"(AOL Autos) -- Have you ever heard of someone having their car ""totaled""? While the word might conjure images of a massive car accident, replete with broken glass and the Jaws of Life, the reality is sometimes far removed. Ford's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck. In fact, there are many accidents that produce structural damage such that the vehicle's frame is bent, even though the exterior of the car might even look drivable. Typically these cars are ""totaled,"" which might give buyers the peace of mind knowing they will get a replacement vehicle. But, overall this produces much higher insurance rates for all drivers. Car companies and insurers are working hard to try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers and some of the development is breathtaking in its innovation . This effort has already led to many new developments in the design of various auto parts and components -- which have indeed led to a reduction in repair costs for various auto parts, components and structures. And more advances are on the way: some carmakers have recently ramped up their operations in this area, which should result in greater cost savings in coming years. One recent development in this area is the Ford Motor Company's new $650,000 Paint and Body Technology Center in Inkster, Michigan, about 20 minutes from the company's Dearborn world headquarters. The new center was created by merging operations with the company's Safety Crash Test Analysis department. Other car companies have their own versions of this kind of operation, including Ford's crosstown rivals, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC. The new Ford center represents an advancement over its previous paint and body tech operation in that it's larger, closer to the company's HQ, and now works more closely with design engineers and auto insurers -- and gets insurers involved earlier in the design process. AOL Autos: Cut your insurance in half . The goal is to identify potential repair issues and then use that info to refine designs -- which in turn helps cut the cost of repairs at dealerships and independent repair shops. Plus, this effort allows repair techs to more effectively restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition. To that end, engineers gather data earlier in the vehicle development process so it can be then analyzed during crash and durability testing. AOL Autos: How to choose a repair shop . For Ford, the closer integration of these functions began when the carmaker's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck. During the vehicle's early development period, these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer, but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision. AOL Autos: Minor damages, major repair costs . ""The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,"" said Gerry Bonanni, Ford's collision repair senior engineer. So, Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash, instead of having to replace the entire frame. ""Partial-frame repairs cost at least $2,000 less than full-frame replacements,"" says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being ""totaled,"" which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states. The success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center. A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang. ""Previously, we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails,"" says Bonanni. ""But, by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies, we developed a procedure, which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers. ""That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails, instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system -- which also translates into lower repair costs, and lower insurance rates, for the owner."" General Motors' Collision Repair Test Center has had also had recent success on this front, says Jim Doherty, GM's manager of the service-engineering team for aftersales body structures. ""We coordinate with the product engineers, so as soon as a new vehicle starts development, about four years before it's introduced, we engage with their team,"" says Doherty. ""Some of our people work on the structure, and some on the exterior, and we collaborate with the design engineers to work out whatever improvements might need to be made over the previous version of a component or assembly."" AOL Autos: Best & worst auto designs . As with Ford, ""the goal is to make sure that the vehicle has the most cost-effective repair strategy,"" adds Dave Bakos, GM's director of global after-sales mechanical engineering. ""Our liaisons with people in the insurance industries are definitely useful -- they call us if they have concerns, and when we develop a new technology, we contact them to make sure they understand it."" The development of lighter-weight steel for auto frames also presents challenges to GM's center. ""They're very high-strength, but their repairability is more difficult when compared with the old cold-rolled steels -- so, that has forced us to come up with new welding, sectioning and attachment strategies as the vehicle is being designed and developed,"" says Doherty. AOL Autos: Take the guesswork out of buying a used car . Doherty and Bakos cite a couple of examples of how the Collision Repair Test Center -- and the collaboration between design and repair engineers and insurance companies -- have been parlayed into cost savings for car owners. Prior to the current model year, the cost of repairing the frame-rail assembly on a Pontiac Solstice included $936 for the part itself, plus 13 ½ hours worth of labor costs to install, says Doherty. But by working with design engineers and insurers, the Collision Repair Test Center was able to develop and create a ""service-only"" partial assembly. That means that, on the '09 Solstice, a collision technician can replace the damaged section of the front rail only, rather than the entire front rail section. The parts for the partial assembly cost far less and require just three and a half hours of labor to install,"" says Doherty. ""Because of these changes, the total cost savings for this repair could be as high as $1,500."" The current Saturn Aura presented a challenge / opportunity along the same lines. For the '09 Aura, GM engineers at the Collision Repair Test Center created ""zone-specific"" replacement parts. ""Rather than replacing the entire body-side assembly as a single piece, engineers developed sectioning procedures for the front, center and rear quarter sections of the vehicle,"" explains Doherty. ""This allows the technician multiple repair options when repairing the side of a damaged vehicle. Even though the cost of parts remained similar, labor cost savings created were substantial, ranging from about $600 to as high as $1,200."" One current focus for these operations at Ford, GM and other carmakers relates to side-impact crashes. ""We don't want every vehicle to have to end up in the salvage yard just because a side pillar is damaged,"" says Bakos. ""So we're working on some combination of welding or welding and adhesives, or maybe mechanical fasteners, in order make those sections more repairable, so that the vehicle isn't totaled."" New challenges continue to present themselves, says Ford's Bonanni. ""New technologies are developing pretty rapidly,"" he says. ""And each time a new one comes along, it's our job to develop new ways of repairing the various structures, components and parts that incorporate those new technologies -- and do it in a way that maintains the vehicle's after-crash structural integrity, and keeps costs down for the vehicle owner.""","Companies and insurers sections cars to be crash (and repair) friendly .

"(CNN) -- North Carolina State University women's basketball coach Kay Yow, who won more than 700 games in nearly four decades of coaching, died Saturday after a long struggle with breast cancer, the university said. North Carolina State University's Kay Yow, in 1996, was one of only six coaches to amass 700 wins. She was 66. Yow, who was in her 38th season as a coach, had amassed numerous awards, including inductions into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. In her 34 years on the sidelines for the Wolfpack, her teams won four Atlantic Coast Conference titles, averaged 20 wins a season, appeared in 20 of 27 NCAA tournaments and reached the Final Four in 1998. She was one of only six coaches in the women's game to win at least 700 games, the university said. She also coached the 1988 women's Olympic basketball team to a gold medal in Seoul, South Korea. Yow was beloved by her players, colleagues and fans, and in 2007, N.C. State christened the court in Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum in her name. Since being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987, Yow had been active in efforts to raise awareness and money to battle the disease, which forced her to miss two games during the 2004-05 season and another 16 in the 2006-07 season, the university said. She helped establish the Kay Yow/WBCA Cancer Fund, which raised money for the cause. About three weeks ago, Yow announced that she was stepping away from coaching duties for the remainder of the 2008-09 season, after missing four straight games because of an extremely low energy level. ""Stepping away from coaching is one of the hardest decisions I have had to make,"" Yow said January 6, according to N.C. State. ""Even though I don't feel well enough to coach, I'm hopeful to feel well enough to attend some ACC games and show my support for the team as well as N.C. State University,"" she added. Yow was born in 1942 in Gibsonville, North Carolina, about 16 miles outside Greensboro. She began coaching at local high schools in 1964 before Elon University hired her. N.C. State hired her in 1975. ""It has been an honor and a privilege to work with Coach Yow for the last 15 seasons. I suddenly find myself grasping to retain everything she has ever said and ever taught me,"" interim head coach Stephanie Glance said, according to the university. The team's game against Wake Forest University, which was scheduled for Monday, has been postponed until February 10 in Winston-Salem, the university said.","Women's basketball coach dies at 66 after struggle with breast cancer .

"(CNN) -- New Yorkers feasted on the stories when the news broke in 2006: Brooke Astor, a socialite and megaphilanthropist with Alzheimer's, had allegedly been swindled of millions and mistreated by her own son. Brooke Astor and grandson Philip Marshall outside her New York country estate, Holly Hill, in 2001 or 2002. Anthony ""Tony"" Marshall, her only child, was indicted on criminal charges including grand larceny, possession of stolen property, forgery and conspiracy. Jury selection for the criminal trial was scheduled to begin Monday. But co-defendant Francis Morrissey's attorney filed an 11th-hour motion to sever his client's trial from Marshall's. The motion was denied late Friday, and a new trial date has been set for March 2. Morrissey, Marshall's former lawyer, faces charges including forgery and scheming to defraud. A lawyer representing Marshall, Fred Hafetz, would say only that there would be ""no plea"" and that he hopes his client will ""be vindicated.""  Watch author Meryl Gordon discuss the case » . The trial is likely to resuscitate the tabloid feeding frenzy, which has fostered headlines such as ""Bad heir day,"" ""Mrs. Astor's disaster"" and ""DA's kick in the Astor."" It's not the way those closest to Astor want to remember her. And the disclosures expected to spill forth from the witness stand aren't the type that Astor, who died in August 2007 at 105, would want shared in public. ""She would have been mortified,"" said Vartan Gregorian, a longtime friend and president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York. ""She was very private."" Through her late husband's Vincent Astor Foundation, Astor was credited with giving New York, where the Astors made their fortune, about $200 million. And although she felt it was expected of her to be proper and elegant, Gregorian said, her wealth didn't define her. Talk of money, real estate and other people's misfortunes were off-limits at her dinner parties, he said. ""She was not ostentatious. ... She was very funny, very witty and very caring."" When a would-be robber accosted her, she foiled the holdup attempt with this response: "" 'Excuse me. My name is Mrs. Astor. I don't think we've been properly introduced,' "" Gregorian remembered with a laugh. For 23 years, Linda Gillies directed the Astor Foundation and witnessed her hands-on approach to doing good -- not just for her ""crown jewels,"" which included the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the New York Public Library, but also for lower-profile programs. Astor was often quoted as saying, ""Money is like manure; it's not worth a thing unless it's spread around."" But for her, again, it wasn't just about the money. Betty Cooper Wallerstein, a community organizer who benefited from Astor's help in saving 2,500 low-income apartments on Manhattan's Upper East Side, described Astor as being equally comfortable mingling with tenants as she was in high society. She remembered attending Astor's 90th birthday party and being struck by the diversity of the crowd waiting to get inside. Around her were elected officials, the social elite, big names such as Henry Kissinger as well as Astor's staff members and activists such as herself. ""She was as lovely to me as she was to the dignitaries who were there,"" Wallerstein said. ""It was such a beautiful and democratic line."" Many close friends and staff members would not speak to CNN, as they will be testifying in the trial or will be involved in a later suit to contest Astor's will, which her son is said to have changed. But those who did speak were quick to share memories they'll always hold dear. The tears came quickly when Carmine Fasciani, 73, remembered Astor. The one-time police detective sergeant, whom Astor always called Sergeant, said he handled security and later served as the full-time head of staff at Holly Hill, Astor's New York country estate. He was employed by her for three decades, up until he had a stroke eight years ago. But his status as employee hardly described their relationship. ""She was my friend. She was a good lady,"" he said, his voice cracking and his words slightly slurred because of the stroke. ""She said, 'I love you' ... and I loved her."" He built the gazebo where Astor watched sunsets and brought her the pink roses she loved. She took him to see a house that she knew he'd fall for and helped secure a good price. When Astor lost part of a finger breaking up a dog fight, she called on Fasciani to fly in to be by her side. And two years after his stroke, he sought Astor's approval, which she gave with a wink and a nod, before marrying his wife, Marilyn, who helped speak for Fasciani by phone from Florida. But working for Astor had its distractions, said Alicia Johnson, who was head of staff at her Maine estate, Cove End, for about 12 years. ""We had the Irish maid fighting with the French maid, the English butler fighting with the cook from Jamaica,"" Johnson said, laughing at the memories. ""Mrs. Astor was a peach. The problem was everyone else."" In Johnson's Maine closet, there are still items Astor insisted she take, including a dress Astor ""hauled out"" for her to wear when she announced that she was getting married in 2000. ""It was a size two, and I was a size 12,"" she said. Employees stayed with Astor for years, until her son reportedly fired most all of them. But the loyalty of Steve Hamor and his two sons stands out. Hamor, 65, was her groundskeeper in Maine for 42 years. Hamor's son Scott, who with his brother also would grow up to work on the grounds, spent his childhood running around the estate as if it was his own playground. As a teen, he remembered ""Mrs. A"" beckoning him from mowing a lawn to say hello and introduce him to Barbara Walters. Astor wanted to send him and his brother to university. They refused. But when Scott found himself in his mid-20s, going through a divorce and with custody of two boys, he accepted her assistance -- and insistence -- in helping him settle into a new apartment. ""She was always wanting to know how you were doing and what she could do for you,"" said Scott, 42, who now works on Maine property owned by David Rockefeller. Concern that not enough was being done for her is what drove Philip Marshall, defendant Tony Marshall's son, to file a petition for guardianship for his grandmother in 2006, alleging, in the words of his lawyer, ""elder abuse"" by his father. The intention was nothing more than to ensure that she was cared for, removing control by his father and transferring care to Astor's dear friend Annette de la Renta. Though he wouldn't discuss the details that prompted his actions -- ""I won't survive this conversation if I do,"" he said -- the successful petition mentioned her sleeping in torn nightgowns on a urine-stained couch and eating bland leftovers. ""To the rest of the world, she was Brooke Astor. To us, she was our grandmother,"" said Marshall, 55, who grew up in Vermont with his twin brother, Alec, and was not ""of the New York world."" The practicing Tibetan Buddhist, who is a professor of historic preservation at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, never anticipated the findings that led to his father's indictment and said he merely wanted to ""provide my grandmother with the care, comfort and dignity she deserved.""","Criminal trial of late socialite Brooke Astor's son begins soon .

"LONDON (CNN) -- Iran offered to stop attacking coalition troops in Iraq nearly four years ago in an attempt to get the West to accept Tehran's nuclear program, a British diplomat told the BBC in an interview aired Saturday. John Sawers, British ambassador to the U.N., told BBC of Iran approaching Western nations with offer. ""The Iranians wanted to be able to strike a deal whereby they stopped killing our forces in Iraq in return for them being allowed to carry on with their nuclear program -- 'We stop killing you in Iraq, stop undermining the political process there, you allow us to carry on with our nuclear program without let or hindrance,"" said John Sawers, now the British ambassador to the United Nations, in the documentary, ""Iran and the West: Nuclear Confrontation."" The United States and other Western nations believe Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program, but Iran says it is developing nuclear capability to produce energy. Iran also has been accused of sponsoring terrorists and supplying weapons to Iraqi insurgents. The latter prompted a warning from the United States that such behavior by Tehran ""would be regarded by us as enemy action,"" Philip Zelikow, a State Department counselor, told the BBC. Then, Iran began shopping its offer around Europe, Sawers said. Sawers, Britain's political director at the time, reveals the behind-the-scene talks from 2005 -- when roadside bombing against British and American soldiers in Iraq peaked -- were held with British, French and German diplomats at hotels in London, Paris and Berlin. ""And then we'd compare notes among the three of us,"" Sawers told the BBC. The British government dismissed the offer and Iran's nuclear enrichment program restarted once again, the BBC reports . Iran has denied offering any such deal and reiterated its position Saturday. ""Iran's high officials have repeatedly stated that Iran has not had any part in attacks against American and British forces, and there is no evidence to support these baseless accusations,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said, according to the semi-official Mehr News Agency. Interviews with top brass from former President Bush's administration and British envoys indicate that Iran and the West had neared agreements several times in the past few years, but never reached success. Nick Burns, who was in charge of the Bush administration's State Department policy with Iran, said taking a tough approach with Iran didn't seem effective. ""We had advocated regime change,"" Burns told the BBC. ""We had a very threatening posture towards Iran for a number of years. It didn't produce any movement whatsoever."" The documentary aired a day after the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security released a report stating that Iranian scientists have reached ""nuclear weapons breakout capability."" The report analyzed the finding of the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). However, an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data, saying Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium (HEU) in order to be weapons-grade material. That hasn't been done, the official said. Meanwhile, Iran's relationship with the West continues to be strained, though both sides have indicated interest in holding direct talks. President Obama, in his first prime-time news conference held earlier this month, said the United States is looking for opportunities for ""face-to-face"" talks with Iran after an absence of diplomatic ties for nearly three decades. ""There's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years, so it's not going to happen overnight,"" he said. And Iran's powerful parliament speaker and former nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, has called the Obama administration ""an exceptional opportunity for Americans.""","Iran approached diplomats with offer nearly four years ago, BBC told .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani security forces say they have killed at least 16 militants overnight in the country's volatile tribal region. Pakistani security personnel patrol the Buner district. This appears to be separate from the hostilities in the military's week-long crackdown in northwestern Pakistan against a Taliban militant advance in the country's North West Frontier Province. However, this reflects the tensions in the region and could signal a spread of fighting resulting from the crackdown. The Pakistani offensive started in the province on Sunday and it came after Taliban militants moved into Buner district last week, a move that alarmed U.S. and Pakistani officials. In this latest incident, about 100 militants attacked a Frontier Corps checkpost in the Mohmand Agency, an area where militants hold great sway. Troops returned fire and killed the 16 militants, the military said. Mohmand is in the country's Federally Administered Tribal Areas that borders a volatile region in war-torn Afghanistan and Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. The military on Saturday released details about other incidents in the province that occurred over the last 24 hours. Troops conducted a successful operation against militants in the district, in the Ambela-Daggar area in the Buner district. They secured a key road and cleared roadside bombs, the military said. In the province's Upper Dir district, militants abducted and then released 10 troops and seized their weaponry and ammunition. And two civilians were wounded when militants lobbed hand grenades. In the province's Swat district, militants attacked a security forces checkpost on Khawazakhela Bridge and Sambat Ridge. In Langer, security forces and militants exchanged fire and forces found military uniforms that militants were using for terrorist activity. Three Afghan nationals were among five militants arrested while planting a roadside bomb. Earlier this year, Pakistan entered into an agreement with militants, allowing them to enforce Islamic, or sharia, in parts of Swat Valley in exchange for ceasing violence. The Swat Valley is a broader area that includes several provincial districts, including Chitral, Swat, Shangla, Malakand, Upper Dir, and Lower Dir. But Pakistani officials say the armed militants' advance into Buner district violated the agreement and briefly halted peace talks between both sides in North West Frontier Province. Representatives from Pakistan's government and the Taliban restarted their negotiations on Friday and were planning to have another session soon, a provincial spokesman said. The Pakistani government has been criticized for not cracking down on militants along its border with Afghanistan. As a result, the U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, which have rankled relations between the two countries.","Pakistani security forces kill at least 16 militants in country's tribal region .

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona produced a dazzling display of attacking football to rout arch-rivals Real Madrid 6-2 in the Bernabeu and all but secure the Primera Liga title. Messi celebrates his second and Barcelona's fifth in the 6-2 rout at the Bernabeu. Two goals apiece from Lionel Messi and Thierry Henry, with defenders Carles Puyol and Gerard Pique also on target, signaled a humiliating defeat for Real who went into 'El Clasico' with renewed hope of retaining the Spanish title. But a mixture of inspired play and comical defending undermined Juande Ramos'  men who had taken the lead as Gonzalo Higuain headed home after 14 minutes. Henry quickly equalized with a clinical finish after Messi's through ball beat the offside trap before an unmarked Puyol headed Barcelona ahead in the 20th minute from a Xavi free-kick. Messi then waltzed through the Real defense after Xavi had cleverly won the ball to put his side 3-1 ahead before the half-time. Sergio Ramos gave Madrid hope in the 56th minute as he headed home an Arjen Robben free-kick, but any hopes of a comeback were quickly dashed. Henry raced onto a through ball from the brilliant Xavi for the fourth before Messi made it five with an impudent finish to fox Iker Casillas in the Real goal for his 23rd goal in the league this season. The final humiliation saw Samuel Eto'o charge down the right to cross for Pique who twisted cleverly to beat Casillas for the sixth and his first-ever La Liga goal. It was Barcelona's 100th league goal of the season which has brought them 27 wins from 34 matches. Real fans headed rapidly for the exits as they tried to come to terms with the most goals ever scored by Barcelona in the Santiago Bernabeu stadium. Their side trail by seven points with only four games remaining with a super-confident Barcelona now heading to the second leg of their Champions League semifinal against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. The first leg was goalless. Meanwhile, Sevilla took a giant stride towards the Champions League with a 2-0 win at rivals Villarreal in Saturday's late match. Luis Fabiano and Freddy Kanoute were on target as third-placed Sevilla moved four points clear of Valencia and five of Villarreal. In other matches, Numancia gave themselves a chance of staying up with a 2-0 win over Malaga to move off bottom spot, three points from safety.","Lionel Messi and Thierry Henry score two goals each in 6-2 Bernabeu victory .

"(CNN) -- A head-banging parrot who became a YouTube sensation has demonstrated that an ability to appreciate music and keep a rhythm is not unique to humans, scientists say. Alex, an African grey parrot, was one of 14 birds which displayed an ability to keep time with a tune. Snowball the cockatoo, who appears to bop his head, tap his claws and squawk enthusiastically to the Back Street Boys' ""Everybody"" is one of several birds apparently capable of dancing to a beat, according to two studies published in the latest edition of the journal Current Biology. In a study lead by Adena Schachner of Harvard University, researchers examined more than 1,000 YouTube videos of dancing animals and found 14 types of parrot species and one elephant genuinely capable of keeping time. The video of Snowball has been viewed more than two million times since it was posted in 2007. Another video of Snowball shows him dancing to Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust."" Watch Snowball the dancing parrot » . Schachner analyzed the videos frame-by-frame, comparing the animals' movements with the speed of the music and the alignment of individual beats. The group also studied another bird, Alex, an African grey parrot, which had exhibited similar abilities to Snowball, nodding its head appreciatively to a series of drum tracks. ""Our analyses showed that these birds' movements were more lined up with the musical beat than we'd expect by chance,"" says Schachner. ""We found strong evidence that they were synchronizing with the beat, something that has not been seen before in other species."" Aniruddh Patel of The Neurosciences Institute in San Diego, who led another study of Snowball's performance, said that the bird had demonstrated an ability to adjust the tempo of his dancing to stay synchronized to the beat. Scientists had previously thought that ""moving to a musical beat might be a uniquely human ability because animals are not commonly seen moving rhythmically in the wild,"" Patel said. Schachner said there was no evidence to suggest that animals such as apes, dogs or cats could recognize music, despite their extensive experience of humans. That leads researchers to believe that an ability to process musical sounds may be linked to an ability to mimic sounds -- something that each of the parrots studied by researchers was able to do excellently, she said. Other ""vocal-learning species"" include dolphins, elephants, seals and walruses. ""A natural question about these results is whether they generalize to other parrots, or more broadly, to other vocal-learning species,"" Schachner said. Researchers believe a possible link between vocal mimicry and an ability to hear music may explain the development of music in human societies. ""The question of why music is found in every known human culture is a longstanding puzzle. Many argue that it is an adaptive behaviour that helped our species to evolve. But equally plausible is the possibility that it emerged as a by-product of other abilities -- such as vocal learning,"" music psychologist Lauren Stewart of Goldsmiths, University of London told CNN. ""Parrots and humans both have the ability to imitate sounds that they hear, unlike our closer simian relatives. Once a species has the neural machinery in place for coupling the perception and production of vocal sounds, it may be only a small step to use the same circuits for synchronizing movements to a beat.""","Scientists: Dancing parrots prove ability to recognize music not unique to humans .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani armed forces have killed 80 militants since launching an assault on a region recently held by the Taliban, the military announced Sunday. Displaced people from Buner district flee the fighting. Three soldiers have been killed and eight wounded in the crackdown in the Buner district in the northwest of the country, the military statement said. The Pakistani offensive started in the province last Sunday, after Taliban militants moved into Buner, a move that alarmed U.S. and Pakistani officials.

"(CNN) -- When the highly anticipated movie ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" opened Friday in theaters, many fans had already seen it. The pirating and distribution of ""Wolverine,"" starring Hugh Jackman, is being investigated by the FBI. The online leak of a pirated, unfinished version of the 20th Century Fox film a month ago sent federal authorities springing into action and stoked a heated conversation within the entertainment industry about digital piracy. Piracy of upcoming films is not new, but the theft of ""Wolverine"" is especially troubling for an industry concerned with a stalled economy and the financial bottom line. It's rare for high-quality copies of a big-budget blockbuster to appear on the Internet more than a month before the film's release, experts say. Within a week of ""Wolverine's"" March 31 leak, more than a million people had downloaded the movie, according to TorrentFreak, a blog devoted to the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol.  Watch intrepid reporter look for answers » . ""Unfortunately, the recent leak of the Fox film 'Wolverine' provided a stark backdrop to the impact that digital piracy has on the large investments that producers make in creating state-of-the-art films,"" said Rep. Howard Berman, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, who oversaw a congressional hearing on piracy after the leak. ""During our hearing in Los Angeles, director Steven Soderbergh said that in 2007, the entertainment industry generated a trade surplus of $13.6 billion,"" Berman added. ""Imagine what those numbers would be if we could rein in piracy."" Bootleg, or illegally copied, movies have long been a thorn to the film industry. In 2003, a version of Universal's ""The Hulk"" appeared on the Internet two weeks before the film opened. A New Jersey man pleaded guilty to the theft. And in 2005, a pirated print of ""Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith"" was uploaded to the Web within hours of the movie's release. But where Hollywood's biggest headache used to be murky, muffled copies of films taken by someone who snuck a camcorder into a theater, today's pirates are getting more sophisticated and gaining access to better-quality goods. Greg Sandoval, who covers media and digital entertainment for CNET News, said that in the digital age, thieves can gain access to near-perfect advance copies of films on DVD that have greater potential to undermine a movie's box-office prospects. And even studios' attempts at safeguarding their products against piracy, such as by encoding DVDs with digital watermarks that allow authorities to trace individual copies, aren't enough, Sandoval said. He said tech-savvy thieves have figured out how to strip such watermarks from DVDs. ""When you're talking about digital content ... it's impossible to lock it down completely"" from theft, Sandoval said. ""These hackers are very creative. Sometimes, they're one step ahead of the security experts."" 20th Century Fox issued a statement vowing to prosecute the ""Wolverine"" thief ""to the fullest extent of the law."" The FBI is investigating, but as of Thursday, no arrests had been made. Darcy Antonellis, president of technical operations for Warner Bros. (which is owned by the parent company of CNN), said the growth of technology has aided the pirates. ""Digital piracy has continued to increase with greater access to [files] and improved broadband services,"" said Antonellis, who helps oversee Warner Bros.' anti-piracy efforts. ""As broadband services increase their capacity to support legitimate services, they also enable increased illegal file-sharing. Technologies have evolved to encumber such distribution but must compete with the strength of viral or super distribution of content."" The bad guys aren't the only ones keeping up with the technology. Keith Bolcar, special agent in charge of the FBI's cyber division in Los Angeles, said agents and their partners as ""doing everything we can to keep up with the learning curve of technology, hopefully just as fast as our criminal subjects."" The FBI meets routinely with studio representatives to share intelligence, to discuss strategy and to detect and fix vulnerabilities in security measures, he said. ""While I can't discuss investigative techniques, we employ a myriad of sophisticated methods to solve these crimes,"" said Bolcar, whose office is investigating the ""Wolverine"" leak. ""Our investigators receive extensive training and are technologically savvy."" Hollywood also faces the challenge of protecting digital files that pass through so many hands while in production and post-production. Antonellis said Warner Bros. works diligently to safeguard its properties. ""Each project, for us, is unique, with its own unique set of challenges,"" she said. ""Whether there are 50 or 500 people involved in the process, we try to focus on ownership/responsibility of our assets throughout the entire production through to distribution process."" John Malcolm, director of worldwide anti-piracy operations for the Motion Picture Association of America, said digital piracy can take many forms, including peer-to-peer file sharing and streaming. Malcolm said the association is conducting a lot of outreach to universities and Internet service providers to help them address piracy that occurs over their systems. The issue is global, Malcolm said, as evidenced by pending litigation in France that would shut down Internet accounts of illegal downloaders. The association is in litigation against an Australian service provider, iiNet, to try to establish the legal parameters of its responsibility in policing its system, Malcolm said. ""In some cases, we are making great progress with ISP, and in some cases, it's a little bit tougher going,"" Malcolm said. ""After all, it's their broadband that's being eaten up, and it slows down their systems."" Berman, D-California, said advances in technologies that enable filtering and other anti-theft tools will help curb piracy. So will creating more sites where viewers can legitimately access movies, shows and music, such as Hulu and the recently announced Vevo, a partnership between Universal Music and YouTube. ""Given how pirated materials often damage computers with viruses, spyware and other problems, consumers will continue to embrace the innovative, legitimate sites that are becoming more and more available,"" Berman said. Malcolm agrees. He said there are more than 350 sites that legitimately distribute digital content. If a person is a true movie lover, they will want to respect the art, the artists and the countless people behind the scenes who make the magic happen, Malcolm said. ""I hear periodically, 'Well, Tom Cruise has enough money' or 'Tom Hanks has enough money,' "" Malcolm said. ""I would say to movie lovers, stick around and watch all of the credits. When you see hundreds of names scrolling across the screen, those are the people whose talents contributed to making that movie, and they need to make a living.""

"(CNN) -- A snowstorm that could last up to 18 hours was on its way to southern New England, and Boston, Massachusetts, could be snowed under with up to 15 inches, the National Weather Service said Sunday afternoon. A snowstorm is threatening parts of the Northeast with as much as 15 inches of snowfall. Monday's commuters in the region could face a nightmare with blowing and drifting snow, freezing temperatures, gusty winds and periods of sleet. Flight delays and cancellations were likely, the weather service said. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino declared a snow emergency starting 10 p.m. Sunday in anticipation of the storm, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Boston public schools will be canceled on Monday. At 2:15 a.m. Monday, light snow was starting to fall, WCVB reported. Winter storm warnings straddled Interstate 95 from Maine to the Carolinas, and they also were issued in parts of Georgia and Alabama. Delta Air Lines canceled 300 flights, most of them to or from Atlanta, because of snowy weather, spokesman Brian Kruse said Sunday. It was snowing in Atlanta, where Delta is based, and 2 to 4 inches was expected. David Spear, a spokesman for the Georgia Department of Transportation, expected traffic chaos. ""People tend to get a little animated out here at the sight of snow,"" he told CNN. ""Our concern is going to be -- as we move into the evening hours and the temperature drops -- that that slush becomes ice and then we have a real situation for our morning commute tomorrow."" He said about 200 DOT trucks were deployed to help make roads safe for motorists. In northern Connecticut, southern New Hampshire and most of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, a winter storm warning was to be in effect from 9 p.m. Sunday to 5 p.m. Monday, the weather service said. Such a warning is issued when winter weather conditions are expected to make travel dangerous. As the storm continued its northward trek late Sunday, Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina was closed at 9 p.m. for snow removal from runways, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Farther north, Richmond International Airport in Virginia was closed at 10:45 p.m. for the same reason, the FAA said. Both airports were expected to reopen before midnight. The heaviest snow, up to 15 inches, was forecast for the heavily populated I-95 corridor between Boston, Massachusetts, and Providence, Rhode Island, northeast Connecticut and north into the Merrimack Valley in northeast Massachusetts, the weather service said. As much as 3 inches per hour could fall between 10 p.m. Sunday and 10 a.m. Monday. In Washington, Mayor Adrian Fenty declared a snow emergency Sunday afternoon, meaning any street designated as ""snow emergency route"" by signs would be cleared of any parked vehicles, towed if necessary, so snow plows could work unimpeded.  Watch report on the storm system » . ""It is important that our crews have access to the roads from curb-to-curb in order to plow the snow,"" said Fenty, whose city was expected to get up to 8 inches of accumulation Sunday night and early Monday with accumulations up to 10 inches by Monday night. ""This is one of the first plow events we have had this season, and we want to ensure we are able to maintain clear and safe roadways as we move into Monday morning,"" Fenty said. Forecasters said as many as 14 inches of snow could pile up in Philadelphia and New York City, starting Sunday night. Lesser amounts of snow were reported as far south as Alabama, although Charlotte, North Carolina, could see up to 8 inches.  Watch snowfall in Georgia » .

"(CNN)  -- More than a week after the swine flu outbreak rattled the world, with cases of infected people popping up from Mexico to South Korea, the new virus strain has shown up in a herd of swine. Masked workers push food to a sealed-off hotel in Beijing where Mexican nationals are being quarantined. The catch, Canadian officials say, is that the animals may have caught the flu from a human. Canadian officials are quarantining pigs that tested positive for the virus -- scientifically known as 2009 H1N1 -- at an Alberta farm in what could be the first identified case of pigs infected during the recent outbreak. They said the pigs may have been infected by a Canadian farmer who recently returned from a trip to Mexico, the epicenter of the outbreak that has sickened more than 680 people. The farmer ""may have exposed swine on the farm to an influenza virus,"" said Dr. Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. ""We have determined that the virus H1N1, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population,"" he added.  Learn about the virus » . Evans and other officials said it is not uncommon for flu viruses to jump from humans to animals and that it does not pose a risk for consuming pork. The number of pigs infected was not disclosed. The infected farmer had flu-like symptoms and is recovering, Evans said. Meanwhile, as the number of confirmed swine flu cases reached 787 worldwide, the World Health Organization said Sunday it had started distributing 2.4 million doses of a common anti-viral drug to 72 nations. So far, 17 countries have confirmed cases of swine flu, the WHO said.  Watch latest developments as swine flu sweeps world » . Dr. Michael J. Ryan, the WHO director of its global alert and response team, said the doses of the drug Tamiflu came from a stockpile that was donated by Swiss health-care giant Roche in 2005 and 2006. Roche said it was working with the WHO to prepare for the virus. The drug should be taken within 48 hours of experiencing symptoms, according to the drug's Web site. Mexico has the most confirmed swine flu cases, with 506 infected people and 16 deaths, the WHO said. Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova Villalobos reported that the country has confirmed 421 cases and 19 deaths. Several other countries, including Canada and Italy, had confirmed additional cases that had not yet been added to the WHO's total. The United States has the second-highest number of confirmed cases, with 160 sickened and one death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO. President Barack Obama spoke with Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday afternoon to discuss both countries' ""efforts to limit the spread of the 2009 H1N1 flu strain and the importance of close U.S.-Mexican cooperation,"" the White House said in a statement. Other than Mexico and the United States, the WHO confirmed cases in 14 other countries: Canada, with 70; the United Kingdom with 15; Spain with 13; Germany with six; New Zealand with four; Israel with three; France, with two; and Austria, China, South Korea, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Costa Rica, each have one.  See where cases have been confirmed » . Ryan said the WHO was still preparing for a pandemic. ""At this point we have to expect that phase six will be reached,"" he said, referring to the organization's highest pandemic threat level. ""We have to hope that it is not reached."" And he noted that a pandemic describes ""the geographic spread of the disease, not its severity."" The latest developments come as parts of Asia discovered they were not immune to the spread of the virus. Hundreds of guests and staff were under quarantine in China after health officials determined that a hotel guest had contracted the H1N1 virus. Nearly 200 hotel guests and 100 staff members were ordered to stay in Metro Park Hotel in Hong Kong for seven days to stop the spread of the H1N1 virus, a government spokesman said. The quarantine was ordered after a 25-year-old Mexican man stayed in the hotel and became sick, according to the spokesman. It is the first confirmed case of the virus in Hong Kong, local medical officials said. South Korean officials on Saturday confirmed their first case -- a 51-year-old nun who recently traveled to Mexico for volunteer work.","Pigs in Canada may be first in recent outbreak to test positive for virus .

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's government ordered the country's army chief of staff fired Sunday, touching off street protests and a split in Nepal's Maoist-dominated ruling coalition. General Rookmangud Katawal gestures after inspecting the guard of honour in New Delhi on December 12, 2007. But Gen. Rookmangud Katawal has refused to accept his dismissal, and Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav -- the constitutional commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces -- has told Katawal to remain in office, a presidential spokesman said. Nepal's Cabinet voted to dismiss Katawal after the military refused the government's order to stop recruiting about 3,000 new soldiers to fill vacant positions when it has yet to take in former Maoist rebels, as a 2006 peace deal required. The move prompted the Maoists' largest coalition partner to quit the government, the party's leader said. ""Without consensus, the ongoing peace process will not reach its logical conclusion and the drafting of the new constitution will not be possible,"" said Ishwor Pokharel, general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). ""The consensus that existed so far has come to standstill."" Supporters of both sides in the dispute took to the streets for demonstrations Sunday. Despite sporadic clashes between the two factions, there were no serious injuries reported. The Maoists laid down their arms and won power in 2008 elections after an agreement that ended a decade-long insurgency. Under the deal, more than 19,000 former insurgents were to be integrated into the country's security forces. But two weeks ago, the government asked Katawal to explain why he went to the Supreme Court to challenge the government's refusal to extend the tenure of eight brigadier generals in March. Government spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara said Sunday that the government was not satisfied with Katawal's explanation and fired him -- three months before his scheduled retirement -- in a meeting that the Maoists' coalition partners boycotted. Pokharel said his party urged the Maoists not to fire Katawal without a consensus in the country's parliament. He said the Maoists, led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, ignored that advice. ""We do not like the way the Maoists' way of functioning,"" Pokharel said. The Maoists hold 238 of the 601 seats in parliament, while Pokharel's party has 109. The Maoists could continue to hold power with the support of smaller parties, but Pokharel said his party is working to form a new ruling coalition. The Cabinet named an interim army chief, but presidential spokesman Rajendra Dahal told CNN that 18 parties in Nepal's parliament asked Yadav to keep Katawal on the job. There was no immediate reaction from the government on the president's decision.","Nepal's government orders army chief of staff fired after recruitment issue .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In Hong Kong, where the alert level has been raised to ""emergency"" after reporting its first case of swine flu, authorities are trying to keep the H1N1 virus from spreading through the metropolis of 7 million people through quarantine, stepped-up border measures and surveillance. Quarantined guests and hotel employees wave through the glass of the main entrance of Hong Kong's Metro Park Hotel. The quarantine has extended beyond the single confirmed case, a 25-year-old Mexican man, to include more than 340 people. They include: two taxi drivers, two fellow taxi passengers, a local friend, 36 passengers within a three-row vicinity of the patient aboard a China Eastern flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and 300 guests and staff at the Metropark Hotel he checked into. All have been put on the antiviral drug, Tamiflu. Among the two cab drivers, one was suspected of taking the patient from the airport to the hotel, and another was believed to have taken him from the hotel to the hospital. Authorities are seeing another 40 to 50 guests whose names are on the hotel's guest list. Some of them left their luggage behind. ""They are gambling with their health, jeopardizing public health safety,"" said Dr. York Chow, secretary for Food and Health, appealing to the guests to come forward. In addition to the Metropark Hotel in Wanchai district, the Lady Maclehose Holiday Village is being used as an isolation center during the one-week quarantines. The government has assured that people under quarantine will have their visas automatically extended, their hotel lodging fees waived and their onward journeys prepared. The Wanchai hotel is providing guests $200 worth of free overseas telephone calls daily. The isolation order, which went into effect Friday night, is to expire Friday at 8:30 p.m. (8:30 a.m. ET) -- the length of an incubation period for swine flu. The isolation order did not extend to the air crew or remaining passengers aboard the China Eastern flight. An airplane's air exchange rate is high compared to that in an office or hotel, explained Yuen Kwok-yung, chair of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong. ""Risk is very low on a plane,"" he said. So far, there have been no further confirmed cases of swine flu, and no Hong Kong pigs have tested positive for the virus, Yuen said.","More than 340 people quarantined in Hong Kong following single case of H1N1 .

"(CNN) -- In 2004, a bullet ripped away Connie Culp's nose, cheeks and upper jaw. Metal fragments sprayed into her skull and stripped her face away, leaving nothing except for her eyes, her chin and forehead. Culp, an Ohio mother of two, lost the mid-portion of her face after a gunshot wound in September 2004. Without her nose, she could not smell. She breathed through a tracheostomy  -- a surgical opening in her neck. Without lips, she could barely speak. But Tuesday, when Culp, 46, the first recipient of a face transplant in the United States, stepped in front of the cameras at a news conference, she was whole. In a soft voice, the Ohio mother of two repeatedly thanked the medical staff and the deceased donor whose nose, upper lip, cheekbones are now hers. ""I want to focus on the donor family that allowed me to have this Christmas present,"" she told reporters gathered at the Cleveland Clinic, where her surgery took place.  Watch Culp talk about the surgery » . In December, Culp underwent a 22-hour transplant surgery. Although the hospital announced the facial transplant at that time, the patient had remained anonymous until the news conference. During the surgery, tissue from a deceased donor's face was shaped and fitted into position. Multiple layers of tissue, bone, muscle and blood vessels, nerve grafts and each artery and vein were connected. Culp received a nose, lower eyelids and upper lips, as doctors filled in the missing components of her face. Culp could not yet move her facial muscles to form a smile, but she laughed. ""Well, I got me my nose."" she quipped. Two months after the surgery, Culp was discharged from the hospital and returned home. Before the surgery, Culp could not eat solid foods. She could not taste. ""Connie can now enjoy her food,"" said Dr. Maria Siemionow, who led the transplant operation. ""She eats hamburgers and enjoys her pizzas, she's drinking coffee from the cup."" Her new face allows her to ""blend with society."" ""As you can see we have now a healthy person and happy person,"" Siemionow said. ""She has reduced dramatically her pain and also she's able to walk on the street without being called names."" Since the operation, doctors say Culp's new face has developed more movement. The new facial nerves are growing slowly, about an inch a month.  See before and after photos of Connie Culp » . ""While Connie can do several things now that she was unable to do in the past, as time goes on more and more of the facial nerves will grow,"" said Dr. Frank Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. ""She will become more animated."" For years, Culp lived ""in tremendous pain, chronic pain, over the entire time,"" said  Siemionow, director of plastic face transplant surgery research and head of microsurgery training at the hospital. Culp told a local television station in a 2008 interview that she had been shot in the face from just eight feet away in an attempted murder-suicide by her husband. In 2005, Culp came to the Cleveland Clinic for treatment. After 30 surgical procedures, none had restored her basic functions. ""The last resort and the last option was to consider face transplantation,"" said Siemionow. Transplant recipients have to take immunosuppressing, anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their life. After the hospital's surgeons, ethical committee members, psychiatry and psychology specialists met with Culp, they decided ""that Connie is the right patient,"" Siemionow said. Doctors involved in Culp's treatment said the surgery was not about aesthetics, but to restore Culp's basic abilities. ""We are actually overwhelmed by how great she's doing functionally,"" Siemionow said.  ""And I'm re-emphasizing that this is all about functional outcome. Someone who couldn't breathe through the nose, who couldn't eat solid foods, didn't have a palate or not able to drink from a cup. ... So if she can do all these functions that are taken for granted on a daily basis, this is amazing."" Although there is a risk Culp's body could still reject the transplant, the doctors said they have not seen such signs. Some critics say face transplants are unnecessary, because they are risky procedures involving a lifetime of immunosuppressants, that do not save a person's life, but improve an individual's appearance.  Previous face transplants performed in Europe and Asia generated controversy. A Chinese man whose face was disfigured in a bear attack died of unknown causes two years after receiving the face transplant. The fact that Culp regained some of her basic functions highlights that ""this is not cosmetic surgery in any sense of the word,"" said Dr. Eric Kodish, the professor and chairman of the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Bioethics. ""We remain convinced about the ethical justification for the face transplant in this and potentially in other cases in the future."" Ultimately, the face transplant affords an individual's ""right to decide what kind of life they want to live.""  Many with facial disfigurements are called names, can't go out in public or wear masks to hide their face, said Siemionow. In Culp's case, it was a matter of restoring basic physical abilities. ""If you can breathe through your nose in the spring in Cleveland, isn't that amazing?"" said Siemionow. Culp will require a few more cosmetic procedures, for example to remove excess skin from her face. Culp read a statement and did not take questions. She told reporters in the news conference that she had been shot and said, ""I don't want to go into it."" Then she asked the public to have empathy for people with facial disfigurements. ""When somebody don't look as pretty as you do, don't judge them,"" she said.  ""You don't know what might happen to you. Don't judge the people who don't look the same way as you do. You never know when it may be taken away from you.""","An Ohio woman who suffered gunshot wound is first U.S. face transplant recipient .

"(CNN) -- Fiat Group, fresh from an agreement to buy a piece of troubled automaker Chrysler, has plans to purchase GM Europe and spin off the recombined carmakers into a new company. Fiat's update of the Cinquecento. The company says its small car expertise can help GM Europe get back on track. If successful, the new company would become one of the largest car manufacturers in the world behind Toyota. The combined company would generate about $100 billion annually with sales of between 6 and 7 million cars a year. ""Clearly they're trying to take advantage of the opportunity when a lot of stakeholders may be willing to accommodate them,"" said John Bonnell, an auto industry analyst with JD Power and Associates. ""It may be their only opportunity to get to the kind of scale necessary to succeed in this market."" In an interview with the Financial Times, Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of Fiat, detailed a plan to separate Fiat Auto core car divisions and join with Opel/Vauxhall, Saab and GM's other European operations. Last week, Fiat agreed to take an initial 20 percent of Chrysler as the U.S. manufacturer filed for bankruptcy protection. ""It's an incredibly simple solution to a very thorny problem,"" Marchionne told the Financial Times. Marchionne hopes to have the deal finished by the end of this month, and list shares for the new company -- which may be called Fiat/Opel -- by the end of August. Fiat has only recently gotten itself back on track. In his five years at the helm of Fiat, Marchionne has helped turn around the troubled Italian automaker. Analysts say its small-car technology can help Chrysler, known for its minivans. In the past five years, Fiat has been able to regain market share in Europe with its economy fuel-saving cars as well as its luxury line, Alfa Romeo. Marchionne is scheduled to meet with German government officials Monday to discuss the plan. Opel is GM Europe's German unit. To secure the deal, Fiat is hoping to secure loans from the German government, raising concerns in Germany about helping to fund the Chrysler deal. The company plans to keep its plants operating in Germany, but will reduce workforce, which is likely to raise political concerns.","Fiat hopes to purchase GM Europe .

"Editor's note: Dr. John Boyce, chief of the Infectious Diseases Section at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in New Haven, Connecticut, was lead author of the Centers for Disease Control's national hand hygiene guidelines for health-care workers and heads the Hand Hygiene Resource Center. Dr. John Boyce says hands contaminated with virus are often  a pathway for people to develop flu. (CNN) -- The rapid spread of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (also known as swine flu) from Mexico to at least 19 other countries in less than 10 days is a cause of major concern. It emphasizes the need for the public to become familiar with how influenza is spread and which preventive measures they can use to reduce their chances of becoming infected. Although little information is available at this time, it appears that this influenza virus spreads from one person to another in the same way as other influenza viruses -- by ""droplet spread."" Respiratory droplets are generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes and expels droplets of fluid. Those droplets travel short distances (usually less than three feet) through the air and can be deposited on the mouth or in the nose of people or on surfaces. Those who develop influenza often shed large amounts of virus in their respiratory secretions for several days after they become ill. Experience with other viruses suggests that individuals with influenza can contaminate their hands when coughing, sneezing or blowing their noses. The virus can survive on the hands for at least one hour. If a person whose hands are heavily contaminated touches a surface such as a doorknob, table or computer keyboard, they can deposit the virus onto that surface, where it can survive for minutes to several hours. One study conducted with a regular seasonal strain of influenza virus found that the virus could survive on facial tissues for several minutes and for two to eight hours on stainless steel or plastic surfaces. If another person touches a contaminated surface with his hands when the virus is still alive and then touches his own mouth or nose, he may become infected. Infection might also occur when a person with influenza shakes hands with another person who subsequently touches their own mouth or nose with their fingers. Several studies have found that many people touch their noses or mouths several times an hour during the course of daily activities. So there are plenty of opportunities for people to inadvertently introduce a flu virus into their bodies if their hands become contaminated. As a result, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that individuals perform hand hygiene -- also known as hand washing or decontamination -- frequently during influenza outbreaks. In addition to reducing the risk of developing influenza, hand hygiene can help protect people from becoming ill with several other respiratory viruses by eliminating these organisms from the hands. A recent study found that hand washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer were both highly effective in reducing a seasonal strain of influenza virus on the hands. This should also be true for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. Either plain soap or antimicrobial soap will reduce the amount of virus on the hands. To ensure decontamination, be sure to wash your hands vigorously and keep both soap and water on your hands for at least 15 seconds. When sinks are not readily available, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a convenient and effective way of eliminate the virus from hands. Use an amount of sanitizer at least the size of quarter or enough to keep your hands wet for at least 15 to 20 seconds while you're rubbing them together. The CDC also recommends that people should avoid touching their mouths, noses and eyes, since surfaces they touch may be contaminated when flu virus is present. People who develop influenza or other respiratory viral infections should also clean their hands after blowing their nose or after covering a cough with their hands. Since droplet spread is the most common way influenza is transmitted from person to person, the CDC also recommends avoiding close contact with individuals who are sick. If you do become ill with influenza, the CDC recommends that you stay home from work or school and limit contact with others. Hand hygiene is an important tool in preventing infection from influenza viruses such as this recent strain and is an easy and effective way to prevent contracting infectious diseases in general. Take the time to educate yourself about proper hand hygiene to protect both yourself and your family. Note: Further information about the 2009 H1N1 influenza (swine flu) outbreak can be obtained by going to CDC's Web site. For general information about hand hygiene in health-care settings, go to this CDC site or this Hand Hygiene Resource Center site.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Look at a Bratz doll. What do you see? Ask that of random shoppers and you might hear it's an empowering role model, a degrading caricature or a harmless piece of plastic. Many parents see Bratz dolls, left, as too racy for their children, and Barbie dolls as representing false ideals. Nine-year-old Ashley Gibbs of Cumming, Georgia, is a fan of the edgy dolls, so it came as an unpleasant surprise that they would soon leave store shelves. ""Ever, ever, ever?"" she asked her mother, Kathryn Adams, after Adams said stores weren't going to sell Bratz after the end of this year. But after a moment of reflection, Ashley seemed relieved. ""Good [thing] I have lots."" Ashley didn't know it, but Bratz are the target of allegations that their creator came up with the concept when he was working for Mattel, the maker of Bratz rival Barbie. Mattel sued Bratz manufacturer MGA Entertainment Inc., and last week a federal judge ordered MGA to cease making the dolls immediately and to stop selling them after the holiday shopping season ends. MGA said it intends to appeal the judge's order and Mattel said it remains open to ""all viable options"" as the matter moves through the courts. The judge's ruling came as a relief to some parents who see the popular dolls' clothes and makeup as too racy for their young daughters. It also eliminates heavy competition against Barbie -- a doll often seen as less provocative, but whose slender body also raises parents' eyebrows. ""I'm happy to not see [Bratz],"" said Kristi Cassell of Sandy Springs, Georgia. Her 5-year-old daughter, Emily, has amassed a collection of Barbies.  Watch mothers and daughters weigh in on the Barbie-Bratz debate » . ""Barbies come across more wholesome,"" Cassell said. Barbie has some ""questionable"" clothes, ""but it seemed like all the Bratz dolls were on a darker side of Barbie,"" she said. Six-year-old Sierra Curry-Corcoran of Newport News, Virginia, also has a Barbie collection and no Bratz dolls. But not by choice. ""I like Bratz better. They have more fancy clothes, and they look more cool,"" Sierra said. Her mother, Tasha Curry-Corcoran, strongly disagrees. ""Bratz are trashy: They wear too much makeup. Their clothing is too short; their boots are too high. They look like prostitutes. That's why we don't have them in our house."" Parents aren't the only ones who have taken aim at Bratz. A 2007 report by the American Psychological Association Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls called Bratz dolls' miniskirts, fishnet stockings and feather boas ""sexualized"" and argued that the dolls' ""objectified sexuality ... is limiting for adolescent girls, and even more so for the very young girls who represent the market for these dolls."" Researchers have criticized Barbie, too. The Mattel dolls represent a ""distortedly thin body ideal,"" and girls experienced ""heightened body dissatisfaction after exposure to Barbie doll images but not after exposure to ... neutral control images,"" according to a 2006 study out of the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom. Cassell acknowledged that Barbie bodies ""are a little unrealistic."" ""But they've been around for generations. I grew up playing with Barbies, and I don't have any physical issues because I had Barbies. I think the adults make a bigger deal out of it than the kids,"" she said. Theresa Hawkesworth of South Africa believes Bratz dolls rather than Barbies are a more positive influence for her 12-year-old daughter, Emma. ""Because their faces and their makeup are so extreme it's almost impossible that a young girl could look like that,"" Hawkesworth said. ""Whereas [with] Barbie dolls, the young girls think that they need that beautiful hair and that beautiful body, and when they don't look like a Barbie they have that poor self-image."" Over the years Emma has accumulated a dozen Bratz dolls, in addition to Bratz shirts, pajamas, posters, computer games and a rolling backpack. ""It's too bad for other girls"" that they're leaving the marketplace, Emma said. As a preteen, Emma feels too old for Barbies, although she still appreciates the style of Bratz. But she doesn't want to emulate that style. ""It looks nice on the dolls, but I would prefer to just wear my own makeup,"" she said. Emma's mother said her daughter's interest in Bratz actually helps the girl maintain her innocence. The branded clothing is ""more innocent, feminine and girly than a see-through or immodest top,"" Hawkesworth said. Ashley's mother had been hesitant to let Ashley or her other daughter, 6-year-old Kate Gibbs, play with Bratz, but she relented when they received them as gifts. Adams had been ""definitely a little bit more of a Barbie fan,"" but, ""I don't want them to buy into the mentality that they've got to look like a Bratz doll or a Barbie doll,"" she said. Ashley seems to be resisting the influence of the Bratz style. ""They have lots of makeup and I don't want that much makeup,"" she said. ""I like casual things, not the big pretty things."" To which Adams later beamed, ""Yes! Proud mom!"" CNN's Sean O'Key contributed to this report.","Bratz dolls will leave the market at the end of the year, to tweens' dismay .

"(CNN) -- A Tampa judge denied bail Wednesday for a Florida man charged with first-degree murder in the death of a 3-month-old child, who authorities say was thrown out of a moving car. Police say infant Emanuel Murray died after his mother's ex-boyfriend threw him from a car on a Florida interstate. Richard Anthony McTear Jr., 21, was arrested Tuesday, hours after a confrontation at his former girlfriend's apartment in which he snatched the infant, Emanuel Wesley Murray, the Hillsborough County sheriff's office said. The child's body was found about 4 .am. Tuesday on the side of Interstate 275 in Tampa, Florida, by a local television photographer on his way to work. The photographer, WTVT's Jason Bird, said he stopped when he spotted something by the roadside . ""It had to be a baby doll but it was too big to be a doll,"" Bird told CNN affiliate WFTS in Tampa. ""I almost passed out, I started shaking,"" said Bird. A preliminary autopsy determined the child died of blunt trauma to the head, the county medical examiner's office said. Police were called to the apartment of McTear's former girlfriend about 3:15 a.m. Tuesday. The mother, Jasmine Bedwell, 17, told investigators that McTear had hit her several times and threatened ""to kill the both of y'all,"" the sheriff's department said in a statement announcing the charges. McTear threw a car seat containing the child across the room during the fight, causing the boy to fall onto the apartment's concrete floor, investigators said. He then picked up the boy and drove off in his blue Chevrolet Impala, throwing the child out while on the interstate, the sheriff's department said. Video on CNN affiliate WFLA TV showed McTear being led out of a Tampa police squad car after his arrest. He ducked his head as TV cameras surrounded him on his walk into a police building. When asked by reporters if he had thrown the child out of the car window, McTear answered, ""It's a dirty game. A dirty game.""

"(CNN) -- Didier Deschamps has been named to succeed Eric Gerets as coach at current French league leaders Marseille at the end of the season, the club announced on Tuesday. World Cup winning captain Didier Deschamps is returning to Marseille as coach at the end of the season. Gerets said last week that he would not be renewing his contract and Marseille decided that France's 1998 World Cup winning captain, Deschamps, was the outstanding candidate to replace him. Former Marseille captain Deschamps, who has signed a two-year contract, has been commentating on French television since leaving Italian giants Juventus where he was coach until the summer of 2007. The 40-year-old previously had a spell in charge at Monaco having ended his playing career in 2001. ""Didier Deschamps will be OM coach next season,"" confirmed a statement on the Marseille Web site. Officials added: ""Last Friday's meeting between the club president (Pape Diouf) and its principal shareholder (Robert Louis-Dreyfus) was able to confirm definitively this choice. ""After Eric Gerets, the club could only fix their choice on a coach of the highest standard to continue the great work already accomplished and the club's development on the playing front. ""Based on our criteria, the choice of Didier Deschamps, whose career as a player and a coach works largely in his favor, naturally won over."" Deschamps led Marseille to a Champions League triumph in 1993 and had two spells at the club as a player, between 1989-1990 and 1991-1994. He also played for Nantes, Bordeaux, Juventus, Chelsea and Valencia in a top career and was also France captain when they won Euro 2000.","Didier Deschamps becomes new manager of Marseille at end of the season .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson may soon return to the stage, at least for a ""special announcement."" Pop star Michael Jackson has been the subject of recent rumors about his health and about a comeback. The pop star has scheduled a news conference Thursday at London's O2 arena, the same venue where Prince sold out 21 nights in 2007, according to London's Outside Organisation. Although the short statement announcing Jackson's news conference did not reveal any details, Britain's Sky News reported Wednesday that the 50-year-old King of Pop has agreed to a series of summer concerts at the O2. Rumors have circulated for years about a possible Jackson concert comeback, just as speculation has abounded about his physical and financial health. Jackson's reclusive lifestyle -- and a photo last year of him being pushed in a wheelchair -- created fertile ground for health rumors. When a London tabloid reported in December that Jackson was battling a potentially fatal disease that required a life-saving lung transplant, his publicist responded that he was ""in fine health"" and that the story was ""a total fabrication."" Jackson's financial troubles in the past year have included the near-foreclosure of his Neverland Ranch in California, which he later sold. Jackson has not lived at Neverland since June 2005, after a Santa Barbara County jury found him not guilty of child molestation charges.","Musician schedules news conference for Thursday at O2 arena .

"(CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the country already is ""seeing shovels hit the ground"" on the first infrastructure repair project funded through the Transportation Department's share of the $787 billion stimulus bill. Workers mark where repairs are needed on Maryland Route 650. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said, ""The work begins today in Montgomery County, Maryland, where a work crew is starting on a project to resurface Maryland State Highway 650 -- a very busy road that has not been fully repaired in 17 years."" The resurfacing contract is going to a Pennsylvania-based family-owned company, American Infrastructure, LaHood said. He said the project will support 60 jobs. ""And that's how we're going to get the country back on its feet,"" LaHood added. Mark Compton, director of government affairs for American Infrastructure, said his company received $2.1 million in federal funds, by way of the Maryland State Highway Administration. The money will be used to repave and add safety features to a stretch of the highway. Compton said the cash infusion is the ""catalyst"" to create 60 jobs, including bringing back some laid-off employees. He said he hopes the workers can be retained beyond this six-month project. ""We'll continue to bid, so the goal is to get more projects to keep those guys working, so they can roll off that project onto another,"" Compton said. CNNMoney: Stimulus funds hit the street . Obama and LaHood on Tuesday announced the release of $27 billion in funds from the stimulus package ""to help states create a 21st-century infrastructure."" The president said it is part of the ""largest new investment in America's infrastructure since President Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System."" Obama said another 200 construction projects would be launched over the next few weeks, ""fueling growth in an industry that's been hard hit by our economic crisis."" Two weeks ago, Obama signed into law his stimulus plan, known as the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. The president has said the plan will create or save up to 3.5 million jobs over the next two years. Four-hundred thousand of those will be infrastructure jobs that include rebuilding roads, bridges and schools. LaHood has asked the nation's governors to certify projects and provide assurances that funds from the act will be spent for appropriate infrastructure projects. Obama said transportation projects would be stamped with a special emblem so people can see where their tax dollars are going. Obama said the investments in highways would create or save 150,000 jobs by the end of 2010. The number of jobs being created or saved in one year is more than the number of jobs the Big Three automakers have lost in manufacturing over the past three years, Obama said. By investing in roads ""that should have been rebuilt long ago,"" Obama said, ""we can save some 14,000 men and women who lose their lives each year due to bad roads and driving conditions."" ""Poor roads are a public hazard, and we have a responsibility to fix them,"" he said.  Watch Obama explain how the roads will save lives » . Obama also announced Tuesday that the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve were launching the Consumer and Business Lending Initiative. When fully implemented, Obama said, the initiative ""will generate up to a trillion dollars in new lending for the American people, and this will help unlock our frozen credit markets, which is absolutely essential for economic recovery.""

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- It's hot and sweaty in a rat-infested room in Lahore's historic red light district, a neighborhood of narrow alleyways lined with brothels. A dancer does the ""mujra,"" a traditional dance banned by a judge for being ""vulgar,"" in Lahore, Pakistan. A barefoot, long-haired woman is gyrating and twirling on the carpet, to the beat of a four-man band whose drummer sweats profusely as he pounds out a furious rhythm. The dancer, who only gives her first name, Beenish, is performing a kind of Pakistani belly-dance called the mujra. Her harmonium player, a skinny bald man who squints through coke-bottle glasses, has been performing like this for the past 50 years. But he says the art form is dying out. ""That spark, the way it was in the past, is no more,"" said Ghulam Sarwar. Last fall, a judge in Lahore's high court declared the mujra dance ""vulgar"" and banned it from being performed on stage. Some here say the government is cracking down on easy, ""immoral"" targets in an attempt to appease religious hard-liners like the Taliban. Islamist militants are believed to be responsible for a recent wave of bomb attacks in Lahore, targeting cinemas, theaters and cafes where young men and women fraternize together. ""It is a gesture of good will to pacify the mullahs and the Taliban,"" said Samia Amjad, a lawmaker in the provincial assembly. Though she is a member of an opposition political party, she said she supported the crackdown on vulgarity. ""I see it as an essential part of Islam."" Dancers aren't the only targets of the court censors. In late March, the Lahore high court banned two female singers from recording new albums after ruling that they sang sexually explicit lyrics. ""If the current circumstances persist in Pakistan,"" said Noora Lal, one of the banned singers, ""then singing will die out in this country."" Pakistan is a deeply conservative Muslim nation, where the punishment for blasphemy is the death sentence. But there is one person in Lahore who openly mocks the conservative establishment: painter and restaurant owner Iqbal Hussain. Though he said he has received multiple death threats from Islamist fundamentalists, Hussain continues to be Pakistan's most vocal defender of prostitutes. All of the models portrayed in his paintings are sex workers. ""I portray them on canvas, portray them as human beings,"" Hussain said, ""They feel pain. They want their children to be educated."" Hussain knows the industry intimately. He was born to a family of sex workers. His mother, a former prostitute, passed away last month at the age of 98. The small, soft-spoken painter has turned the house he grew up in, an old four-story building with ornate wooden balconies, into a popular restaurant for tourists and wealthy Pakistanis. On one side of the house there is a brothel, on the other side, the 17th century Badshahi Mosque, one of the largest mosques in the world. In his subversive paintings, which Hussain said sell for more than $10,000 each, he highlights the overlap between Lahore's sex industry and its religious community. In one canvas, hundreds of worshippers are depicted prostrating themselves around the mosque, while in the foreground, two women apply lipstick and makeup on a balcony. Hussain explained that the prostitutes in the painting were preparing to receive new customers as soon as the prayers in the mosque were over.  Watch the dance being called ""immoral"" in Pakistan » . The painter claimed that on religious festivals, the brothels and dance halls in his neighborhood overflow with customers. ""They come from the northern areas with their turbans,"" Iqbal said, laughing. ""All coming to this area. They're not going to the mosque ... but to the brothels!"" Nevertheless, the rising tide of the Taliban in northwestern Pakistan has some residents of Lahore's red light district worried. ""May Allah keep us safe from them,"" said Beenish, the mujra dancer. ""We are poor, humble people. They should not target this place."" Photography by CNN's Farhad Shadravan.","In Lahore's red light district, Iqbal Hussain mocks Pakistan's religious establishment .

"(CNN) -- A federal agency is examining what caused the Dallas Cowboys' practice facility to collapse on Saturday, paralyzing a scout and injuring 11 others. An aerial view of the scene shows the Dallas Cowboys logo amid the ruins of the indoor practice facility. ""We're trying to determine if there were any violations, or determine the cause,"" said Elizabeth Todd, spokeswoman for Region 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. OSHA investigators will be interviewing witnesses and looking for identifiable hazards, she said. The procedure is routine and implies no wrongdoing, Todd said. OSHA has six months to finish its investigation. Meanwhile, the CEO of a company that makes similar buildings says he believes fewer people would have been injured if the Cowboys' facility had been supported by air rather than a metal frame. About 70 people -- including players, coaches, staff and media -- were inside the metal-framed structure for a rookie mini-camp practice when a line of heavy thunderstorms hit the dome. Video from the incident shows the lights swinging violently from the dome's ceiling seconds before the ceiling crashes to the ground. Players and coaches rushed to help those trapped. ""It was as if someone took a stick pin and hit a balloon,"" said photographer Arnold Payne, who was shooting the practice for CNN affiliate WFAA-TV.  Watch Payne describe being inside when structure collapsed » . Scouting assistant Rich Behm, 33, suffered a severed spinal cord and is paralyzed from the waist down, the team said. He underwent surgery Saturday. ""Rich is a courageous member of our family and someone for whom we care deeply. We ask for all friends and fans of the Dallas Cowboys to join us in embracing him and his family with their thoughts and prayers at this very difficult time,"" team owner Jerry Jones said.  Watch the roof collapse on players, coaches » . Special teams coach Joe DeCamillis fractured a cervical vertebra, and assistant trainer Greg Gaither had two broken bones in his leg, the team said. Gaither had successful surgery Saturday, and DeCamillis was scheduled to undergo surgery Monday, the team said. According to the National Weather Service in Fort Worth, ""a microburst impacted the Valley Ranch area,"" where the Cowboys practice. A microburst is a ""small, intense downdraft which results in a localized area of strong thunderstorm winds,"" the weather service said. Though winds near the ground were estimated near 70 mph, winds are generally more fierce farther from the ground, and microbursts can have winds in excess of 100 mph, the weather service said. ""Therefore, it is quite possible that winds greater than 70 mph affected the upper portions of the damaged structures,"" the service said. The Cowboys' attorney, Levi McCathern II, was in meetings at Valley Ranch on Monday morning and could not be immediately reached. Elizabeth Criswell, a paralegal with his firm, said OSHA's involvement was standard procedure and that the Cowboys would issue a press release at a later time. Summit Structures of Allentown, Pennsylvania, and Cover-All Building Systems of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, which built the dome, referred all questions to a Boston, Massachusetts, public relations firm. The firm released a statement from Nathan Stobbe, Summit's president, who said he was in Texas working with officials to ""assess this severe weather event."" The statement quoted the National Weather Service description of a microburst. It further said the facility was constructed in 2003. A new roof was installed on the building during a 2008 upgrade, the statement said. ""We understand there is a great deal of concern and curiosity about what happened on Saturday, but rather than speculate, we are focused on being part of the effort to find answers and assist the team,"" Stobbe's statement concluded. Mariellen Burns of Regan Communications in Boston did not immediately respond to a follow-up e-mail inquiring what wind speeds the building was engineered to sustain. At least three of Summit's competitors say their buildings can withstand winds of 140 mph or higher. Donato Fraioli, the CEO of Air Structures American Technologies Inc., said the air-supported structure his company built for the Miami Dolphins can withstand winds up to 140 mph. However, Fraioli said, several media outlets, including CNN, have been erroneously reporting that the Cowboys' structure was supported by air. The Cowboys' facility was supported by a metal frame, which is why so many people were hurt, he said. Fraioli, who has 47 years of experience in air- and metal-supported structures, said his company has built air-supported structures in some of the most troublesome climates in the nation, including facilities for the New York Giants, New York Jets, Denver Broncos, Minnesota Vikings, Seattle Seahawks, Chicago Bears, Buffalo Bills and Philadelphia Eagles. His company also has constructed metal-frame buildings -- generally for industrial applications and to accommodate aircraft -- and he has found that many football teams, both college and pro, are opting for air-supported structures because they are cheaper and safer. ""The worst that could happen if it had a failure of any sort ... the fabric would fall over the interior players,"" he said, adding that repairing an air-supported structure generally entails patching and re-inflating it, as opposed to reconstructing a metal frame. Not only are the air-supported buildings safer in the event of a collapse, he said, but they're safer during practice as well. ""There are no steel beams to run into or any aluminum frames to run into,"" he said. Metal frames also leave more room for construction and engineering error. ""I just think you have that many more nuts and bolts and components that could easily be erected with error,"" he said. ""Why have it, just for the reason of what happened in Dallas? Why take the risk?"" CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Cowboys' attorney's office says OSHA involvement standard procedure .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- In a major shake-up the likes of which Cubans have not seen for decades, President Raul Castro on Monday reorganized his Cabinet, replacing longtime aides to his brother Fidel, who resigned from office a year ago, citing poor health. Cuban President Raul Castro is moving his own people into power, analysts say. Some analysts said the changes appear to be an attempt by Raul Castro to put his own supporters into positions of power. Among the changes: . Felipe Perez Roque, the 43-year-old foreign minister, was replaced by his deputy, Bruno Rodriguez Aprilla. Carlos Lage Davila, an economist, lost his job as Cabinet secretary, but no mention was made of removing him from his other post as vice president of the Council of State. Lage, who helped guide the nation through its ""special period"" of dire economic times in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the loss of billions in subsidies, was replaced by Brig. Gen. Jose Amado Ricardo Guerra; Raul Castro is also commander in chief of the armed forces. ""It looks like Raul putting some of his own people in,"" said Wayne Smith, director of the Cuba program at the Center for International Policy in Washington, who led the U.S. Interests Section in Havana during the Carter administration. Smith noted that Cuba's government underwent ""quite a few shake-ups after the revolution first came in"" in 1959, but said Monday's move ""is the biggest shake-up that I've seen in a very long time ... for the last 30 or 40 years."" ""This is obviously a major move,"" concurred Vicki Huddleston, who led the Interests Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and is a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""[There is] nothing like this that I can recall since the late 1960s."" She noted that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez met with both Castro brothers during a visit late in February to Havana, on what Granma described as a ""work visit,""  and speculated that Raul Castro may have asked him then to buy in on the changes. ""They really need Chavez to be on board, because without the subsidized oil from Venezuela, they're dead,"" Huddleston said. With the Cuban economy hamstrung by the world economy, Raul Castro may have decided it is time for him to make reforms of his own without worrying about second-guessing by his brother or his brother's allies, she said. Huddleston speculated that the changes could portend the government once again allowing private enterprise to flourish in Cuba. Communist leader Fidel Castro experimented with that during the 1990s, but pulled back. ""It represents a significant step by Raul Castro to gain autonomy and, essentially, distance himself from Fidel's old gang,"" said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. ""In other words, he feels confident enough that he has an independent base of power."" He said Raul Castro's moves to date have proven popular not only with his party members, but also with the general population. Still, Raul Castro should not take that support for granted, Birns said. ""It may be that, if he makes too many moves, the party will feel that their privileges are being taken away, and that will make them unhappy."" Otto Reich, who served as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs during the George W. Bush administration, said he was withholding judgment. ""It's a little early to tell what this really means,"" he said. ""Some people are saying the Fidelistas are being replaced by the Raulistas. But the other side is: Are we talking about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic?"" The state-run newspaper Granma published an official notice from the State Council that said the changes were intended to form a structure that is ""more compact and functional, with fewer organisms of the central administration of the state and a better distribution of the functions that they carry out.""

In the left shows William ""Bill"" Garrett in high school, and the right is a 2007 photo of the Maryland teenager. They told the Johns Hopkins University freshman that his father had poisoned the family dog, his sister had injected crystal methamphetamine into his pet lizard and his grandmother had put human body parts into his food. As schizophrenia took hold, the Maryland teenager became lost within his own mind and had to leave college after winning a full, four-year scholarship. Garrett's experience echoes the teenage years of Nathaniel Ayers, a promising string bass player whose musical training at the Juilliard School was cut short by schizophrenia, a brain disorder that blurs a person's ability to distinguish between reality and delusions. Ayers became homeless and played Beethoven pieces on a broken violin in the streets of Los Angeles, California. His struggles with schizophrenia and his friendship with a Los Angeles Times columnist inspired the movie ""The Soloist,"" which releases Friday. His sister, Jennifer Ayers-Moore, hopes the movie will raise awareness about schizophrenia and has established the Nathaniel Anthony Ayers Foundation for the artistically gifted mentally ill. ""I know there are thousands of Nathaniels, and they deserve a chance, too,"" said Ayers-Moore, an Atlanta-based social worker. Teen interrupted . Schizophrenia is the result of disrupted brain development. Males typically get symptoms during their teens or early 20s, as Ayers and Garrett did. ""It's a critical time for the brain,"" said Dr. Jon McClellan, the medical director of the Child Study and Treatment Center at Seattle Children's Hospital. ""It's the CEO part of the brain that pays attention, makes decisions and filters. The prefrontal cortex, that's the last area of the brain to develop.  As that area comes online, that's when the illness presents."" In high school, Garrett won elected offices in student government and headed the lacrosse and cross country teams. A gifted student, he wanted to study political science and biology at Hopkins. At home, he cooked family dinners, helped his little sister with homework, and surprised his mother with pancakes on her birthday. ""People likened him to the perfect child before he got sick,"" said his mother, Kristan Kanyuch. In 2007, the unusual behaviors started. He slept a lot. He emptied an entire can of bug spray in his bedroom. When he came home for a weekend from college, he pointed to a blister on his hand that had formed from playing lacrosse. ""Look, I have gangrene,"" he said.  ""My hand is going to rot."" Then he tried to cut off his hand with a paring knife. His family stopped him and took him to an emergency room for a psych evaluation, but Garrett refused to wait and left. A week later, Kanyuch got a call from the university. Her son was failing every class. When confronted, Garrett looked at the F's and calmly replied, ""I'm not failing anything."" In the 1970s, Ayers-Moore saw the symptoms when her family picked her brother up from Juilliard to head home to Cleveland, Ohio, for summer. ""The look in his eye was so different,"" she said. ""It was like you could see into his soul, he could look into yours. It sort of startled me a little bit. I didn't know what to say to him. On the way from New York, I pretended I was asleep. I didn't know what to say."" Paranoid schizophrenia . About three decades later, Nickole Kanyuch, 15, watched a similar scenario unfold as her brother, Garrett, struggled with paranoid schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder. ""I watched the big brother who I had looked up to all my life fall apart and become someone entirely new,"" she said. ""The boy who was destined for greatness, who worked long and hard for 12 years to lead a successful life, was destroyed in a mere six months."" Garrett, who had once organized his 600 books by the Dewey Decimal system, could hardly read two sentences.  The voices in his head drowned out the words on the page, he told his mother. Garrett, who color coordinated the clothes inside his closet, could no longer groom himself or shower.  The voices told him the shampoo and soap were poisoned. Kristan Kanyuch quit her financial planning job to take care of him. Despite taking medicine, Garrett's health fluctuated.  One day he was fine; the next, he threatened to kill the neighbors. Frustrated and facing mounting debt, Kanyuch sought help. She joined a mental health support group. At one session, she was told to follow simple instructions from a counselor.  Meanwhile, 10 people who stood around her talked at once.  While the chorus of voices drowned out the instructions, she realized this was how her son lived every day. That night, Kanyuch hugged her son. ""You have to be the most courageous person. You wake up every day,"" she told him. ""That's when he explained to me the reason he sleeps,"" Kanyuch said.  ""He doesn't hear the voices. He doesn't hear them telling him he's fat, stupid, there's a conspiracy. It's a break for him to sleep."" Although no one knows where these voices originated, they could be triggered by wiring problems in the brain, said McClellan, who researches adolescent psychiatry. One theory is schizophrenia causes difficulty distinguishing thoughts from their outside experiences, ""so they experience internal thoughts and perceptions as voices,"" he said. Recovery . Garrett has been a subject in two research programs searching for better schizophrenia treatments. His condition fluctuated, and, for months, he was on suicide watch. Schizophrenia is a difficult disorder to treat, because one medication that soothes one patient can make another psychotic. ""Medication or dosages can't be matched absolutely with the individual, so there is some of that trial and error,"" said Dr. Thomas Bornemann, director of the Carter Center's Mental Health Program. Garrett tried many drugs. Some made him drowsy, others volatile and one drug made him gain 75 pounds. Severe side effects often cause patients to stop taking medication. For now, doctors seem to have found one that helps Garrett. Since March, Garrett has been at a Maryland research center that looks into the relationship between metabolism, tobacco and schizophrenia. After a violent visit in August, Garrett, 21, had not been home until Easter. During the recent  visit, he played basketball, Yahtzee and Wii bowling with his family. ""He was able to carry on a conversation and play card games,"" Kanyuch said. ""He was interacting."" At home, surrounded by reminders all his past achievements, Garrett said: ""Mom, I was on the top of the world. Now I'm in the gutter."" His mother disagreed: ""Look at it as an opportunity."" ""What?"" he said. ""It's not an opportunity everyone would jump at,"" she told Garrett.  ""But as you rehabilitate, as you grow an insight into your illness, there may be things you deal with forever. But you've had significant experiences that you may be able to use to help other people. There's no place where insight and advocacy [for mental health] is needed more than in politics, which is what you wanted to do."" A life with schizophrenia won't be easy, but some with the disorder have graduated from college, earned doctorates and lead enriched lives, she told Garrett. ""He doesn't understand the courage he has.""","Schizophrenia disrupts Maryland teenager's life, forces him to leave college .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Tim Russert's personal physician says medics tried to save the NBC anchor shortly after he collapsed at work. Dr. Michael Newman said medics tried to revive Tim Russert several times before he died. Dr. Michael Newman told CNN's Larry King that a defibrillator, a heart-shocking device, was used to try to save Russert. ""A resuscitation was begun almost immediately,"" he said. Russert, a mainstay of television journalism's political talk as the host of ""Meet the Press,"" died of a heart attack after collapsing at NBC's Washington bureau Friday. He was 58. Newman appeared on ""Larry King Live"" on Monday, along with Dr. Mehmet Oz, a cardiac thoracic surgeon, and Dr. P.K. Shah, King's heart doctor.  Watch Russert's son greet guests at wake » . Newman described Russert as a model patient: ""He complied with almost everything that was asked of him."" The following is an edited version of the show's transcript: . Newman: Tim had a cardiac arrest. It was related to an acute -- presumably acute dissection, rupturing plaque that's causing a blockage of a coronary artery. He had a heart attack -- a fatal arrhythmia.  Watch panel discuss if Russert's death was preventable » . King: Did we know he had heart disease? Newman: Tim was known to have coronary artery disease, and it was being treated with respect to management of his risk factors. King: Was he on medication? Did he exercise? Did he watch what he ate? Newman: Tim was on medication. I'd like to say, I'm glad you mentioned exercise and watching what we eat. The foundation of management of heart disease and every medical condition, really, starts with lifestyle modification. You know, a healthy lifestyle, and you'll have good health, and you'll certainly have a healthy heart. ... Tim appreciated that. Yes, he exercised. He was on his Aerodyne bicycle.  See a timeline of Russert's career » . King: Dr. Oz, from what Dr. Newman said, could it have been prevented? Oz: You can never tell for sure. And the reality is a big wake-up call. And it's the question that Tim Russert would be asking right now: What are the odds that I could have done something different myself? Let's examine it for a second. Of the 450,000 people a year who die of heart attacks in this country, probably half of them never knew they were at risk of a heart attack. It's because the heart doesn't really have pain fibers. In fact, the only reason you ever feel any pain when you're having a heart attack is because the nerves in the heart cross other nerves -- from your chin, your arm or from the chest and the spinal column. And they short-circuit each other out. And that creates this referred pain that in cardiology and cardiosurgery we recognize to be angina. The other reality -- and this is a big wake-up call for a lot of Americans, as well -- is that a lot of the plaques that we have are not flow limiting. And by that I mean they don't cause a limitation on the amount of blood that courses through the veins that go to our heart. ... King: Dr. Shah has brought along a defibrillator. Right? Dr. Newman, it was not used, is that correct? Newman: That's not correct. King: OK, it was used. Newman: NBC had a defibrillator. A resuscitation was begun almost immediately. NBC had an EAD [external automated defibrillator] on site, and they were preparing to use it. At the same moment, the DC EMS, emergency medical squad, arrived, and they immediately defibrillated Tim. He had no heart rhythm. They defibrillated him. His heart was beating then in a ventricular -- fine ventricular fib, and then it deteriorated. They shocked him again. Actually, he was defibrillated three times before his arrival at Sibley Memorial Hospital.  Remembering Tim Russert » . King: Why do you think it didn't work in the Russert case? Shah: There are several possibilities. The longer the delay between the time collapse occurs and you begin defibrillation, the less the success of defibrillation. That's number one. Number two, if you're a very big-sized individual and have a large heart, the larger the heart, the harder it is to get a successful defibrillation. The bigger the heart, the more likely you are to go back into fibrillation. King: Dr. Newman, was Tim Russert a good patient? Newman: Tim was a great patient. Tim Russert as a patient was the Tim Russert that we all know. He complied with almost everything that was asked of him. He was well-informed, asked good questions. Tim was a good patient. Are there things all of us as patients could be better at? Sure. But Tim was a good patient. King: Do you ever think, Dr. Newman, in retrospect, I could have done more? Should have done more? Newman: You know, as physicians, we always hope that we can change people's lives, that we can make them feel better, live longer, that we can intervene, and that's what our role is. Unfortunately, in many instances, our hopes are not fulfilled. Absolutely, I wish Tim was alive and with us today. ... And ... patients die of heart disease or cancer; we all struggle with the fact there are limits to what we can do.","Tim Russert's doctor says he was a model patient .

"(CNN) -- Pig farmers threw rocks at police officers in Cairo, Egypt, on Sunday as health workers gathered the farmers' herds for slaughter in what the government says is a precaution against the spread of swine flu, an interior ministry official told CNN. The Egyptian government required all pigs in the country be killed, citing a need to prevent the spread of swine flu. Brig. Gen. Hani Abdel-Latif said 50 to 60 protesters gathered in Cairo's Manshiyet Naser slum because they were upset with the health ministry's decision to slaughter all pigs in the country. But local media reported the number of farmers clashing with police on Sunday was in the hundreds. Experts have criticized the Egyptian government's move, announced last week, to slaughter all pigs regardless of whether they are infected. There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Egypt. And according to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, humans cannot get the swine flu virus, known to scientists as the H1N1 virus, by eating pork. The CDC says human infection from pigs most likely occurs when people are in close proximity to sick animals, such as in pig barns. But Egyptian officials cite how avian flu still exists in the country because, they say, the government did not take sufficient protective measures when that disease was first discovered there in 2006. Most Egyptian pig farmers are Coptic Christians, a group that makes up about 10 percent of the 80 million people in the mostly Muslim nation. Coptic Christians do not observe the Muslim ban on eating pork, and historically they have coexisted peacefully with the Muslim majority in Egypt. The farmers also work in the garbage industry and use their daily collections to feed their herds, which number about 300,000 animals in the country. With the government-mandated slaughter under way, Egypt's Health Ministry declared Saturday that ""Egypt is free of the swine flu."" Dr. Hamid Samaha, head of the country's Public Institute for Veterinary Services, said that starting Sunday the government will compensate pig farmers by paying as much as $45 for a disease-free pig and about $5 for diseased ones. The health ministry told CNN its workers are freezing all the disease-free meat and plan to give it back to its owners once the ban on pigs is lifted. But according to Egypt's state-run al-Akhbar newspaper, ministry sources said the country does not have enough facilities to store the frozen meat. Ministry spokesman Dr. Abdel-Rahman Shaheen said the government will open two new slaughterhouses in two provinces near Cairo, al-Alioubiya and al-Giza. Shaheen also announced Saturday that the ministry has enlisted 100 additional doctors and nurses to help in health quarantines at Cairo Airport, where travelers are being questioned if they have been to Mexico recently. And more are expected to be hired to help at Alexandra's main seaport, where the government declared a state of emergency last week.

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's prime minister said Monday he will resign to save what he called the country's ""infant democracy."" Pushpa Kamal Dahal cited a serious political crisis caused by the president's ""unconstitutional"" order. It is the latest fallout over the status of Nepal's army chief, Gen. Rookmangud Katawal. The Maoist government sacked Katawal on Sunday. Hours later, President Ram Baran Yadav reinstated him. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, commonly known as Prachanda, resigned on Monday, citing a serious political crisis caused by the president's ""unconstitutional"" order. ""The dual powers that have been unconstitutionally established in the country must end under any circumstance,"" Prachanda said in a televised address announcing he would resign from the country's Cabinet. Prachanda is the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which had been the largest party in Nepal's coalition government until it recently withdrew. The former guerilla leader headed a decade-long bloody Maoist insurgency to abolish the country's monarchy before being sworn in as prime minister in August. In his address on Monday, Prachanda blamed certain political parties and ""power centers"" for ""striking at our democracy, constitution and the peace process by putting the president in the forefront of the controversy over the chief of army staff."" ""This has raised concerns over our infant democracy and the peace process,"" he said. ""I appeal to the people, civil society and political powers to be committed to the struggle for establishing a democratic Nepal."" Nepal's interim constitution gives the president powers as supreme commander of the army and guardian of the constitution. Yadav's spokesman said the president had the support of 18 parties in parliament when he reinstated the army chief. The decision to fire Katawal touched off protests. Supporters of both sides in the dispute took to the streets on Sunday. Despite sporadic clashes between the two factions, there were no serious injuries reported. The Cabinet voted to dismiss Katawal after the military refused the government's order to stop recruiting about 3,000 new soldiers to fill vacant positions when it has yet to take in former Maoist rebels, as a 2006 peace deal required. The Maoists laid down their arms and won power in 2008 elections after an agreement that ended a decade-long insurgency. Under the deal, more than 19,000 former insurgents were to be integrated into the country's security forces. Journalist Manesh Shrestha contributed to this report.","Government calls president's order to keep army chief in office ""unconstitutional""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, withdrew his name from consideration as surgeon general of the United States on Thursday. He spoke to CNN's Larry King about the decision and President Obama's health care plans. Here is an edited transcript: . Dr. Sanjay Gupta says he just returned from India, where he looked into medical tourism. Larry King: But, first, breaking news about CNN's own Dr. Sanjay Gupta, long rumored to be the main candidate for U.S. surgeon general. He's taken himself out of the running. Joins us now here in Los Angeles to talk about it. Why? Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Well, first of all, it was a really tough decision, and a long decision and a long process for sure. And I was incredibly flattered, humbled by the consideration even for the position. I think for me it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else. You know, I have two daughters. Our third daughter is now imminent. In fact, I have my phone on right here, I might get called off the set. King: As we talk. Gupta: As we talk, my wife is imminent with our third child. You know, this job that we have collectively takes us away from our children for so many years at once, and I sort of came to grips with the fact that I'd probably be away at least the first several years, four or five years -- there's my existing two daughters, one more on the way -- but several years of their lives. And I just didn't feel like I should do that now. And the other thing, let me just add, you know, you know me and a lot of people know me, obviously, as a journalist for CNN, but you know, I continue to practice neurosurgery, Larry. You and I have talked about that, and I... King: You do brain surgery all the time. Gupta: Yes. And it's an important part of my life. And I work at a county hospital. That's the hospital I've chosen to work at in Atlanta [Georgia]. And I really enjoy that. I came to grips with, ironically, that being surgeon general, I probably would not be able to continue to practice surgery. King: How about the cut in pay? Gupta: Well, you know, that's a sacrifice we were willing to make. I think, you know, either you're a public servant or you're not a public servant. I've always been drawn to public service. So that really wasn't a consideration for me. King: Was it an offer or a ""would you consider if""? Gupta: It's a little bit of a funny thing -- and I've never been through this process before. I guess the formal part of it is when you are nominated. I was not nominated, but I had conversations with the senior-most people that would make an offer, and they told me they wanted me to do this job. So... King: Was it the thought of [Democratic former] Sen. Tom Daschle, who was going to be secretary of health, that you be his surgeon general? Gupta: Well, I did have conversations with him, but you know, the fact that he withdrew did not play as big a role in my mind in terms of not considering the job. Again, I think either you do public service or you don't. You want your job to be as precisely defined as possible, for sure, but that wasn't a major factor. King: The way it was presented, then, you feel that you would have been offered it even if Daschle had not left or had left, no matter what? Gupta: I think so. You know, I mean, you know, I've had a lot of conversations with the White House folks. I think there was a big interest on their part, and obviously they know of my dedication to public service. I think there was a real melding there. King: Do you have anyone you would recommend for that job? Gupta: You know, no one off the top of my head. I mean, I think whoever takes that job really does have to make it a higher-profile job. I mean, this is an important job. I have a great deal of respect for the office and for the commissioned corps. You've seen the work they do. They do life-saving... King: A lot of clout. Gupta: Yes, a lot of clout, life-saving, life-preventing work -- or life-preserving work -- all over the country every single day. And I think that it has to have a little bit of a higher profile. Whoever takes this job has to be out there really advocating the issues of public health. At no time is it probably more important than right now, as we're dealing with health care reform. These issues really go hand in hand. King: Well, their loss is a continuing our gain. Gupta: I appreciate that. King: If I may speak to it. Gupta: I would miss this witty banter for sure, back and forth. King: May I speak for CNN. But you had to be flattered. Gupta: I was flattered. And you know, I have a great deal of respect for that office. And I in no way want people to think that I don't. This is really more about my family and my surgical career. King: Couple other notes. I know you're just back from India. I want to ask about that. Gupta: Yes. King: President Obama held a health care summit [Thursday] at the White House. More than 100 experts, policy makers took part, including some who opposed the Clinton administration's health care reform back in the '90s. Do you support his aims? Gupta: He is drawing an inextricable relationship between the economy and health care. As people talk -- the economy is issue No. 1, as we talk about all the time. But he's making the point, I think, and he has been for some time, even while he was campaigning, that you cannot talk about the economy without talking about health care. The businesses have to provide health care insurance for their employees. It is often very difficult for them to do that, in addition to trying to reach some sort of profit from their product. So I -- that message, I think, has been pretty loud and clear, and I think it is resonating. He's also talking about the fact that you can't fix the health care system without bringing down costs of health care overall. And since you brought it up, I was just in India, and one of the stories that I was doing was about medical tourism. Here is a good example -- 750,000 Americans leave the United States every year to go abroad for life-saving operations. Why? Mainly because of cost. It can be up to a tenth of the cost in some of these countries such as India, such as Singapore. King: Open-heart surgery in India might be one-tenth of what it costs here? Gupta: One-tenth. Hip surgery, neurosurgery. All -- a lot of these various operations. And the real question, and I think it's a question worth exploring, is why? How can they do it so much cheaper? How can they offer good-quality care? I saw it. It is good-quality care. I saw that with my own eyes. What do we have to learn? And how can we use this to help reform our health care system? King: Is there an assumption that we have the best doctors, that we do it better than anybody else, that's an American assumption? Gupta: Yes. And I think, you know, we do provide very good health care for people who have access to it. King: Ah. Gupta: And I think that's part of the problem. King: That's the rub, though, right? Gupta: That is the rub. And I think there are really two schools of thought, which we are going to hopefully distill down, as we talk about this issue more and more. One is, do you revamp the entire health care system? Do you say, look, this health care system is broken, toss it all out, let's start all over again? Or do you say, look, it works pretty well for a fraction of the population. Let's see who it doesn't work for and fix those things only. So don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Let's target what's broken and focus on that. King: What role in all of this will the new surgeon general play? Gupta: I really don't know. I'm not sure. At one point... King: He would have to be a proponent for it, you would think. Gupta: You know, the surgeon general has an interesting position, and this is something that I learned. It is truly one of the more apolitical positions at that senior level. So they are really the nation's doctor. I think that they really have to focus on making sure that best health practices are constantly known. It's amazing how high the health illiteracy rate remains in this country. To remind people how to best take care of themselves. King: One other thing. Do you think it's going to -- do you think we're going to get a new health care program? Gupta: I think so. It's going to take a long time. I think that it may not even happen within this first term, if there is a second term for him. So I think it's not going to be something that happens certainly overnight. The fact that they had a health care summit this early on I think is probably a good sign of at least his commitment to this issue.","Gupta: ""It really came down to a sense of timing""

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A magnitude-7.9 earthquake that struck southwestern China last year left 5,335 students dead or missing and disabled an additional 546 children, state media reported. A girl fastens wish cards at a middle school at Qushan township earlier this year in memory of students. The first official tally of students killed in the Sichuan province quake was released Thursday by Tu Wentao, the head of the province's education department, the Xinhua news agency said. As of September, official figures put the death toll at 69,227, with more than 17,923 people missing. The tremor struck May 12 about 2:30 p.m., when many children were in school. The official tally of student deaths and injuries was released a few days after an Amnesty International report accused the government of China of intimidating and unlawfully detaining relatives of children who had died in the earthquake. The 52-page report, published Sunday, documented instances in which relatives said they had been detained for up to 21 days for trying to get answers from officials. ""By unlawfully locking up parents of children who died, the government is creating more misery for people who have said in some cases they lost everything in the Sichuan earthquake,"" said Roseann Rife, deputy program director of Amnesty International Asia-Pacific. The report also accused authorities of preventing relatives from complaining to higher officials about the quality of construction in the buildings that had collapsed. The human-rights organization called on Chinese authorities ""to take immediate action to address the grievances of survivors and relatives of those who were killed or injured."" CNN was not immediately able to get a response to the report from China's Ministry of Civil Affairs and Ministry of Justice.","In September, officials put death toll at 69,227, with more than 17,923 missing .

"HOUSTON, Texas (CNN) -- On the tape, Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan appears to burn with rage. Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan, pictured here, allegedly tortured a business associate on videotape. Believing he was cheated in a business deal, the member of the United Arab Emirates ruling family was trying to extract a confession from an Afghan grain dealer. With a private security officer assisting, Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan is seen stuffing sand in the Afghan's mouth. As the grain dealer pleads and whimpers, he is beaten with a nailed board, burned in the genitals with a cigarette lighter, shocked with a cattle prod, and led to believe he would be shot. Salt is poured on his wounds. In the end, the victim can muster up only weak moans as an SUV is repeatedly driven over him. The 45 minutes of torture appears on a nearly three-hour-long videotape shot in late 2004 in the desert outside Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf region. It was made at the direction of the sheikh himself. The tape has been viewed by CNN. Now the tape has surfaced as a piece of evidence in a federal civil suit filed in Houston, Texas, against the sheikh by his former business partner, Bassam Nabulsi. As media, U.S. governmental and human rights questions and concerns emerged, Abu Dhabi's government on Tuesday issued a statement saying it deplored the contents of the video and plans an immediate and comprehensive review of it. Nabulsi, a Lebanese-born U.S. citizen living in Houston, says he met Sheikh Issa when the royal came to Houston for medical care in 1994.   Watch portions of the tape and Nabulsi tell his story » . According to Nabulsi, the men became friends and business partners, and Sheikh Issa eventually recruited Nabulsi to move to Abu Dhabi to work for him. ""We were buddies,"" said Nabulsi, who met with CNN journalists in Houston. ""He gave me his personal vow. He swore to look after my family in case something happened to me."" The sheikh, who holds no official government position, is the half-brother of the country's ruler. In the lawsuit, Nabulsi says was disturbed by the sheikh's ""increasingly bizarre behavior"" after the November 2004 death of his father, UAE ruler Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan. Nabulsi's lawsuit says that Sheikh Issa's father ""kept tight control over Sheikh Issa"" but after the father's death, he ""apparently no longer felt constrained."" Nabulsi claims he confronted his business partner about the Afghan's treatment, telling him that to do such a thing he ""must not be a God-fearing person."" Nabulsi says his boldness prompted the sheikh to turn on him. Later, Nabulsi was arrested on drug charges. Security officers working for the sheikh ransacked his home and demanded the torture video, Nabulsi claimed. By this point, the tape -- shot by Nabulsi's brother at the order of the sheikh -- had been smuggled out of the country. According to an affidavit, Nabulsi's brother worked for Sheikh Issa as a personal assistant. In 2005, Nabulsi was arrested, jailed and ultimately convicted on drug charges. And, he said, he was tortured and humiliated by UAE police, who demanded he return the tape. ""It was a lot of humiliation,"" Nabulsi told CNN. ""And I really don't like to talk about it."" Nabulsi was fined and deported. Darryl Bristow, the sheikh's Houston attorney, argued in court papers that American courts have no jurisdiction over his client. In a statement to CNN, Bristow said Nabulsi is using the videotape of a third party, Nabulsi's brother, to influence the court over a business dispute. ""The public should know that the man behind the camera was Bassam Nabulsi's brother and that Bassam Nabulsi kept the video from the media while his lawyer was asking for money. What do you call that where you come from?"" Bristow asked. Nabulsi's attorney denied wrongdoing. The Houston case languished in the U.S. court system after it was filed in 2006 but it eventually moved forward when the sheikh's personal assistant was served with court papers last year. Nabulsi's attorney, Anthony Buzbee, said he has deposed the sheikh, but the deposition is under seal. The case was filed in Houston because the Sheikh Issa-Nabulsi business partnership was formed and focused in Texas and ""claims at issue in this case arose out of contacts within Texas."" Nabulsi claims breaches of contract and fiduciary duty. He wants $80 million he says is owed to him from their business relationship. He also wants to be awarded punitive damages for torture, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and malicious prosecution. Initially, the UAE Interior Ministry said Sheikh Issa ""does not hold any official position"" in the government and that Nabulsi's lawsuit is ""a private dispute."" Asked about the torture allegations, the UAE said it investigated and found ""...all rules, policies and procedures were followed correctly by the police department. The review also concluded that the incidents depicted in the videotapes were not part of a pattern of behavior."" The shocking case has made waves recently as news organizations asked about the tape. U.S. senior officials familiar with the case say the administration is holding off sending a nuclear deal with the United Arab Emirates to Congress for ratification because they fear a fallout from the torture story. Congress has to ratify the civil nuclear agreement signed in January between the Bush administration and the UAE. Those senior U.S. officials said the agreement was supposed to be sent to the Senate, but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held off doing so because of the story's sensitivity. One American lawmaker, Rep. James McGovern, D-Massachusetts, asked Clinton to investigate and that all ""expenditures of funds, training, sales or transfers of equipment or technology, including nuclear"" to the UAE be put on hold until the matter is reviewed. He also wants the United States to deny any visas for travel by Sheikh Issa or his immediate family. ""I think we have an obligation to say we want to step back a bit and look at this a little more closely,"" said McGovern, co-chairman of the congressional human rights commission. He promised hearings on the issue, probing the case and how the U.S. Embassy in the UAE handled it. ""I am not going to let it go away,"" McGovern said. Human Rights Watch, the humanitarian watchdog group, is calling for the United Arab Emirates to ""investigate and prosecute"" the grain dealer's torture. With media questions about the tape mounting, Abu Dhabi said on Wednesday it decided to renew its inquiries -- more than four years after the incident. As for the grain dealer, UAE officials say he survived the ordeal, and said the sheikh and the grain dealer settled the matter privately by agreeing not to bring formal charges against the other. How much money was the grain dealer accused of stealing from the sheikh? ""It's nothing,"" Nabulsi said. ""No more than about $5,000."" CNN's Scott Bronstein, Drew Griffin, Stan Grant, Elise Labott, Octavia Nasr, and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Former business partner of Sheikh Issa of Abu Dhabi suing royal .

"(CNN) -- The days of being cut off from the Internet while you're on a plane are quickly disappearing. An American Airlines passenger uses Wi-Fi to access the Internet during a flight. A number of domestic airlines have recently begun offering Wi-Fi Internet access aboard planes, and other airlines say they are working toward making it happen. ""This is the year"" for Wi-Fi on planes, said Jack Blumenstein, president and CEO of Aircell, whose Gogo® Inflight Internet service provides access on Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Virgin America flights, and will begin testing on United flights later this year. Gogo is installed on more than 190 commercial planes, and Blumenstein said he expected 1,200 aircraft to have Gogo capability by the end of 2009. For now, Wi-Fi on domestic carriers' planes is limited to flights within North America. Gogo, which operates by transmitting signals from ground-level towers, functions across the United States and up to about 300 miles offshore. The company's access will cover the entire continent within a year or two, Blumenstein said. Row 44, which uses satellite technology to provide connectivity to Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines, already covers much of North America and will roll out trans-Atlantic and European service in the third quarter of this year, said the company's CEO, John Guidon. Neither company would release the exact cost of turning airplanes into Wi-Fi hot spots. But Blumenstein said Aircell managed to equip a plane for ""substantially"" less than $100,000. Row 44, which bills itself as the ""industrial-strength solution"" to airplane connectivity, costs hundreds of thousands of dollars per plane, Guidon said. Another company, LiveTV, is a subsidiary of JetBlue that provides free e-mail and messaging aboard flights but doesn't offer open Web surfing. LiveTV, which uses air-to-ground technology, provides the service on select JetBlue flights and also is working with Frontier Airlines on offering Internet access aboard its planes. The Wi-Fi venture has the potential to be ""very profitable,"" said Harlan Platt, an airline industry expert and professor of finance at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. ""Normally, air carriers rush to purchase capital equipment that raises their cost but doesn't raise their revenue. ... This is actually a revenue-producing tactic. And it's a good one because it's providing value to the passenger and it's creating incremental revenues for the airline,"" Platt said. Aircell, which shares its revenue from Gogo with the airlines, charges $9.95 for flights under three hours, $12.95 for flights longer than three hours and $7.95 to use a Wi-Fi capable handheld device for any flight length. Passengers can begin using the service once the plane reaches 10,000 feet. If the plane remains in flight for longer than three hours as part of a delay, passengers do not pay the higher fee, Blumenstein said. Platt believes that business model will evolve to entice more passengers to use it. The size of those fees could result in ""a whole segment of the market that they're not going to capture,"" said Platt. The airlines will maximize their profits by convincing more passengers to use the system with a lower price, he said. Platt predicted Aircell and the airlines would create a second tier of service, which would be less expensive but with fewer capabilities. He compared the strategy to airlines' price-reducing tactics to avoid empty seats on planes. As Aircell and Row 44's services expand, LiveTV is monitoring passengers' usage to gauge how to move ahead with its own business model, said Mike Moeller, vice president of sales and marketing for the company. ""Yes, broadband is coming. We're sitting there asking, 'Who pays? Is it the airlines or the customers? And what will they pay? What is the right technology? ... When does all of this happen?' We're in weird economic times,"" Moeller said. As for the possibility of passengers offending their seat-mates by surfing for inappropriate content, Blumenstein said nine months of Wi-Fi availability on American yielded no such incidents. Still, airlines including American, Delta and United have requested screening for potentially offensive content, he said. On the other hand, Alaska Airlines, which uses Row 44, does not plan on using the company's content-blocking capabilities. Instead, flight attendants will follow standard protocol for objectionable material -- they'll ask passengers to stow it away, said Bobbie Egan, an airline spokeswoman. Here is what major U.S. airlines offer, and what is coming up: .","Many domestic airlines have begun offering Wi-Fi Internet access aboard planes .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Dom DeLuise, who spiced up such movies as ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""Silent Movie"" and ""The Cannonball Run"" with his manic delivery and roly-poly persona, has died, his son's publicist said. Dom DeLuise was best known for his roles in Mel Brooks films as well as films with his friend Burt Reynolds. Publicist Jay Schwartz did not disclose the cause of death, but DeLuise, 75, had been battling cancer for more than a year. DeLuise was surrounded by family when he died in a Santa Monica, California, hospital Monday night, son Michael DeLuise told CNN affiliate KTLA. DeLuise was most famous for his supporting roles in a number of Mel Brooks films, including 1974's ""Saddles"" -- in which he played a flamboyant musical director who led dancers in a number called ""The French Mistake"" -- and 1976's ""Silent Movie,"" in which he played the assistant to Brooks' director Mel Funn. He was also in the Brooks-directed ""The Twelve Chairs"" (1970), ""Spaceballs"" (1987) and ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" (1993). But he could also assay more serious roles, most notably in the 1980 dark comedy ""Fatso,"" in which he played an overweight man trying to wean himself from comfort food. The film was directed by Brooks' wife, Anne Bancroft.  Watch an impromptu performance by Dom DeLuise » . DeLuise, who struggled with his own weight, was also an author of cookbooks. In 1991, he told CNN's Larry King that after meeting Luciano Pavarotti while working on an opera, he realized he needed to try to shed some of his weight. ""I finally became powerless over food,"" he told King. ""You know, anybody who's an alcoholic or cocaine or something, that's what food was to me."" Besides authoring cookbooks, DeLuise penned seven children's books. DeLuise was also part of the supporting cast in the Burt Reynolds crash-'em-up vehicles ""Smokey and the Bandit II"" (1980), ""Cannonball Run"" (1981) and ""Cannonball Run II"" (1984). Other DeLuise films include ""The End"" (1978), ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"" (1982) and ""Johnny Dangerously"" (1984). His voice was featured in such films as ""An American Tail"" (1986) and its sequels, ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" (1989) and its 1996 sequel, and ""Oliver & Company"" (1988). Dominic DeLuise was born in Brooklyn, New York, on August 1, 1933. In the 1960s he had bit parts in a handful of movies, including ""Fail Safe"" (1964), but  became well known as a regular on ""The Entertainers"" and a Dean Martin variety show. He had his own summer replacement show in 1968 and was a regular on Glen Campbell's ""Goodtime Hour"" in 1971-72.  Watch DeLuise talk about working on ""The Mike Douglas Show"" » . DeLuise had three sons -- Peter, Michael and David -- who all became actors.

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepal's prime minister said Monday he will resign to save what he called the country's ""infant democracy."" Pushpa Kamal Dahal cited a serious political crisis caused by the president's ""unconstitutional"" order. It is the latest fallout over the status of Nepal's army chief, Gen. Rookmangud Katawal. The Maoist government sacked Katawal on Sunday. Hours later, President Ram Baran Yadav reinstated him. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, commonly known as Prachanda, resigned on Monday, citing a serious political crisis caused by the president's ""unconstitutional"" order. ""The dual powers that have been unconstitutionally established in the country must end under any circumstance,"" Prachanda said in a televised address announcing he would resign from the country's Cabinet. Prachanda is the leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which had been the largest party in Nepal's coalition government until it recently withdrew. The former guerilla leader headed a decade-long bloody Maoist insurgency to abolish the country's monarchy before being sworn in as prime minister in August. In his address on Monday, Prachanda blamed certain political parties and ""power centers"" for ""striking at our democracy, constitution and the peace process by putting the president in the forefront of the controversy over the chief of army staff."" ""This has raised concerns over our infant democracy and the peace process,"" he said. ""I appeal to the people, civil society and political powers to be committed to the struggle for establishing a democratic Nepal."" Nepal's interim constitution gives the president powers as supreme commander of the army and guardian of the constitution. Yadav's spokesman said the president had the support of 18 parties in parliament when he reinstated the army chief. The decision to fire Katawal touched off protests. Supporters of both sides in the dispute took to the streets on Sunday. Despite sporadic clashes between the two factions, there were no serious injuries reported. The Cabinet voted to dismiss Katawal after the military refused the government's order to stop recruiting about 3,000 new soldiers to fill vacant positions when it has yet to take in former Maoist rebels, as a 2006 peace deal required. The Maoists laid down their arms and won power in 2008 elections after an agreement that ended a decade-long insurgency. Under the deal, more than 19,000 former insurgents were to be integrated into the country's security forces. Journalist Manesh Shrestha contributed to this report.","Government calls president's order to keep army chief in office ""unconstitutional""

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Look out for cancellation penalties. Beware of energy surcharges. And watch for facilities fees. Hertz lost $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. No, not on your airline ticket. Not on your hotel folio. You may find these new extras on your next car rental bill. Beleaguered auto rental firms are quietly adding new surcharges designed to lift revenues in a recessionary economy. To get an idea of how absurd it's becoming meet Jim Swofford. He found a mysterious $5 fee on his Hertz bill recently, which a representative described as a cancellation fee. Car rental companies typically don't charge their customers for cancellations, so Swofford, who frequently rents from Hertz, said he didn't want another car he'd reserved for later. ""That'll be $25,"" the agent told him. ""So I jokingly said I would not cancel but just be a no-show,"" he remembers. ""She said that would result in a $50 fee."" Or talk to Eric Hegwer, a photographer from Austin, Texas, who spotted a $1 ""energy surcharge"" on his Hertz car rental bill recently. ""My previous rentals didn't have one,"" he says. I asked Hertz about the two new surcharges. Company spokeswoman Paula Rivera told me the cancellation fee, which was added in December, applied only to prepaid reservations and is meant to ""reimburse Hertz for the paperwork and billing involved with a prepaid reservation."" The fee also covers part of the company's cost of holding vehicles for prepaid reservations. The energy surcharge, which was added in October, bills all rentals in most states an additional $1 a day ""to offset the increasing costs of utilities, bus fuel, oil and grease,"" she said. It's easy to see why car rental companies are taking these steps. The industry is hemorrhaging money faster than oil leaking from a cracked gasket. Hertz lost $73 million in the fourth quarter, and competitor Avis lost $121 million in the same period. They fared much better than Advantage Rent A Car, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December and whose assets were sold to Hertz for a reported $33 million. Every penny counts for the car rental companies. Then again, in this dreadful economy, who isn't counting every cent? Shocking anecdotes aside, there's a pattern here, and you don't have to be an investigative reporter or a conspiracy theory-obsessed columnist to see it. Just read the annual reports issued by one of the publicly traded car rental companies. (Look for the form 10-K and then scroll down to ""Legal Proceedings"" for an enlightening read.) They're littered with lawsuits over fees, surcharges and add-ons that motorists say broadsided them when they rented a car. A representative of the American Car Rental Association, a trade group for the car rental business, says these fees are essential to the industry's survival. But that doesn't give companies a license to surprise their customers. ""The car rental company has an obligation to clearly and concisely explain all fees and charges at the time of rental, "" says Robert Barton, the association's president and chief operating officer for U-Save Car & Truck Rental. How to stay ahead of these extras? Knowing is half the battle. Here are five of the newer charges that could sideswipe you on your next trip. A fee for something you've already paid for . This is one of the more creative new ways of separating you from your money: charging you twice for the same thing. ""Three times now, with three different companies, they have tried to charge me for gas when I've returned the car with a full tank and claimed it was an honest mistake,"" says Sid Savara, a software engineer in Oahu, Hawaii. ""It leads me to suspect they are just tacking the fee on and most people aren't noticing or complaining about it."" Boston-based author John DiPietro brought his own E-ZPass toll transponder when he rented a car in Massachusetts recently, but Budget billed him for the toll roads anyway. ""We're still trying to resolve it,"" he told me. Now more than ever, it's important to be on the lookout for duplicate charges on your rental bill. A fee for something that should come with the car . Such as tires. Enterprise recently charged one of Edgar Dworsky's readers a $2 ""tire fee."" He edits a Web site called Consumer World, and like me, he hears a lot of horror stories from travelers. What's a tire fee? Enterprise told Dworsky it was required by the state of Florida. ""I guess the consumer advice is to order a car without tires next time,"" he joked. But other fees can't be blamed on the state, including surcharges that cover the cost of oil and grease. It might be interesting to show up at a car rental counter with four tires and a can of Pennzoil, and ask to have those fees waived. You think they would do it? Yeah, neither do I. Surcharge on surcharges . Scott Lerman found a ""privilege fee"" on his last car rental in Florida, which applied to rentals picked up within 48 hours of flight arrival. ""Never seen anything like it,"" says the Livingston, New Jersey-based freelance publicist. (The fee covers the costs of operating an off-airport location.) Other renters have reported seeing a similar surcharge combined with what's often called a concession recovery fee, which amounts to a surcharge on top of a surcharge. At best, car rental companies are coming up with new and confusing names for their fees. At worst, they're charging us a fee on top of another fee. Next thing you know, there'll be a surcharge on a surcharge on top of a surcharge. Don't laugh -- I'm sure they've already thought of it. The stadium tax . Fees for new stadiums and concert halls are technically not new, and technically they're not even controlled by car rental companies. Except that municipalities keep coming up with new ones and car rental companies don't lobby hard enough to have the fees removed. So rental firms are not completely blameless. Seth Mendelsohn, the president of a food store in Boulder, Colorado, found a $4 ""downtown arena"" fee on his bill when he visited Kansas City recently. ""Apparently the city is trying to pay for part of the Sprint Center through car rental fees,"" he told me. There are dozens -- perhaps hundreds -- of these so-called stadium taxes across the country. And new ones keep popping up. One of the latest is a car rental tax in Gwinnett County, Georgia, to build a stadium for the Atlanta Braves. And just last week, legislators proposed a $2 tax to fund commuter rail service in South Florida. Extra driver fees . These aren't brand new, but the way in which they're being enforced has changed recently. When Carol Stevenson and her sister rented a car from Payless in Phoenix, they were asked to pay $9 a day more if Stevenson's sister wanted to drive. ""And that didn't include their insurance waiver,"" she remembers. Why charge for an extra driver? The simple answer: because they can. In the past, car rental agents looked the other way when two drivers showed up to rent the same car. But now, with money tight, they're applying more pressure to authorize a second driver. If you don't fork over the money and happen to get into an accident, they warn, you won't be covered by their insurance. Of course, that assumes you buy their overpriced collision-damage waiver in the first place. Odds are, your credit card or car insurance offers comparable coverage. Most of these fees can be avoided by pre-paying for your car through one of the ""opaque"" travel sites such as Hotwire.com or Priceline.com, or by buying through an online travel agency that guarantees its rates. But car rental companies are trying to find a way to stick it to customers with prepaid vouchers, too. I'll have more on that in a future column. Where will it end? Something tells me we're not there yet. Not even close. (Christopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine. This column originally appeared on MSNBC.com.

"HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (CNN) -- To feel the vibrancy of Ho Chi Minh City, all you have to do is step out onto a bustling city street. Step to it: Walking through the city's streets is the best way to see it. Negotiating the roads, chock full of motorbikes and an increasing number of cars, can be daunting. But copy the fearless locals -- they don't break stride and never retreat -- and put your fate in the hands, or throttle, of the city's drivers who seems masterful at avoiding each other. A good place to kick off a visit is on one of the main drags, Le Loi, a street that runs through the heart of the city. Near one end is the picturesque Opera House, as well as the majestic City Hall or ""People's Committee Building"" (this is still a communist country of course). You shouldn't have to do too much motorbike dodging down Lei Loi and after just a 15 minute stroll from City Hall is the famed Cho Ben Thanh Market. However give yourself more time to stop into galleries or buy a classic piece of communist propaganda along the way. The hundreds of stalls at Cho Ben Thanh offer a mix of traditional culture and tourist kitsch. You can sit with the locals and sip a solid jolt of Vietnamese coffee then move on to shopping for touristy T-shirts and ""authentic chopsticks"". Many of the stalls feature signs saying the prices are fixed. But if you're prepared to drive a hard bargain, or buy in bulk, that idea can be amended. It's also worth a return trip later on in the evening when the market closes and street side restaurants spring up, offering great meals at cheap prices. If you're looking to get away from the strip of Western hotels in the city center, hail a cab and head over to Cholon, or Ho Chi Minh City's Chinatown. In the late 18th century, this enclave was actually a separate city from old Saigon but the two were united in the early 1930's. Today Cholon is home to the Binh Tay Market, which the locals call ""Cho Lon."" Just don't confuse it with Ben Thanh, or you'll be right back where you started. The area is filled with plenty of local color and is a photographer's dream. Despite mass consumption of bottled water and the finest sunscreen, you'll need to find a way to beat the heat in Ho Chi Minh City. One of the best ways is to make regular stops at any restaurant or café for a refreshing lime soda. A bowl of the traditional Pho (pronounced ""fuh"") is also a must. It's said that this simple dish -- consisting of noodles, beef and broth -- was created at food stalls in Hanoi nearly a century ago. But even in Ho Chi Minh you need to walk only a few feet before coming across a food joint claiming to serve the city's best Pho. In a place with stifling heat and the motorbike madness, an afternoon rest is a wise move, especially if you want to partake in the nightlife. Another dose of Vietnamese coffee will surely have you revived in no time. Or, if you're in need of some pampering, try a foot massage at any of the countless establishments -- to play it safe and avoid ""additional services"" get a suggestion from any hotel concierge. Is Ho Chi Minh City the most exciting city in Asia for a short break? Have you say in the ""Sound Off"" box below. If you're keen to try to play foreign correspondent -- or at least see where they gathered during the days of the Vietnam War - look no further than the Rex Hotel on Nguyen Hue Boulevard. The drinks are wildly overpriced and the crowd seems to be on the ""5 Asian Cities in 7 Days"" tour, but its large rooftop does offer a great bird's eye view of the lively streets below. The nearby Temple Club on Ton That Thiep Street offers a quieter setting for a cocktail. Diners also give great reviews for the food. Afterwards, stroll over to Vasco's on Hai Ba Trung Street. The French colonial style building features bands playing away upstairs with large lounges on the veranda, while downstairs you can settle in for a more mellow night. If your 24 hours in Ho Chi Minh City happens to turn into 36 or 48, arrange a day trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels, about 70 kilometers Northwest of the city. The Viet Cong built this maze of passageways, which served as supply lines, during the Vietnam War. The narrow tunnels snake underground for a staggering 200 kilometers. Not only can you take a stroll, or crawl, through a few parts of it, you'll also be served a unique dose of communist propaganda. Most trips to Cu Chi also include a stop at the very colorful and unique Cao Dai Temple in Tay Ninh. If these options don't hit the mark, you can always accept an offer from one of the countless ""moto drivers."" They'll have you on the back of their bike and whizzing through the streets in no time. Just hold on tight. And maybe close your eyes.","The city is buzzing with motorbikes, so be quick to get up to speed .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama's ambitious strategy for Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan, dubbed ""Afpak"" by administration officials, will face its first test Wednesday when he meets with the leaders of both countries -- neither of which is seen as able to maintain stability and fight strengthening Islamic insurgencies. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari will meet with Afghanistan's president and President Obama. The president will meet separately with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari before holding a joint session with the two leaders. The leaders also will hold talks at the State Department, FBI, CIA and on Capitol Hill. Obama will try to build an enduring regional alliance with both countries, enlisting them as full partners rather than treating them as battlefields for U.S. soldiers to fight extremists. But both leaders are seen as weak and are deeply unpopular back home. The Taliban has re-emerged to retake large swaths of Afghanistan, and in recent weeks, Taliban fighters have made alarming advances in Pakistan. Just last week, the State Department warned that al Qaeda continues to enjoy safe haven along the rugged border between the countries, where al Qaeda plots attacks against the U.S. and its allies. U.S. concern has focused on Pakistan, which Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-New York, on Monday aptly warned has its ""pants on fire."" In Pakistan's Swat Valley, the government's recent peace deal with militants pushing for the establishment of strict Islamic law went awry, allowing the Taliban to advance within 60 miles of the capital, Islamabad. The government's initial inaction prompted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to accuse Islamabad of abdicating to terrorists. Obama also expressed concern about the fragility of Zardari's government. Richard Holbrooke, Obama's formidable point man for Afpak, insists Pakistan isn't a failed state. Yet there is plenty of concern in Washington that Zardari's government could fall, leaving Pakistan's considerable nuclear arsenal at risk. Holbrooke also played down reports the U.S. is courting Zardari's main political rival, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Rather, officials say the U.S. wants the two men to work together, which would divert Zardari's attention away from domestic political squabbles and enable him to unite the country in the fight against extremists. This is the U.S. main challenge -- persuading Pakistan to focus on what it considers a ""mortal threat,"" and not on what Obama himself has called the Pakistani military's misguided ""obsession"" with neighboring India. The Taliban advances seem to have delivered a wake-up call to the government, which has launched an offensive against the militants. To help, Obama has asked Congress to quickly approve hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency aid to help the Pakistanis combat the insurgency and is supporting a $7.5 billion civilian aid package over the next five years. Concerned about reports that the Pakistani military is working at cross-purposes and, in some cases, aiding the Taliban, Congress is trying to condition the money on progress made by Pakistani forces in rooting out extremists. A key component of the U.S. strategy is a surge in civilian assistance to boost domestic support for both governments. In an effort to promote more economic development and cooperation between the U.S. and the two countries, the ministers of agriculture and finance from both countries have been invited to Washington to join the talks. While the U.S. focus clearly has been on Pakistan, violence in Afghanistan has reached its highest levels since Taliban forces were driven from power after the U.S. invaded in the fall of 2001 in response to the 9/11 terror attacks. The U.S. wants to ensure stability in the lead-up to August elections, which is why Obama has committed 21,000 additional troops, in addition to the much needed economic assistance. Since talking office in January, Obama and other U.S. officials have been tough on Karzai, criticizing his government as ineffective and weak on corruption. Karzai further angered U.S. officials this week when he named Mohammad Qasim Fahim, a powerful warlord accused of violating human rights, as his vice presidential running mate, despite warnings from Secretary of State Clinton that Fahim would be a polarizing choice. But despite the belief by many in Washington it is time for Karzai to go, the Afghan president arrived this week in Washington virtually assured re-election, having persuaded his main opposition not to run against him. In a speech Tuesday, Karzai wisely said ""money can't buy you love"" and ""force won't buy you obedience"" Those sentiments illustrate one of the deficits in Obama's strategy. While the U.S. hopes the additional assistance will turn both leaders into reliable allies, the administration has yet to unveil a plan for communicating directly to the Afghan and Pakistani populations, both of which are skeptical of the U.S. intentions toward their countries. Additionally, the U.S. has focused its diplomacy so far on officials at the federal level, and efforts to establish strong and regular lines of communication with provincial government officials are in their infancy. That has contributed to the lack of U.S. influence in Pakistan during the Taliban's recent advances in the Northwest Frontier. Creating and implementing an effective strategy toward Afghanistan, and more importantly, Pakistan, is proving to be one of the most challenging, yet important, foreign policy issues facing the Obama administration. Wednesday's talks will be the first indicator as to whether the U.S. has two partners in what has been dubbed ""Obama's war.""

"LONDON (CNN) -- The latest video from Somalia's al Qaeda-backed Al-Shabaab wing is as slickly produced as a reality TV show but with a startling message -- complete with a hip-hop jihad vibe. Experts think Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, dubbed ""The American"" by al Qaeda, speaks in the Somali video. ""Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,"" the unidentified voice raps on the video, which runs at least 18 minutes. The video also shows a man reported to be Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, dubbed ""The American"" by al Qaeda. He apparently is now in Somalia training and counseling Somalis from North America and Europe. He speaks in American English. ""Away from your family, away from our friends, away from ice, candy bars, all those things is because we're waiting to meet the enemy,"" says the man believed to be al-Amriki.  Watch part of the video » . Intelligence experts say the video was probably made in recent weeks and comes on the heels of an audio message in March purportedly from Osama bin Laden. In that recording, the al Qaeda leader calls on his ""Muslim brothers in Mujahid Somalia"" to overthrow President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed for cooperating with the West. Al-Shabaab is the militant Islamic wing in Somalia. It means ""Youth"" in Arabic. ""We're seeing perhaps their most sophisticated attempt so far to really reach an audience of potential recruits in America, and that's one of the things that made that video very significant,"" said Ben Venzke of the IntelCenter, a Washington-based research group that tracks al Qaeda's development and messages. ""They're casting it in a way that's going to speak to the youth of today,"" Venzke said. ""Most of the time, what we're seeing in their videos directly parallels what the groups are doing operationally, what they are targeting, where they're recruiting."" Sheik Ahmed Matan knows that firsthand. A respected member of Britain's Somali community, Matan said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men who have returned to Somalia for terrorist training. ""A lot of young people from here, from America, from Canada, from everywhere from Europe -- they went there,"" he said. He added that these men are capable of being sent back home to conduct terrorist operations, even suicide bombings. ""It can be, they can train anytime and send them here, anytime,"" Matan said. Somalis from North America and Europe are beginning to come to terms with the problem of recruitment, he said. The United States and British governments say Somalia is an emerging terror hot spot, which could pose a threat beyond its borders. Matan said he often challenges ""recruiters"" at mosques and elsewhere in Britain, demanding that they stop brainwashing younger Somalis about Islam. He said the government should play a greater role in monitoring what is said and done at these mosques -- but, he concedes, doing so has proved highly controversial in Britain and throughout Europe. There is some evidence that al Qaeda is successfully preying on some of those with Western backgrounds. One of them was a business student from London who suddenly left for Somalia. He surfaced about 18 months ago on a martyrdom video, just before blowing himself up in southern Somalia, killing at least 20 people, officials say. U.S. Defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said months ago that one of their worst nightmares would be al Qaeda operating freely in Somalia. Now that nightmare continues, with Somalis in North America and Europe admitting that al Qaeda's reach is spreading. Venzke said Al-Shabaab has put out more videos than ever before in the past year. ""If that's what they're doing publicly, we can only assume how their operations have developed,"" he said.","Al Qaeda's Somali arm has hip-hop jihad rap and message from ""American""

"(CNN) -- Trains and text messages made a deadly combination when two locomotives collided head-on last year near Los Angeles, California, witnesses told an investigative panel this week. Firefighters and investigators inspect the wreckage a day after a train collision in California killed 25 people. Metrolink commuter train engineer Robert Sanchez missed a stop signal while trading text messages with a friend on September 12, leading to a collision with a Union Pacific freight train that killed Sanchez and 24 other people in Chatsworth, California. The accident injured 101 people and caused $10.6 million in damages, according to a report by federal investigators. One National Transportation Safety Board member worries other disasters loom on the nation's rail system. ""One train, one day, one crew. It raises questions for me as to what the heck else is going on out there,"" said Kitty Higgins, chairwoman of a two-day NTSB hearing in Washington on the accident. Sanchez violated his employer's safety rules by even having a cell phone in the cab of the locomotive, a supervisor testified.  Watch what investigators found » . Phone records show Sanchez was not only texting a friend just 22 seconds before the collision, but he also had made plans to allow the same friend to actually operate the train. This was a text conversation four days before the crash: . [Sanchez to friend]: ""I'm REALLY looking forward to getting you in the cab and showing you how to run a locomotive."" [Friend to Sanchez]: ""OMG dude me too. Running a locomotive. Having all of that in the palms of my hands."" [Sanchez to friend]: ""I'm gonna do all the radio talkin'...ur gonna run the locomotive & I'm gonna tell u how to do it. "" At the hearing, officials said Sanchez had been caught with a cell phone twice before. Once another employee turned him in, another time a manager called his phone to see if it was with him in the train cab. ""The engineer's cell phone rang. It was in his briefcase on the other side of the train. I told the engineer that he was in violation of our policy,"" Rick Dahl, who was a safety manager with Metrolink at the time of the accident, told the NTSB investigative panel. Federal regulations do not cover cell phone use by train crews. Records also indicate Sanchez previously had allowed unauthorized people to ride in the cab, and one person even sat at the controls while the train was operating, investigators said. Phone company records indicate the Union Pacific freight train conductor, who was not named and who survived, also sent a text message about two minutes before the collision, but no other crew member sent or received any messages while on duty, investigators said. That train crew followed all signals and other procedures properly, according to an NTSB timeline. The Metrolink train stopped at a station for 57 seconds to allow passengers to exit and board the train, according to an animation of the timeline presented at the hearing. ""The engineer is required to call all signals and indications via radio,"" Dahl testified. Sanchez did not call any of the last three signals before the crash, investigators determined. The freight train was supposed to move onto a siding to allow the Metrolink train to pass, but it never got there because the commuter train ignored a stop signal and intercepted it at a curve. The freight train was just emerging from a tunnel in the rugged Topanga Canyon, and the trains were visible to each other in the curve for only about five seconds, according to the report. At the time of impact, the Metrolink train was traveling about 42 mph and the Union Pacific train 41 mph. The freight train braked for two seconds before impact; the commuter train didn't brake at all, according to onboard data recorders. Investigators found no problems with the signals, the trains' brakes and radios or the tracks. The Union Pacific conductor's blood and urine tested positive for marijuana, but no other crew member's from either train did. A final report on the Southern California crash is months away. A month after the crash, former President Bush signed into law a bill requiring the railroad industry to implement by 2016 a rail-traffic control system akin to the familiar air-traffic control system in the nation's airports. Such a system had been on the NTSB's ""wish list"" since 1990, an agency press release said. ""Many lives will be saved as a result of this legislation,"" NTSB Chairman Mark V. Rosenker said at the time. CNN's Ted Rowlands and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","NTSB: Train engineer missed stop signal just before crash .

"(CNN) -- Terrell Owens, a former San Francisco 49er and a former Philadelphia Eagle, is now a former Dallas Cowboy. The Cowboys released Owens late Wednesday, according to published reports. The Dallas Cowboys have decided to part ways with wide receiver Terrell Owens, according to published reports. Questions surrounding the future of the controversial wide receiver have swirled since the Cowboys' season ended with a 44-6 loss at Philadelphia that kept Dallas out of the playoffs. Owner Jerry Jones had said in recent weeks that he had not decided whether to keep or release Owens. In early February, Jones struck down an ESPN report that Jones' son, Stephen, who is the team's vice president, was lobbying his father to cut the wide receiver. Owens signed a three-year, $25 million contract with Dallas in March 2006.  He signed a new four-year, $34 million deal that included a $12 million signing bonus, in June 2008. Owens finished the 2008 season 69 receptions for 1,052 yards and 10 touchdowns. In Owens' three seasons with the team, the Cowboys went 31-17, but 0-2 in the playoffs. While Owens has produced solid numbers on the field, his career has been plagued with controversy. After Owens left the San Francisco 49ers in 2003, he insinuated in an interview with Playboy magazine that his then-quarterback, Jeff Garcia, was homosexual. As a Philadelphia Eagle, Owens made headlines for coming back to play in Super Bowl XXX after suffering a severely sprained ankle and a fractured fibula weeks earlier. The following season, he voiced his displeasure with QB Donovan McNabb and Eagles management, which led to a four-game suspension without pay and his eventual deactivitation from the team. In September 2006, police responded to Owens' home after his publicist found the wide receiver unresponsive with an empty bottle of painkillers. Owens refuted reports that it was a suicide attempt and claimed a combination of painkillers and supplements made him groggy. This past season, Owens was reportedly jealous of Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo's relationship with tight end Jason Witten. According to published reports, Owens believed Romo and Witten held private meetings and created plays without including him. Published reports also said Owens had issues with Cowboys offensive coordinator Jason Garrett's play-calling. -- CNN.com's Kamal Wallace contributed to this report.","Sources: Dallas Cowboys release wide receiver Terrell Owens .

"(CNN) -- Around 200 new species of frogs have been found in Madagascar, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. A study has found nearly 200 new species of frogs in Madagascar. A study identified between 129 and 221 new species of frogs on the island. The Spanish Scientific Research Council (CSIC), who carried out the study, believe the find could practically double the number of amphibians known in the world if the results are extrapolated at a global scale. The study, published in the journal ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA,"" suggests that the number of amphibian species in Madagascar has been significantly underestimated. ""The diversity of species in Madagascar is far from being known and there is still a lot of scientific research to be done. Our data suggest that the number of new species of amphibians not only has been underestimated but it is spatially widespread, even in well studied areas,"" said Professor David R. Vieites, CSIC researcher to the press at the Spanish National Natural Sciences Museum in Madrid. ""For example, two of the most visited and studied national parks, Ranomafana and Mantadía/Analamazaotra, harbor 31 and 10 new species respectively."" Dr. Frank Glaw, curator of herpetology at the Zoologische Staatssammlung from Munich was part of the research team: ""During the past 15 years, we discovered and described over 100 new frog species from Madagascar, which led us to believe that our species inventory is almost complete. But as our new surveys show, there are many more species than we suspected,"" he said in a press statement. The paper suggests that the total biodiversity on the island could be much higher in other species as well, so the actual destruction of natural habitats may be affecting more animals than previously thought. This has important consequences for conservation planning, as the rate of destruction of rainforests in Madagascar has been one of the highest in the planet, with more than 80 percent of the historic surface of rainforest already lost, according to the study's authors. Almost a quarter of the new species discovered have not been found yet in protected areas, but the unstable political situation in Madagascar has also been cited as hampering conservation efforts. ""Although a lot of reserves and national parks have been created in Madagascar during the last decade, the actual situation of politic instability is allowing the cut of the forest within national parks, generating a lot of uncertainty about the future of the planned network of protected areas"", said Vieites. Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world and one of the most biodiverse areas globally, with a high degree of endemic species. ""To get an idea of its biodiversity --while in the Iberian Peninsula [there] are about 30 species of amphibians and in Germany about 20, in a single locality in Madagascar we can find around 100 species of frogs,"" said Vieites. Dr. Miguel Vences, professor at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, who was also part of the study team, and believes that a century of new species discovery is just beginning: ""People think that we know which plant and animal species live on this planet. But the majority of life forms on Earth is still awaiting scientific recognition.""","Nearly 200 new species of amphibians found on biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar .

"(CNN) -- The Turkish Airlines plane that crashed this week in Amsterdam fell almost vertically to the ground, making only a short track in the muddy farmer's field where it went down, Dutch investigators said Friday. Dutch investigators continue to probe the crash site for more clues. That sudden drop indicates the aircraft did not have enough forward speed when it crashed, a spokesman for the Dutch Safety Board said, but the reasons for that are still unclear. It is too early to speculate on the cause of the crash, spokesman Fred Sanders told CNN. Reports that it was caused by engine failure are premature, he said. ""There must have been ... reasons why the plane did not get enough speed,"" Sanders said. ""We don't know yet why this came about, and that's the main thing that will have to be investigated."" Wednesday's crash of Flight 1951 from Istanbul, Turkey, to Amsterdam killed nine and injured more than 60 of the 135 people on board. The crash, less than 500 yards short of the runway, split the plane into three parts.  Watch crash survivors return home » . Weather conditions at the time were favorable. Passengers described feeling the plane suddenly drop before impact, and at least one passenger said he heard the pilot trying to give more power to the engines before the plane went down. Safety Board specialists are analyzing the flight data and voice recorders and expect to finish their work at the crash site this weekend, Sanders said. Pieces relevant to the probe will be brought to a hangar at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport for further analysis.  Watch how survivors described crash » . The Safety Board may release preliminary findings next week, Sanders said. The nine dead included five Turks and four Americans, said Theo Weterings, the mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality, where the airport is located.  See where 737-800 has been involved in previous incidents » . There were four Boeing employees on the flight, and three were killed, the company said Friday in a posting on its Web site, citing the U.S. Embassy in Amsterdam as its source. The fourth employee is hospitalized. The flight's pilot, Captain Hasan Tahsin Arisan, with more than 12,000 hours in the cockpit of Boeing 737s, also died. Before becoming the pilot of passenger planes, Arisan was a Turkish Air Force squadron commander and F-4 Phantom Fighter pilot, famed for engaging in mock dog-fights with rival Greek pilots over the Aegean Sea. An airline workers union mired in an ugly labor dispute with Turkish Airlines called Friday for the resignation of the company's top management, as well as the sacking of top government ministers. Atilay Aycin, the chairman of Hava-Is which claims to represent 12,000 workers, denounced Turkish Airlines executives at a news conference Friday, accusing them of ""failing to manage a crisis"" and calling Wednesday's plane crash ""work-related murder."" A week before the accident, Hava-Is published a statement that accused Turkish Airlines management of ""inviting a disaster"" by ""ignoring the most basic function of flight safety, which is plane maintenance services."" After the crash, Turkish newspapers reported the Boeing 737 had had a series of malfunctions in the days and weeks before the fatal flight. Turkish Airlines defended its maintenance record. ""Turkish Airlines, which strictly follows its work on flight safety, followed all the maintenance procedures of the plane manufacturer [and] national and international authorities' directives for this plane,"" an airline statement said. In its news release, Turkish Airlines noted a signal light and a wing-flap had recently been replaced on the aircraft. Turkey's flagship airline is well-rated internationally for its overall safety record. Some aviation industry experts in Turkey have played down the critical comments coming from Hava-Is, calling them overheated rhetoric.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Actor Tim Roth is in an abandoned building near downtown Los Angeles, and he's about to mix things up. British actor Tim Roth plays a human lie detector on the hit series ""Lie to Me."" ""This is a scene where the FBI is interrogating a suspect,"" Roth said. ""I'm breaking into the interrogation to get information out of him using the sort of techniques that my character espouses as opposed to pressuring him."" Roth, who plays Dr. Cal Lightman on the hit Fox series ""Lie to Me,"" is shooting scenes for the season finale, which will air May 13. His character is an expert on body language and the detection of deception. ""Our series is based on the idea that we can read what's going on across your face and if it's contradicting what you're actually saying,"" Roth said. Lightman and his colleague, Dr. Gillian Foster -- played by Kelli Williams -- run ""The Lightman Group."" They observe body language and interpret what it means in order to help law enforcement agencies see through the bull. His character is based on Dr. Paul Ekman, a specialist who reads clues embedded in the human face, body and voice to expose the truth in criminal investigations. Ekman, who in 2001 was named as one of the most influential psychologists of the 20th century by the American Psychological Association, is a scientific consultant for the show. Roth says Ekman can be intimidating. ""He makes me very, very nervous, Paul, you know,"" he said. ""I mean, he's the sweetest man, as sweet as can be, but when he's around, you feel like your acting is really being judged."" Roth is perhaps best known for his outings with famed director Quentin Tarantino. The British actor pulled off a convincing American accent in the cult classics ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" He uses his true-Brit accent in ""Lie to Me,"" which debuted in January and is one of the season's few successful new dramas. In a review for Entertainment Weekly, critic-at-large Ken Tucker wrote that ""Like 'Monk' and 'Psych' and 'The Mentalist,' 'Lie' offers us an eccentric who's brought in by law enforcement to solve crimes."" Though he gave the show a B-minus, Tucker praised Roth for ""resist[ing] the cuddly/cranky."" The show has quickly found its fan base, though ratings have declined slightly since the show was put in its 8 p.m. Wednesday time slot, ahead of ""American Idol."" (The first five episodes aired after ""Idol."") ""I got stopped because one of my lights was out and I was coming back from work and the guy, the cop that stopped me said 'Oh, we watch your show' and they seemed to enjoy it,"" said Roth. ""ER"" alum Mekhi Phifer is set to join the cast as an FBI agent for two episodes this season, starting Thursday. ""I'm here to kick ass and take names, you know. So it's kind of different,"" Phifer said. ""It's fun, you know. Obviously, I carry a gun and I'm in law enforcement rather than being a doctor."" Phifer particularly likes acting in intense scenes with Roth. ""I have my own way of doing it,"" he said. ""It's a little different than the way Tim does it. It's a lot of fun, and we're having a great time."" And will time spent on the show help Phifer better detect when people are lying to him in real life? ""It's going to take a few more episodes, but I'm pretty perceptive,"" he said. Roth, however, makes no claims of special powers -- at least when he's away from the set. ""I try not to know too much, because it actually is quite extraordinary,"" he says. ""When you watch politicians on TV, you can use the stuff that Paul does to see if they're lying or not. I try not to take it home.""","British actor Tim Roth stars in the hit Fox series ""Lie to Me""

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Consumers in Beijing's malls and shops are shunning the milk and poultry sections -- for good reasons. Poultry products, including eggs, may be contaminated with melamine through animal food. They are shocked and scared by the news headlines: some food produced in China is tainted with melamine. ""Of course I'm worried,"" says a woman shopping in Nanxiaojie Market. Stop eating eggs? ""That's not possible,"" she tells CNN. ""If there's a problem with eggs, it should be solved fundamentally."" Chinese premier Wen Jiabao says China will take steps to win back consumers. ""We will use our actions and high quality of our food products to win the trust and confidence of Chinese people and people around the world,"" he told reporters at the end of a two-day summit of Asian and European leaders in Beijing last weekend.  Watch more about the tainted food scandal » . ""Three minister-level officials have resigned and a government investigation is going on. Whoever is responsible must be brought to justice. We need to protect the Made in China brand,"" said Chinese analyst Victor Gao. But the problem could be more pervasive. The state-run Nanfang Daily published an investigative story saying that adding melamine into animal feed has become an ""open secret."" The report said adding melamine into feed started in the aquatic farming industry five years ago, as a way of faking higher protein levels.  Learn more about chemical melamine » . It then spread into other agro-industries such as poultry. Even more shocking is the allegation that the melamine added is from industrial waste material. CNN contacted the Ministry of Agriculture about the story, but got no immediate response. Two years ago, reports revealed pet food exported from China to the United States was spiked with melamine and had sickened and killed dogs. Several weeks ago, the food scandal spread to milk, biscuits and candies. Now, it is tainted eggs. So far, no illnesses or deaths have been linked to eggs. Tests in Hong Kong last week showed eggs exported by a Chinese company are contaminated with excessive levels of melamine. In recent days three other brands of eggs have also been found to contain the chemical. Small wonder egg sales at the Xinfadi, a wholesale market in Beijing, dropped by 10 percent this week, according to the state-run China Daily. Chinese officials say the source of the problem is melamine, an industrial chemical used to produce plastics and fertilizer. Melamine is high in nitrogen. Unscrupulous milk suppliers would water down milk and spike it with melamine -- but in amounts that allowed it to still pass quality tests. Agriculture experts speculate that eggs tainted with melamine may be the result of tainted feed given to hens. That begs the question: if melamine was in the animal feed, will it make into the meat, and into consumers' bodies? Ingesting melamine in large doses over an extended period of time could cause kidney stones and other illnesses, agriculture and health experts say. But taking in a small amount of melamine poses no such danger. ""If it's taken over a long period of time, maybe, but if it's ingested only for short period of time it does not pose harm on animals,"" says He Jiguo, a professor of food science and nutrition at the China Agriculture University. He says the animals that end up being slaughtered do not live that long and do not actually ingest enough melamine for it to build up in their systems. The dogs and cats that were sickened in the United States were probably eating treats and meals tainted with melamine over a long period of time, he explains. Until the situation is resolved, worried grocery shoppers in Beijing say they'll just have to eat fewer eggs and more bean-products, like soybeans.","Chinese premier Wen Jiabao says China will try to win back consumers .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- If you want to peer inside your DNA, there's no shortage of companies offering avenues for doing so these days. A cheek swab or saliva sample is all firms need to scan your genes. But how much health-relevant information can they provide? The opportunity to have your complete genome mapped was recently auctioned on eBay -- with the winning bidder shelling out a cool $68,000 in the auction, which ended Monday. However, more cost-conscious consumers are more likely to send in a saliva sample to a company like Google-backed 23andMe, which will scan and analyze genetic information for about $400. The costs and services these firms offer vary widely, but they're basically chasing the same market: the customer who is curious about what their genes can tell them about themselves. Welcome to the world of personal genomics. A spate of firms -- from 23andMe and fellow Silicon Valley start-up Navigenics to Cambridge, Mass.-based Knome and Iceland's DeCode Genetics -- are vying to tap the growing interest in DNA analysis among individuals. They're upbeat about the promise of this business, saying that consumers' ability to gauge how their genes influence risk for diseases like diabetes and cancer could revolutionize health care. ""The ability to treat disease is driven by the ability to assess risk. As knowledge builds up, it will increasingly become an unacceptable position not to have your genetic profile,"" says Kari Stefansson, chief executive of DeCode, one of the first firms to offer scans that allow individuals to examine their genomes. But analysts and researchers are a bit more cautious. While there's plenty of potential for retail genomics, they say the budding market is still in its early stages. Have you bought a retail DNA test? Share your story on iReport . Companies that offer personal DNA analysis have attracted the interest of individuals who are highly concerned with their health, as well as so-called early adopters who are enamored with new technologies. But the outlook for business opportunities is still hazy, mostly because there isn't a full understanding of the benefit of these tests in terms of identifying how and why diseases occur in people, according to Jonathan Witonsky, a health care analyst at consulting firm Frost & Sullivan.. Just how much health-relevant information consumers can glean remains hotly debated in the research community. Studies suggest that common maladies like heart disease and diabetes may result from the variations of several genes, rather than the single variants that many retail gene tests scan for. David Goldstein, head of the Center for Human Genome Variation at Duke University, believes that given the current knowledge of how genes influence disease, there is only a ""recreational"" use for retail tests. Like many other researchers, he believes the odds identified by these tests can be so marginal that they have a weak effect on health when compared to lifestyle or environmental factors. If someone wants to lower their risk for diabetes, for instance, they're better off exercising more and changing their diet than getting a retail gene test, Goldstein told CNN. Consumer genomics firms agree there is still much to be discovered, but they say providing consumers with the knowledge that is available to them is better than none at all. ""It is an evolving science. To ignore the genetic markers that we currently understand would be complacency,"" says Vance Vanier, chief medical officer at Navigenics, which is backed by venture capital heavyweights Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital. Linda Avey, co-founder of 23andMe, says arming people with information may help them turn their attention to prevention. ""We think making this data available to people will help people focus their behavior and lifestyle."" Companies are adjusting their services as new research becomes available, says Daniel MacArthur, a UK-based genetics researcher who follows the consumer genomics market on his blog, Genetic Future. ""Right now, the genome scans offered by companies like 23andMe focus on common genetic variants, and don't pick up most rare variants like Huntington's disease mutations,"" he said. However, several companies are now beginning to add these rare, severe disease mutations into their tests, MacArthur said. The market may also get a boost as costs for complete genome sequencing continue to drop. Privately funded Knome currently charges $99,500 to map a complete genome. But many scientists foresee complete sequencing eventually falling to just $1,000. As it becomes more cost effective to conduct larger research studies, they anticipate discovering more medically relevant information. Being able to identify ahead of time whether you're at risk of disease is something that can be beneficial going forward,"" says Bill Buhr, an analyst at investment research firm Morningstar. He expects sales of services for testing genetic make-up to hit $1 billion in three years. ""As the technology gets better, this potentially could be something more people get into,"" he said. Although Buhr, who covers DeCode, one of the few firms in the space that's publicly listed, said the outlook for the Icelandic firm was bleak. DeCode has been hit by the credit crisis, fueling chatter it's headed for bankruptcy. However Stefansson dismissed that speculation and told CNN the company expects to complete its restructuring by the end of May. It's too early to say whether consumer genomics is going mainstream, 23andMe's Avey says. But there's no denying there's tremendous interest among consumers. ""It goes [back] to human nature. We're very curious about ourselves.""","Handful of firms from 23andMe to DeCode offer DNA tests to individuals .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A 22-year-old medical student suspected of killing a woman he may have met through a Craigslist online ad was arraigned Tuesday and will be held without bail. Medical student Philip Markoff, 22, appears in court Tuesday in Boston, Massachusetts. Philip Markoff, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, listened intently but did not speak during the hearing in Boston Municipal Court. Dressed in a blue-striped shirt and slacks, Markoff was handcuffed and wearing leg irons. His attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is ""not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything."" A woman identifying herself as Markoff's fiancee also maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News. Megan McAllister said Markoff ""is the wrong man"" and ""was set up."" ""Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public,"" McAllister wrote. ""All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!"" She accused Boston police of ""trying to make big bucks by selling this false story to the TV stations. What else is new??"" Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley told reporters, ""This was a brutal, vicious crime -- savage. And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them."" A procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, Conley said. A Boston University spokeswoman said the school suspended Markoff, who has no criminal record, when it learned of the charges on Monday. Markoff is charged with killing 26-year-old Julissa Brisman of New York on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Evidence from the scene suggests that Brisman ""put up a fight,"" prosecutor Jennifer Hickman said during the hearing Tuesday. Police said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service. She sustained blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said. Markoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a Westin Hotel. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, Hickman said in court Tuesday. Police said earlier the Westin victim was 29. She was not identified. Authorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters, and she was killed during a struggle. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.  Watch police say assailant has perused Craigslist ads » . Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who sought public assistance identifying the man. Police traced the Internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in Quincy, Massachusetts, he said. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and ""the case just begins to build from there."" ""This poor woman, Julissa Brisman, no matter what choices she made or decisions she made in life, she is a human being who's entitled to dignity and respect,"" Conley said. There may be more victims that authorities are unaware of, he said, adding that the prosecutor's goal is to hold Markoff accountable, not to pursue women who may be advertising on Craigslist. ""If you have been a victim like these victims have, please come forward,"" he said. Markoff is ""bearing up,"" according to attorney Salsberg. ""It's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him. ... He's pleaded not guilty. He is not guilty,"" said Salsberg. McAllister, in her e-mail to ABC, wrote, ""Philip is an intelligent man who is just trying to live his life, so if you could leave us alone we would greatly appreciate it. We expect to marry in August and share a wonderful, meaningful life together."" The couple's wedding Web site had been taken down or was unavailable as of Tuesday afternoon. Authorities in Boston are working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, on what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney said. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, McCartney said. He said no conclusions could be made yet, but allowed that the incident ""may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area."" Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster told CNN the company is ""horrified and deeply saddened that our community services have been associated in any way whatsoever with a crime of violence."" He promised that Craigslist will evaluate the incident to see if additional measures could be introduced to protect users. CNN's Mary Snow and Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","Not-guilty plea entered in Philip Markoff's behalf in woman's slaying in Boston .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Safety advocates are fighting efforts to allow tractor-trailers to carry heavier loads on highways, saying the trucks are already too dangerous. But at least one group says adding an axle would improve safety margins so such loads can be carried. Mark and Tracy Quinichett, whose daughter was killed in a wreck, speak Monday against raising trucks' load limits. ""It is a public health crisis,"" policy activist Joan Claybrook said Monday, announcing a petition drive to fight larger loads that could be authorized as part of a transportation bill moving through Congress. At a Monday news conference, Claybrook -- who chaired the National Highway Transportation Administration during the Carter administration -- and her Truck Safety Coalition presented several families who have lost a loved one to a highway accident involving commercial trucks. A new Web site from the coalition, StopBiggerTrucks.org, provides statistics the group believes will persuade people to pressure lawmakers to leave truck limits as they stand. But an industry group, the Coalition for Transportation Productivity, hopes lawmakers will approve a proposal to add an axle to today's big rigs -- an action it says will allow higher load limits and lead to safer roads. Adding an axle would give big rigs 22 wheels, up from the current 18. Without the change, ""more trucks will have to take to the road"" to handle rising cargo demand, said John Runyan, co-chairman of the truck cargo industry group. Runyan was at the back of the room during the other group's news conference, where families gave tearful accounts of losing loved ones in truck wrecks. One of those couples, Mark and Tracy Quinichett, lost their 21-year-old daughter a few months ago when a truck's wheel flew off and crashed through the windshield of her car on the Capital Beltway outside Washington. ""The larger the trucks -- it's just so much more dangerous. And if they are allowed to make these trucks larger, it's going to be a real, real problem, even more than it is right now,"" Mark Quinichett said. Runyan told CNN that going from 18 wheels to 22 wheels would allow for the safe transportation of heavier loads because the weight would be more evenly distributed.","A petition drive is fighting effort to let trucks carry larger loads .

"(Mental Floss) -- Although you probably use it every day, here's some interesting trivia you may not know about deodorant. Actor Matthew McConaughey reportedly doesn't wear deodorant. 1. Be thankful for your foul body odor. According to anthropologist Louis Leakey, it might be responsible for early man's survival. Leakey's theory claims that most predators avoided feasting on humans because our body odor was ""too repugnant."" 2. Not only did the ancient Egyptians give us pyramids and flush toilets, they also pioneered the field of deodorants. Egyptians were the first to popularize the idea of applying scents to armpits, usually using cinnamon and other spices that wouldn't turn rancid in the heat. 3. The Roman poet Ovid preferred a more proactive solution. In Book III of the Art of Love, he cautions women against carrying goats under their arms. 4. Antiperspirants are classified as drugs by the FDA. Technically, they affect and/or alter your body's natural functions. 5. The first modern brand of antiperspirant, EverDry, hit drugstores in 1903. The original formula was so acidic that it regularly ate through clothing. 6. Of course, modern antiperspirants can also ruin your clothing. Aluminum chloride, the ingredient that blocks glandular openings and prevents sweating, is notorious for turning T-shirts yellow. So, blame your antiperspirant for your pit stains, not your body. 7. Offensive body odor is actually illegal in libraries in San Luis Obispo County, California.  Mental Floss: Weird wedding laws still on the books . 8. One thing modern antiperspirants don't do is cause degenerative diseases. Medical science has found no conclusive evidence that absorbing aluminum chloride through the skin can lead to memory loss or slurred speech. 9. Aoki, a Japanese company known for its menswear, has developed a deodorant suit that supposedly absorbs sweat and neutralizes odors all over the body. 10. But that's nothing! The greatest Japanese innovation in the fight against B.O. is Fuwarinka scented gum. The so-called ""functional candy"" contains aromatic compounds that cause your skin to release ""Fresh Citrus"" or ""Fruity Rose"" aromas for up to 6 hours after chewing. 11. When Kurt Cobain wrote the lyrics for Nirvana's breakout song ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" he didn't know Teen Spirit was a popular deodorant brand. The Mennen Company, which produced the deodorant, wouldn't say whether the song caused sales to spike, but six months after the single debuted, Colgate bought the company for $670 million. Mental Floss: 7 food promotions gone horribly wrong . 12. In May 2008, actor Matthew McConaughey revealed that he never uses deodorant or antiperspirant. The next day, he received a year's supply of deodorant body spray from the Axe Company, along with a note on why he might want to start. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Two Americans banned from entering the United Kingdom because the government feels they have been ""stirring up hatred"" responded by slamming the country's home secretary, and one of them threatened to sue her. Jacqui Smith said she did not hesitate to name and shame those who foster extremist views. Radio talk show host Michael Savage and the anti-gay Rev. Fred Phelps were listed Tuesday among white supremacists and radical Islamic clerics who will not be allowed into the country. Savage, whose conservative daily show can be heard on radio stations across America, lashed out in an audio clip on his Web site and devoted seven stories on his main page to the ban. He is listed under his real name, Michael Alan Wiener. Britain's Home Office said it decided to exclude the 22 people on the list after measures by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith last year targeting people ""who have engaged in spreading hate."" ""She has painted a target on my back, linking me with people who are in prison for killing people,"" Savage said. ""How could they put Michael Savage in the same league as mass murderers when I have never avowed violence?""  Watch more about Savage's reaction » . According to the British Home Office, Savage is on the list for ""seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence."" Smith said she is determined to keep those who ""spread extremism, hatred and violent messages"" out of the country. ""Coming to the UK is a privilege, and I refuse to extend that privilege to individuals who abuse our standards and values to undermine our way of life,"" Smith said. ""Therefore, I do not hesitate to name and shame those who foster extremist views, as I want them to know that they are not welcome here. The Home Office named only 16 people on the list, saying it was not in the public interest to disclose the names of the other six. Savage called Smith a ""witch"" in the audio clip and asked why six names on the list weren't released. He also questioned why North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez didn't make the list. Savage said he has seven attorneys working on a defamation lawsuit against Smith and encouraged his listeners to call off any travel plans to England and boycott all British products. Savage's show is not syndicated in England. The outspoken Kansas Rev. Fred Phelps and his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, also made the list for ""engaging in unacceptable behavior and fostering hatred."" Phelps did not issue a response on his Web site. However, the site linked to a British news story on the ban and the link called Smith a ""neo-Nazi dyke"" and ""filthy God-hater."" Phelps and his followers at Topeka's Westboro Baptist Church oppose homosexuality. They picket the funerals of soldiers killed in Iraq, saying their deaths are God's way of punishing the United States for supporting homosexuals. They have expressed similar views about the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The church's slogan is ""God Hates Fags."" Also on the list: . • Former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Don Black, who established the white supremacist Web site Stormfront, which the Home Office called one of the oldest and largest hate group sites. • Eric Gliebe, chairman of the National Alliance, one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the United States. The Home Office accused Gliebe of ""justifying terrorist violence, provoking others to commit serious crime and fostering racial hatred."" • Samir al Quntar, a Lebanese man who spent three decades in prison for killing four Israeli soldiers and a 4-year-old girl in 1979. Al Quntar is listed for ""engaging in unacceptable behavior by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence"" in order to provoke terrorist acts, the Home Office said. • Nasr Javed, a leader of the Kashmiri militant group, Lashkar e Taiba. • Islamic clerics Abdul Ali Musa, Abdullah Qadri Al Ahdal, Amir Siddique, Yunis Al Astal and Safwat Hijazi. • Wadgy Abd El Hamied Mohamed Ghoneim, whom the Home Office describes as a prolific writer and speaker. The Home Office said he has sought ""to foment, justify or glory terrorist violence in furtherance of particular beliefs and to provoke others to commit terrorist acts."" • Mike Guzofsky, the leader of a militant Jewish group who also has ties to Kahane Chai, a group that the U.S. State Department lists as a foreign terrorist organization. • Russian skinheads Artur Ryno and Pavel Skachevsky, whom the Home Office said are ""leaders of a violent gang that beat migrants and posted films of their attacks on the Internet.""","Talk show host asks why Hugo Chavez, Kim Jong Il not on list .

"CRANWELL, England (CNN)  -- Britain's oldest man and the oldest living veteran of World War I was celebrating his 112th birthday Friday with a party and a fly-past at an air force base. Henry Allingham at a 90th anniversary celebration of the Royal Air Force this year. Henry Allingham is the last surviving member of the Royal Naval Air Service, which he joined in 1915. He saw action at the Battle of Jutland off Denmark the following year, according to the Ministry of Defense. Allingham is also the last surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force, which was created in 1918, nine months before the end of the war. He left the service a year later, the defense ministry said. Friday's events were happening at the Royal Air Force base in Cranwell, England, about 120 miles north of London. Friends of his at the base said Allingham, who arrived in a wheelchair, was looking ""fresh."" After a birthday lunch, aircraft from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, an aerial display team, planned to fly overhead, the base said. Members of the Falcons Parachute Display Team then planned to drop in and present Allingham with a birthday card from the chief of Britain's air staff. Allingham is Britain's oldest man and the oldest surviving member of the armed forces, according to Guinness World Records. The former aircraft engineer still travels and makes public appearances at military events and commemorations. In July, Allingham had a private audience with Queen Elizabeth and attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace. In November, he laid a wreath in St. Omer, France -- where he was stationed during the war -- to celebrate Armistice Day, the end of World War I. Allingham said last year that he remains active to emphasize the importance of remembering the conflict. ""I don't do these things because I enjoy doing them but to keep the memory alive of all my comrades who fought and died in the First World War,"" he told the Ministry of Defense.","Britain's oldest man, oldest veteran from World War I, celebrates his 112th birthday .

"(CNN) -- A fourth man was charged Tuesday with murder in the shooting death of University of Memphis football player Taylor Bradford, Memphis police said. Devin Jefferson, 21, planned the armed robbery of Bradford because he thought the football player was carrying a large amount of cash, police said. ""He was the brain trust on this one, he was the one that got the information that Taylor had cash,"" Sgt. Vince Higgins said. ""Taylor and Jefferson knew each other. They had a girlfriend in common so there was some history there."" Police investigating a car crash on September 30 found Bradford, 21, fatally wounded near the campus residence hall area. He had apparently gotten into his car after he was shot and drove a short distance before crashing into a tree. The 5-foot-11, 300-pound defensive lineman from Nashville was taken to Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. DaeShawn Tate, 21, Victor Trezevant, 21, and Courtney Washington, 22, have been charged with murder in perpetration of attempted aggravated robbery, Memphis Police Department Director Larry Godwin said Monday. Homicide investigators developed their case with the help of a citizen's tip and from Crimestoppers, Godwin said. ""It was an attempted robbery, aggravated robbery,"" he said. ""He [Bradford] was targeted because of some information that was out there and the fact that they believed he had some cash, or he had something that they wanted."" Officials at the 21,000-student school said Bradford, a marketing major who lived on campus, was popular with the football team and on the campus. He had transferred from Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, and was 36 credit hours short of graduation.

"(CNN) -- Comic and best-selling author Joy Behar appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Wednesday. Joy Behar and her co-hosts on ""The View"" were recently named on the Time 100 most influential list. ""The View"" co-host discussed a variety of topics, including the Miss California USA pageant, her feud with Donald Trump and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's political future. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: It looks like Donald Trump has made up with Barbara (Walters). How are you and Donald now? Joy Behar: You would not believe how friendly he was to me today at ""The View."" The man was all over me. First of all, in the green room after the show, he actually kissed me. I don't think that he kisses anybody. He came up to me and he actually kissed me and hugged me. It was weird. King: Because he criticized you, as you know, in the past. Behar: Well, he said that you hit me hard and so I went back at you. I don't remember even what I said. I made a joke about his hair, I think. But, you know, I'm done with that anyway. It's an old story. I'm not interested in his hair anymore, and we're fine.  Watch Behar dish » . King: What did you make of (the controversy with Miss California USA), Joy? Behar: This Miss California girl, I think she's doing great. I mean who even thinks of Miss USA? Nobody even knows Miss USA exists. She's got a great career ahead of her now, where everybody sees how gorgeous she is. She's winning the race, believe me, and with new boobs. Who can ask for anything more? King: What do you think of the fact that your program made the (Time magazine) most influential list? View the list . Behar: That is my favorite, that we are on the most influential list. I never thought I would see this day. I just feel like good, now I can have some influence on Ahmadinejad, (Benjamin) Netanyahu. Maybe I can have some influence on the world. King: Elizabeth Edwards, as we all know, is battling breast cancer, coping with the fallout of her husband's infidelity, selling a new book, too. What do you make of that whole situation, Joy? Behar: You know, what is it with these political wives who love to stand by their men? I happen to like Elizabeth Edwards very much. She's been on the show and I've met her a couple of times. She's a really nice person, and he's a dog, you know? Let's tell it like it is. He's a dog and people do not like him. I think his political career is over, and it's disappointing because he was a decent Democrat. He had his heart in the right place. He was a good liberal, and now he's out of the picture. Although it didn't stop Newt Gingrich, who also told his wife he wanted a divorce when she was in the hospital. So, you know, bad taste, I guess, doesn't hurt all of their careers. So we never know what's going to happen to him. I just feel bad for her. King: Let's move to another politician, Sarah Palin. What's your read on the governor? Behar: Well, you know, they're talking about her as the new Republican Party. If that's what they want for their new Republican Party, that's fine -- somebody who doesn't believe in a woman's choice, someone who doesn't believe in evolution, someone who is,  you know, loves to hunt and kill animals or whatever. I don't know what her reasoning is. Then fine. ... And doesn't really believe in global warming. She and Rush Limbaugh constantly are talking about how there's no problem. I mean this guy, Rush Limbaugh, I used to work with him years ago, and I've sort of been friendly with him in a certain weird kind of way. He constantly is talking about how there is no global warming. Every climatologist in the world says there's global warming. Every scientist has said there is a problem. We're all on this Earth together and this guy goes out and says that there's no global warming. Who is he? What is he talking about and who are these ditto heads that agree with him, I'd like to know? Aren't they breathing the same air that we are? King: Do you think Palin will be a presidential (candidate)? Do you think she's going to get up pretty close to getting that nomination? Behar: Oh, I hope so. I would love to see that, because whoever is running against her, that's going to be, you know, a slam dunk, in my opinion. Because every time the woman is in an interview, she shows herself to be very, very shallow -- you know, as they say, stunningly superficial on another network. So, let her run.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Hydroxycut products, popular dietary supplements used for weight loss, have been linked to liver damage and are being recalled, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday. The FDA has received 23 reports of serious liver injuries, including a death, linked to Hydroxycut products. The FDA said it has received 23 reports of serious liver injuries linked to Hydroxycut products, which are also used as energy enhancers and as fat burners. The reports include the 2007 death of a 19-year-old man living in the Southwest, which was reported to the FDA in March. Other serious liver problems reported included liver damage that resulted in a transplant in 2002, liver failure, jaundice, seizures and cardiovascular problems. The FDA is warning consumers to immediately stop using 14 Hydroxycut products manufactured by Iovate Health Sciences Inc. of Oakville, Ontario, and distributed by Iovate Health Sciences USA Inc. of Blasdell, New York. The company is voluntarily recalling the following products: Hydroxycut Regular Rapid Release Caplets, Hydroxycut Caffeine-Free Rapid Release Caplets, Hydroxycut Hardcore Liquid Caplets, Hydroxycut Max Liquid Caplets, Hydroxycut Regular Drink Packets, Hydroxycut Caffeine-Free Drink Packets, Hydroxycut Hardcore Drink Packets (Ignition Stix), Hydroxycut Max Drink Packets, Hydroxycut Liquid Shots, Hydroxycut Hardcore RTDs (Ready-to-Drink), Hydroxycut Max Aqua Shed, Hydroxycut 24, Hydroxycut Carb Control and Hydroxycut Natural.  Watch more on the FDA's concern » . According to the FDA, last year, Iovate sold more than 9 million units of Hydroxycut products, which were distributed widely to grocery stores, health food stores and pharmacies. ""The FDA urges consumers to discontinue use of Hydroxycut products in order to avoid any undue risks. Adverse events are rare, but exist. Consumers should consult a physician or other health care professional if they experience symptoms possibly associated with these products,"" said Dr. Linda Katz, interim chief medical officer of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. Liver damage is rare, but patients who experienced problems were taking doses recommended on the product label, the FDA said. Symptoms include brown urine, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, stomach pain, itching and light-colored stools. The FDA has not determined what specific ingredients are responsible for the problems, because the products contain a variety of overlapping ingredients and herbal extracts. Dietary supplements sold before October 1994 are not required to undergo any FDA review before going to market. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 required manufacturers to ensure a supplement to be safe before marketing. But manufacturers still don't need to register a product with the FDA or get approval before selling a supplement. The agency can take action against an unsafe supplement once it's on the market. Since December 2007, any serious adverse event reported to the manufacturer must now be reported to the FDA within 15 days. The Council for Responsible Nutrition, the leading trade association representing the dietary supplement industry, said that both the FDA and Iovate ""took appropriate action today."" ""We commend FDA for warning consumers of a potential safety problem associated with these products, and were encouraged to see that the company -- Iovate Health Sciences -- agreed to recall the products from the market until further determinations can be made,"" said Steve Mister, the council's president and CEO.","FDA recalls Hydroxycut products after 23 liver injuries and one death .

"(CNN)  -- A man suspected of killing five members of his family and wounding another on Thursday committed suicide after police surrounded him in a house, police in Cleveland, Ohio, said Friday. Police say Davon Crawford, 33, killed his new wife, her sister and three children. Acting on a tip, police surrounded the house and then entered it after seeing a man who matched the description of suspect Davon Crawford briefly step outside, police spokesman Lt. Thomas Stacho said. ""They confronted the male hiding in a bathroom,"" Stacho said. ""When he spotted the agents, then he took his own life."" Cleveland police launched a manhunt Thursday for Crawford, 33, suspected of killing his new wife, Lechea Crawford, 30; her sister, Rose Stevens, 25; and three of Stevens' children, Destiny Woods, 5, and 2-year-old twins Dion and Davion Primm. A 7-year-old boy was shot and hospitalized, Julie Short, a spokeswoman for MetroHealth Medical Center, said Friday. The boy's grandfather told CNN affiliate WEWS that the boy was in stable condition and talking after having been shot in the shoulder. A fourth child, a 12-year-old boy, managed to escape, WKYC reported. The Cleveland Plain Dealer also reported that a 2-month-old girl, the daughter of Davon and Lechea Crawford, escaped the shooting unharmed and is being cared for. Police began searching for Crawford, 33, Thursday night after receiving a call around 8 p.m. to the upper floor of a duplex.

"(CNN) -- Elisabeth Hasselbeck, co-host of ""The View"" and author of the new book, ""The G-Free Diet,"" spoke Wednesday with Larry King. Elizabeth Hasselbeck, of ""The View,"" says Bristol Palin is an ideal choice to speak about teen abstinence. Hasselbeck offers her thoughts on being the sole conservative on her show, Elizabeth Edwards dealing with her husband's infidelity, Bristol Palin being abstinence spokeswoman and her battle with celiac disease. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: Were you surprised that ""The View"" made the most influential list of Time magazine? Elisabeth Hasselbeck: I sure was. I think it's truly a tribute to what Barbara (Walters) has done and the show that she created along with Bill Geddie, our executive producer. It's a great place for women to come to and listen -- men, as well. But, also, for us to get there every day and discuss everything from politics to motherhood and parenting. But it was a shock. I think any time you receive an honor such as that, it's shocking.  Watch Hasselbeck defend Bristol Palin » . King: As the definitive conservative in the group, do you feel like the outcast? Do you feel put upon? Hasselbeck: I never feel like an outcast there. If anything, I feel more included than ever. I mean, truly that is a table where respect is number one, in terms of we sort of have a vow to one another. And we couldn't come there every single day and talk about the things that -- that we discuss and have the debates that we do and get as fiery as we do and get back there the next day if there wasn't that respect at the table and true value for the others' opinion. I mean the more we tend to disagree, I think the more we sort of dig deeper into that relationship. King: So the anger doesn't carry over? Hasselbeck: No. I wouldn't even classify it as anger. I think it's passion, and I think it's passion with purpose. You know, we do believe different things at times. Occasionally, we agree. It may not be that interesting when we do, but there is passion. It is coming from different places, but we love that conversation. I love being able to hear someone else's opinion on a subject and maybe sort of, you know, push a button here and there and see what they think about what I have to say. King also talked with Hasselbeck about Bristol Palin, the daughter of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, being a spokeswoman for abstinence. King: What do you make of that choice? Hasselbeck: I think she's the perfect choice. She has a tangible, living example of what this new responsibility is in her life. I believe that there is a sort of sadistic giddiness on the part of some true radical leftists, who are laughing behind-the-scenes about Bristol Palin's situation. Why are they so obsessed with her being a spokesperson for this? She's promoting a great thing -- abstinence. Find me something else that works 100 percent of the time. King: Elizabeth Edwards has gone public about her pain about her husband's infidelity. Yesterday on this show, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Joy Behar, your compatriot, called John Edwards a dog. Do you agree? Hasselbeck: You never understand the intimacies of someone's relationship with their spouse -- I mean or boyfriend, partner, etc. Those are places that only the two people truly understand. I think we're also looking at a woman of incredible strength, having looked at cancer and battled through. I believe that nothing, truly, can compare to that. And, you know, it's unfortunate. I think this alleged affair and, you know, disturbance, even in terms of allegedly funding his mistress' foundation, is even more complicating the matter. The idea of another child in the mix (is) disturbing as well. King: Elisabeth, Miss California USA Carrie Prejean -- first, the controversy over gay marriage statements and now scandal over semi-nude modeling photos of her. What do you think of the way she's being treated in the media? Hasselbeck: Well, I think there's a very specific witch hunt going on here because she expressed her opinion. So now we're going to dig and throw fear into the heart of any person who may want to freely express their opinion in the United States of America. That seems like a big bullying scheme to me. If she had answered the other way, would anyone have been searching for those photos? Would they want to vilify her or remove what she's been working for? I don't understand the pageant well, and I don't know what her responsibilities were. Was she to represent the state of California in her opinions and was she to represent the opinions of a young woman who believed in her heart one thing? That's her personal opinion. I'm not sure what her duties were or were to be. I do know this, though. I'm not sure this investigation into any sort of photos or background or family members that they're pulling out of left and right would have even occurred if she had given an answer on the other side. So it seems to me a bit of a bullying scheme, as I said before, and that disturbing. We should be able to have our opinions in this country and stand by them and at least be respected, at the very least. Later in the interview King talked with Hasselbeck about her new book, ""The G-Free Diet: A Gluten-Free Survival Guide."" King: Now, (when) we think of gluten, we think of wheat, right? Hasselbeck: Well, it's actually more than that. Gluten is a protein found in barley, oats, wheat and rye. It's more broad than most people actually think, so that is definitely a misconception out there. This has been a decade-long process for me. I have celiac disease, and I say out of diabetes came that low glycemic index diet and out of my celiac disease, I found this all-star diet. I call it my ""diet in the rough"" because it is something that, even if I didn't have celiac disease, like many others, I would follow this diet. You know, over 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with IBS, thyroid issues. I was having infertility problems. People suffer miscarriage after miscarriage, stillbirth. It eventually leads to intestinal cancer. This is something that needs to be treated. But the diet is actually, yes, for people with celiac disease, for millions with food intolerance that is up like 25 percent in the past five years (and) for people who just want a healthy lifestyle. I mean I'm on this diet before I'm pregnant, during pregnancy and when I'm trying to get back in my bikini to, you know, strut around in the summer.","Elisabeth Hasselbeck says ""radical leftists"" laughing at Bristol Palin's situation .

"(CNN) -- ""Get yourself together."" Mary Williams repeated those three words often to her 28-year-old daughter, who served three years in a Kansas prison for a 1988 armed robbery. Donnie Belcher, 7, visits her mother, Wanda Taylor, at Lansing Correctional Facility in Kansas in 1991. Williams never judged her daughter, Wanda Taylor, for the crime or the crack cocaine addiction that fueled it. There was no need to pick at the past. Instead, Williams looked to the future. The future was her granddaughter, Donnie Belcher, a shy 4-year-old girl with curly hair who cried inconsolably from behind the glass the first time she visited her mother in jail. The little girl's mother was locked up for three years, leaving her in the care of her grandmother. ""It was hard on me,"" said Belcher, now 25. ""I never wanted to leave my mother."" Belcher defied the odds, growing up straight as an arrow despite having a mother in prison. Her childhood was part of a national trend. The incarceration rates for U.S. mothers began to surge in the 1980s, fueled by the crack cocaine epidemic and tougher mandatory sentencing laws, experts said. A recent study by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found the number of incarcerated mothers rose 131 percent from 1991 to 2007, while the number of fathers in prison increased 77 percent during the same period. According to the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based nonprofit, about 1.7 million children have a parent in prison. ""We should be alarmed,"" said Georgia Lerner, executive director at the Women's Prison Association, a national nonprofit working with incarcerated women. ""Even when children have seen their mothers get arrested, they still want to be with their parents,"" Lerner said. ""They still love their mothers and want to be together."" While some critics argue that criminals make poor parents, experts said there is no doubt that separation from a parent, particularly a mother, affects a child's psychological development. When a father is imprisoned, the mother typically cares for the children, said Danielle Dallaire, a psychology professor at the College of William and Mary.  But her research shows that when a mother is incarcerated, the father often plays no role in raising the children left behind. Federal statistics show children are five times more likely to end up in foster care when a mother is sent to prison than when a father is imprisoned. Read the Federal Report . Belcher's grandmother, Williams, stepped in because she didn't want the child in foster care. The girl's father was not in the picture. For three years, Williams, a single mother herself, drove her granddaughter twice a month to see her mother. They never missed a visit, despite having to travel to several prisons across Kansas. After passing through the metal detectors and being frisked by security officers, the girl showed off the A's she received from school or told her mother about which boy had cooties. Each visit lasted two hours. Belcher often asked, ""When will you come home?"" ""Soon,"" her mother said. ""Soon.""  Find out what Taylor and her family learned from her time in prison » . A growing number of prisons are recognizing the need to preserve mother-child relationships. They have staffed nurseries and day care centers to keep families connected. Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a maximum security women's prison in New York, is host to an annual summer camp run by volunteers. At camp, children can play basketball and participate in other activities with their incarcerated mothers. In May, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reuniting moms and dads with their children. The ""Get on the Bus"" program provides 700 children with free rides to the prisons. The three years without Taylor were financially difficult for Williams, who was approaching retirement age. In her 50s at the time, she worked as a dental assistant to support her granddaughter. She poured all her time and effort into the quiet little girl. She packed her schedule with Girl Scouts and free summer camps, determined to make sure her granddaughter stayed out of trouble. ""Kids would tease me and say to me, 'Why is your mom so old?' "" Belcher recalled. Belcher was elated on May 29, 1991, when her mother returned to their home in Kansas City, Missouri, after serving three years of an eight-year sentence. Taylor got sober and attained her GED behind bars. She returned to find her 7-year-old daughter blossoming into her polar opposite. The girl put her head into books and graced the honor roll regularly. She didn't rebel. ""I wanted to be everything my mother wasn't,"" Belcher said. ""I loved my mom, but I couldn't do what she did."" ""I did it all,"" said Taylor, now 48. By 13, she skipped school frequently to attend ""hooky parties"" where she used drugs and alcohol. By 16, she dropped out of high school. ""When you're out there, you're out there."" The years after Taylor's release from prison also were tough on the mother-daughter relationship. As an adolescent, Belcher battled feelings of bitterness toward her mother and feared her mother would relapse. ""I felt angry,"" Belcher said, and the anger only grew during her high school years. ""It wasn't fair to me. Why did I have to have a mother like that?"" Belcher threw herself into academics and excelled. She knew that many children without parents often end up in trouble and behind bars themselves. She didn't want that for herself. ""She had a life where she could have just gave up, but she didn't do that,"" said Williams, now 71. ""She went straight ahead."" By 13, she was writing poetry. By 16, she was a track star at her high school and at the top of her class. She entered DePaul University in 2002 with nearly 50 scholarships. Belcher is a high school English teacher at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, a college preparatory school that boasts alums like Michelle Obama. She has a cozy apartment in Chicago, Illinois -- her first home that is all her own. This summer, she will apply for grants to start her own nonprofit to help children of incarcerated parents stay out of trouble. Belcher said she admires her mother's resilience. She watched her search tirelessly for a job, despite her felony record. She is proud of her mother, who worked her way up to become a successful child care operator for the state of Minnesota after years of working in factories and fast food restaurants. Today, her mother resides in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and her grandmother still lives in Kansas City, Missouri. ""You can't always control life's circumstances, but you can control how you react to them,"" Belcher said. Her mother and grandmother will visit Belcher this weekend to celebrate completion of her master's degree -- and Mother's Day.","Donnie Belcher's mother was incarcerated when she was 4 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A second lingerie-modeling photo of Miss California USA Carrie Prejean has appeared after she assured pageant officials this week that the earlier shot was the only one she had appeared in. Miss California USA Carrie Prejean may lose her crown because of some semi-nude photos she appeared in. The Web site that published the first picture published a second one Wednesday. It had already promised to ""slowly roll out"" more photos. After the appearance of the first photo, the possibility that racier images could emerge prompted ""closed-door meetings"" Tuesday to consider stripping Prejean of her beauty queen title, pageant spokesman Ron Neal said. Although Neal said Prejean ""breached her contract"" by keeping the semi-nude photo or photos a secret, the only pictures published so far appear about as revealing as the bikini Prejean wore in the pageant's swimsuit competition. ""We have been told by Carrie Prejean there are no other photos other than the one circulating in existence. She should know better than anyone,"" Miss California USA Director Keith Lewis said Wednesday before the latest photo was released.  Watch reaction to racy photos » . Pageant officials were not immediately available for comment on the new picture. The 21-year-old Miss USA contestant has been the center of controversy since she declared her opposition to same-sex marriage in a response to a question on the national pageant stage last month. She finished as runner-up to Miss USA. In a statement given to CNN on Tuesday, Prejean said the photos -- and she did use the plural -- were being used in a ""vicious and mean-spirited"" effort to silence her for ""defending traditional marriage."" While she vowed to ""continue to support and defend marriage as the honorable institution it is,"" Prejean may be doing so without the Miss California USA title. State pageant officials met Tuesday with lawyers and representatives of Donald Trump, who owns the international competition, to consider whether they had grounds to take the crown away from Prejean, according to Neal. ""When you compete for Miss California, you're supposed to disclose whether you posed for nude or semi-nude photos, because it's grounds for disqualification,"" he said. CNN obtained a copy of the pageant contract Prejean signed last year, in which she agreed that the discovery of semi-nude photos could mean disqualification. The first photo made public shows Prejean -- who said she was 17 at the time -- wearing pink panties and no top. She is turned away from the camera, with her arm hiding most of her breast. The second photo is essentially the same, but Prejean is looking over her opposite shoulder. It was unclear whether pageant officials would consider that a semi-nude photo, in light of their standard requirement that contestants parade across stage wearing a bikini that arguably shows more skin. Ahead of the second photo being published, Nik Richie -- of TheDirty.com -- said he was upgrading his Web site's servers to handle the flood of traffic he expects will come after he posts the additional photos. ""I will slowly roll these out,"" Richie said. The Web site appeared to be overwhelmed by traffic early Thursday. CNN tried to access it, but could not. ""We'll see what happens with those and we want to know who's releasing them,"" Neal said. Shanna Moakler, the co-executive director of the Miss California USA organization, will meet with Tami Farrell, the runner-up for the title, ""to discuss the possible next steps,"" Neal said. Prejean defended the photos, which she said were taken when she was a teenager aspiring to be a Victoria's Secret model. ""I am a Christian, and I am a model,"" she said. ""Models pose for pictures, including lingerie and swimwear photos."" She said the photos ""have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith."" ""I am not perfect, and I will never claim to be,"" she said. ""But these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive. While we may not agree on every issue, we should show respect for others' opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean-spirited attacks."" Her publicist, Melany Ethridge, confirmed a comment she gave to celebrity Web site TMZ in which she said Prejean was 17 when she posed for the photos, hoping they would land her a modeling job. ""In her naivete, an agent convinced her to pose for this photo to submit to a lingerie company, claiming they could make her the next Victoria's Secret model,"" Ethridge told TMZ. ""She has since learned what a lie that was, and what a mistake it was to have the photo taken."" Prejean announced last week that she would star in a new $1.5 million ad campaign supporting ""opposite marriage"" (marriage between a man and a woman) funded by the National Organization for Marriage. ""Marriage is good,"" Prejean said at a news conference announcing the ad campaign. ""There is something special about unions of husband and wife. Unless we bring men and women together, children will not have mothers and fathers.""

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. You may think you have the worst boss in the Western Hemisphere, but if you've never had to dodge a cell phone, been fired over a breakfast pastry or had your work referred to as ""a complete and utter mess,"" you probably have it better than you realize. Consider the following celebrities, whose poor underlings withstood verbal and sometimes physical abuse and lived to tell about it: . Scott Rudin . The high-profile film producer, whose film credits include ""The Queen,"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Firm,"" is infamous for his hot temper and verbal rants. The Wall Street Journal once claimed he has fired 250 personal assistants, sometimes for offenses as minor as bringing him the wrong breakfast muffin. (Rudin claimed the actual number is closer to 120; however, he wasn't counting those who didn't survive his grueling two-week trial period.) Despite Rudin's reputation, however, being his personal assistant remains one of the most coveted jobs among wannabe movie moguls. Naomi Campbell . Campbell is to her employees what fireworks are to the average person: If not handled carefully, she may cause bodily harm. In early 2007, the British supermodel pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault for hitting her housekeeper with a cell phone over a pair of missing jeans. Campbell insisted the incident was an accident, but a history of similar events -- including a 2000 guilty plea for assaulting a personal assistant on a movie set in 1998 -- indicates otherwise. Simon Cowell . It's no secret that the mastermind behind ""American Idol"" has notoriously high standards, nor does he apologize for them. In fact, Cowell, who is known for finding new and creative ways to insult everyone from contestants to ""Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest, seems to relish his reputation as the judge everyone loves to hate. And why not? After all, it is his famously prickly personality that has helped make him a household name. Al Capone . Alphonse ""Al"" Capone's name is synonymous with organized crime. He was as well-known for his involvement in illegal gambling, bootlegging and prostitution as for his brutality. His own men were behind 1929's infamous ""St. Valentine's Day Massacre."" In 1931, Capone finally went to prison for income tax evasion and was released -- ironically, for good behavior -- after serving eight years in federal prisons. Afterward, Capone retired to his estate in Florida, where he died in 1947 of heart failure. Leona Helmsley . The recently-deceased Manhattan hotelier will go down in history as the ""Queen of Mean,"" a nickname she earned as a result of her erratic behavior and hasty firing of employees. After serving time for tax evasion in 1989 (""Only the little people pay taxes,"" was her infamous defense), Helmsley again brushed with the law in 2004 when a court ordered her to pay a former landscaper for breach of contract (Helmsley had abruptly fired the man after finding out he was gay). Gordon Ramsay . The hot-tempered (pun intended) host of ""Hell's Kitchen"" could give Simon Cowell a run for his money as the cruelest judge on TV. Neither holds back when it comes to doling out criticism, but Ramsay steps it up a notch with slightly more colorful language. In fact, his fondness for four-letter words is matched only by Cowell's fondness for tight black T-shirts. E-mail to a friend . Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009. All rights reserved.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A habitually violent young man was convicted Wednesday of the murder of teenage actor Rob Knox, who had starred in the latest ""Harry Potter"" film. The father, brother and mother of Rob Knox pose together after the death of the young actor. Karl Bishop, 22, attacked Knox and four friends with two kitchen knives outside a bar in Sidcup, south east London, last May. He stabbed them 10 times in less than two minutes, the Old Bailey court in central London heard. Knox, 18, had rushed out of the bar after he heard that Bishop had threatened his younger brother Jamie but he ended up being stabbed five times, once in a main artery. He died in hospital later that night. Bystanders said Bishop's face was ""screwed up in rage"" as he lashed out with the two knives, the Press Association reported. Days before the attack, the actor had finished filming on ""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince,"" due for international release in July, in which he played the role of Marcus Belby. He was set to reprise the part in future ""Harry Potter"" films. Knox's father Colin told mourners at his funeral, including co-star Rupert Grint, that his son had been ""living the dream,"" PA said. Prosecutor Brian Altman told the court that the young actor's promising life was ended by a ""habitual knife carrier"" who believed stabbing people was an ""occupational hazard"" and had previous convictions for knife crime. Bishop is due to be sentenced on Thursday. Knife crime in Britain is a political hot topic due to a spate of recent killings of mainly young people in major cities. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has urged tougher sentences for those caught carrying knives. He told the Daily Telegraph last month: ""By carrying a knife you are not only endangering the lives of others, but you are more likely to be killed, or end up in jail. ""We need to change the way young people think about knives, we need families and communities working together ... to get this message across and help stamp out knife crime and get weapons off our streets.""","Man convicted of murder of teenage actor who starred in new ""Harry Potter"" film .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's president has defended his government's recent ceasefire in the country's volatile Swat Valley in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, saying that many in the West have mischaracterized the deal. President Zardari also said that the cease-fire would not close girls' schools in the troubled region. The permanent ceasefire, which was brokered in late February between members of the Taliban and leaders of Swat Valley, has been criticized and called a major concession by the Pakistani government in an attempt to hold off Taliban attacks. The central government has long exerted little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July to flush out militants from areas of the North West Frontier Province . As retaliation for the military presence, the Taliban carried out a series of deadly attacks, beheadings and destruction of girls' schools. They also continued to gain ground, setting up checkpoints throughout the area. President Asif Ali Zardari addressed the international criticism in his Wall Street Journal article, published Wednesday. ""We have not and will not negotiate with extremist Taliban and terrorists,"" Zardari wrote. ""The clerics with whom we have engaged are not Taliban. Indeed, in our dialogue we'd made it clear that it is their responsibility to rein in and neutralize Taliban and other insurgents."" The deal was brokered by Sufi Mohammed, a pro-Taliban cleric who in the past was arrested for leading thousands of fighters against the United States in Afghanistan. Mohammed made the deal with his son-in-law and Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah. In the article, Zardari also said that the cease-fire would not close girls' schools in the region. ""We have not and will not condone the closing of girls' schools, as we saw last year when militants closed schools in pockets of Swat Valley. Indeed, the government insists that the education of young women is mandatory. This is not an example of the government condoning or capitulating to extremism -- quite the opposite,"" Zardari wrote. The cease-fire deal imposes Islamic law, or sharia, in the region. As part of the agreement, the Taliban is allowing boys' schools to reopen and the government to set up temporary quarters for the more than 200,000 Swat residents who fled. Women in the area interviewed by CNN said that they would not be able to go to the schools and that, under Taliban-imposed sharia law, they cannot even be seen in public without their husbands or fathers. Swat Valley, located in North West Frontier Province, was once one of Pakistan's biggest tourist destinations. It is near the Afghanistan border and is 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the capital, Islamabad. -- CNN's Stan Grant contributed to this report.","Deal brokered in February between Taliban and leaders of Swat Valley .

"MIDDLETOWN, Connecticut (CNN) -- The suspect in the shooting of a Wesleyan University student is in police custody, police in Meriden, Connecticut, said Thursday. Police have arrested Stephen Morgan in the shooting death of Johanna Justin-Jinich. A spokesman in Meriden said Stephen Morgan had been in custody there, but was transferred to police in Middletown, seven miles away. No other details were available. An arrest warrant was issued earlier for Morgan, charging him with murder in the death of Johanna Justin-Jinich at a Middletown bookstore on Wednesday. Justin-Jinich was shot Wednesday afternoon at the Red & Black Cafe in Broad Street Books, the campus bookstore, the university said. She worked at the cafe, the cafe said on its Web site. It said that her killing has left employees ""devastated."" Earlier Thursday, a law enforcement source told CNN that police spoke briefly to the suspect after her shooting death. Morgan was one of several people who gathered Wednesday afternoon outside Broad Street Books after the Wesleyan junior was shot, the source said. He gave his name to investigators who spoke with him, the source said. At that early stage of the investigation, the source said, police had no reason to suspect Morgan. Earlier Thursday, Morgan's sister had urged him to turn himself in to ""avoid any further bloodshed."" Diana Morgan told reporters in Marblehead, Massachusetts, that her family was ""shocked and sickened by the tragedy in Middletown."" She said her family did not know her brother's whereabouts, but issued a brief statement to him through the media: ""Steve, turn yourself in right now to any law enforcement agency, wherever you are, to avoid any further bloodshed. We love you, we will support you in every way and we don't want anyone else to get hurt."" She did not take questions. Before his arrest, police had been worried that Morgan may be targeting Wesleyan University and the town's Jewish residents. A statement from the university alleges that Morgan had written threats against ""Wesleyan and/or its Jewish students"" in his personal journals. Congregation Adath Israel, Middletown's lone synagogue, canceled all activities for the next day, said its president, Eliot Meadow. He said police told him that they do not think Morgan is part of a larger anti-Semitic organization. About 200 families attend the synagogue, Meadow said, and he added that Wesleyan, a private university with about 3,000 students, has a substantial Jewish population. While Justin-Jinich was a student at Wesleyan and was Jewish, according to the Middletown mayor, there was another connection between her and her alleged killer, authorities said.  Watch how suspect and victim knew each other » . In July 2007, the young woman filed a harassment complaint against Morgan while the two were taking the same six-week summer course at New York University, school spokesman John Beckman told CNN. The complaint, in which Justin-Jinich said she was receiving harassing e-mails and phone calls from Morgan, was filed with the university's public safety department toward the end of the course, Beckman said. The public safety department brought in the New York Police Department and after conversations with Morgan and Justin-Jinich, the young woman declined to follow up or press charges, Beckman said. Beckman said the two were not living in the same student residence house during the course. Additional details were not immediately available. Another law enforcement source also told CNN that in an excerpt from one of the e-mails sent to Justin-Jinich, Morgan wrote, ""You're going to have a lot more problems down the road if you can't take any (expletive) criticism, Johanna.""  Watch the crime described as 'every parent's nightmare' » . Middletown Mayor Sebastian Giuliano said the connection between Morgan and Justin-Jinich may ""go back to Colorado.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Paula Abdul is ready for another fresh start, now that she's kicked her addiction to painkillers, the ""American Idol"" judge told a magazine. Paula Abdul told Ladies' Home Journal that she struggled with a drug problem. The former pop star released a new song this week and will take the ""American Idol"" stage Wednesday night to perform it. Abdul, in an interview for the Ladies' Home Journal's June issue, acknowledged what she has denied for years -- that she had a drug problem. But last November, days after an obsessed fan apparently killed herself outside Abdul's home, she went to a health spa where weaned herself off prescription pain medications she had used for a dozen years. ""Withdrawal -- it's the worst thing,"" she told the magazine. ""I was freezing cold, then sweating hot, then chattering and in so much pain, it was excruciating. But at my very core, I did not like existing the way I had been.""  Watch more on Abdul's challenges » . Abdul acknowledged several years ago that she used medications to kill the pain for a series of injuries, but this is apparently her first admission she was hooked on them. When People magazine asked her about it in 2005, she chose her words carefully: . ""Drugs? I'm not addicted to pills of any kind,"" Abdul then said. Her painkillers were, in fact, not pills. Abdul wore a patch that delivered a pain medication about 80 times more potent than morphine, she told Ladies' Home Journal. Abdul's slurring of words and apparent confusion on ""American Idol"" and during interviews stirred rumors of a drug problem in recent years. She told the magazine, though, she was never under the influence during a show. Her pains began with a cheerleading accident at age 17, but were compounded by later mishaps -- including a stage accident in 1991, a car wreck in 1992 and a plane crash in 1993, she said. The persistent hurting is almost gone after a 15th surgery, she said. After two short marriages, Abdul said she is still looking for a soul mate. ""I'm working on finding that guy,"" she said. She premiered her new song -- ""I'm Just Here for the Music"" -- on ""Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest's radio show Tuesday. She told Seacrest she only decided last week to accept the invitation to perform it live on the TV show. ""I was invited by the producers and I wasn't sure it I was going to do it because timing was of the essence,"" she said. She said she put her performance together over the weekend. Abdul's ""American Idol"" contract ends with this season, and she told Seacrest she did not know if she would be back to judge next season.","Paula Abdul told Ladies' Home Journal she had painkiller addiction .

"FOLKSTON, Georgia (CNN)  -- Rain or shine, 80-year-old Cookie Williams plops himself on the wooden viewing platform perched over double train tracks. Cookie Williams, 80, watches a CSX freight train chug by on a typical Tuesday afternoon. On this warm May afternoon, a patient Williams sits slouched, legs crossed and arms relaxed, donning his vintage CSX railroad company cap littered with miniature train pendants. He is waiting for a train. A scanner, listening for oncoming train signals, crackles in the background as it picks up some conductor chatter. He waits some more. ""A lot of people in this town thought I was on the kooky side,"" said Williams, who is retired from the paper and pulp industry. ""But I love it. I've loved these trains ever since I was a kid."" Folkston, Georgia, where Williams lives, is one of many train hot spots nationwide. Here, the blasting train noises are jokingly called ""Folkston music."" With up to 60 trains crawling loudly through the quaint town each day, it's become an attraction for fans eager to collect train images and sounds. In 2001, Williams, who grew up by a train track, pushed town officials to construct a viewing platform with picnic tables, wireless Internet and a scanner to detect oncoming trains. The Southeast Georgia town reports that at least 12,500 visitors from all over the world visit the platform to watch trains each year.   Watch Williams and his friend talk about the joy of train watching » . As the prominence of the iconic American railroad has faded over the past half-century, there remains a devout group of train enthusiasts like Williams and his friends, dubbed railfans, who obsessively chase and watch powerful trains glide along railroad tracks. Trains Magazine, an industry publication, estimates that there are 175,000 U.S. railfans, mostly male baby boomers. ""The word 'enthusiast' doesn't begin to cover their devotion,"" said Rhonda Del Boccio, head of the Okefenokee Chamber of Commerce, which oversees railfan tourism in Folkston. ""Picture [the popular game] 'World of Warcraft' for train people."" On any given day in America, loyal railfans camp out for hours or even days on a platform, a grassy field, a road or a backyard to snap a few photographs or shoot video of the moving trains. Some travel to different cities and countries to capture the right shot. Last weekend, nearly 20 railfans convened at the Izaak Walton Inn in Essex, Montana, a railroad worker dormitory built in 1939 that was converted into a hotel. The group took pictures of trains set against the backdrop of Glacier National Park during the day and had history lessons about trains at night. A train festival this summer in Oswego, Michigan, is expected to draw in 30,000 attendees, many of them railfans. Just like bird watcher keeps an eye out for specific birds, railfans watch for cargo and passenger trains and ""critters""-- railfan lingo for small freight trains. On a lucky day, they may spot a historic steam locomotive. Hardcore railfans spend so much time visually dissecting the trains, they can recite the number of axles in a passing train or recount which years railroad giant Union Pacific Railway Co. changed its logos. ""It's a marvel to see something that weighs hundreds of tons, hauling thousands of tons, moving through rural country,"" said Bill Taylor, a 62-year-old railfan and former teacher. His Missoula, Montana, home is adorned with antique rail items, such as train silverware and conductor lanterns. ""It's an orchestra of motion."" In an age of social media, railfanning has taken a new turn, going viral. On YouTube, there are more than 24,000 railfan videos, ranging from trains chugging through Gary, Indiana, to the subway in New York. Flickr.com touts thousands of pictures uploaded my railfans delighted to share their most prized train spotting moments. The obsession over railfanning often stems from historical and technological intrigue. Trains not only represent a romanticized era, they have been central to American economic growth and commerce across the country, historians say. Like any other pastime, railfanning has rules. Most railfan veterans execute the hobby with caution, steering at least 100 feet from private property and dangerous areas, railfans say. Sometimes, amateur train lovers wander too close to the tracks, raising safety concerns and irritating rail conductors and employees. Rail workers nickname pestering railfans ""foamers"" because fans stand near the tracks in such awe that they are practically drooling when a train plows through.  See train photos from our iReporters » . ""For [conductors and rail workers], it's a dog chasing a car,"" said Rick Enselman, 41, of Edmond, Oklahoma, who became enamored with railfanning 15 years ago. He started taking his two children to the tracks with him. ""They don't understand the rhythm and rhyme of why we're doing it."" Enselman, a salesman, says railfanning takes his mind ""away from the real world."" His love of trains was inspired by his great-uncle, who bequeathed him a vintage Lionel O Scale train set decades ago. But it hasn't been a smooth ride for railfans. After September 11, railfanning sparked some controversy. Security officers at railroad companies began to ward off railfans, fearing that they might be a terrorism threat. Officers soon realized railfans were no harm and could bolster surveillance. In 2006, BNSF Railway Co., one of the largest railroad operators in the United States, created the Citizen for Rail Safety Group, where railfans help the company watch for unusual activity. There are more than 8,700 people, mostly railfans, registered today. Today, trains are also making a steady comeback despite the challenges of a sluggish economy. Amtrak passenger ridership saw an increase of 10 million over the past decade. President Obama has talked about resurrecting plans for a national high-speed rail network. ""Even though there are fewer railroad companies, they are hauling more stuff than ever before,"" said Kevin Keefe, publisher of Trains Magazine. ""I don't think railroads have lost the ability to capture people's attention."" Back on the viewing platform in Folkston, a 10-year-old boy with eager blue eyes hidden behind a thin pair of glasses, with a videocamera in his hand, is sitting two seats away from Cookie Williams. Surveying the naked tracks carefully, the boy, a railfan from North Carolina, fidgets in his seat . ""It's coming up, son,"" Williams reassures the boy and the four other railfans on the platform. ""A few more minutes."" So they wait together, faces brushed by the soft breeze. And they wait a few minutes more, before the bells jingle a warning. The horn screams twice. And the howling cacophony of a diesel locomotive crashes toward them as they watch the train come into focus from the distance.","Trains Magazine estimates there are 175,000 railfans in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Toyota reported a first-ever annual net loss of $4.4 billion on Friday, the latest automobile maker to be battered by the credit crisis. The top executives for Toyota at a press conference in January. Net revenue for the fiscal year ending March 31 was down nearly 22 percent, with total sales of 7.6 million vehicles -- 1.3 million fewer than the previous year. The company dividend will be reduced to 100 yen per share, down from 140 yen per share last year . The appreciation of the yen against major currencies, rise in raw material costs and the collapse of the auto market in Europe and North America led to the company's annual loss, said Katsuaki Watanabe, Toyota president, at a press conference. The firm expects sales to decline even further to 6.5 million units this year. The company, however, will be further expanding it environmentally friendly line of automobiles.

"(CNN) -- A year ago, employees at Boiron, a medical manufacturing company, wined and dined at the Ritz-Carlton Golf & Spa Resort overlooking the picturesque bay in Rose Hall, Jamaica, for their annual retreat. The InterContinental Montelucia Resort & Spa is subtly scaling back amid a sagging economy. This year, employees are saying goodbye to luxury as company President Ludovic Rassat moved the event to a more sensible location: the Sheraton Suites Philadelphia Airport. Many of his employees who live near the hotel are expected to sleep at home. ""It's important to see we are making decisions for the good of the company,"" Rassat said. ""At the end of the day, it's going to be good for them. Their jobs are still going to be there."" With a mentality like Rassat's pervading the business and leisure traveler psyche, luxury hotels are bleeding occupancy and revenue at a rate far worse than the travel slump experienced after September 11, travel experts say. To overcome their financial woes, luxury hotels are dropping rates, giving customers incentives and finding ways to cut operating costs without compromising the integrity of their posh images. Starwood Hotel & Resorts, which owns the chic W and St Regis hotels, is offering existing and new members of its preferred guest program the opportunity to earn a free weekend night with two stays at any of Starwood's hotels from May through July. Guests can use their free night through the end of September across Starwood's brands, including many of the company's luxury properties. This summer, Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, which operates five-star properties around the world, will offer customers who book particular packages free breakfast and a $100 resort credit. Washington's Willard Intercontinental Hotel is offering a ""buy two nights, get a third night free"" promotion for weekend stays through December. From December to February, occupancy in luxury hotels, a category that includes names such as the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. sunk more than 15 percent -- a steeper drop than at mid-level hotels, according to leading hotel industry watcher Smith Travel Research Inc. The revenue generated from the available luxury rooms fell 23 percent in that same three-month period, according to the Smith Travel Research report. Meanwhile, there are 551,610 rooms opening this year amid sluggish consumer demand, according to a STR construction pipeline report in March. And when the economy rebounds, the luxury lodging segment will take longer to recover. ""Luxury hotels will lag behind the rest of the hotel industry,"" said Bobby Bowers, senior vice president of operations at STR. ""They have ups and downs that are steeper than the industry as a whole."" PKF Consulting forecasts that the luxury hotel segment will stay in red ink until 2011. Things have gotten so bad that some upscale-hotel owners across the country are delaying hotel construction to save money. Other developers are facing foreclosure or have scrapped future hotel plans altogether, industry experts say. Much of the luxury hotel business' slowdown has been driven by guilt, some executives say. Business leaders fear that they might look too excessive by staying at an upscale hotel as pink slips and pay freezes become ubiquitous. One high-end resort in Amelia Island, Florida, had one of its business customers suggest that the hotel drop the word ""island"" from its address to downplay the resort's exclusive image. Many companies such as Starwood and Rosewood are trying to lure customers by giving free nights and dining and spa credits without significantly lowering room rates, which could tarnish their exclusive appeal. Hotel operators hope that offering guests free nights will encourage them to spend more money overall. Other hotels prefer bundling their rates in packages so it is difficult to tell how much the prices have dropped. ""They need to protect the image of their property,"" explained Erik Herskind, a principle at Greenlight, a Dallas, Texas-based company that works with luxury hotels. ""They need to feel like even in this tough time, they are a prestigious place, so they are finding quiet ways to attract business and the right kind of business."" But other luxury hotels are dropping rates anyway, partnering frequently with online travel companies like Expedia Inc.'s Hotels.com in special sales featuring five-star hotels. Shaun Stewart, director of market management for Hotels.com, says the discounts make it the ""best time to upgrade"" for travelers who have never lodged in luxury. Hit particularly hard by the recession is Las Vegas, Nevada, where luxury hotel rates have plummeted more than 30 percent, according to Hotels.com. For example, the Trump Hotel Collection, which is advertising with online travel companies for the first time, is touting prices of $89 a night at the opulent Trump International Hotel Las Vegas. The year-old luxury hotel sold rooms for about $200 before the economy crumbled. The company is also using Facebook and Twitter to appeal to a younger demographic, who can now afford to stay at their property. ""You have a couple of bad apples in the bag,"" Melissa Brown, vice president of sales and marketing at Trump, said of luxury hotels that began to dramatically drop prices last year. ""Then we all have to fall with it."" Many luxury hotels, known for their extravagant pampering, amenities and services, are also making subtle cuts to save money. But they are careful not to scale back too much. InterContinental, owned by InterContinental Hotel Group, says a growing number of branches are replacing costly imported floral displays with arrangements from local vendors. Some gift baskets now have fresh fruit and bottled water rather than smoked salmon, cheeses and chocolates. Share prices at the company fell by 26 percent in 2008 while the company opened a record 430 hotels that year. At the InterContinental Montelucia Resort & Spa in Paradise Valley, Arizona, the hotel has made valet parking optional to reduce the number of employees working in the front. Instead, guests can park their cars. But cutting prices and services is a risky balancing act for luxury brands in the long run, warns Bob Caroll, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. ""If you really are that much of a better property, consumers will start to wonder why your price is the same as a normal hotel,"" Carroll said. ""But once consumers start to believe the lower price, luxury hotels may experience difficulty in raising prices when the economy recovers. It's a double whammy.""","Occupancy in luxury hotels dropped 15 percent from December to February .

"(CNN) -- Drew Peterson, who was arrested this week in the death of his third wife, joked with the media about his jail jumpsuit and chewed gum throughout his first court appearance Friday. A judge delayed Drew Peterson's arraignment until May 18 because his lawyers couldn't attend Friday's hearing. The 55-year-old former police officer flashed a broad smile and engaged in banter during the 10-yard walk to the courthouse. Wearing an inmate uniform -- a bright-red short-sleeved shirt and pants, white socks and sandals -- Peterson had his hands and feet shackled as he arrived at the courtroom. Asked how he was, he responded, ""three squares a day and a spiffy outfit."" He then held up the chains and said, ""and I got the bling. Can't complain."" Peterson, who authorities call the prime suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, was indicted on murder charges related to the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, the Illinois state attorney's office said.  Watch a shackled Peterson go to jail » . Peterson appeared in court Friday, but a judge delayed his arraignment until May 18. Judge Richard Schoenstedt ordered the delay after Will County State's Attorney Jim Glasgow told him that Peterson's primary lawyer, Joel Brodsky, had asked for it because neither he nor Peterson's other attorney could attend Friday's hearing. Peterson, chewing gum throughout the proceedings and speaking in a clear voice, told Schoenstedt that he knew both of his lawyers were out of town and that he had no objection to the delay. Glasgow, who has said he will prosecute the case personally, said Brodsky told him that he expects to ask the judge for a reduction in Peterson's $20 million bail during the May 18 arraignment. Illinois State Police said Peterson was taken into custody about 5:30 p.m. Thursday after a traffic stop near his home. Police had staked out his home all day, police Capt. Carl Dobrich said, but waited for Peterson to leave before arresting him out of concern for his three young children, who were in the house. Peterson, through his attorney, denied any wrongdoing in either case. Glasgow said he believes that the case is strong. ""This is an extremely grave and serious matter, and it is reflected in the bond,"" Glasgow said. Brodsky told CNN's Larry King that he thought the bail was excessive and would seek a more ""reasonable"" amount, noting that it was the most expensive bail he'd seen in 10 years.  Watch Peterson's attorney address his client's arrest » . Charles B. Pelkie, a spokesman for Glasgow, said a grand jury indicted Peterson in the murder of Savio, whose death had once been ruled an accidental drowning. But Brodsky said in a statement that prosecutors won't be able to prove their case, because ""he didn't do it."" ""There is no evidence that links Drew Peterson to the death of Kathleen Savio or anyone else for that matter,"" Brodsky said. ""Drew did not harm Kathleen; he has said so from Day One. We're obviously disappointed a grand jury indicted him. But an indictment does not mean guilt."" Pelkie said the grand jury continues to meet and is studying the possibility of charges in Stacy Peterson's disappearance.  Watch family members react to the arrest » . After Stacy Peterson went missing in October 2007, media and police scrutiny of Peterson revealed that Savio had died mysteriously during a nasty divorce a few years earlier. Savio died just before the division of marital assets was finalized, making Drew Peterson the sole beneficiary. Savio was found in the dry bathtub of her home. At the time, the death was ruled an accidental drowning. But her family continued to insist that Savio died as a result of foul play. The investigation into Stacy Peterson's disappearance brought renewed interest in Savio's death. Authorities exhumed Savio's body, further tests were conducted, and her death was been ruled a ""homicide staged to look like an accident."" Brodsky told King that he thinks the case has always been about circumstantial evidence and that he will bring a pathologist to trial who will say Savio died in an accidental drowning. ""I think the jury's going to see that, in fact, this always has been an accidental death and still is an accidental death,"" Brodsky told King. Kathleen Savio's brother, Nick, told CNN affiliate WLS that he received a call saying Peterson had been arrested.  Watch police arrest Peterson » . ""The state police had been telling us the day was coming,"" he told WLS. ""We kept hearing it for about eight months. I'm almost in tears here. It's been so hard for our family. ""Hopefully, we'll get the justice we've always been waiting for."" Martin Glink, attorney for the Savio family, said they had been hopeful the grand jury felt that there was enough evidence to charge Peterson. ""We're very happy that the wheels of justice have continued to move and they are pointing in his direction,"" Glink told WLS. The news was bittersweet for Stacy Peterson's family, who continue to wait for news about her disappearance. ""We have anticipated this coming. We have dreamed about it. We have been patient over it,"" family spokeswoman Pam Bosco told WLS. ""Now that it's here, it's almost a little bit calm. We're waiting for the storm to calm now. The calm before the storm."" Bosco said she was hopeful there would be charges in Stacy Peterson's case. ""We always said from the very beginning that Kathleen and Stacy had one thing in common, and that was Drew Peterson,"" she said. ""So, hopefully, we'll have news soon about Stacy, too."" Ernie Raines is also relieved about the arrest. His daughter, Christina Raines, is dating Peterson and was living with him before his arrest. Raines told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he was with his daughter and Peterson as recently as last week, when they talked about going to Las Vegas, Nevada, and getting married. Thursday night, he spoke with his daughter after the arrest. ""My daughter was terrified, very emotional, upset,"" Raines said. ""And I tried to tell her from the beginning that this was going to happen, be prepared."" Raines said that when he heard about the arrest, he was more relieved than anything. ""I'm glad justice finally came before he hurt my daughter,"" he said. Police put Peterson's three young children in the custody of the state's children and family service department. His adult son was contacted, at Peterson's request, to take them, according to Dobrich. Dobrich said Peterson cooperated with police during his arrest.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi who was captured on videotape torturing an Afghan grain dealer has reportedly been detained, a senior U.S. State Department official told CNN Saturday. Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan, pictured here, allegedly tortured a business associate on videotape. The official said the government of the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu Dhabi as one of its seven emirates, told the State Department that Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan is under house arrest pending an investigation, but that the United States has not independently confirmed the development. The videotape emerged last month in a federal civil lawsuit filed in Houston, Texas, by Bassam Nabulsi, a U.S. citizen, against the sheikh. Former business partners, the men had a falling out, in part over the tape. In a statement to CNN, the sheikh's U.S. attorney said Nabulsi is using the videotape to influence the court over a business dispute. The tape of the heinous torture session is delaying the ratification of a civil nuclear deal between the United Arab Emirates and the United States, senior U.S. officials familiar with the case have said. The senior U.S. officials said the administration has held off on the ratification process because it believes sensitivities over the story can hurt its passage. On Saturday, Human Rights Watch called the sheikh's reported detention ""a significant development"" but said the UAE government needs to do more to restore confidence in its judicial system. ""The videotape of this episode shocked the world,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""The report of the arrest was reassuring, but now the government needs to make the details public. Secretive prosecutions will not deter further abuses and torture."" On the tape, Sheikh Issa appears to burn with rage. Apparently believing he was cheated in a business deal, the sheikh was trying to extract a confession from the Afghan grain dealer. With a private security officer assisting, Sheikh Issa is seen stuffing sand in the Afghan's mouth. As the grain dealer pleads and whimpers, he is beaten with a nailed board, burned in the genitals with a cigarette lighter, shocked with a cattle prod and led to believe he would be shot. Salt is literally poured on his wounds. The 45 minutes of torture appears on a nearly three-hour-long videotape shot in late 2004 in the desert outside Abu Dhabi. It was made at the direction of the sheikh himself. The tape has been viewed by CNN.  Watch portions of the tape and Nabulsi tell his story » . After international concerns over the tape mounted in late April, Abu Dhabi's government issued a statement saying it deplored the contents of the video and planned an immediate and comprehensive review of it. The sheikh, who holds no official government position, is the half-brother of the UAE's ruler, President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Human Rights Watch sent a April 28 letter to the president imploring him to form ""an independent body"" to probe both the torture and and the ""failure"" of the UAE's Interior Ministry ""to bring those involved to justice."" The group reiterated that call Saturday. As for the grain dealer, UAE officials say he survived the ordeal, and said the sheikh and the grain dealer settled the matter privately by agreeing not to bring formal charges against each other. However, Nabulsi's attorney, Anthony Buzbee, said the grain dealer can't be located and it is not known whether he is alive.","State Department official says member of Abu Dhabi royal family reportedly detained .

"(CNN) -- As a spending bill loaded with pork makes its way through Congress, President Obama is getting pushback from members of his own party who are questioning his vow to end wasteful spending. The Senate could vote on the spending bill as early as Thursday. The president on Wednesday pledged turn tide on an ""era of fiscal irresponsibility,"" reiterating his campaign promise that the days of ""pork ... as a strategy"" are over. And in a prime-time address before a joint session of Congress, Obama last week praised the $787 billion stimulus package signed into law, telling the nation, ""I'm proud that we passed a recovery plan free of earmarks, and I want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities."" But some in the audience found that hard to swallow. ""There was just a roar of laughter -- because there were earmarks,"" said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri. Earmarks, sometimes called ""pork,"" are unrelated pet projects that members of Congress insert in spending bills.  Watch more on the earmarks in the bill » . The scoffing continues as the president hammers away at reducing wasteful spending and saving taxpayers money while lawmakers on Capitol Hill load up a spending bill with more than 8,000 earmarks totaling nearly $8 billion. The legislation in question is a $410 billion omnibus bill that would keep the federal government running through the rest of the fiscal year, which ends in September 2009. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that monitors government spending, the bill includes: . About 60 percent of the earmarks are from Democrats, and about 40 percent are from Republicans, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense. Ryan Alexander, the president of the Taxpayers for Common Sense, pointed out that not all earmarks are bad. ""They're not always good or bad. What's bad is the process. We don't know why certain projects get earmark funds and why other projects don't. Some of them may be good. But that could be just as well by accident as it is by design, because we have no idea why these projects are funded and why other projects aren't,"" he said. Earlier this week, 14 Democratic senators met to talk about their concerns with the spending. On Wednesday, Democratic Sens. Evan Bayh and Russ Feingold called on Obama to veto the bill.  Watch Feingold talk about a 'teary-eyed' defense of earmarks » . ""But the bloated omnibus requires sacrifice from no one, least of all the government. It only exacerbates the problem and hastens the day of reckoning,"" Bayh wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial published Wednesday. Democrats blocked amendments by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, that would have narrowed the spending on earmarks. ""So much for the promise of change. This may be -- in all the years I have been coming to this floor to complain about the earmark pork barrel corruption that this system has bred, this may be probably the worst, probably the worst,"" McCain said Tuesday. The spending bill made it through the House last week. A vote in the Senate could come as early as Thursday, but it's unclear if there are the 60 votes necessary to sent it to the floor since some Democrats aren't supporting it. Obama is expected to sign the bill when it reaches his desk. But Democrats speaking out against the pork could just be flexing their muscles, said CNN contributor Roland Martin. ""I would love to see these same Democrats have the courage to actually stand up, look their fellow senators in the eye, Democrats and Republicans, and say, OK, let's get rid of your particular project,"" he said. ""What often happens in Congress is, they complain in terms of the general ... What I am saying is, call them out. Put it on the table,"" he said. Those defending the earmarks say they make up just a small portion -- less than 1 percent -- of the overall bill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, on Thursday defended congressional earmarks, despite calls from the White House earlier this week to reform the process. ""The legislatively initiated proposals in the appropriations bill, I think, are an appropriate function of Congress of the United States,"" Pelosi said. But Pelosi said she does believe Congress should cut back on the number of earmarks. Pelosi said after Congress finishes the $410 billion spending bill for this year, she planned to work with the Obama administration to find ways to reduce the number of earmarks in future spending bills. The White House says this bill is just last year's unfinished business -- and next time, it will be different. ""We'll change the rules going forward,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Wednesday when asked about the legislation. Obama presented his budget summary to Congress last week, but the full details of his 2010 budget won't be available until April. CNN's Jason Carroll, Joe Johns, Kristi Keck and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","$410 billion spending bill for FY 2009 includes 8,000 earmarks .

"(CNN) -- Doctors chose a woman who survived a shotgun wound to her face as the first recipient of a face transplant after treating her for nearly four years. This image projects what Connie Culp, 46, may look like two years after the face transplant. Connie Culp knew of the Cleveland Clinic's interest in face transplants and approached the medical staff, doctors said at a news conference Tuesday. Dr. Maria Siemionow, the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital's director of plastic surgery research and head of microsurgery training, had more than 20 years of experience in complex transplants. By 2004, Siemionow was looking for the right candidate for a face transplant who wasn't doing it for vanity. ""They are not looking to go out on the street and be beautiful,"" Siemionow told CNN in a 2006 interview. ""Some of these patients, when they were interviewed just said 'I want to walk on the street and just make sure I am not sticking out.' They just want to have a normal face."" The doctors examined the patient's history, motivation and ability to understand the risks of the transplant. And they found Culp to be an ideal candidate. Five years after a gun blast shattered her nose, cheeks and upper lip, she had a band of scar tissue extending across her face. ""The most devastating of all was the fact that society had rejected her and children were afraid of her,"" said Siemionow, who led the December 10 transplant operation.  See before and after photos of Culp » . Culp, a mother of two and a grandmother, told her doctors she could understand that some adults would shun her. ""But what really bothered her the most were children -- the children that shied away from her,"" said Dr. Frank Papay, the chairman of Institute of Dermatology and Plastic Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. ""That sense of innocence, and her not being able to see that innocence really, really affected her."" The shooting . In September 2004, Culp's estranged husband shot her in the face in an attempted murder-suicide outside a restaurant in Hopedale, Ohio, according to CNN affiliate WTOV in Steubenville, Ohio. Culp was 8 feet away from her husband, Thomas Culp, when he pulled the shotgun's trigger. He then turned the weapon on himself, according to local news reports. They both survived. Thomas Culp was sent to prison. Despite her wounds, she told WTOV in 2008, ""I'll always love him. He was my first love."" At the same time, Culp said, she felt angry. ""I wouldn't be human if I didn't. I forgive him, but I have to go on, you know?"" After the shooting, Culp recuperated in a hospital and in a personal care home for two years. Culp told WTOV she had vision problems and was learning Braille. Her approach to life was to ""keep motivated. Don't sleep your life away -- that could have happened. I could be depressed. I'm not."" As she spoke, her breaths emitted a small whistle from her tracheotomy tube, which protruded from a surgical opening in her neck. ""I cannot smell. I will never be able to smell,"" she said in the interview. Culp was wrong. How doctors transplanted a face . The doctors at the Cleveland Clinic analyzed Culp's injuries using CAT scans and developed plastic models of her skull. They practiced face transplant operation on cadavers several times. Culp met with the hospital's surgeons, ethical committee members and psychiatry and psychology specialists who determined that she was an ideal candidate for the surgery. Then, the wait for the right donor began in 2008. ""We thought we were going to wait a long time because we had to find a Caucasian female in her mid 40s to match Connie, so we expected a year before we were able to find a donor,"" said Papay, who is also head of craniofacial surgery. ""Well, three to four months later, I got a call at around midnight from Dr. Siemionow saying 'I think we have a donor.'"" The family of a brain dead woman granted permission to use her face. He likened the preparation for the December transplant to a rocket launch, saying, ""Everything was prepared beforehand very, very, very carefully."" Surgeons sheared out the donor's mid-facial area including the lower eyelids, cheekbones, the nose, some of the sinus and the whole upper jaw, with the blood vessels.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss the face transplant » . When it came time to move the donor's parts to Culp, they had to see that the donor and recipient parts aligned. ""One of the ways you can tell that is how your upper teeth fit to the lower teeth,"" Papay said. ""We knew it was like a hand in a glove, exactly where we needed to be."" They secured the bones into Culp's face using titanium plates and screws. Then the microvascular surgeons attached the vessels. They tucked the scars around Culp's ears or underneath her eyelid, where they would not be visible.  How the doctors operated » . Doctors added more skin than needed in case of tissue rejection. After monitoring Culp's progress, doctors say they will remove the excess tissue and tighten her jawline in future surgeries. Contrary to science fiction and movies, the surgery did not make Culp look like the donor. ""If you just took the skin and transplanted it to the other patient, the bony structure is different,"" Papay said. ""If you took the bony structure and transplanted it on the other side, it ends up being a composite. So, it doesn't look like the donor. It doesn't look like the recipient. It ends up looking like someone new."" Recovery . At this point, all the transplanted parts of Culp's face are functioning except for her facial nerves, which are growing about an inch a month. Doctors anticipate Culp will be able to have full facial function -- and more expression --  by this winter. In physical therapy, she learns to train her nerves, make facial expressions, smile and purse her lips, doctors said. ""If you cry or you laugh or you smile, it's not like you think about it.

Transplant patients must take immune-suppressing drugs throughout their lifetime to prevent tissue rejection. But she showed improvements that enabled the doctors to reduce her regimen to one medication, doctors said. ""She's taking her medications,"" Siemionow said. ""We know she is compliant. She cares about how she looks. She has her hair done in a new color...She is full of life. She does her push-ups. She's on the treadmill.

"(CNN) -- A terrorism suspect -- whose 2008 escape from Singapore launched a global manhunt -- has been arrested in Malaysia, according to authorities there. An public alert posted at a supermarket for Mas Selamat Kastari on March 1, 2008, in Singapore. Mas Selamat Kastari, suspected leader of the Islamist militant group Jemaah Islamiyah's Singapore arm, was arrested April 1 in Johor state in Malaysia, near the border of Singapore, Malaysian police said. Authorities have interrogated him and are sharing the information with police in the region, Malaysian law-enforcement officials said. ""It's very good he's been caught, but it's important to remember there are many other fugitives still at large, not (the) least, Noordin Moh Top,"" said Sidney Jones, South East Asia director for the International Crisis Group. Noordin is a Malaysian thought to be behind the region's most recent major attacks. He belongs to a small splinter group of Jemaah Islamiyah that espouses the use of large-scale terror attacks to push for the establishment of Islamic states in the region. Noordin is a one-time officer, recruiter and bomb-maker for Jemaah Islamiyah, who police say has narrowly escaped their dragnets for years. In the case of Mas Selamat, thousands of security forces fanned out across Singapore after he escaped in February 2008. Interpol, the organization that helps facilitate cooperation among police agencies around the world, later issued a worldwide security alert for him. Mas Selamat had been arrested in Indonesia and turned over to Singapore, on suspicion of plotting to crash a plane into the country's airport. Jemaah Islamiyah is thought to have links to al-Qaeda and is suspected of being behind the 2002 nightclub bombings on the Indonesian island of Bali that killed more than 200 mostly Western tourists. Singapore is a strong U.S. ally and one of the world's most prosperous countries with strong international trading links. Mas Selamet fled the southeast Asian country in 2001 after authorities cracked down on Jemaah Islamiyah and arrested dozens of its members. To retaliate, Mas Selamet plotted to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's main airport, Changi, the Home Affairs Ministry said. The plot was not carried out. He also is suspected of being behind plans to attack the U.S. Embassy and a government building. Indonesian authorities arrested Mas Selamet on immigration violation charges in 2003. Three years later, he was deported to Singapore, the Home Affairs ministry said. He was being held under Singapore's Internal Security Act, which allows authorities to indefinitely detain someone without trial. Mas Selamet slipped away from a detention center in Singapore after asking to use the toilet before a visit with his family, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng told lawmakers in parliament 2008. Journalist Baradan Kuppusamy contributed to this report.","Mas Selamat Kastari was arrested April 1 in Johor state in Malaysia .

"(CNN)  -- Hulk Hogan said his comments to Rolling Stone magazine that he can ""totally understand"" O.J. Simpson -- the former football great found liable for the deaths of his wife and another man -- are being misunderstood. Linda and Hulk Hogan enjoy happier times at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards in New York. The pro wrestling legend said Wednesday that he ""took the high road"" and ""didn't do the O.J. Simpson thing"" despite the pain of his bitter divorce fight with wife Linda. Hogan's lawyer said the quotes leaked to a gossip column have been taken out of context and the full article proves Hogan ""never condones the O.J. situation.""  Watch Hogan claim he was misquoted » . A spokesman for Linda Hogan said the statement amounts to a death threat and that her attorney is ""weighing all options necessary to protect his client."" ""His violent and scary mood swings have been my nightmare for too many years,"" Linda Hogan said Thursday in a written statement. ""I hope for the sake of our kids that he gets the psychological help for himself and the safety of others."" Her spokesman, Gary Smith, said, ""For those who buy his claim the comment was taken out of context, read the rest of Rolling Stone and determine for yourself if his suicidal tendencies coupled with the use of drugs and alcohol make him a danger."" The controversial quote is part of a eight-page feature article about Hogan to be published in the magazine's Friday edition. ""I could have turned everything into a crime scene like O.J., cutting everybody's throat,"" Hogan told Rolling Stone. ""You live half a mile from the 20,000-square-foot home you can't go to anymore, you're driving through downtown Clearwater [Florida] and see a 19-year-old boy driving your Escalade, and you know that a 19-year-old boy is sleeping in your bed, with your wife... . ""I totally understand O.J. I get it."" The controversy began with a leak of the quote to the New York Post's Page 6 gossip column. Hogan lawyer David Houston said that quote was ""part of a larger conversation to exemplify degrees of emotional turmoil."" ""Earlier reports to the contrary exemplify the danger of cherry-picking quotes and reacting to them,"" Houston said. Hogan spoke later Wednesday to a photographer with the gossip Web site TMZ: . ""I spent three days with a writer for Rolling Stone talking about being positive and happy and walking in the spirit of Christ. And he asked me, 'Well, why didn't you flip out?' Well, I didn't jump off the Empire State building, I didn't buy a white Bronco. I didn't do the O.J. Simpson thing. I took the high road. ""I'm not focused on Linda anymore,"" Hogan said. It has been widely reported that Linda Hogan, 49, is dating a younger man. She filed for divorce in 2007 after nearly 25 years of marriage. Simpson was found not guilty of murder in the 1994 stabbing deaths of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, but was found liable for their deaths by a civil court jury. Simpson later was found guilty in a Las Vegas, Nevada, armed robbery case and sentenced in December to up to 33 years in prison. Linda Hogan's spokesman linked the comments to the 55-year-old Hogan's three-decade career, during which he held multiple championship titles and, during his heyday in the 1980s, was easily the most popular wrestler in the world. ""We have always maintained that the fear that Linda has had to live with comes from the rage and instability much too often associated with pro wrestlers,"" Smith said in the statement. Hulk Hogan's real name is Terry Bollea. His wife alternately goes by Linda Hogan and Linda Bollea. CNN's Marc Balinsky contributed to this report.","Hulk Hogan, in a bitter divorce with his wife, Linda, talks to Rolling Stone magazine .

"(CNN) -- The mood at Hong Kong's Metropark Hotel was subdued Thursday -- but only because most of the guests were in their rooms nursing hangovers from a night of partying the evening before. Quarantined guests and hotel employees wave through the glass at Hong Kong's Metro Park Hotel. And with good reason. For seven days, the 200 guests and 100 staff members at this modest business hotel in the Wanchai bar district have been in involuntary confinement after health officials determined that a guest there had contracted swine flu. But in another 24 hours -- at 8:30 p.m. Friday to be precise, as guests kept reminding themselves -- they would be free to leave. ""Last evening, people perked up a bit,"" said Kevin Ireland, an Indian national. ""We're cheerful. We're happy we're getting out tomorrow."" For most of the guests here, it was a case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. They picked the same hotel as a 25-year-old guest from Mexico who tested positive for the H1N1 virus. And Hong Kong health officials -- unwilling to see a repeat of the SARS epidemic in 2004 that killed nearly 300 people -- placed the hotel on lockdown. That was last Friday night, when Ireland was headed out to grab some Italian food with friends but hotel staff stopped them at the door. Since then, the guests have kept themselves busy trying to ward off boredom as they waited out their seven-day confinement.  Images from a British hotel guest » . Most stayed cocooned in their tiny rooms, flipping through channels on the television or staying connected with their work colleagues via Internet chats. With no pool to lounge by and just one restaurant to pick from, guests milled about in the lobby to pick up food or get their temperatures taken once a day. ""We go down to the lobby for food and then back to the room to eat your food,"" said Leslie Carr, a British man. ""Not many people are downstairs hanging around to talk or discuss anything."" Outside, bars and clubs lay only a short walk away. But police in face masks stood guard at the door, barring exit. Packs of reporters and camera crews peered through the hotel's glass windows. The British contingent organized a quiz night once. When a French national had a birthday, the country's consulate sent wine and champagne. The Hong Kong government, itself, tried its best to make living arrangements as comfortable as possible. They delivered a box of chocolates to guests, comped their rooms and offered them free long-distance phone calls. But food was a constant complaint. Guests, tired of hotel fare, were allowed to order take-out -- a boom in business for area eateries. ""A tribal instinct sort of manifested itself,"" Ireland said. ""You get into linguistic groups. You hang with people of the same country and region."" Mark Moore, a British national, spent many hours kicking himself for changing his plans at the last minute -- the day before the quarantine. He was scheduled to fly home at the end of a business trip, but decided to spend the weekend visiting friends and family in Hong Kong. ""I wish I'd left the day before,"" Moore said. ""I definitely wish I'd gone home a day early."" Tempers sometimes flared. Guests questioned the point of a quarantine when they were allowed to flout health safety recommendations. Many walked around without the blue surgical masks they were expected to cover their mouth and noses with. Each also had to take a 10-day dose of anti-viral medication. None have tested positive for the virus. ""We were all using the same elevator when we knew the virus can spread through touching objects,"" Ireland said. ""The health workers worked in shifts. I don't know if they go home or to some other place where there's some sort of quarantine. And we're handing money to pay the people outside bringing our food. I'm not wearing gloves, the guy on the outside's not wearing gloves."" Hong Kong's Chief Executive Donald Tsang publicly apologized to the guests but said the precautions were needed. ""In view of the lack of data ... we have to be very cautious,"" added Yuen Kwok-Yung, a professor of microbiology of Hong Kong University. ""I believe that as time goes by, we can change our strategy."" By Thursday, many guests said they have paid their bills and packed their bags. All there was left to do is stare at the clock ticking away toward their release.","More than 340 people quarantined in Hong Kong following single case of H1N1 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal judge has ordered the immediate release into the United States of 17 Chinese Muslims who have been held for several years in the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A guard tower is visible behind razor wire at the military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina on Tuesday ordered the 17 detainees to appear in his Washington courtroom at 10 a.m. Friday and said he would hold a hearing next week to determine under what conditions they will be settled in the United States. The government late Tuesday afternoon announced it would file papers shortly with an appeals court seeking an emergency stay to stop the judge's order in its tracks. The detainees are ethnic Uighurs, from a mostly Muslim autonomous region in western China. They have been in government custody for seven years and have been cleared for release for the past four years to any country willing to take them. No countries have volunteered. The judge, visibly impatient, told government lawyers he wants no delays. ""There is a pressing need for them to be released,"" Urbina declared. When a government lawyer requested one week for authorities to determine how immigration authorities would handle a court-ordered arrival of individuals with no status, Urbina summarily rejected the request. He angrily demanded Immigration and Customs officials not even consider arresting the Uighurs upon arrival. ""I have issued an order. I do not want these people interfered with in any way,"" the judge said. Justice Department lawyers told the judge they will immediately appeal the ruling and seek a stay of the order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The Justice Department released a statement late Tuesday afternoon protesting Urbina's order.   ""Today's ruling presents serious national security and separation of powers concerns and raises unprecedented legal issues,"" said Justice Department chief spokesman Brian Roehrkasse. At the White House, Press Secretary Dana Perino warned the ruling represents a dangerous precedent. ""The district court's ruling, if allowed to stand, could be used as precedent for other detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, including sworn enemies of the United States suspected of planning the attacks of 9/11 who may also seek release into our country,"" she said. Dozens of colorfully dressed members of the Uighur community from the Washington area beamed as they left the courtroom and began embracing. ""We welcome this. It has been a very long time,"" said Amy Reger of the Uyghur Human Rights Project. The United States determined in 2004 the 17 Uighurs are not enemy combatants, but has kept them at Guantanamo while trying to persuade other countries to resettle them. Officials said they were not returned to China because of credible fears they could be mistreated if returned. The Uighurs fled Afghanistan shortly after the U.S.-led bombing campaign began in 2001. They were turned over to U.S. military officials by Pakistani authorities. U.S. intelligence officials alleged the Uighur detainees are associated with the East Turkmenistan Islamist Movement, which the administration designated a terrorist organization in 2002. Lawyers for the Uighurs dispute any terrorist connections. Attorneys for the 17 detainees promised the court that if the judge's ruling stands, a Lutheran church group in Maryland and other service groups are prepared to provide both short-term and long-term care and support for the freed prisoners. Seventeen Uighur homes have been identified to initially house the detainees. Urbina scheduled an October 16 hearing for immigration officials and other government agencies to discuss conditions for the 17 men.","Group of 17 Chinese Muslims must be released into United States, judge rules .

"Editor's note: John Feehery worked as a staffer for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. He is president of Feehery Group, a Washington-based advocacy firm that has represented clients including News Corp., Ford Motor Company and the United States Chamber of Commerce. He formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America. John Feehery says Republicans are poised to bounce back for several reasons. (CNN) -- ""It is important for us to have a strong Republican Party,"" Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tauntingly told a press conference on April 23. ""And I hope that the next generation will take back the Republican Party for the Grand Old Party that it used to be."" Thanks Mrs. Pelosi, for your best wishes. But be careful what you wish for. I wouldn't write the obituary for the Republican Party quite yet. Sure, things are looking grim at the moment. Yes, our Republican Party Chairman Michael Steele stumbled out of the starting gate, making several verbal gaffes, and raising questions about his competence. Yes, the latest poll numbers are in the toilet, showing only 21 percent of the American people call themselves Republicans. Yes, Arlen Specter decided the GOP was a drag on his personal political future. And yes, we lost a special election in upstate New York that maybe we should have won. But things change. Remember a year-and-a-half ago, when everybody thought the election would be a referendum on the Iraq war. Remember 10 months ago, when everyone thought that expensive gas was going to drive people to the polls. It turned out that, by the time of the election, the most important thing that people cared about was their declining 401ks or their lost job. Here are five reasons why the Republican Party will be back and perhaps sooner than anyone thinks: . 1) Overreach: Several of my Democratic friends over the last several months have tried to comfort me when discussing the fall of the Republican Party with one consoling thought: Don't worry, we will screw it up. And on that one thing I agree with them. The liberal Democrats that currently run the Congress are destined to overreach on the legislative front. Pelosi and her California allies, like Reps. Henry Waxman, George Miller and Pete Stark, tend to think the rest of America wants the same things they do, from higher taxes on energy to a national health care plan that could be a blueprint for socialized medicine, from abortion on demand to gay marriage. But most Americans actually look at California as an economic basket case and social mess. It is a beautiful state, but it is also completely screwed-up, thanks largely to liberal governance. The Democrats are certain to overdo it on the liberalism, and that will make the Republicans much more attractive in two to four years. 2) Checks and balances: Unlike the parliamentary governments of Europe, where one party runs everything until they mess up, the American system actually gives a preference to both parties having skin in the game. While most voters don't actually think ""divided government"" when they go to the polls, they do think that one-party government tends to lead to excess and corruption. That is why the people have a chance a mere two years after the president gets elected to give him a midterm report card in the form of Congressional elections. Most polls now show voters prefer a candidate who will serve as a check on President Obama's power. And for most voters, who see Pelosi and Nevada Sen. Harry Reid as even more liberal than the president, Republicans will serve as that check. 3) Crisis breeds renewal: When things are going well, a political party tends to discourage independent thought and enforce philosophical orthodoxy. But when a political party faces crisis, all of that goes out the window. It is a wide-open world right now for Republicans as they debate amongst themselves what the party truly stands for. The debate will be painful, as neoconservatives, paleo-conservatives, progressive conservatives, moderates and libertarians battle it out to chart the course for a new and more vibrant party. Republicans can afford to have these debates now when they are in the minority, because frankly, they have nothing else to do. The Democrats went through this process in the mid-90s, and they built a new party that attracted centrists like Mark Warner, without alienating old-line liberals like Pelosi or Waxman. 4) Talent senses opportunity: Investors know that the time to buy is not when the market is at its peak, but when the market is at the bottom. But it is not always easy to know when the bottom hits. In politics, it is pretty easy to know when a party has hit the bottom. And for the Republicans, it is now. Talented political entrepreneurs look to the GOP and see nothing but opportunity. The old bulls have been wiped out. The new guard is ready to start leading. In the House, young guns like Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan are charting the future for the next Republican takeover. Adam Putnam of Florida and Mark Kirk of Illinois are getting ready for state-wide runs. But it is not just the young guns. It also more experienced politicians, John Kasich and Rob Portman of Ohio, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, Jeb Bush of Florida, who see an opportunity to lead the party back to power. 5) The Republican Party is the de facto Libertarian Party: Most people I talk to think of themselves not as Republicans or Democrats, but as libertarians. Not libertarians in the political party sense, but libertarians in a deeper philosophical sense. They tend to want government to stay out of their lives as much as possible. They tend to distrust all politicians, and when they hear someone say, ""I am from the government, and I am here to help,"" they tend to laugh uproariously. It was Will Rogers who said, ""I don't make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts."" The Republican Party does best when it seeks to reform government, to lessen the power of the bureaucrat, and to fight to give more freedom to the people. When the GOP returns to that philosophical creed -- which it will do in the face of the Obama administration's vast expansion of government power -- its fortunes will brighten again. If the Republican Party were a stock, the smart investor would start buying it now. Yes, things look grim at the present time, but things change. The GOP is not dead yet, and Speaker Pelosi may see her wish of a resurgent Republican Party come true quicker than she anticipated. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Feehery.","John Feehery: The Republican Party is struggling, but isn't dead .
He says there are five good reasons to think the GOP will bounce back .
U.S. system is designed to provide checks on the majority party, he says .

"(CNN) -- While most parts of the country grapple with massive job loss and a deficit in new jobs, the South is faring a bit better. Hundreds stand in line at the Miami Dade College Mega Job Fair 2009 in Florida. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in December the South recorded one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country at 7 percent. According to Careerbuilder.com, the nation's largest online job site, the South continues to see growth in the oil and gas industries which means more job opportunities in related fields like engineering. As an attractive destination for senior citizens, the South is also a hot spot for those seeking employment in the health care field or industries that cater to older populations. Education also continues to be an area that many consider ""recession-proof."" CNN affiliates in the South report there is hope for those seeking jobs at job fairs which are drawing big crowds. Charlotte, North Carolina  In a competitive market, job seekers have to be creative and some are turning to Twitter to give them an edge. The Web site TweetMyJobs.com is an online service that couples the social networking capacity of Twitter with more traditional online job-search services. ""Pick a location and job type you are interested in -- you subscribe to that. Any time a new job comes out on TweetMyJobs.com, it will automatically be sent to your cell phone,"" Web site developer Gary Zukowski told News 14 Carolina. Read what developer told News 14 Carolina about the site . Antwon Keith, Mecklenburg County employment security commission manager, said that such an instantaneous job alert may be just what job seekers need to stay ahead of other applicants. His concern, he told the station, was that older applicants, who are currently flooding his office, may have a difficult time utilizing the online site. Hope for those in the financial sector  There is an expectation that some financial services companies in Charlotte will be hiring soon, a possible bright spot for those laid off from companies like Bank of America and Wachovia. Robert Half International conducts a hiring survey every three months and told WCNC that while some companies are planning reductions due to the economy, others will add staff. ""As companies have contracted and realized that their staff may be smaller than they like, they've been looking at the idea of possibly bringing in more talent,"" Michael Steinitz of Robert Half International said. ""And it's actually a really good time to improve your talent pool and make sure you have the best people on your staff."" Read about the hopeful survey .

They are also looking forward to the baseball season which is slated to bring new jobs. The Winston-Salem Dash baseball team has openings for batboys, ushers, attendants and other hourly positions. Read about resident's excitement over the ballpark jobs . Competition for the 150 positions has been fierce, especially since seasonal workers from last year have also been applying to regain their former jobs. Job seeker Akila Covington told the news channel that she has not worked in a long time and she hoped to land one of the positions to help provide for her family. ""I need this job badly,"" she said. ""I was working at US Airways last year and lost my job, so I've been out almost a year and most definitely, yeah, need the job."" Even those lucky enough to score a position won't begin immediately. Workers won't start until the new ballpark is completed and that date is still tentative, officials told WXII 12 News. Miami, Florida  More than 1,000 Floridians stood in line to meet recruiters for the second day of a job fair held at Miami-Dade College's North Campus.  Held March 3-4, the number of recruiters present was fewer than years past, but those on hand told local station WPLG there were jobs for qualified applicants.

"(CNN) -- Both people who died of swine flu in the United States had pre-existing health problems, federal health authorities said Thursday in a report. A student uses disinfectant as she arrives Thursday at the National Technical Institute in Mexico City. The 22-month-old child who died April 27 of the flu, also called H1N1, had neonatal myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease, said the report, which was written by a virus investigation team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. The child -- who was from Mexico and who fell ill while visiting relatives in Texas -- also had a heart defect, problems swallowing and chronic hypoxia, the report said. The 33-year-old Texas woman who died last week was pregnant when she became ill, the article said. She had been diagnosed with asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The details came in a summary of the 642 confirmed cases of H1N1 infection that were diagnosed between April 15 and May 5 in 41 states among patients ranging in age from 3 months to 81 years. Sixty percent were 18 years or younger and 18 percent had recently traveled to Mexico, the report said. It said that 36 of the 399 patients with confirmed H1N1 infection whose hospitalization status was known had been hospitalized. Of the 22 hospitalized patients for whom data were available, four were younger than 5. Nine had chronic medical conditions, some of which included Down Syndrome and congenital heart disease. Seven patients said they had traveled to Mexico during the week before onset of illness. Eleven of those 22 hospitalized patients had pneumonia and eight patients were treated in an intensive care unit. Four were placed on ventilators. As of Tuesday, 18 of the 22 patients who had been hospitalized had recovered, it said. In a conference call with reporters, CDC's Dr. Carolyn Bridges said epidemiologists would be scrutinizing the disease's spread in South America, where the cool season is set to begin. Flu virus ""prefers lower humidity and lower temperatures for transmission,"" she said. ""We'll be looking closely to the Southern Hemisphere during their winter to see what happens. That may give us some clues as to what to expect."" Brazil's health minister told reporters Thursday that four cases of H1N1 infection have been confirmed in Brazil. Three have been hospitalized and one is at home, said Health Minister Jose Gomes Temporao. One case is in Rio de Janeiro, two are in Sao Paolo and the fourth was in Minas Gerais in southeastern Brazil. Two of the patients had recently been in Mexico City; the other two had recently been in Florida, he said. Another 21 cases are suspected in Brazil, he said. In Buenos Aires, Health Minister Graciela Ocana confirmed Argentina's first H1N1 case -- a man who arrived April 25 from Mexico. The man was hospitalized in the capital and released after he recovered, Ocana said. The ultimate course of the disease remains unclear, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who is involved in the effort to create a vaccine. ""We may be seeing the tip of the iceberg,"" he told CNN. ""We can't make any definitive projections about where this is going. It appears to be acting like a typical seasonal flu, only it's out of season. We shouldn't be seeing this much influenza and it's with a new virus and that's the cause fo the concern."" Asked when a vaccine might be available, he said, ""We hope to get doses by mid- to late fall.""

"(The Frisky) -- When I asked an old friend why she hadn't just broken up with her live-in boyfriend instead of beginning a messy affair with a married neighbor, she snapped, ""Don't be stupid -- nobody leaves a relationship without having another one in place."" Overlappers refuse to end one relationship until they have another one in progress. Oh, please, I corrected her. Of course they do. People fall out of love or get angry and leave without a safety net all the time. But as I thought back, I realized that for as long as I knew her, she never had. Even when she pretty much hated the one she was with, she stuck it out until she'd lined up his replacement. I could never understand why. My friend is beautiful, successful and very smart; surely being single for a little while wouldn't end her world. Women aren't the only ones guilty of this. I know -- and have unfortunately dated -- plenty of men who careen from one girlfriend directly into another, often with a big fat overlap; connecting the two relationships like a murky Venn diagram. I understand that being single can be annoying and lonely sometimes, but there are plenty of good reasons not to be -- or date! -- an Overlapper. 1. Karma! While overlapping is definitely cheating, the difference is these types go into it with the sole purpose of transitioning into another relationship. But however you word it, Overlappers deceive one or both parties in order to get what they want. When you begin a relationship dishonestly, it usually comes back to bite you in the butt. At the very least, you will never be fully able to trust an Overlapper. Because -- as yet another cliche based in truth goes -- if he does it with you, he'll do it to you. 2. Drama! Breakups are never fun, however splits caused by infidelity are hands down the most explosive. If you're like my friend and her man (who, against all odds, actually left his wife), this means that instead of talking about hearts, flowers, and butterflies -- like other new couples -- you spend your nights plotting how to hide assets and whether or not your overpaid lawyer is enough of a shark. How romantic! 3. The Pressure! Though they may appear independent, people who can't be alone are that way because they need to see themselves reflected in someone else's adoring eyes. But when their mirror (aka, partner) develops a flaw (weight gain, job loss, etc.), their image of themselves reflects that. Being a narcissist, nothing less than perfection is acceptable, so they start looking for the next mirror. Got that, fatty? You'd better stay at the top of your game if you want to hang onto an Overlapper. 4. Not cute! ""I met my boyfriend when his puppy peed on my foot"" is the perfect example of a meet-cute story. It has all the key elements -- chance, humor, and, best of all, a cuddly puppy! ""I met my boyfriend because I was his kids' nanny and then his wife found out, which is how I got this black eye,"" is definitely not a tale you're going to want to share at parties.

"(CNN) -- This spring break, thousands of college students will ditch the bars and the beaches to do something more meaningful with their vacation time. Brad Vonck (bottom, left) and other student volunteers worked with the Cherokee Nation in Stilwell, Oklahoma. Brad Vonck is one of them. A sophomore at the University of Illinois, Vonck will travel to San Juan, Texas, in a group of 13 students to volunteer with La Union del Pueblo Entero, an organization that helps strengthen the communities and lives of farm workers and their families. ""Learning about different cultures is very important to me,"" Vonck said. ""I like to engage in different areas of life that I don't really understand."" Every year, more and more college students, like Vonck, are choosing to spend their valuable time off from school participating in ""alternative spring break"" programs -- community service-based opportunities dealing with the most pressing issues of the day, including hunger and homelessness, disaster relief and global warming. ""If you can name a social issue, then students are doing trips around it,"" said Jill Piacitelli, executive director of Break Away, an organization that trains and helps colleges across the United States promote alternative break programs. For the past six years, these programs have been growing in popularity among college students. Break Away estimated that this year, nearly 65,000 students will participate in its alternative break programs, an 11 percent increase from 2008. ""It's a student-led social movement. ... This is a group that very much wants to be involved in the world around them,"" Piacitelli said of the volunteers. ""They're solution-oriented. They want to innovate and lead and involve their peers."" The average domestic trip costs around $250 or $300, Piacitelli said, which includes ""housing, travel, social activities, food and often a donation to the community."" Many university programs offer financial aid and the option to raise money to help pay for trips. ""It is rare that anyone who wants to go on a trip cannot go,"" Piacitelli said. The affordability is part of the reason why so many students return for second or third trips. Nikunj Shah, a graduate of Arcadia University, has taken several alternative spring break trips volunteering in the United States and Mexico. This year, he will be traveling as an alumnus to Jean Lafitte, Louisiana, a city that has been largely ignored by disaster relief efforts in the wake of hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita. ""I've always had an interest in helping people. I've always been really involved in community service,"" Shah said. ""So I saw this as an opportunity to go places I haven't been before, to get a feel for different cultures and to help people there that truly need help."" In an effort to expand their alternative spring break options, universities across the United States partner with humanitarian organizations like the United Way of America. Randy Punley, director of corporate and media partnerships at the United Way, oversees the organization's Alternative Spring Break programs. After Hurricane Katrina, the United Way partnered with MTV to engage young people in the response effort. ""We knew there was an interest and a passion in young people for the work we were trying to achieve,"" Punley said. Since then, the United Way has evolved and expanded, establishing chapters on college campuses. The organization has also developed an Alternative Spring Break Social Media Challenge, encouraging young people to be active in their communities and use social media Web sites, like Facebook or Twitter, to involve other people. ""Whether it started with the first Gulf War, punctuated by the September 11 attacks and Katrina and the economic meltdown, young people have a very different perspective about what's going on in the world,"" Punley said. At the end of the weeklong trip, most students say it was the best week of their lives, Punley said. The increasing interest in these programs, Punley believes, speaks volumes about the attitudes of Generation Y, a group of people who are eager to make an impact on the world around them. ""It's such a difference from going home and not really feeling accomplished to going on these trips and meeting new people,"" Vonck said. ""You get experiences that you wouldn't get sitting on the couch watching TV for a week."" Piacitelli said these programs encourage young people to continue serving their communities and those in need. ""The students are the main benefactors of what goes on,"" Piacitelli said. ""It changes their consciousness. They get really interested in social issues ... They see themselves as active citizens, and helping the community becomes a priority."" Like Vonck and Shah, University of Illinois senior Adriana Collazo has a passion for community service. During her spring break last year, Collazo traveled to the Bronx in New York to volunteer at a homeless shelter. She stayed at a hostel with other volunteers and helped serve food and organize clothing drives. ""I never really had all that money to go off and do the whole Cancun, Mexico, spring break, and I didn't really want to, because I think that's throwing away money,"" Collazo said. ""When you can give back, it's selfish."" The trip to the Bronx was a personal one for Collazo who, at the age of 6, experienced poverty firsthand when her family became homeless. ""My family's better now, and I want to give back,"" Collazo said. ""I think a lot of students have realized that they can do better things with their time. ... It humbles you.""","""Alternative"" spring breaks are becoming more popular among college students .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani forces have killed as many as 200 Taliban militants in the past day in the Swat and Shangla areas, the military said Sunday. Pakistan has launched a massive military operation against the Taliban in the Swat Valley. CNN could not verify the account, because journalists are barred from the region. The military blamed the Taliban for injuring civilians as the offensive entered its third week. ""Indiscriminate mortar firing and planting of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] in the streets and roads by the miscreants in the populated areas of village Thana, Malakand and Mingora, resulted into civilian casualties,"" the military said in a statement.  Watch more on crisis » . The military eased a curfew on the region, allowing civilians to flee the fighting between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. (7 p.m. Saturday and 4 a.m. Sunday EDT).

At least two soldiers were killed Sunday, and another died of wounds he suffered on Friday, the military statement said.  Watch why civilians have backed the Taliban to survive » . The military has been releasing regular reports saying it has killed Taliban militants in the region, but it has produced little evidence of the successes it claims.

"(CNN) -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on Tuesday insisted that his country's nuclear arsenal is ""definitely safe,"" despite growing concerns about recent gains by the Taliban along the country's border with Afghanistan. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari insists his country's nuclear arsenal is ""definitely safe"" from militants. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Zardari responded to the fact that the United States doesn't know the locations of all of Pakistan's nuclear sites. He also addressed the Obama administrations concern over whether the weapons are vulnerable to Taliban fighters who are gaining control of some border regions. ""They can't take over,"" Zardari said, referring to militants. ""We have a 700,000 (person) army -- how could they take over?"" For the last two weeks, Pakistani troops have been battling Taliban fighters in Buner and Lower Dir, two districts bordering the Swat Valley -- a broad Taliban stronghold in Pakistan. Army generals claim to have killed scores of militants. Pakistan's government recently signed a deal that would allow Islamic law, or sharia, in the Swat Valley, in exchange for an end to fighting. Still, Pakistan's military is continuing an assault on militants in Taliban-held areas after they seized territory in violation of the agreement signed by Zardari. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama said Pakistan's government appears to be ""very fragile"" and argued that the United States has ""huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable"" and doesn't end up a ""nuclear-armed militant state."" And, after making two visits to Pakistan in the last three weeks, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, indicated Monday that he is ""gravely concerned"" about recent Taliban and al Qaeda gains across much of southern Afghanistan and in Pakistan. Pakistan's nuclear weapons are ""definitely safe,"" Zardari said Tuesday. ""First of all, they are in safe hands. There is a command and control system under the president of Pakistan. And Buner ... there has been fighting there before. There will be fighting there again and there will always be an issue of people in those mountains that we've been taking on."" Zardari's comments came as the Obama administration prepared for meetings set for Wednesday with Zardari and Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai to discuss security in the region. A senior administration official told reporters that the U.S. objective of the meetings is ""an alliance with these countries against a shared threat.""  Watch Pakistan's U.S. ambassador discuss the Taliban insurgency » . Zardari and Karzai will also be visiting key congressional leaders and policymakers in advance of meetings with Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A bill called the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, introduced by Sens. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Dick Lugar, R-Indiana, would authorize $7.5 billion in non-military aid to Pakistan over the next five years to foster economic growth and development, and another $7.5 billion for the following five years. Zardari, for his part, said he is grateful for the financial aid Pakistan has received from the United States, but said he needs ""more support."" ""I need drones to be part of my arsenal. I need that facility. I need that equipment. I need that to be my police arrangement,"" he said. The U.S. military has carried out airstrikes against militant targets in Pakistan, after Zardari's government was criticized for not cracking down on militants along the Afghan border. The unmanned drone attacks have rankled relations between Pakistan and Washington. Asked whether the U.S. strategy bothered him, Zardari said, ""Let's agree to disagree. ... We're still in dialogue."" Zardari also denied speculation by some Congressional lawmakers that his country has used most of the $10 billion given by the United States to strengthen its arsenal against a threat from nuclear rival India -- as opposed to going after the ongoing militant threat. ""They've given $10 billion in 10 years, a billion nearly a year for the war effort in -- against the Taliban, and the war that is going on,"" he said. Zardari also addressed his government's apparent resistance to significant U.S. involvement on Pakistani soil. Recently, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates observed, ""There has been a reluctance on their part up to now. They don't like the idea of a significant American military footprint inside Pakistan. I understand that. And -- but we are willing to do pretty much whatever we can to help the Pakistanis in this situation."" Zardari called Pakistan's relationship ""pretty strong"" and said, ""We are asking. We've been asking for a lot of help, and it has been in the pipeline for a long time.""","Pakistani President insists his state's nuclear arsenal is safe, despite Taliban gains .

"Editor's note: Simon Johnson, a former International Monetary Fund chief economist, is a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Peter Boone is chairman of Effective Intervention, a UK-based charity, and a research associate at the Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics. They run http://baselinescenario.com/, a global economy Web site. Simon Johnson, above, and Peter Boone say the U.S. could be in for a long period of virtually no growth. (CNN) -- Euphoria returns! Who could have guessed that Bank of America stock would rally 70 percent the week it learns the Feds are demanding new capital equal to nearly half the bank's market capitalization? The ongoing grim news -- on rising unemployment, continued (albeit slower) economic decline, and ordinary working Americans being hammered on all sides -- is being ignored by stock and commodity markets. Is America now back on track for growth? The answer to that is almost surely no. Rising stock markets don't necessarily mean a sharp recovery is under way. Consider the case of Japan in its first lost decade of the 1990s. After falling 63 percent from its peak in late 1989, the Nikkei staged a 32 percent rally in one month. It then remained volatile but around the same level for nearly 10 years -- because the return on assets and capital investors could earn proved so low throughout that economy. During the 1990s, Japan's banking system was burdened with bad loans that kept eating into profits and its nonfinancial companies had excess capacity that had to be wound down; these problems were made worse by a decline in the working population. The initial excess of capital, supplemented by high ongoing savings from households and corporations, kept interest rates low. Throughout this period the price/earnings ratio on stocks ranged from 30 to 50 (it's 51 today), compared with 15 to 20 in Europe and the United States. The logic was simple: With so little return available on all assets, local investors were willing to pay up for stocks even if the dividends were a paltry 1-2 percent. Does this sound familiar? We think so. The current rally in stocks marks one clear success -- the fear of a systemic collapse due to loss of confidence in our financial system has subsided. This is good news, and an important achievement of President Obama's team. However, our ""turning Japanese"" phase may just have begun. The ""stress tests"" that were just completed do not mark the renewed health of our banking system. We still have 22 percent of Americans with houses worth less than their mortgages, and there are parallel problems for commercial property and other sectors. Many bankruptcies are yet to come. Most publicly traded large homebuilders are deep in debt, yet they are burning cash and waiting to see if -- magically -- the two-year stock of unsold housing can somehow disappear. We've barely begun to downsize our auto industry, and the parts suppliers and dealers that go along with it, to reflect the lower level of consumer spending and scarcer availability of credit for the future. All of this is also true across much of Europe. In essence, Europe and the United States both are saddled with zombie banks (which don't really lend), zombie corporations (which don't grow), and a decline in the relative size of the working population (as more people try to retire). This ""Japanese"" scenario can persist for many years. The biggest risk now is that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury try to re-leverage our way out of a Japanese-style prolonged recession by flooding the economy with cheap credit -- like they did in 2002, but to an even greater degree. Cheap government finance for powerful banks is a great cocktail for re-election; running stress tests that weren't really stressful is a good indication this is where policy is heading. This time the money won't come from consumers (or from China, as it did after 2002); it will be American and European central banks providing funds and our governments running massive budget deficits. If this is the strategy, the next crisis will be even more traumatic. Budget deficits over 10 percent of Gross Domestic Product and trillions of dollars of new loans to the banks from the Federal Reserve are recipes for hyperinflation and, if the Fed and Treasury don't pull away the punch bowl soon, sharply increasing inflation is very much in the cards. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Johnson and Peter Boone.","Johnson, Boone: Stocks are rallying as if economy is out of the woods .
They say that's premature, and we could be in for a long period of stagnation .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A second lingerie-modeling photo of Miss California USA Carrie Prejean has appeared after she assured pageant officials this week that the earlier shot was the only one she had appeared in. Miss California USA Carrie Prejean may lose her crown because of some semi-nude photos she appeared in. The Web site that published the first picture published a second one Wednesday. It had already promised to ""slowly roll out"" more photos. After the appearance of the first photo, the possibility that racier images could emerge prompted ""closed-door meetings"" Tuesday to consider stripping Prejean of her beauty queen title, pageant spokesman Ron Neal said. Although Neal said Prejean ""breached her contract"" by keeping the semi-nude photo or photos a secret, the only pictures published so far appear about as revealing as the bikini Prejean wore in the pageant's swimsuit competition. ""We have been told by Carrie Prejean there are no other photos other than the one circulating in existence. She should know better than anyone,"" Miss California USA Director Keith Lewis said Wednesday before the latest photo was released.  Watch reaction to racy photos » . Pageant officials were not immediately available for comment on the new picture. The 21-year-old Miss USA contestant has been the center of controversy since she declared her opposition to same-sex marriage in a response to a question on the national pageant stage last month. She finished as runner-up to Miss USA. In a statement given to CNN on Tuesday, Prejean said the photos -- and she did use the plural -- were being used in a ""vicious and mean-spirited"" effort to silence her for ""defending traditional marriage."" While she vowed to ""continue to support and defend marriage as the honorable institution it is,"" Prejean may be doing so without the Miss California USA title. State pageant officials met Tuesday with lawyers and representatives of Donald Trump, who owns the international competition, to consider whether they had grounds to take the crown away from Prejean, according to Neal. ""When you compete for Miss California, you're supposed to disclose whether you posed for nude or semi-nude photos, because it's grounds for disqualification,"" he said. CNN obtained a copy of the pageant contract Prejean signed last year, in which she agreed that the discovery of semi-nude photos could mean disqualification. The first photo made public shows Prejean -- who said she was 17 at the time -- wearing pink panties and no top. She is turned away from the camera, with her arm hiding most of her breast. The second photo is essentially the same, but Prejean is looking over her opposite shoulder. It was unclear whether pageant officials would consider that a semi-nude photo, in light of their standard requirement that contestants parade across stage wearing a bikini that arguably shows more skin. Ahead of the second photo being published, Nik Richie -- of TheDirty.com -- said he was upgrading his Web site's servers to handle the flood of traffic he expects will come after he posts the additional photos. ""I will slowly roll these out,"" Richie said. The Web site appeared to be overwhelmed by traffic early Thursday. CNN tried to access it, but could not. ""We'll see what happens with those and we want to know who's releasing them,"" Neal said. Shanna Moakler, the co-executive director of the Miss California USA organization, will meet with Tami Farrell, the runner-up for the title, ""to discuss the possible next steps,"" Neal said. Prejean defended the photos, which she said were taken when she was a teenager aspiring to be a Victoria's Secret model. ""I am a Christian, and I am a model,"" she said. ""Models pose for pictures, including lingerie and swimwear photos."" She said the photos ""have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith."" ""I am not perfect, and I will never claim to be,"" she said. ""But these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive. While we may not agree on every issue, we should show respect for others' opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean-spirited attacks."" Her publicist, Melany Ethridge, confirmed a comment she gave to celebrity Web site TMZ in which she said Prejean was 17 when she posed for the photos, hoping they would land her a modeling job. ""In her naivete, an agent convinced her to pose for this photo to submit to a lingerie company, claiming they could make her the next Victoria's Secret model,"" Ethridge told TMZ. ""She has since learned what a lie that was, and what a mistake it was to have the photo taken."" Prejean announced last week that she would star in a new $1.5 million ad campaign supporting ""opposite marriage"" (marriage between a man and a woman) funded by the National Organization for Marriage. ""Marriage is good,"" Prejean said at a news conference announcing the ad campaign. ""There is something special about unions of husband and wife. Unless we bring men and women together, children will not have mothers and fathers."" CNN's Aileen Martinez contributed to this report.","Miss California USA Carrie Prejean says she posed for one semi-nude photo .

"DUBLIN, Ireland (CNN) -- Jane Orobator lives in a small house in Dublin, Ireland. She's a full time psychology student at Trinity college and she is single-handedly raising 3 girls aged 9 to 14. Their smiling faces are framed in photos on the walls at home -- the only ornaments in an otherwise sparsely decorated house. An emotional Jane Orabator said her daughter's arrest made her world crumble like a pack of cards. But there is one family member missing from these photos: the oldest sister, Samantha, now 21, in prison in Laos charged with smuggling heroin. ""My life, my world is crumbling like a pack of cards right before me,"" Jane Orobator told CNN in an emotional interview. ""Samantha has never given me any cause to worry."" Over the course of a 90-minute interview with CNN, Orobator frequently broke down in tears. At one point, she collapsed to her knees and begged for her daughter's release. But Jane Orobator is clearly baffled and mystified as to how her daughter ended up in Laos in the first place. Samantha Orobator was born in Nigeria. Her family sent her to London, England, to live with her aunt when she was 8 years old to escape the political strife back home. By many accounts, Samantha was a happy and popular child. She achieved good grades and excelled in biology, hoping to become a surgeon. ""A really nice child, who loved school, good friends, respected the staff, behaved herself and achieved good academic results,"" recalls school headmaster Serge Cefai. ""We're extremely surprised,"" he says, ""We've had some of her ex-friends get in touch with the school saying 'What do you know?' Well, we only know what the media has told us and what's now coming out. And everybody is in the same boat. Samantha couldn't be involved in drugs, could she?"" Jane Orobator describes her daughter as quiet, petite and ""fragile."" Her daughter never mentioned any boyfriends and didn't smoke or drink, she says. In fact, Samantha's life was so trouble-free that when her mother and three sisters eventually moved to Dublin, Ireland, the family decided that she should stay with her friends and school in London. Friends say she was popular and outgoing, but that she also had an adventurous streak. Her former classmate Ronke Oseni describes a fun-loving girl with a passion for travel. ""The thing about Samantha is that she likes to travel and do new things,"" she explains. ""She's very funny, like extremely funny, the weirdest sense of humor, very articulate, very hard working."" But the last time Oseni talked to her friend was in June last year. She did not mention any plans to go overseas. In fact, Samantha was planning a holiday, says her mother. Jane Orobator last talked to her daughter in July when she was traveling with friends in Holland. But Samantha did not mention any details about who she was traveling with or where she was going next. In August Samantha was arrested at the Wattan Airport in Vientiane, Laos, allegedly in possession of 1.5 pounds of heroin -- an offense punishable by death. How did Samantha end up here? Jane Orobator doesn't know. British consular officials contacted her sister, the aunt who raised Samantha, in September, informing the family that she was in jail. When Jane Orobator discussed it with her sister, both women dismissed it as impossible. ""I just didn't believe it. It was totally out of character."" She told us, ""I thought it was her passport that someone else was using. And I was furious that Samantha had lost her passport or given it to someone else."" It wasn't until January that British consular officials contacted Jane Orobator directly and confirmed that the woman inside the Phothong prison in Laos was indeed her daughter. And the nightmare got worse: She was told Samantha was five months pregnant. ""I've not been able to comprehend it. Being there. Samantha? Arrested? Five months later she is pregnant?"" she says. ""Because it's like a puzzle. I'm still trying to figure out how she got there. I have not been able to figure that out. Suddenly, she's pregnant."" Oseni and other friends have rallied to her side and support groups have sprouted across the Internet -- hoping public pressure will lead to her release. There is a glimmer of hope: The Laos government said Samantha Orobator will no longer face the death penalty, because Laotian law does not allow the execution of a pregnant woman. Also, a new prisoner transfer agreement signed Thursday between Laos and Britain may allow Samantha to serve her prison term here in Britain. ""It is good news that she might be able to come here and if she's found guilty and has to serve her sentence here, at least I can visit her because where she is no one can visit her,"" said Oseni. ""She's a strong person. She has a strong character. She can defy any odds."" But for Jane Orobator, the ordeal is not over yet. She still fears that conditions in the Phothong prison may be too harsh for her daughter. ""Technically, they haven't killed her by firing squad. They have killed her the other way around. Because they can never give her the care she needs. Because the circumstances of the pregnancy, the psychological torment she's going through."" Jane Orobator says she is waiting for her Irish passport. She then hopes to travel to Laos and see her daughter before her trial starts, possibly as early as next week.","Mom: ""Samantha has never given me any cause to worry""

"(CNN) -- Toney Dixon's fascination with dead bodies goes back to her childhood, when she would sneak around her uncle's funeral home and watch him prepare bodies. The bodies on display are plastinated, a process that replaces bodily fluids and fat with plastic. ""I found my heart racing,"" said Dixon, 67. ""But instead of being taken aback and terrified, I wanted to know more."" Years later, Dixon's curiosity drew her and her twin sister, Erlyene Toney-Alvarez, to Body Worlds, an exhibit that shows preserved human specimens bisected and stripped of skin. ""It's like standing in the mirror and seeing yourself in a totally new way,"" said Dixon, the younger twin. The twins were so impressed that they signed up on the spot to donate their earthly remains to the exhibit, which is currently showing in the United States, Canada, England and Germany. With their signatures, the women joined a group of people who believe that having their bodies dissected, preserved and displayed will serve a greater purpose than burial or cremation. Body Worlds' donor program boasts about 800 people in North America and 8,600 worldwide. ""I thought, since I like to think outside the box, this would be a really good way to preserve our bodies instead of the typical funeral,"" Toney-Alvarez said. ""It's also something I can go to my death feeling good about, like I made a contribution to humankind."" Individual Americans have had the right to bequeath their bodies to science since 1965, when the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act established the human body as property. With that law, a donor's wishes superseded those of the next of kin. But academics in the field of gross anatomy attribute recent increases in body donations to relaxed social mores, according to an article published by the Association of American Medical Colleges. Traditionally, medical schools have been the most common recipients of willed specimens in America. Then, in 1993, controversial German anatomist Gunther von Hagens emerged with an alternative. Von Hagens, a self-styled iconoclast who earned the moniker Dr. Frankenstein in Europe for performing a public dissection, invented plastination in the 1970s.  See photos of the Body Worlds exhibit » . He spent the next few years popularizing and refining the process, which replaces bodily fluids and fat with plastic, earning equal shares of admiration and infamy. In 1993, von Hagens founded the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany, a research center that performs plastination and manages the Body Worlds exhibits. The Institute produces specimens for Body Worlds exhibits and academic institutions that pay anywhere from $200 to $60,000 for them. Von Hagens says he relies on donors not only as a source of specimens, but also as representations of Body Worlds' philosophy. ""I feel it is in line with democratic principles that you can decide in your lifetime whether to go to the cemetery or put yourself on display in an exhibition to teach the next generation,"" von Hagens said in a recent telephone interview. Von Hagens says the Body Worlds donor program distinguishes it from similar exhibitions that have used bodies of questionable origin. In a settlement with the New York State Attorney General's Office, Premier Exhibitions admitted that the specimens used in ""Bodies ... The Exhibit"" might be victims of torture or execution from Chinese prisons. The settlement requires that Premier Exhibitions obtain proof of donor consent for specimens used in its shows. The company has also set up a fund to compensate visitors to its New York show. Legislation is pending in several states that would require shows like Body Worlds to prove donor consent before they open. Von Hagens has weathered similar allegations over the years. He insists that the specimens in Body Worlds exhibits come from donors. He has done some plastination work on bodies from China at the request of medical schools and universities, but these bodies were not put on display. ""It is very, very important for the donors to know the purpose of the exhibit, that it is not entertainment, it is education and enlightenment,"" von Hagens said. ""I have to be in peace with those on display."" The donors meet periodically at conferences, where they catch up with each other and with von Hagens. Recently, the sisters attended a donor conference in Los Angeles, California, with their mother, Irma Henry, who signed on in 1997. Marc Rohner donated his leg to Body Worlds because he wanted others to learn from it. ""What you see in a picture or on ""CSI"" does not do justice to what the real human body looks like or how it functions,"" said Rohner, whose leg was amputated in 2006 to remove a malignant giant cell tumor. ""By having a three-dimensional leg or black lung in front of you, you have areas of focus and details you can't see in a photo."" With his donation, Rohner, a pathologist's assistant in Columbus, Ohio, became the first living person to give a body part to the Institute. Rohner acknowledges that the exhibits are not for everyone. Church groups in Europe have repeatedly denounced the shows as disrespectful, and skeptics around the world continue to question whether the Body Worlds specimens really are from legitimate sources. But Toney-Alvarez says she will visit Body Worlds, even if her mother and sister are on display. ""Once you have passed on, it's just a shell. The memories are in the heart and in the mind,"" she said.","Body Worlds was created by Gunther von Hagens, who invented plastination .

"(CNN)  -- Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad has submitted his letter of resignation, the prime minister's office told CNN on Saturday. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's resignation may smooth the way for a unity government. Considered a political independent, Fayyad was appointed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in June 2007 to be prime minister. Fayyad's decision may help smooth the way for a Palestinian unity government that would be acceptable to both Hamas and Fatah, the region's two main political parties, as well as the international community. Officials have argued a neutral government would be crucial to getting aid into Gaza to help with reconstruction and humanitarian relief. Palestinians unsuccessfully tried their hand at a unity government in the spring of 2007, with the mediation of Saudi Arabia. The experiment ended in June of that year with Hamas taking over Gaza, leaving Fatah in charge in the West Bank. Fayyad, a well-regarded international economist, was finance minister during the short-lived unity government in 2007. CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad steps down .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- In a major shake-up the likes of which Cubans have not seen for decades, President Raul Castro on Monday reorganized his Cabinet, replacing longtime aides to his brother Fidel, who resigned from office a year ago, citing poor health. Cuban President Raul Castro is moving his own people into power, analysts say. Some analysts said the changes appear to be an attempt by Raul Castro to put his own supporters into positions of power. Among the changes: . Felipe Perez Roque, the 43-year-old foreign minister, was replaced by his deputy, Bruno Rodriguez Aprilla. Carlos Lage Davila, an economist, lost his job as Cabinet secretary, but no mention was made of removing him from his other post as vice president of the Council of State. Lage, who helped guide the nation through its ""special period"" of dire economic times in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the loss of billions in subsidies, was replaced by Brig. Gen. Jose Amado Ricardo Guerra; Raul Castro is also commander in chief of the armed forces. ""It looks like Raul putting some of his own people in,"" said Wayne Smith, director of the Cuba program at the Center for International Policy in Washington, who led the U.S. Interests Section in Havana during the Carter administration. Smith noted that Cuba's government underwent ""quite a few shake-ups after the revolution first came in"" in 1959, but said Monday's move ""is the biggest shake-up that I've seen in a very long time ... for the last 30 or 40 years."" ""This is obviously a major move,"" concurred Vicki Huddleston, who led the Interests Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and is a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""[There is] nothing like this that I can recall since the late 1960s."" She noted that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez met with both Castro brothers during a visit late in February to Havana, on what Granma described as a ""work visit,""  and speculated that Raul Castro may have asked him then to buy in on the changes. ""They really need Chavez to be on board, because without the subsidized oil from Venezuela, they're dead,"" Huddleston said. With the Cuban economy hamstrung by the world economy, Raul Castro may have decided it is time for him to make reforms of his own without worrying about second-guessing by his brother or his brother's allies, she said. Huddleston speculated that the changes could portend the government once again allowing private enterprise to flourish in Cuba. Communist leader Fidel Castro experimented with that during the 1990s, but pulled back. ""It represents a significant step by Raul Castro to gain autonomy and, essentially, distance himself from Fidel's old gang,"" said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs. ""In other words, he feels confident enough that he has an independent base of power."" He said Raul Castro's moves to date have proven popular not only with his party members, but also with the general population. Still, Raul Castro should not take that support for granted, Birns said. ""It may be that, if he makes too many moves, the party will feel that their privileges are being taken away, and that will make them unhappy."" Otto Reich, who served as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs during the George W. Bush administration, said he was withholding judgment. ""It's a little early to tell what this really means,"" he said. ""Some people are saying the Fidelistas are being replaced by the Raulistas. But the other side is: Are we talking about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic?"" The state-run newspaper Granma published an official notice from the State Council that said the changes were intended to form a structure that is ""more compact and functional, with fewer organisms of the central administration of the state and a better distribution of the functions that they carry out."" CNN's Morgan Neill and Shasta Darlington in Havana, Tom Watkins and Arthur Brice contributed to this story.","Several longtime aides to Fidel Castro are replaced .

"(CNN)  -- Is the movie cop thriller heading for retirement? Colin Farrell, left, and Edward Norton star in ""Pride and Glory"" as New York cops. It seems incredible to suggest that such a popular form of storytelling might be on the way out, but it's happened before: Musicals and westerns were once staple entertainment for the moviegoing masses, and somewhere in the 1970s they just went thataway. Now the musicals and westerns that emerge are considered unusual. So consider: Last week the top box-office draw in the country was ""Max Payne"" with Mark Wahlberg as an obsessed cop tracking down the killer who murdered his wife and child. Based on a video game, ""Max Payne"" takes a rudimentary plot and boils it down still further, to the point where it's worse than predictable. The film's attraction (such as it is) isn't found in story, but in decoration: the blue-filtered chiaroscuro and etch-y comic book compositions, how the snow glints under the streetlights. ""Pride and Glory,"" on the other hand, is resolutely old school. Not only is it not based on a video game, it's hard to imagine that any of the characters has played one -- or seen a movie either.  Watch behind the scenes at ""Pride and Glory"" » . The time period isn't specified, but it seems to be today, going on 1974. Written by ""Tumbleweeds"" director Gavin O'Connor and Joe Carnahan (""Narc""), based on a story O'Connor put together with his twin brother Greg and ex-New York cop Robert Hopes, this is one of those movies that wants to emulate the serious side of '70s cinema, to dig into thorny ethical quandaries and alert us to institutional corruption. Unfortunately, it does a poor job. This time Edward Norton is the alienated cop, Ray Tierney. Like Max Payne, he's stepped away from the street to nurse his own grievances -- he bears an ugly scar down his cheek from an incident referred to only obliquely. The details remain hazy, but it casts a ""Chinatown""-size cloud over Ray and probably accounts for the state of his marriage -- which is over -- and the fact that he's sleeping on his dad's leaky sailboat. There's considerably more plot in ""Pride and Glory"" than in ""Max Payne,"" but it's only marginally less predictable. A shooting puts four cops down -- all of them from the command of Ray's brother Francis (Noah Emmerich). Francis is devastated, and the boys' father, Francis Sr. (Jon Voight), insists Ray must step up and take charge of the investigation. The Tierney clan has another cop in the family: Jimmy (Colin Farrell) is married to their sister (Lake Bell). We soon realize Jimmy's hands are dirty. But what will Ray do about it? If you've seen your Sidney Lumet movies -- ""Serpico,"" ""Prince of the City,"" ""Q&A"" -- then you'll be well ahead of the game. Even if you haven't, you'll have seen the cop shows that drew from them. Which is why almost every scene, every line of dialogue in ""Pride and Glory"" has the dull thud of cliche. ""We can't keep doing this,"" moans Ray's soon-to-be ex-wife. Any regular moviegoer will know exactly what she means: How many more times will we have to suffer this déja-vu? Granted, originality isn't everything. Last year, James Grey's ""We Own the Night"" invested a very similar story with subtle character shadings and a subversive edge. What's most disappointing about O'Connor's capably acted but gloomy and portentous movie is how it shies away from any real complexity. The Tierneys may have their faults, but the outsider, Jimmy, is the bad egg (we gather that much when he threatens a baby with a hot iron). When push comes to shove, the brothers do the right thing in a climax so stock you could use it to make gravy. The old school was better than this. And, back then, it wasn't old either. ""Pride and Glory"" is rated R and runs 129 minutes. For Entertainment Weekly's take, click here.","""Pride and Glory"" wants to be cop thriller throwback; instead it's just predictable .

"(CNN) -- The weather can affect your travel, your mood and apparently the size of your family. Edie is a proud blizzard baby, and her parents have already bought her a snowsuit for this year. Denver hospitals are reporting a baby boom, which is arriving about nine months after two blizzards walloped Colorado's capital city. With roads shut down for days, couples were stuck at home and apparently cuddled up to stay warm. Marjorie Silva told the Rocky Mountain News that she has a new baby because she didn't want her husband to play in the snow during the blizzard. ""It was cold, and we took a bath together,"" she told the newspaper, referring to husband Hansell. ""And one thing led to another. He wanted to go outside and play with the snow, and I didn't want to. ... We just ate and stayed in bed."" Hospital staffers are working extra hours and using an overflow unit to take care of all the new babies and moms at Avista Adventist Hospital in suburban Louisville, according to Lynne Snyder, the director of women's services. One baby couldn't wait to get to the second-floor delivery room. The doctors had to go to Mom at the bottom of the stairs, and everyone went into the emergency room to help the infant into into the world. The infants are going home with T-shirts pronouncing them proud to be a blizzard baby.  Dad: We waited nine months for our Christmas present » . Edie Coddington is wearing one of those shirts, even though her parents, Odele and Ian, were out of town when the storms hit. They were visiting family in Calgary and had to wait until the two blizzards cleared before they could get back to Colorado. Edie was a very happy surprise, Odele Coddington said. Their joy is shared by co-workers who are having an ""enormous rash"" of blizzard babies, Ian Coddington said, adding that company picnics will be very entertaining in about five years, when the babies are older and running around. For now, more babies may be on the way. Sky Ridge Medical Center, just south of Denver, expects a 20 percent increase in deliveries in October. One doctor at the hospital told CNN affiliate KMGH that he expects the baby boom to last for couple of more months. ""The snow stayed on the ground throughout December, January, and into February. My theory is that the cabin fever didn't set in until a little bit later,"" Dr. Steve Grover said. Although the new parents and hospitals are having fun with the term blizzard babies, officials say it will be months before it can be determined whether there is any connection between the blizzards and the new arrivals. And previous purported baby booms have been discounted after experts studied the numbers, according to The Associated Press. University of North Carolina and Duke University researchers found there were no booms after the New York City blackouts in 1965 and 1977. But already, Denver-area businesses say they are benefiting from a boom in sales. ""We've also been selling a lot of diaper bags and blankets. I'm completely wiped out of blankets. I can't keep up with the blankets,"" Linde Schlumbohm, the owner of Studio Bini, told the TV station. E-mail to a friend .","Denver hospitals reporting increase in baby deliveries .

"(ESSENCE.com) -- While the country celebrates the first black president, African-Americans are facing critical challenges from high unemployment, home foreclosures and a record number of black men in prison. Marc Morial is president and CEO of the National Urban League. Despite these disparities and the fact that African-Americans have been hit hardest by the current economic meltdown, a recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that 59 percent of African-Americans believe the country has made real progress in race relations, a 30 percent jump from last year. The National Urban League, in its report ""The State of Black America 2009,"" acknowledges the feeling of hope the Obama administration brings, but demands the president examine the sobering issues facing African-Americans. ESSENCE.com asked president and CEO of the Urban League Marc H. Morial whether or not the sentiments reflected in the poll mirror the national Black perspective. ESSENCE: With all of these factors that are challenging the African-American community today, do you really believe most of us feel like race relations between blacks and whites have improved?  See how a few Americans feel about race relations » . Marc H. Morial: I know that a poll is a snapshot of time, and while it's important to keep the proper context, this is a positive thing. Yes, people are beginning to have a healthier view of race relations. But we must keep in mind the underlying conditions that people are currently living in. There are still very significant disparities between blacks and whites in America. The unemployment rate in the current recession is but one example. ESSENCE: Do you believe the election of the first African-American president had anything to do with the change in black attitude toward the future of the U.S.? Morial: This is clearly a visible example of the effect of President Obama's election. It has created hope, optimism and a better way of thinking about the issue of race. I just hope that it's sustainable. If it's sustainable, it means we can work towards addressing and alleviating some of those underlying conditions. We should hope that it maintains and translates into positive action to try to close some of the difficult challenges like the economic gap and the housing problem. ESSENCE: Does it surprise you that white people had an equally positive outlook on race relations? Morial: Not in light of Obama. He got more white votes than Kerry or Gore. He also got a higher black turnout than at any other time in American history. So he has demonstrated this unique important ability at the national level to appeal to a broad cross-section of people. People place a considerable amount of trust and optimism in his leadership.  Watch an Essence editor talk about her interview with Michelle Obama » . ESSENCE: How have organizations like the National Urban League reinforced this new attitude about race? Morial: I really believe a great deal has to do with President Obama. To have that kind of effect and impact means that people are willing to move forward and they believe and hope that things are getting better. Our mission at the National Urban League is to help children and adults, young and old, achieve economic parity, through programs and public policy. Those that have worked in the trenches for many years to improve relations and conditions deserve some credit, but the issue for us is about sustainability and transferability.  Have race relations improved? Watch to find out » . We want to see this epidemic of high school dropouts improve. We want to see this disparity that exists in economics reduced.

"LONDON, England -- In his autobiography, Eric Clapton admits that he enjoys nothing more than sitting in a deck chair on a white sandy beach watching his children playing in the sea. Private getaway: Eric Clapton enjoys spending time relaxing on his superyacht Va Bene. It's the perfect antidote to a punishing tour schedule, and with gigs in the U.S., Canada, the UK, Scandinavia and Europe so far this year, getting away from it all is an experience he values. He found that he was particularly at ease aboard the 157 ft (47.8m) motor yacht Va Bene, which he chartered in 2005 and cruised with friends around the Mediterranean. The sheltered port of Bonifacio at the southern end of Corsica became one of his favorite haunts. In fact, Clapton enjoyed Va Bene so much that he bought her. It was the first time he'd ever had to borrow money to buy something, but he had fallen for the yacht, despite her 13 years and slightly dated looks. Besides there was always the possibility of updating her to give her a new lease of life. Va Bene came with an interesting pedigree. She had originally been commissioned by a Greek ship owner in 1992 to a design by Richard Hein (of Oceanco fame) and built by Kees Cornelissen in Holland. She was then purchased by F1 motor racing supremo Bernie Ecclestone before being sold to an American. A steel-hulled displacement yacht with a cruising speed of about 14 knots, Va Bene can accommodate 12 guests in six separate sleeping cabins and has a crew complement of 13. Having lived with Va Bene for a couple of years, Eric Clapton finally felt the time was right for a refit. Clapton was particularly keen for the work to be carried out in the UK, partly because he wanted to buy British but also because he could keep a close eye on proceedings. Pendennis Shipyard in Falmouth, Cornwall, was an obvious choice. Roger Taylor, the drummer with Queen has his yacht Tiger Lilly refitted regularly in Falmouth and Pete Townsend of the Who is another famous client. Pendennis Shipyard representative Alastair Heane was first introduced to the yacht during the charter show in Antigua in December 2006. Eric Clapton has a house on the island and Va Bene is based here during the winter season. Heane quickly established a detailed proposal of work. The plan was to get Va Bene to Falmouth after Clapton had finished his 2007 summer holiday so that the work could be carried out during the winter. The initial time frame was three months but like most complex refits this quickly extended to six as the work list grew. The target was to have Va Bene ready and waiting in Porto Cervo Sardinia on July 1 this year in time for Eric Clapton's month-long family holiday -- a date that was set in stone to fit around his tour schedule. We caught up with Va Bene during a photo shoot at the end of June 2008 on the very day she was setting sail from Palma, Mallorca, to meet up with the boss in Sardinia. With the final last-minute touches still being applied and the crew busily unpacking everything from the owner's precious guitar to his children's cuddly toys, it was a close run thing but Pendennis had met the deadline in style. The first thing that strikes you on boarding Va Bene is the calm, informal atmosphere of what is clearly a much-loved family yacht rather than a glitzy monument to success. Eric Clapton may be one of the world's greatest living rock stars but he is also an unpretentious family man who wants a yacht that he can relax on. The saloon encapsulates this perfectly. Rather than a single formal space with designer furniture that look so immaculate you hardly dare sit down, Va Bene's saloon is divided into four separate areas with clusters of contrasting chairs, sofas, tables and cabinets. One group of guests can be relaxing round the card table and matching leather chairs, while others stretch out on the big taupe corduroy sofa to watch a movie. That still leaves room for him to sneak off into another corner and perch on one of the special armless low-level chairs to play his guitar. The adjacent dining room is a little more formal but even here the overriding feeling is of a wonderfully light room centered around what looks like a huge limed-oak table inlaid with Italian marble. In fact, it is all the handiwork of a talented local artisan who painted the surface of the original table to match the materials found elsewhere on the yacht right down to the fake wooden joints and natural marble flaws. This solution appealed both to Clapton's desire to refresh rather than replace where possible and his appreciation of skilled craftsmanship. He is a keen collector of modern art himself and every spare wall and surface reflects this passion. From intricate postcard-sized oil paintings of Venice to large, sprawling canvases and some beautiful marble sculptures and ceramic vases, it is a collection that reflects the singer's own ability to transcend the confines of any one genre. Perhaps that also explains the relatively neutral tones of the décor. There is an Art Deco theme running through the main guest areas, which the refit has refreshed and modernized rather dispensed with. The limed-oak paneling is original but all the garish gold door handles, light fittings and switches have either been replaced or replated in chrome to give it a much more contemporary feel. The high gloss white painted ceiling panels and moldings have all been meticulously flatted back to leave a softer matt finish while all the ceiling lights, some 400 of them in total, have been replaced with modern recessed spots. As you'd expect aboard a musician's yacht, the AV system was another major beneficiary of the refit. Every cabin and guest space now has a discreet Arcam iPod dock so that he can plug in his iPhone wherever he is and enjoy instant access to his personal music library. All bar one of the existing Bang & Olufsen CRT televisions have also been swapped for high-definition Panasonic Viera flat screens. The highlight of the refit is the new owner's suite on the main deck -- a space that Clapton and his wife rarely used before the refit, because it is at the opposite end of the yacht to his children's cabins. (They preferred the smaller but more family-friendly location of the VIP guest suite next to the main run of cabins on the lower deck.) But it's a much more enticing space these days. Reconfigured by interior designers H2 in Putney, London, it now enjoys a much bigger family bathroom complete with walk-in rain shower, dramatic stone basins, a large tub and a natural teak floor. The key to the success of the refit, which cost in excess of US$4 million, lay in the planning. Pendennis's Tyrone Harvey and a small team started with a technical visit to the yacht in Palma, Mallorca, in the early summer of last year. Within days of arriving in Falmouth Va Bene had undergone sea trials with Duncan Propellers to try and improve an ongoing issue with her performance and economy. It eventually transpired that one of the gearboxes had been incorrectly fitted. She was then moored alongside at Pendennis while her crew started the long job of removing her entire inventory. She also had her teak deck stripped off before she was floated into the 150m long dry dock. Despite all the changes, Va Bene left Falmouth on time, arriving in Sardinia on July 1. Indeed, it was during this holiday that Eric Clapton took time out to talk to SuperYacht World about his born-again Va Bene (see p74). Now that he has had a chance to enjoy the fruits of his and Pendennis's labor, Va Bene is available for charter through Burgess Yachts in the Mediterranean and Caribbean. It's not often you get to walk in the shadow of a genuine rock legend but on Va Bene you can also swim, sunbathe and sleep in Eric Clapton's personal holiday home. Chartering just doesn't get any better than that. Subscribe to SuperYachtWorld . COPYRIGHT ©  2009 IPC MEDIA LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED .","Eric Clapton owns the 48 meter superyacht Va Bene .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- While violence decreases across Iraq, women in the war-ravaged country face worsening hardships as warfare has thrust them into the role of family breadwinners, an aid group's survey said. An Iraqi woman who sells incense and candles to support her children says, ""to work is to preserve your honor."" In a release dated Sunday coinciding with International Women's Day, Oxfam International issued, ""In Her Own Words: Iraqi Women Talk About Their Greatest Concerns and Challenges."" Many women have been widowed and have had to run their families because their husbands ""had been killed, disappeared, abducted or suffered from mental or physical abuse,"" the survey says. As a result, many have been unable to earn a decent living. While there are no precise numbers, there are now an estimated 740,000 widows in Iraq, Oxfam says. ""Women are the forgotten victims of Iraq,"" said Oxfam International Executive Director Jeremy Hobbs, in quotes included in the survey.  See pictures of women working in Iraq » . The survey found that largely because of the conflict in Iraq, 35.5 percent of participants were acting as head of the household and that ""nearly 25 percent had not been married."" ""If this reflects Iraq as a whole, it is the highest rate in the larger region, a result of the loss of men of marrying age as a result of the conflict,"" the survey said. Oxfam and its Iraqi partner group Al-Amal Association, conducted the survey in five provinces -- Baghdad, Basra, Tameem, Najaf and Nineveh. Questioners interviewed 1,700 respondents starting last summer. While the survey doesn't represent the situation facing all Iraqis, it provides ""a disturbing snapshot of many women's lives and those of their children and other family members."" ""A quarter of the women interviewed still do not have daily access to water, a third cannot send their children to school and, since the war started, over half have been the victim of violence,"" Hobbs said. ""And to add further insult more than three-quarters of widows, many of whom lost their husbands to the conflict, get no government pension which they are entitled to."" The report urges Iraq to invest in social welfare essential services. ""A whole generation of Iraqis are at risk. Mothers are being forced to make tough choices, such as whether to pay for their children to go to school and receive health care, or to pay for private power and water services. These are choices no mother should have to make. And they are not only threatening individual families, they are also threatening the future of Iraq itself,"" Hobbs said. Here are some of the survey results. • Security and safety are the top concerns of nearly 60 percent of women. • More than 40 percent of respondents said their security situation worsened last year. • 55 percent had been victims of violence since 2003. • Some 45 percent of women said their income was worse in 2008 than in 2007 and 2006. • 69 percent said access to water was worse or the same as in in 2006 and 2007. • 80 percent said access to electricity was more difficult than or the same as in 2007. • Nearly half of the women said access to quality health care was more difficult in 2008 compared with 2006 and 2007. • 40 percent of women with children reported that their sons and daughters were not attending school.","An estimated 740,000 widows struggle in new roles as heads of house, survey says .

"(CNN) -- Millions of people are expected to go to Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, but with a troubled economy and pocketbook issues on the mind, the president-elect must be careful to set the right tone. Construction of the inaugural stand continues in front of the White House last week. President Bush raised a record $42.8 million dollars for his second inauguration, and according to Public Citizen, more than 90 percent of the donations to that ceremony were from executives or corporations. But this year, some say throwing a multimillion-dollar party would be unseemly in a time when crash, bailout, and foreclosure fill the economic headlines. ""A lot of it is about tone and making sure that the celebrations that do take place are not over the top, that they don't appear to be insensitive to the pain people have right now,"" said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. The inaugural committee for Obama and Vice President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to make sure the ceremony underscores the incoming administration's ""commitment to change business as usual in Washington."" The Presidential Inaugural Committee has limited individual contributions to $50,000. There is no law restricting the size of donations, but in the past, inaugural committees  have set contribution limits as high as $250,000. The PIC said it will not take contributions from corporations, political action committees, current federally registered lobbyists, non-U.S. citizens or registered foreign agents. Obama has promised to ""take power away from the corporate lobbyists"" -- a pledge that would be questioned should the president-elect rely on them to foot his inauguration bill. ""If he can pay for these parties with small donations, I think there'd be a lot more acceptance of that,"" Alexander said. Watchdog groups say there are some things Obama can do to take control of the tone. For example, he could make donations to charity, and Michelle Obama could opt for something more reasonably priced than a designer dress. When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, he also faced a financial crisis. He gave voters a now famous pep talk about the failing economy, then skipped the fancy inaugural balls because they sent the wrong message. But analysts say Obama's not expected to go that far because so many people want to celebrate his historic win. ""Washington, D.C., was pro-Obama and had Obama-mania long before November 4. But the moment November 4 occurred, all -- all craziness sort of broke loose,"" said Anne Schroeder Mullini, a gossip columnist for Politico. As inauguration organizers work to keep the tone in check, they are speaking out against those trying to make money by scalping tickets to the event. Tickets for the inauguration are distributed through members of Congress, and just 240,000 seats are available for the actual swearing-in ceremony. The tickets are supposed to be free, but with demand outpacing supply, a traditional giveaway has turned into a thriving online marketplace. Legitimate ticket brokers -- the same companies that peddle tickets to rock concerts and NASCAR races -- are selling tickets to the inauguration for thousands of dollars, even for standing-room areas on the National Mall. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein wants to make that practice a crime, punishable by up to a year in prison. Organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the ceremony. ""We think it's absolutely insane to be selling those tickets. We understand some people want to make a buck, but for those people thinking of buying tickets, it's buyer beware,"" warned Howard Gantman, staff director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. CNN's Carol Costello, Brianna Keilar and Erica Hill contributed to this report.","President Bush raised a record $42.8 million dollars for his second inauguration .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- On the same day that it announced record suicides among its soldiers, the U.S. Army said Thursday that it will soon conduct service-wide training to help identify soldiers at risk of suicide. The program will teach soldiers how to recognize behaviors that may lead to suicide, and how to intervene. The program, which will run February 15 through March 15, will include training to recognize behaviors that may lead to suicide and instruction on how to intervene. The Army will follow the training with another teaching program, from March 15 to June 15, focused on suicide prevention at all unit levels. Earlier Thursday, the Army reported the highest one-year level of suicides among its soldiers since it began tracking the rate 28 years ago. The Army said that 128 soldiers were confirmed to have committed suicide in 2008, and an additional 15 were suspected to have committed suicide that year in cases under investigation among active-duty soldiers and activated National Guard and reserves. The Army's confirmed rate of suicides in 2008 was 20.2 per 100,000 soldiers. The nation's suicide rate was 19.5 per 100,000 people in 2005, a figure considered the most recent, Army officials said last month. In 2007, the Army reported 115 confirmed suicides, which was then the highest level since 1980, when it began tracking suicides. Suicides for Marines were also up in 2008. There were 41 in 2008, up from 33 in 2007 and 25 in 2006, according to a Marines report. In addition to the training the Army announced Thursday, the service has a program called Battlemind, intended to prepare soldiers and their families to cope with the stresses of war before, during and after deployment. It also is intended to help detect mental-health issues before and after deployments. The Army and the National Institute of Mental Health signed an agreement in October to conduct research to identify factors affecting the mental and behavioral health of soldiers and to share strategies to lower the suicide rate. The five-year study will examine active-duty, National Guard and reserve soldiers and their families.","Service-wide training to help soldiers identify those at risk of suicide .

"(AOL Autos)  -- At the 2009 Detroit Auto Show, Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and MINI showed the world what electric vehicles of the future will look like. And the future of driving looks fun. The Dodge Circuit EV can blast from 0-to-60 mph in around 4 seconds. Those in the know realize that sometime in the future, the vast majority of light cars and trucks in the US will feature electric final drive systems. The motors used in these systems will be powered by batteries, fuel cells, on-board generators, and perhaps even the sun. But this open issue doesn't change the inevitability of this reality. Given our current economic times, reality demands practical, tangible, and achievable ideas of what electric vehicles (or ""EVs"" for short) might actually look like. This is it ... Chrysler . Three of the four electric vehicles Chrysler showed in Detroit, Michigan, were shown at other events and even to Washington bureaucrats. Each of these vehicles is a running prototype, not some pie-in-the-sky-we'll-never-build that idea. ENVI is the special group of engineers at Chrysler that develops the company's EVs. To date, the ENVI group has developed four electrically powered models, each quite different from the other: a Dodge Circuit EV sports car (rear-wheel drive), a Chrysler Town & Country minivan (front-wheel-drive), a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited (all-wheel-drive), and now a Jeep Patriot (front-wheel-drive). Chrysler promises to offer at least one of these models in 2010, and three more by 2013. AOL Autos: Dodge Circuit EV photos . Chrysler approaches electric vehicles with simple plug-and-play engineering. Every one of their vehicles uses similar electric drive motors (only varying in power output), advanced lithium-ion batteries, and a power management controller. Each plugs in to 110- or 220-volt household outlets for recharging. The Chrysler and both Jeeps use an on-board range-extending battery charger (a generator). This generator automatically turns on after the vehicle's initial batter charge has been spent (usually within a range of 40 miles), supplying extra voltage that give these three vehicles an estimated range of approximately 400 miles. The generator is powered by a small gasoline-powered engine that runs with exceptional efficiency. This technology is similar in concept to what General Motors has shown in their Chevrolet Volt, a vehicle that should be ready for production in 2010. AOL Autos: Cadillac Converj photos . The Dodge Circuit carries a larger battery pack and no generator, so its range on the charge it carries is approximately 150-200 miles. Its large battery pack combined with compact dimensions and the exceptional torque provided by its electric motor blast the car from zero-to-sixty mph in around four seconds, exceptionally fast for any sports car regardless of engine type. Mercedes-Benz . Mercedes-Benz used the 2009 Detroit Auto Show to showcase their Concept BlueZERO vehicles. The Mercedes approach was to develop one efficient body style, and then equip it with three different electric drive packages. AOL Autos: Mercedes Stirling Moss photos . Much of the hardware for the all-electric front-wheel-drive propulsion units is built into what Mercedes calls ""sandwich-floor"" architecture that the company uses on several production cars. The design helps keep heavy components mounted low on the chassis for better handling, enhanced safety, and maximized interior room. All three Concept BlueZERO vehicles include electric drive and batteries. The E-Cell uses a large battery pack that is said to deliver a range of 120 miles. The F-Cell utilizes a smaller battery pack, but supplements the vehicle's range with a hydrogen fuel cell. The fuel cell produces electricity to recharge the battery pack that extends cruising range to 240 miles. The E-Cell Plus, with a range of approximately 360 miles, is the distance champion. The key is the on-board generator powered by tiny 1-liter turbo-charged three-cylinder gasoline engine. The engine and generator are located in the rear of the BlueZERO. For the record, when you see photos of these cars together, the E-Cell is lime green, the F-Cell is mint green, and the E-Cell Plus is orange. Toyota . Adding to its line of popular hybrid vehicles in the U.S., Toyota just confirmed plans to add as many as 10 new gas/electric hybrid vehicles in the next few years. On their way toward that goal, Toyota showed their all-new, third-generation Prius plus the new Lexus HS250H. AOL Autos: 2010 Toyota Prius photos . Important to this story, Toyota also committed to selling a battery powered electric car in 2012 for the U.S. market. Toyota debuted what their all-electric vehicle might be at the 2009 Detroit Auto Show, and it's an urban commuter called the FT-EV. The little four-seater is based on Toyota's popular iQ, a car that's already a hit in Japan. The good news is that the iQ is a real car, so the FT-EV will not be a glorified golf cart or a neighborhood vehicle with severely limited capabilities. The claimed range for the FT-EV is 50 miles. As we went to press, details were still sketchy about the FT-EV's running gear. As Toyota releases more details, we'll bring them to you. Mini . While standard MINI models like the Cooper are comparatively easy on gas compared to larger cars, under the ownership of parent company BMW, MINI is testing the limits of how green a MINI can be. AOL Autos: 2010 BMW Z4 photos . Perhaps following the performance of the stunt cars used in The Italian Job (2003), BMW decided to investigate a battery-powered MINI. They introduced the MINI E coupe last November at the Los Angeles Auto Show and the car was on display again in Detroit. The ""charged"" MINI E can run up to 150 miles on a full battery pack. Charging is accomplished through standard 110- or 220-volt outlets. The electrified MINI weighs 600 pounds more than a standard MINI Cooper and because of the bulk of the required battery pack, the interior seats only two. Performance from the 204-horsepower motor equals the gas-powered MINI, with a 0-60 mph run in 8.5 seconds. BMW will produce only 500 MINI Es for the United States (if it were easy to make electric MINIs, they'd make more). The limited-production run will be split between New York and L.A. on one-year closed-end leases. After the leases expire, BMW will ship the MINIs back to Germany for evaluation. This scenario mimics what General Motors did with their EV1 electric vehicle about a decade ago.","Latest technologies debut at the 2009 Detroit Auto Show .

"(Budget Travel) -- Even the most sophisticated traveler could be forgiven for thinking that there's little more to Panama than its iconic canal, seaside capital, and snorkeler-packed Bocas del Toro islands. The Los Santos region of Panama has spectacular rolling farmlands and blissfully empty beaches. But there's a more secret and equally spectacular side to the country about a five-hour drive west from Panama City: the Pacific coast region of Los Santos. Here, rolling farmlands and stands of mahogany and cocobolo trees hug an azure coastline, luring surfers, nature buffs, and, increasingly, travelers and second-home owners from all over. Although roadside real-estate billboards suggest a far more developed future, Los Santos has managed to stay blessedly free of resorts. In their place are a handful of low-key -- and far more affordable -- boutique hotels. The most stylish is the seven-room Villa Camilla, just outside the fishing village of Pedasí. The red-tiled hideaway, located on an 800-acre parcel of the Azuero Peninsula, started out as a private escape for French interior designer Gilles St.-Gilles and his wife, Camilla. ""The area reminded us of Tuscany,"" says St.-Gilles, who landscaped the estate with fragrant jasmine, plumeria, and hibiscus. In 2005, the couple opened their place as a hotel, and last fall they added 20 new seaside duplex lofts. As stylish as they are family-friendly, the setups come with full-size kitchens, extra guest beds, and mosaic-tile flooring. An in-house stable is ready for shoreline horseback rides, and you can sign up for snorkeling trips to nearby Isla Cañas, a palm-fringed refuge where thousands of leatherback turtles converge to build nests. Farther inland, the center of Pedasí has a cow-town vibe: Picture low-slung cottages painted bright green and yellow, and ranchers wearing handmade Panama hats. Yellow is also the color of choice at the new Casita Margarita. This five-room B&B comes with locally crafted cocobolo furniture and a wraparound veranda overlooking Pedasí's main street. Perhaps best of all, it's within walking distance of local hangout Mano Surf Community, a pro shop that does double duty as a café and juice bar, and El Gringo Dusek, a no-frills, alfresco cantina run by retired U.S. Navy officer Joseph Dusek, which serves the best barbecue ribs in Los Santos. Of course, beyond the culinary surf and turf, the region's big draw is its blissfully empty beaches: Some of Panama's most scenic -- Los Destiladeros, Modroño, and the black-sand Playa Venao with its eight-foot breaks -- are short drives from Pedasí. Closer to home, Pedasí's El Arenal is a good launchpad for day trips to Iguana Island. (Fishermen stationed by the pier rent their motorboats, captain included, for about $50 round trip.) The hotel-free and nearly visitor-free isle is named for its resident black and green iguanas. Sign up for an Iguana Island Foundation snorkeling and hiking tour; you might just get a good look at some hatchlings. While it may be hard to top that sight, 77-year-old Dalila Vera de Quintero knows how to command equal wows. Her lemon-yellow bakery in a bungalow, Dulceria Yely, is famous across Panama for its home-style sweets, like almond queques (pound cakes) and creamy chicheme, a shake blended from sweetened milk, fresh corn, and crushed vanilla beans. She also stashes a cake or two in the kitchen for favorite customers, such as former Panamanian president and Pedasí native Mireya Moscoso.

"ST. PAUL, Minnesota (CNN) -- If a state held a yard sale of government entities to bring in some much-needed cash, this might be what it would look like. Two Minnesota lawmakers have proposed selling the capital's airport to alleviate the state's budget deficit. Two Minnesota lawmakers are asking the state's legislature to consider a proposal that would sell to private firms the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, along with other state property and programs, in an effort to bring in roughly $6 billion or more. Coincidence or not, that's about the same size as the state's estimated budget deficit. State Sen. Geoff Michel and state Rep. Laura Brod -- two Republicans from Minneapolis suburbs -- say they don't want to go about solving the budget crisis in a traditional way. ""The discussion is often 'do you tax more, [or] do you spend less?'"" Brod says. ""But it seems to me that there is a third option out there, and that's reforming how government operates."" They also say their proposal is a way to spark debate over whether government should be in control of certain entities in the first place. ""Government doesn't always have to do it,"" Michel says. Running the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport (MSP) is a prime example of something the government could do without, they say. ""The airport is a significant asset,"" Brod adds. ""Why is the state running the airport, which provides restaurants and shops and the functions and the operations that a private business probably would do very well? ""So what we're looking at is just ... raising the real question of 'what should government be doing?'""  Watch the lawmakers discuss their proposal » . Michel and Brod also cite a recent survey by J.D. Power and Associates that put the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport at the bottom of a list of 19 ""large airports"" in terms of customer satisfaction. But they say their intention is not to ""indict"" anyone -- merely to ""shine a little light on what is a new idea for Minnesota,"" according to Brod. While privately owned and operated airports are much more common overseas, Michel and Brod could offer only one example of a similar notion in the United States: Chicago's plan to privatize Midway airport. That plan, however, has yet to be finalized by the Federal Aviation Administration. Michel says their proposal might mimic the Midway deal in that it could be a leasing of the entire airport and its operations for a term of 99 years. Midway sold for $2.5 billion, and Michel estimates that, given how much more use MSP sees, Minnesota might be able to bring in $5 billion with its airport. Even though a final draft of a proposed bill is still days away from even being introduced, one lawmaker from across the aisle is already promising to make it an uphill battle. State Sen. Steve Murphy, a Democrat and chair of the transportation committee, says the plan is a ""horrible idea"" and a ""gimmick."" ""You have to do what you have to do to get by [in] these economic times, and it's not having a fire sale on government,"" Murphy says. ""It's sitting down with a sharp pencil and cutting out programs that have run their useful life. It's cutting back on maybe Sen. Michel's per diem, things like that."" The bill would have to get through Murphy's committee before it could make it to the floor of the legislature, and Murphy says his panel ""would not go for this."" Despite the J.D. Power survey touted by Brod and Michel, Murphy calls the airport ""one of the best-run operations in the world."" ""This is ... government that works,"" Murphy adds. ""So now we want to sell it? For what reason?"" In response, Brod calls Murphy's comments mere ""scare tactics."" And Michel adds: ""There's nothing more predictable than a politician defending the status quo. And the days of status quo in Minnesota -- and, I think, the world -- are over."" Adeel Lari, a research fellow at the Center for Transportation Studies in the Hubert Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, specializes in innovative financing in state and local policy-making. He says privatization can work, but given the economy, now may not be the best time to consider selling anything, let alone an airport that could be worth billions of dollars. ""Everything is in turmoil,"" Lari says. ""Even if it was the right thing to do, there's no market for it."" Lari says the ideal philosophy -- ""buy low and sell high"" -- would be next to impossible to realize in today's situation. He says the state's holdings would almost certainly go for a less-than-desirable price. Lari also worries the state may not see enough profit in the long run. ""Selling infrastructure is one-time money you're getting,"" Lari says. ""If you're selling the infrastructure [as opposed to just the internal operations] then basically you're losing out on everything."" The issue of whether the average customer -- the air traveler, in this instance -- would be protected has also come up. Jerry Zhao, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota who focuses on state and local public finance, says privatizing has mixed results and may not be the best option, especially when it's only considered ""as the last resort of the desperate."" ""Some recent cases of [public-private partnerships] of transportation facilities have led to widely spread concerns on whether the public interest is protected in these concessions,"" Zhao says. ""Some services tend to be reserved for the public sector because of their 'public good' nature that won't be factored into consideration by profit-oriented businesses. ""Without careful research, a desperate rush into selling or leasing public facilities may lose value on public assets, lose long-term interests of the public in the exchange of short-term budget benefits, and lose democratic control."" Michel and Brod say the airport is only the tip of the iceberg. Their bill will also include the sale of the Minnesota State Lottery. Brod says that in this case, it's more of a fundamental question of ethics. ""Is gambling something that the state ought to be doing anyway?"" Brod asks rhetorically. The lottery would bring in between $500 million and $1 billion, they guess. It would be a different scenario, however, in that, since lottery proceeds come back to the state, Michel says they would include a provision to have the state keep that money. If not, he admits, they wouldn't be able to garner lawmaker support. It doesn't end there. The lawmakers say they're looking at everything the state owns as possible items to be auctioned off, including roads, parks, prisons, rest stops -- even the naming rights to public transit systems. Once drafted, the bill would have to pass through any relevant committees depending on what state entities end up in the final version. Only once it moves through could it be brought to the floor of the legislature. ""Our job now is to educate our fellow colleagues,"" Michel says.","Minnesota lawmakers propose selling airport and other government holdings .
State, like many others, is struggling with budget woes .
Opposing lawmaker calls idea of selling government entities a ""gimmick""
Financial experts say now might not be a good time to get a good return on sales ."
"(CNN) -- Jenna and Barbara Bush know a lot about growing up in the White House. The Bush twins told Sasha and Malia Obama to ""remember who your dad really is."" The twin daughters of former President Bush were 7 when their grandfather, former President George H.W. Bush, was inaugurated, and 20 when their father became president. Like their dad, who left a note for President Barack Obama, Jenna and Barbara Bush wrote Tuesday to Obama's daughters about what to expect in the weeks and months ahead. ""We also first saw the White House through the innocent, optimistic eyes of children,"" the twins wrote in an open letter published in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal.  Growing up in the White House » . The twins reminisce in the letter about important events and historic moments they were able to be part of in a presidential family. But the Bushes also tried to prepare Sasha and Malia for some sobering truths. ""Although it's an honor and full of so many extraordinary opportunities, it isn't always easy being a member of the club you are about to join,"" they said. ""Our dad, like yours, is a man of great integrity and love; a man who always put us first. We still see him now as we did when we were 7: as our loving daddy."" But as their father was increasingly criticized in the media and mocked by late night comedians, the twins said they learned a lesson. ""He is our father, not the sketch in a paper or part of a skit on TV,"" they wrote. ""Many people will think they know him, but they have no idea how he felt the day you were born, the pride he felt on your first day of school, or how much you both love being his daughters. So here is our most important piece of advice: Remember who your dad really is."" It helps, wrote the Bushes, to surround yourself with loyal friends. The rest of the letter was more lighthearted, with the twins sharing some of their favorite memories of living in the White House, including playing house and hide-and-seek in what many children would consider to be the ultimate playground. ""When we played house, we sat behind the East Sitting Room's massive curtains as the light poured in illuminating her yellow walls,"" the girls said. ""Our 7-year-old imaginations soared as we played in the enormous, beautiful rooms; our dreams, our games, as romantic as her surroundings. At night, the house sang us quiet songs through the chimneys as we fell asleep."" They also told the Obama girls to embrace any opportunity they had: ""When your dad throws out the first pitch for the Yankees, go to the game."" ""In fact, go to anything and everything you possibly can: the Kennedy Center for theater, state dinners, Christmas parties (the White House staff party is our favorite!), museum openings, arrival ceremonies, and walks around the monuments."" ""Just go,"" they wrote. The twins also reminded Sasha and Malia to be themselves -- kids -- saying even if they travel over holidays like Halloween, the girls should dress up and trick-or-treat down a plane aisle. ""Slide down the banister of the solarium, go to T-ball games, have swimming parties, and play Sardines on the White House lawn,"" the Bush girls said. ""Have fun and enjoy your childhood in such a magical place to live and play."" Jenna and Barbara Bush told the girls to cherish the pet that their father so publicly promised them. ""Sometimes you'll need the quiet comfort that only animals can provide,"" they said. ""Four years goes by so fast,"" they wrote. ""So absorb it all, enjoy it all!""","Bush twins tell new first kids not to let sketches, skits of dad get to them .

"(CNN) -- Chris Rock is best known for two things: being funny and being crass. ""If you're the president you only have two jobs: peace and money,"" Chris Rock said. ""This is what people come to see. I'm just doing my show,"" the comedian said with a laugh. He's also known for his political commentary, but there's one person he's having a lot of trouble making fun of -- president-elect Barack Obama. This is apparent in his new DVD ""Kill the Messenger,"" which combines three shows from his international tour: New York; London, England; and Johannesburg, South Africa. ""It was a tour nobody wanted to do... because the general perception is that comedy doesn't translate,"" Rock said. But thanks to the Internet, the world is a lot smaller than it was even 10 years ago. And people are digging the same jokes, he said, including ones about John McCain and Sarah Palin. As the DVD readies for release on January 20, CNN talked with Rock about his lack of Obama jokes, Inauguration Day and why racism will never die. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: I watched the special last night, and I noticed that you did a lot of jokes about John McCain -- his age, his war hero story -- but not so many about Barack Obama. Is it harder to make fun of Obama? Chris Rock: He's just one of those guys, you know, like Will Smith. There's no Will Smith jokes. There's no Brad Pitt jokes. You know, what are you going to say? ""Ooh, you used to have sex with Jennifer Anniston. Now you have sex with Angelina Jolie. You're such a loser."" What do you say? ""Ooh, your movies are big. You make $20 million."" There's nothing to say about Brad Pitt. CNN: Why is Obama like that? Rock: It's like ""Ooh, you're young and virile and you've got a beautiful wife and kids. You're the first African-American president."" You know, what do you say? CNN: As time goes on do you think it will get easier? Rock: Of course, as time goes on. At some point he's going to -- there's always slip-ups. No one can survive that level of scrutiny without occasionally making it easy for a comedian. CNN: Let's talk about the inauguration. Are you going? Rock: No, I have to go to Sundance [Film Festival]. I've got a movie premiering at Sundance. So I have to go to the whitest place in America -- Utah. CNN: What's it going to be like for you on Inauguration Day? Rock: It'll be a cool day. It's weird. I've never watched an inauguration. I've never watched anyone get sworn in. You know, it's like Election Day and then you look up and somebody else is the president two months later. It was never like, ""I can't wait till tomorrow. Oh my god! They're going to swear in Jimmy Carter!"" CNN: Are you going to watch this one, though? Rock: I'll put it this way -- like any business is going to be getting done while this guy is getting sworn in. Like I'm going to be in a meeting. Everything is going to stop for however long it takes. Hope they get to it -- hope it's not like I gotta listen to three different versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" or something. I hope it's not like Rosa Parks' funeral, where everybody f***ing speaks. CNN: What are you hoping Barack Obama does for this country? What do you think is his most important task? Rock: You know, if you're the president you only have two jobs: peace and money. That's it. I mean, it's like, what did Clinton do? We were at peace and we had a budget surplus. That's it. That's the gig. The closer you get us to those two goals, you know, that's pretty much the gig. Is that too much to ask for? CNN: At one point in your act, you said, ""Racism will never die. It will only multiply."" Why do you believe that? Rock: Well, it's never going to die. Maybe it won't multiply. Is racism going to end? No. It's not even race. People are always going to, you know, find something wrong with people who are not the exact same as them. That's just what it is. Black, white, short, tall, religions, whatever. People are bad, man. CNN: How was it different playing for an audience in Africa? Rock: You know it's weird -- it really wasn't that different. I mean, that's why I love this special. People are the same wherever you go. And if they weren't, they wouldn't laugh at the same s**t. If they were so different they wouldn't know what I was talking about. CNN: Stand-up comics I've talked to in the past say they like their shows to appear spontaneous. But your new DVD stitches together three shows, illustrating to the audience how scripted comedy can be. Why did you decide on that format? Rock: You know, I don't believe in that ""come up with stuff on the spot."" I mean, honestly, that's why I think comedy, stand-up comedy, always plays such a back seat to music. Like, would you go see a singer if you thought he just came up with the songs? They wouldn't give out Grammys for songs that they just came up with. You're going to go see someone at Radio City or Madison Square Garden, I think you'd like to know that they have an act before you spend $75. So yeah, when you say ""came up with it right there,"" that's really cute when you paid $8 to get in and two-drink minimum. When the ticket's $75, that's a whole other mindset.","Comedian Chris Rock to release ""Kill the Messenger"" DVD January 20 .

"LONGBOAT KEY, Florida (CNN) -- Like any sun-drenched beach paradise, Longboat Key offers water sports, biking and tennis, but the best way to enjoy the island may be by doing nothing at all. Low season on Longboat Key, Florida, generally starts in May and runs until late fall. This thin sliver of land off Sarasota on Florida's west coast is home to 8,000 people year-round, but come winter, the population swells dramatically. Thousands of visitors from colder climates flock to LBK -- its shorthand moniker -- from January to April to enjoy its balmy temperatures and the sparkling turquoise waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Off season, however, the only crowds are the sea gulls grooming their feathers on the warm white sand, and Longboat Key feels like the closest thing to having a private beach. On a recent late-September visit, the temperatures hovered in the mid-80s, palm trees swayed gently in the wind, hibiscus flowers bloomed and the sun's rays were on par with their intensity in July. The only signs of fall were the pumpkins on display at the local grocery store, along with regular fare, like mango Key lime pie.  See photos of Longboat Key's beaches, birds and sunsets » . Tell people you are heading to Longboat Key, and many will think it's part of the Florida Keys off the southern tip of the state, but LBK is about 200 miles to the north-northwest of -- and in some ways worlds away from -- Key West and its neighbors. Nightlife on the island is likely to mean a moonlit walk on the beach rather than a drink at the bar, and the odds are good the locals will sport gray hair. Elegant setting . Buffered by Sarasota Bay on one side and facing the Gulf of Mexico on the other, the Key is sheltered from the tourist hustle and bustle of mainland Florida. At less than 11 miles in length and no more than a mile across in its widest places, LBK also feels like a secluded community with an elegant flavor of its own. The surroundings are lush, upscale and serene. A trip down Gulf of Mexico Drive, the island's main artery, reveals golf courses, condominiums and homes ranging from newly constructed mansions to older, one-story houses. The traffic is light, life moves at a slower pace and the mood is relaxed. ""You won't find mini-malls, towering billboards, or glaring neon signs,"" the local Chamber of Commerce promises. Nonhuman island visitors also contribute to the mellow atmosphere. Dolphins regularly swim just offshore. Great egrets and great blue herons fish along the beach, while pelicans dive into the water in search of a meal. Birds of all sizes regularly patrol the palm-lined parking lot of the local supermarket looking for scraps of food from the lunch crowd. Wingless creatures also pop up in unexpected places. Visitors walking into one establishment are greeted by a stern voice exclaiming, ""Bear, no!"" Bear, it turns out, is a curious 5-month old Chesapeake Bay retriever who insists on checking out all the customers entering the store despite his owner's orders to stay put. Lodging and shopping . There are few hotels on Longboat Key, but rental homes and condos abound, so it's best to make lodging arrangements in advance, especially for visitors who plan to stay a while. Low season generally starts in May and runs until November. Tourists yearning to make the island a permanent home should bring along a big wallet. The average sale price for a condominium was more than $1 million last year, and it topped $1.5 million for a single-family home, according to the local Chamber of Commerce. Spenders on a smaller scale can get their fix in neighboring St. Armands Key and its unique shopping circle lined with boutiques and restaurants. (The official motto urges visitors to ""get out of the box, get into the circle."") Shoppers can find anything from jewelry to knock-out shoes to sea shells of all shapes and sizes. Depending on your budget and appetite, a lunch break can range from a latte to a smoked salmon and brie grilled cheese. St. Armands Circle is a great place to people watch, but it's good to know the tranquil beach back on Longboat Key is just a short drive away. Shopping can be exhausting when sunny, lazy days in a blissful place are filled with doing nothing at all.","Thousands of visitors from colder climates flock to Longboat Key in winter .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities arrested Vicente Carrillo Leyva, a leader of the Carrillo Fuentes drug cartel, officials announced Thursday. Vicente Carrillo Leyva is escorted by police at a news conference in Mexico City on Thursday. Carrillo Leyva was arrested as he exercised in a park in a residential area of Mexico City, where he had been living under the alias Alejandro Peralta Alvarez, officials said. The federal attorney general's office told reporters he was tracked through his wife, who did not change her name. Carrillo Leyva ""is considered one of the heirs to the criminal organization known as the Juarez Cartel, after the death of his father, Amado Carrillo Fuentes,"" said Assistant Prosecutor Maricela Morales. His father died in July 1997 while undergoing plastic surgery to alter his appearance in an effort to avoid capture. Amado Carrillo was known as ""El Senor de los Cielos,"" the ""Lord of the Skies,"" because of the fleet of jetliners he used to transport cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. Carrillo Leyva, 32, was presented at the news conference, surrounded by black-clad, hooded law-enforcement officials. He wore dark-frame glasses and a white jogging suit with double black stripes on the sleeves. His dark hair was long and shaggy. Last month, federal officials offered a reward of up to $2.16 million (30 million pesos) for information leading to his arrest. The same reward has been offered for his uncle, cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, also known as ""El Viceroy"" and ""El General,"" who remains at-large. Rewards of $2 million apiece have been offered for 22 other leading cartel suspects. Wednesday's arrest was the fourth detention of a top drug cartel leader in recent weeks. Last week, officials announced the arrest of Hector Huerta Rios, also known as ""La Burra"" or ""El Junior,"" a top lieutenant of the Beltran Leyva cartel. He was arrested in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia in Nuevo Leon state, along Mexico's border with the United States. The previous week, Mexican authorities announced the arrest of Sigifredo Najera Talamantes, a drug-trafficking suspect accused of attacking a U.S. consulate and killing Mexican soldiers. Talamantes, also known as ""El Canicon,"" also is suspected in attacks on a television station in Monterrey in Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex agency said. That same week, the Mexican military also arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant. Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame drug cartels for a surge in violence in the region. Despite the violence, Mexican officials say the country is generally safe and that tourist areas such as Cancun and Acapulco are heavily patrolled. Watch Leyva get escorted by law enforcement officials » . Officials from Acapulco city hall, the Guerrero state government and the Mexico attorney general went so far as to sign a statement in early March assuring students wanting to go there on spring break that efforts had been taken to ensure their safety. In a speech in mid-March, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said 93 percent of the 6,500 deaths attributed to organized crime in 2008 occurred among the criminals. Most of the rest were law enforcement authorities, officials have said. Few civilians are killed, the president said. In that same speech, Calderon ridiculed those who say Mexico is unsafe. ""It is absolutely false, absurd, that anyone indicate that Mexico does not have control over one single part of its national territory,"" he said. ""I challenge anyone who says that to tell me what part of the country they want to go to and I will take that person there."" Analysts point out that most of the violence is occurring along the U.S. border, particularly in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua and Tijuana. Drug cartel violence is also found on Mexico's western coast. ""The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern,"" the U.S. State Department said in a February 20 travel alert. ""Mexican authorities report that more than 1,800 people have been killed in the city since January 2008. Additionally, this city of 1.6 million people experienced more than 17,000 car thefts and 1,650 carjackings in 2008."" The State Department advisory tells U.S. citizens how best to remain safe. ""While millions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico each year (including thousands who cross the land border every day for study, tourism or business), violence in the country has increased recently. It is imperative that travelers understand the risks of travel to Mexico, how best to avoid dangerous situations, and whom to contact if one becomes a crime victim. Common-sense precautions such as visiting only legitimate business and tourist areas during daylight hours, and avoiding areas where prostitution and drug dealing might occur, can help ensure that travel to Mexico is safe and enjoyable.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Prince Harry, the red-headed younger son of Britain's Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, is back in the headlines after a British tabloid posted a home video of him using an offensive term to describe an Army colleague. Prince Harry's behavior landed him on the front pages of British newspapers. Some of those who have watched him closely through the years see a pattern which they blame on royal destiny rather than racism or ignorance. The video, much of it apparently shot by the prince himself in 2006, led to predictable howls of condemnation, not least from the sensation-seeking newspaper that published it. News of the World posted the video on its Web site under the headline ""Prince Harry video nasty that will spark outrage."" Harry, who is third in line to the throne, immediately issued an apology through a spokesman for referring to a soldier from Pakistan as ""our little Paki friend.""  Watch video which has sparked controversy » . The word ""Paki"" is considered deeply offensive by many in Britain -- comparable to the ""n-word"" in the United States, said Harry biographer Mark Saunders. ""That word is just unacceptable,"" Saunders said. It was not the first time Harry had been forced to apologize for offending people. In 2005, the News of the World's sister paper The Sun obtained and published a photograph of him wearing a Nazi uniform at a party, prompting an apology and a promise that he had learned his lesson. Penny Junor, who has written several books on Britain's royal family, says she suspects Harry may get himself into embarrassing situations more often than his older brother William at least partly because Harry does not expect to become king. ""Fundamentally it probably has a great deal to do with being number two,"" said Junor, the author of ""The Firm: The Troubled Life of the House of Windsor."" ""He's a spare, not an heir."" She said: ""The older ones are very much groomed for the task at hand. Those in charge sometimes miss a trick with the younger members"" of the family, she said. Harry's father, Prince Charles, may want to avoid trying to rein his son in too much, Junor theorized. ""I'm sure that Charles thinks it's putting an impossible burden on him to really nail Harry down to the floor when his future is uncertain,"" she said. ""Their lives are very restricted in many ways. It's a burden being the Prince of Wales, number two in line, number three in line. There is a tendency to try and relieve the burden from the children by not jumping down their throats every time they do something stupid."" In this generation, Harry has been much more likely than William to be the one doing ""something stupid,"" she admitted. William was criticized last year for landing an Army helicopter in a field belonging to his girlfriend's parents, but the incident did not cause the same uproar as Harry's two gaffes. Harry may have engaged in more outrageous behavior than his older brother simply because of his personality, Junor added. ""He's much more frivolous than William, more an impetuous party animal,"" she said, also describing him as ""not the brightest brain in Britain."" ""The older child, because he knows there is a seriousness to the position he was born to, knows from day one what is expected of him,"" she said. ""The younger one has all of the frustrations of that without knowing (if) he will inherit the throne."" Saunders, the author of ""Prince Harry: The Biography,"" has observed the same pattern. ""Even when (Harry) was a young boy he was a maverick,"" said Saunders. ""Harry used to play with the photographers, whereas you would never get that with William."" ""William formed a bond with his father,"" based in part on the throne the two men expect to inherit -- which Harry likely never will, Saunders said. ""There's a job that only William, his father and the queen can share."" Not expecting to become king may have freed Harry, Saunders speculated. ""This started a long time ago. (Harry) said 'I am me, and I am going to be me.' With Harry there have been several moments, gross errors. He has made missteps,"" Saunders said. ""You could argue that there are simply the mistakes of a young man growing up -- but William could never afford to make those kind of mistakes."" It is a pattern that has been repeating, to an extent, in the royal family for generations. Prince Andrew, one of Prince Charles' younger brothers, has something of a reputation as a playboy, while the queen's late younger sister, Princess Margaret, bucked convention in her own day, seeking to marry a divorced man. The British newspaper, The Guardian summed up the piquancy of being a younger sibling of the sovereign in Margaret's obituary in 2002, noting she had been second in line to the throne throughout her teens, but was 11th by the time she died. ""They have all the pressures of being a member of the family,"" Junor said, ""without the reward of being the top person.""","Royal watchers see a pattern in Prince Harry's errant behavior .

"(CNN) -- Around 200 new species of frogs have been found in Madagascar, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. A study has found nearly 200 new species of frogs in Madagascar. A study identified between 129 and 221 new species of frogs on the island. The Spanish Scientific Research Council (CSIC), who carried out the study, believe the find could practically double the number of amphibians known in the world if the results are extrapolated at a global scale. The study, published in the journal ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA,"" suggests that the number of amphibian species in Madagascar has been significantly underestimated. ""The diversity of species in Madagascar is far from being known and there is still a lot of scientific research to be done. Our data suggest that the number of new species of amphibians not only has been underestimated but it is spatially widespread, even in well studied areas,"" said Professor David R. Vieites, CSIC researcher to the press at the Spanish National Natural Sciences Museum in Madrid. ""For example, two of the most visited and studied national parks, Ranomafana and Mantadía/Analamazaotra, harbor 31 and 10 new species respectively."" Dr. Frank Glaw, curator of herpetology at the Zoologische Staatssammlung from Munich was part of the research team: ""During the past 15 years, we discovered and described over 100 new frog species from Madagascar, which led us to believe that our species inventory is almost complete. But as our new surveys show, there are many more species than we suspected,"" he said in a press statement. The paper suggests that the total biodiversity on the island could be much higher in other species as well, so the actual destruction of natural habitats may be affecting more animals than previously thought. This has important consequences for conservation planning, as the rate of destruction of rainforests in Madagascar has been one of the highest in the planet, with more than 80 percent of the historic surface of rainforest already lost, according to the study's authors. Almost a quarter of the new species discovered have not been found yet in protected areas, but the unstable political situation in Madagascar has also been cited as hampering conservation efforts. ""Although a lot of reserves and national parks have been created in Madagascar during the last decade, the actual situation of politic instability is allowing the cut of the forest within national parks, generating a lot of uncertainty about the future of the planned network of protected areas"", said Vieites. Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world and one of the most biodiverse areas globally, with a high degree of endemic species. ""To get an idea of its biodiversity --while in the Iberian Peninsula [there] are about 30 species of amphibians and in Germany about 20, in a single locality in Madagascar we can find around 100 species of frogs,"" said Vieites. Dr. Miguel Vences, professor at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, who was also part of the study team, and believes that a century of new species discovery is just beginning: ""People think that we know which plant and animal species live on this planet. But the majority of life forms on Earth is still awaiting scientific recognition.""","Nearly 200 new species of amphibians found on biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar .

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN) -- ""Always you have to run for your life,"" says Boo Htoo, who grew up in a refugee camp in Thailand just across the border from Myanmar. Boo Htoo and his family lived at the Maela Refugee Camp before being resettled in Phoenix, Arizona. Ethnic minorities still flee the repressive military regime in Myanmar, formerly Burma. Some 111,000 Myanmar refugees live in nine camps in Thailand, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Htoo, now 29, recalls making the long trek with his parents to cross the border when he was about 5. ""[It's] a very long way,"" he says. ""We don't have a car, a plane. We don't have a bicycle to ride. My parents just take what they can carry, and then we started walking across the jungle, sleeping in the jungle."" Htoo and his family are now resettled in Phoenix, Arizona. Thanks to Carolyn Manning and her Welcome to America Project, they got a warm welcome to the big city, complete with furnishings and household items for their first apartment and toys for his two young children. ""That day that I have a lot of American friends in my apartment,"" recalls Htoo, ""this is the day that I feel very happy."" For Htoo, it was a remarkable transition from ""a really hard life in the refugee camp."" ""They have a wire fence around the camp; they put soldiers around the fence,"" Htoo says. ""You are not allowed to go outside to work. You don't have a chance to go to university even if you are willing to go. I cannot express the feeling of how difficult it is.""  Watch Htoo tell his story » .

Since 2001, she and volunteers have provided furniture, clothing and support to more than 550 refugee families. Nominate your Hero at CNN.com/Heroes . The first family Manning welcomed came to her attention in a local newspaper. Manning's brother-in-law Terence had died in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York. The family in the newspaper was from Afghanistan and had lost a relative to the Taliban. Manning immediately saw a parallel. ""Knowing that Terence was killed innocently and then seeing the Afghan family who had someone killed in their family, I started to make a connection between myself and that family,"" Manning recalls. ""We lost a family member, too. The difference was we had a safe place that we lived -- and they had to flee their country."" At a time when many Americans were putting up walls and shunning foreigners, Manning reached out to them. She and her family took up a collection of furniture for them -- and The Welcome to America Project was born. ""They've been invited here,"" says Manning. ""Everybody has a right to find a place where they belong. I want the refugees to feel that this is their home."" The families assisted by The Welcome to America Project typically have languished in refugee camps for 10-12 years, says Manning, and come from countries including Iraq, Myanmar, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, Nigeria and Bhutan -- places where they were often persecuted because of their race, religion or political views. ""There are a number of different things they have to learn how to do when they first arrive,"" Manning says. ""They've never seen buildings built like ours. They've lived in huts literally made out of bamboo, with leaves on top. There's a lot of transition for them.""  Watch Manning describe the refugees' strikingly different backgrounds » . Over the last seven years, Manning says, she's learned a lot from the refugees and finds herself looking at American customs from a new perspective. ""We brought a toaster into a family from Africa and they didn't know what it was,"" recalls Manning. ""The woman was very dutiful in watching [when] we tried to show them how to toast bread. But then through a translator her response was, 'Why would you want to ruin bread?'"" Manning says the refugees are resourceful and eager to start a new life, developing strong ties to their new communities, making active contributions, working hard and paying taxes. ""It's not an 'us and them,'"" she says. ""We're all part of one humanity. And we're trying to do what's right, and what is fair.""  Watch The Welcome to America Project in action » . As word continues to spread -- the project is currently bigger than ever, says Manning -- The Welcome to America Project is nearing its 600th family donation.

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- The operator of a trolley that rear-ended another trolley should have been able to see the other vehicle was stopped 480 feet ahead, a federal investigator said Monday. Passengers walk past firefighters at a Green Line station in Boston after the trolley collision Friday evening. The trolley driver has told investigators he was text messaging during Friday night's collision, which injured 20 people. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which previously had banned operators from using cell phones and other portable devices, now has told employees to leave the devices at home while on duty, National Transportation Safety Board member Debbie Hersman said Monday. Hersman also noted investigators have determined that the operator may have missed some crucial indications of a stopped trolley ahead on the tracks.  Watch new transit rule on cell phones » . ""There were several signals -- two green signals, a yellow signal and a red signal -- coming out of the station, and the point of collision occurred 80 feet past that red signal,"" Hersman said. ""We did a site-distance test, and we know that the operator had the ability to see the trolley stopped in front of him 480 feet in advance of the collision."" Boston officials said over the weekend that the trolley operator was using his cell phone. Numerous media outlets, including CNN's Boston affiliates, have identified the driver as 24-year-old Aiden Quinn. ""The operator of the striking train was interviewed at the hospital by two detectives,"" said MBTA general manager Daniel Grabauskas. ""He admitted that he was texting at the time of the accident."" The operator told detectives that, when he looked up, ""it was too late as he applied the brake and the train struck the other trolley,"" Grabauskas said. He described himself as ""outraged."" ""We have reinforced for a number of years that the use of cell phones or any other kinds of electronic devices while operating a train or a bus is absolutely prohibited,"" Grabauskas said. Though the investigation is ongoing, he said, the two-year employee will be fired if his version of events is confirmed. None of the injuries was considered life-threatening, the MBTA said. The collision happened at 7:18 p.m. ET Friday as the Green Line trains were traveling between the Park Street and Government Center stations in downtown Boston. Both trains were traveling westbound when one train rear-ended the second, an MBTA official said. A train operator also was text messaging last year in a California train crash that killed 25 people.

"(CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon announced the resignations Tuesday of three high-level government officials, most notably Communications and Transport Secretary Luis Tellez Kuenzler. The government of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, seen here in January, is facing elections in July. Abraham Gonzalez, a key official for the powerful ministry that oversees Mexico's government, also resigned. So did Sergio Vela Martinez, president of the National Council for Culture and the Arts. No official reasons were given for any of the resignations, which analysts said did not appear to be related. But at least two of the resignations did not come as a surprise. Tellez, who stepped down from a Cabinet-level post, had been involved for weeks in a controversy over taped comments revealed last month by CNN journalist Carmen Aristegui. In the taped conversation, Tellez said former Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had stolen government money. Salinas has not been formally accused of any crime. Tellez received an anonymous threat in late February from an apparent political enemy telling him to resign or more damaging audiotapes would be released to the media. He refused and turned the matter over to authorities. Ana Maria Salazar Slack, a political analyst who is host of a daily radio show in Mexico City, called it ""an almost soap opera-ish scandal"" that left Calderon little choice but to force Tellez to resign. ""Although Calderon wanted to keep him in office, it made it very difficult to keep him there,"" she said. Calderon moved Tellez to a post as a presidential aide dealing with economic matters. Other observers also were not surprised by the move. ""That was waiting to happen,"" said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico Institute at the Washington-based Woodrow Wilson Center. ""But evidently the president values his counsel and has kept him in a high-profile position in the presidency from which he'll continue to have influence."" Robert Pastor, the Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s, praised Tellez but said political considerations prevailed. ""He's a very competent fellow,"" Pastor said. ""One of the most competent people I've known in Mexico. But this tape in particular was very embarrassing."" In a televised news conference after Calderon announced the changes, Tellez expressed his ""gratitude for this opportunity that few Mexicans obtain."" Replacing Tellez will be Juan Molinar Horcasitas, the head of the Mexican Institute for Social Security. Molinar belongs to the same party as Calderon, the National Action Party [PAN], while Tellez belongs to the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]. That played a role, Slack said. ""The president is sending a signal to his party that he's going to support people from his own party,"" Slack said. ""Beyond the political scandals of the tapes, there's a decision for the president to appoint people very close to the party."" Gonzalez's departure was not a surprise either, since he is running for a congressional seat in July and Mexican law requires him to resign. Analysts spoke highly of Gonzalez's replacement, Geronimo Gutierrez Fernandez. He had been the top person in the foreign ministry for Latin and North America. ""Gutierrez moving in is outstanding,"" the Mexico Institute's Selee said, calling him ""one of the smartest people ... I've met"" and ""an impressive guy."" Consuelo Saizar Guerrero takes over as head of the National Council for Culture and the Arts, replacing Vela, whose reasons for resigning were not disclosed. Saizar previously served as head of the Economic Culture Fund, the government's book-publishing enterprise. The arts and culture post will play a significant role in 2010, when Mexico celebrates 100 years of its social revolution and 200 years of its declaration of independence, radio analyst Slack said. As for the timing of resignations from three key posts, Slack linked it to Mexico's election calendar. ""In order to understand these changes,"" she said, ""you have to understand there are midterm elections in July. So if there are going to be any changes, they have to take place right now."" Meanwhile, Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue, said the changes do not portend a political shift. ""This doesn't sound like any major direction in change for Calderon,"" Hakim said.","Analyst says timing of resignations linked to Mexican midterm elections in July .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners and well-wishers gathered Saturday at a church east of London for the funeral of controversial reality TV star Jade Goody. Jade Goody's coffin is carried into church for the funeral service in Essex Saturday. The 27-year-old lost a public battle with cervical cancer last month, prompting sympathy and headlines around the world. As Goody's white coffin was carried into the church at Buckhurst Hill, Essex, east of London, a gospel choir began singing ""Amazing Grace."" Pallbearers included her husband Jack Tweed, whom she married in February.  Send your tributes to Jade Goody. Inside the church the congregation heard Tweed read a poem as well as watching a multimedia tribute to Goody's life.  View image gallery of Jade Goody's funeral » . Outside thousands of well-wishers gathered in the spring sunshine to watch the funeral service on large TV screens, breaking into spontaneous applause throughout the service. TV pictures showed one young girl with ""R.I.P. Jade"" drawn on her cheek. Read blog from her funeral . Addressing the congregation Max Clifford, Goody's publicist, said: ""She achieved in seven months what doctors, politicians and medical experts can only dream of achieving. Her legacy is a wonderful one. Because of Jade Goody, lots of women have had their lives saved.""  Watch family and fans pay their last respects » . After the service congregation member Peter Holmes, 28, from St. Albans, north of London, told CNN: ""The service was lovely. The funeral was just what Jade was all about. She was a fun-loving person who always lit up a room with a funny comment."" Flowers thrown by well-wishers covered the front of the vintage hearse carrying Goody's coffin as it arrived at the church. Crowds earlier applauded as the cortege slowly made its way through Bermondsey, south London, where Goody grew up amid deprivation and drug abuse. At one point the procession stopped to release a white dove.  Wreaths included one in the shape of a pink heart, another that resembled a blue handbag and another shaped like a camera -- reflecting Goody's love of the limelight. After the funeral friends and family left for a private burial. Goody had burst into the spotlight in the British version of ""Big Brother"" in 2002 but attracted global notoriety five years later when she made racist comments -- for which she later apologized -- to Indian actress Shilpa Shetty. Well-wisher Vicky Scott, a security consultant from Bedfordshire, central England, waiting outside the church before the service, told CNN: ""She had very much to live for and she had achieved so much. She had a tough life and she gave us so much. ""I think she was an inspiration to many women, the way she brought cervical cancer to many women's minds."" Clifford said in comments reported by the Press Association that Goody's mother Jackiey Budden was ""distraught"" and Tweed was ""heartbroken."" Goody's two sons, Bobby, 5, and Freddie, 4, did not attend the service and are believed to have gone to Australia with their father, TV host Jeff Brazier, according to media reports. Medical officials have reported a big rise in the number of screenings for cervical cancer after Goody's diagnosis was announced live on India's version of ""Big Brother"" last August, a phenomenon some have dubbed the ""Jade Goody effect."" Images of her shrinking frame and bald head dominated the pages of British media after she announced she had just weeks to live. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown had previously praised Goody's work in raising awareness of cervical cancer. ""In many years to come, there will be an awful lot of women who've got an awful lot to thank Jade Goody for,"" he said. Despite her weakening state Goody continued to open her door to the media, saying she needed to keep selling her story to help secure the future of her sons. With Clifford's help, she organized her wedding to boyfriend Tweed, who had only just been released from prison after serving a sentence for assault, selling the exclusive rights to OK! magazine for a reported $970,000. It was also filmed for her reality TV show. CNN's Peter Wilkinson contributed to this report.","Funeral service of reality TV star Jade Goody takes place east of London .

"(CNN) -- Cheryl Bradshaw shivered under a big brown coat as she made her way through a line of people waiting along an icy road in Wilmington, Ohio. She was among about 5,000 residents who accepted food from the nonprofit Feed the Children. The nonprofit Feed the Children delivers boxes of food and other items to families Thursday in Wilmington, Ohio. ""A lot of this people in this town ... it's day to day, dollar to dollar,"" Bradshaw said of the town of about 12,000 between Cincinnati and Columbus. Wilmington is still reeling from news that delivery giant DHL would close its hub there. About 3,000 of the 8,000 people who faced layoffs lived in or around Wilmington. One in three families in Wilmington had someone employed at DHL, according to an economic task force created by Mayor David Raizk. A crowd gathered Thursday as 12 loaded semitrailers cautiously parked on slippery roads. Each family got two boxes. One had 25 pounds of canned food and vegetables. Another contained 10 pounds of personal care items.  Watch as townspeople describe tough times » . Bradshaw said she appreciated the help. She got laid off in December from ABX Air, a Wilmington-based air cargo services company that worked with DHL. ""We are raising two grandkids, and we only have one income, so it's a big, big blessing,"" she said. Tony Sellars, the nonprofit's director of communications, said, ""This is the largest distribution we have had in such a small town."" Sellars said the organization is monitoring layoff conditions in various cities and identifying critical locations where it can be of assistance. ""We have been around since 1979, and this is unprecedented in terms of need,"" Sellars said. ""In Wilmington, the residents are proud and confused; they are resilient and trying to solve their problems on their own, but they don't know where to turn."" Feed the Children distributed the food and other items in conjunction with partners that include Avon Products and the local Sugartree Ministry Center.

"(AOL Autos)  -- Buying a used car may seem like a simple topic. Used car sales company CARMAX had an influx of trucks and SUVs after gas prices skyrocketed. But when you begin slicing and dicing the various possibilities among approximately 3.3 million vehicles that are for sale at any given time, interesting insights into consumer preferences begin to emerge. For Krista Glotzbach, director of marketing at Vast.com, the San Francisco, California-based aggregator of data (which provides used vehicle search data for AOL Autos), the various permutations are nearly endless. But users shouldn't worry because, with the help of search filters, vehicle fashion statements (what color do you want) and budgetary considerations (what price range do you want) easily come to the surface for faster used car searching. Because Vast.com has a variety of sources for its data, including Web ""crawls"" (an automated Internet search for used vehicle information), the data is, by definition, revealing in its own right. AOL Autos: Safest cars . But industry player CARFAX, which makes its vehicle history reports available to the public, provides a different kind of insight. AOL Autos: Used luxury cars . As Larry Gamache, director of communications, pointed out, used car sales dominate the automotive industry. With that volume comes its share of fraud, notably in the marketing of vehicles damaged by flood. And even if a vehicle doesn't look bad, what you can't see can hurt. ""The problem with flood-damaged cars is that they're rotting from the inside out,"" Gamache said. It's also a potentially big safety issue. ""Air bags that have been submerged do not function properly,"" Gamache noted. ""They either don't deploy or could deploy at speed."" But not all used cars have skeletons in their closets. Actually, most of the vehicles sold in the U.S. are used. AOL Autos: Most popular crossovers . Here are a few water cooler tidbits that might make you say ""hmm"": . 1. Three out of four automotive transactions in the U.S. involve previously owned vehicles. 2. The average vehicle will likely have three owners in its lifetime. 3. Industry experts believe one of every 25 air bags that have been deployed have not been properly replaced. They're also the most stolen item from a vehicle (having surpassed radios). AOL Autos: Best resale value cars . 4. About half the cars that are flood damaged end up back on the road. As far as Hurricane Katrina is concerned, estimates are that about 200,000 vehicles were dried out and resold. 5. The most frequently searched price range for a used vehicle is under $5,000. 6. Consumers lose as much as $4 billion a year due to odometer fraud, with the average rollback being 15,000 miles. AOL Autos: Best hybrid cars . 7. There are more used Silverado pickup trucks for sale than any other model (nearly 120,000 throughout the U.S.) 8. Texas has more used vehicles than any other state (more than 220,000); Houston alone has more than 32,000 on the market at any given time. 9. Chevrolet tops the list of most-available brands in the U.S. (with about 450,000 available), followed by Ford (425,000). There are ""only"" about 280,000 Toyotas on the market at any given time. 10. Silver is the most available color in the used vehicle market -- more than 447,000 vehicles, followed by black (429,000), white (409,000), and red (321,000). Blue (309,000) and gray (277,000) are also aplenty. The color you're least likely to find? Pink, with just 249 used vehicles listed. 11. Age does appear to matter, at least when it comes to a used vehicle. Nearly half those listed at any one time (about 1.5 million) are model years 2007-2008. 12. Automatic transmissions outnumber manual 10 to 1 in the market for used vehicles. 13. Six cylinder vehicles are the most popular on the used car market, accounting for nearly a third of the total available (and roughly the combined total of both four cylinder and eight cylinder powered vehicles). The least likely number of engine cylinders? The 23 vehicles that were listed as being equipped with a 16-cylinder motor, among them a 2006 Bentley Continental Flying Spur (just $122,000) and a 1938 Cadillac ($195,000). 14. Nearly half the used vehicles on the market come with air conditioning. Clearly, the marketing and sale of used vehicles is a big business. Like any other transaction, it's ""buyer beware"" and ""buyer aware."" Thankfully, well-known and respected sites (such as AOL Autos Used Cars) and sources such as CARFAX for checking a vehicle's history can help lower the risk to consumers. Sources: VAST.com (vehicles available as of July 21, 2008), CARFAX, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.","Three out of four transactions in the U.S. involve used vehicles .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Attorney General Eric Holder was decidedly noncommittal Thursday as he was buffeted on Capitol Hill by alternating demands to release -- or not -- more secret documents related to alleged torture, and to prosecute -- or not -- Bush administration officials who wrote and approved those documents. Attorney General Eric Holder testifies before a U.S. House subcommittee on Thursday. Holder was scheduled to appear before a House committee to discuss the Justice Department budget, but lawmakers threw away the script and overwhelmed him with pointed questions about the memos and accountability for the interrogation policies. The toughest exchanges were with the top Republican in the session, Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia. Wolf insisted Holder provide still-secret documents which former Vice President Dick Cheney says detail valuable intelligence gained from the use of the harsh techniques against captured suspected terrorists. ""You have an obligation to release the rest of the memos,"" Wolf demanded. But Holder said he had no knowledge of documents that might contain the information to which Cheney referred. ""I'm not familiar with those memos. I frankly have not seen them. I don't know that they exist,"" Holder said. When Holder said he doesn't control all of the documents, Wolf complained Holder was trying to duck responsibility ""just because the documents might be in a different building."" ""It is certainly the intention of this administration not to play hide and seek, or not to release certain things,"" Holder replied. ""It is not our intention to try to advance a political agenda or to try to hide things from the American people,"" he said. As Republican lawmakers complained about the administration's release of four documents last week that had authorized waterboarding and other controversial methods, Democrats praised the release. Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey, D-Wisconsin, said torture is illegal and those responsible for its use have to be held personally accountable. Representatives of liberal organizations including MoveOn.org, Democrats.com and the American Civil Liberties Union were in the hearing room seeking to cajole Holder and other administration officials to appoint a special prosecutor to press charges against Bush administration officials. ""The Justice Department is obligated to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate these crimes,"" said Mandy Simon of the ACLU. She said representatives of the groups had provided to Assistant Attorney General Lee Loftus a disk containing the signatures of about 260,000 individuals demanding the outside prosecutor be appointed. Holder was not asked whether he would seek an outside counsel, but indicated he was waiting for more information from pending reports. He said a key report on the actions of Bush Justice Department officials involved in drafting the controversial legal guidance would be completed ""soon"" and he hopes to make it public.","On Capitol Hill, Republicans criticize initial release of four interrogation memos .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- An actor who played a wannabe mobster in ""The Sopranos"" was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for a botched burglary that left an off-duty New York police officer dead. Lillo Brancato Jr. appeared on ""The Sopranos"" and played alongside Robert De Niro in ""A Bronx Tale."" The Bronx County District Attorneys Office had sought the maximum of 15 years for Lillo Brancato Jr., who was convicted last month of attempted burglary stemming from a fatal encounter with police officer Daniel Enchautegui. Before the sentencing, Enchautegui's sister addressed the court to deliver a victim impact statement. Enchautegui, 28, was shot in the chest when he interrupted an alleged break-in at a neighbor's home in the Bronx but managed to shoot both suspects multiple times before dying. Brancato was cleared in Enchautegui's death, but his accomplice, Steven Armento, 51, was convicted in the shooting and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. During the trial, lawyers for Brancato argued that there was not a break-in. Brancato testified that he knew the owner of the home, a Vietnam veteran who had given him permission to enter the house and take painkillers or other pills whenever he wanted. Brancato testified that he and Armento, 51, were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium. He admitted breaking a window at the home but said it was strictly because he was going through intense heroin withdrawal that night and was trying to wake up his friend to get drugs. Brancato appeared on six episodes of the hit HBO series ""The Sopranos"" in 2000. As a teen, he starred alongside actor Robert De Niro in ""A Bronx Tale.""","Prosecutors sought 15 years for Lillo Brancato Jr. for attempted burglary .

"Editor's note: Alvin F. Poussaint, MD, is professor of psychiatry at Judge Baker Children's Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston, and co-author with Bill Cosby of ""Come On People: On the Path From Victims to Victors,"" 2007. Dr. Alvin Poussaint says while we salute King and Obama, there's more work to be done. BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Today, one day before the inauguration of the first African-American president, the Martin Luther King Jr. observance hailing civil rights gains will be combined with jubilation over Barack Obama's historic achievement. The festivities this year portend a new direction for the King holiday. On Monday, we salute King-and-Obama. And on Tuesday, we salute Obama-and-King, as the Rev. Joseph Lowery, co-founder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with King, gives the benediction after Obama's swearing-in. The events juxtapose two African-American icons in the march toward racial equality. Traditional tributes to King are likely to be overshadowed by Obama's game-changing win; his success, despite racial barriers, mistakenly leads many Americans to believe that King's rallying cries may be outdated. For example, at most celebrations, the ""I Have a Dream"" speech is highlighted. With the election of Obama, many are saying that we have fulfilled King's dream. So will the ""dream"" speech be appreciated only as a powerful historical moment rather than a vision for the future? I hope not. But other perspectives may change as well. In stirring oratory, King said he had a dream that one day his four children would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. But now, since Obama's accomplishment, scores of people -- including African Americans -- feel we have reached that goal, despite obvious remnants of racial discrimination. In fact, some conservatives are using Obama's success to argue against the need for affirmative action. Similarly, King's oft-quoted words: ""I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you ..."" will resonate in a different way because of Obama's startling election. I have heard many reports from black people themselves that the president-elect has taken us symbolically to that elusive Promised Land. While Obama's win may have taken the edge off some of King's inspirational rhetoric, it should not lead to complacency in the fight for social justice. There is still much work to be done. Obama's election does not solve the many problems facing the African-American community. We will continue to face disparities in health care, including an infant mortality rate twice as high as whites, and 20 percent of blacks still lack basic health insurance, according to government statistics.. High rates of crime and violence, with homicide as the leading cause of death for young black men, demoralizes black neighborhoods. In many communities, the high school dropout rate exceeds 50 percent. That dropout rate for many is a ticket to prison, where blacks make up nearly 40 percent of inmates, according to the Justice Department. Racial profiling has not ended, and there continue to be horrific incidents of police brutality against blacks. This compounds family stress at a time when federal government data shows 70 percent of black children are born to single mothers and African-American unemployment is twice the rate of whites. These challenges were there before the dramatic economic downturn of recent months; they will get worse if there are no interventions. Obama is doing his share by reinvigorating King's primary theme of helping others by urging Americans' commitment to the King Day of Service, established by Congress in 1994. His emphasis on volunteering is an appropriate extension of King's ultimate mission. People cannot simply have high expectations about what Obama can do for them but must also work as individuals and communities to support his programs to help pull the United States out of its economic and social crises. This January, the link established between the civil rights achievements of King's dream and Obama's triumph will be etched in our minds. That is not a bad thing. It gives us an opportunity to broaden the celebrations on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The King holiday would be enhanced by recognizing other modern civil rights icons as well. Luminaries such as Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, John Lewis, Andrew Young, Fannie Lou Hamer, Stokely Carmichael, Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr., Dorothy Height, Bob Moses and a host of others should not be allowed to fade into the background. Without diminishing the extraordinary legacy of MLK, other leaders who have contributed to the emancipation of black Americans should be remembered. Obama's watershed moment brings a new spirit to the Martin Luther King Jr. Day observance. Eventually, I hope due credit will be given to all those fighters whose shoulders Obama stood on to secure the ultimate prize: the presidency of the United States.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is set to deliver the Republican response to President Obama's upcoming joint address to Congress, a high-profile slot the party often gives to one of its rising stars. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, 37, will give GOP response to President Obama's address to Congress this month. ""Gov. Jindal embodies what I have long said: The Republican Party must not be simply the party of 'opposition,' but the party of better solutions,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner said in a Wednesday statement. Jindal, a former congressman in his first term as Louisiana's governor, was widely believed to be on Republican presidential nominee John McCain's short list for vice president, and he often served as a campaign surrogate on the Arizona senator's behalf. The 37-year-old son of Indian immigrants also was given a prime-time speaking slot at the GOP convention last September, though he ultimately decided not to attend the four-day event as Hurricane Gustav headed for landfall in his state. An Ivy League grad and Rhodes Scholar, and his state's first nonwhite governor, Jindal has long been on the GOP's radar screen as a potential future leader and likely presidential candidate. And as the GOP is launching full-scale efforts to appeal to nonwhite voters, Jindal has become one of the party's most high-profile minorities. ""His stewardship of the state of Louisiana, dedication to reforming government and commitment to bringing forth new and innovative ideas make him a leader not just within the Republican Party, but in our nation as a whole,"" Boehner also said of Jindal on Wednesday. Jindal, who became governor two years after Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana, has drawn praise for spearheading the ongoing recovery efforts. ""When you look at major statewide offices Republicans have won over the past three years, there is one, Louisiana,"" said Alex Castellanos, a CNN contributor and Republican strategist. ""In a state where we lost confidence in government, perhaps more than any other state, he restored it and cut taxes."" Though he is often mentioned as a likely contender for the 2012 Republican presidential race, Jindal has said his current focus is on winning reelection in 2011. Jindal also said late last year that even if he were considering running for president, now is the time to support the sitting president. ""It doesn't matter whether you're Republican, Democrat or independent, it doesn't matter whether you voted for him or not, President-elect Barack Obama is our president,"" he said. The White House announced on Tuesday that Obama will deliver the annual State of the Union address to both houses of Congress on February 24. In 2008, Democrats tapped Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius -- then considered to be a possible vice presidential candidate -- to give the rebuttal speech to former President Bush's final State of the Union address. Other Democrats who delivered responses to Bush's State of the Unions include Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, and former Washington Gov. Gary Locke, the nation's first Chinese-American governor. The last Republican to deliver a response to a State of the Union address was Maine Sen. Susan Collins in 2000.","Jindal embodies image as ""party of better solutions,"" House Minority leader says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- It was a night for neon pink bow ties and words like ""disaster"" and ""monstrosity."" It was not the night, however, to be Paris Hilton, Mike Myers or Uwe Boll. Paula Einstein, Rebecca Marcotte and Kelie McIver do a parody of ""Dancing Queen"" to open the show. The 29th Annual Golden Raspberry Awards honored the worst film achievements of the year in a small theater in Hollywood on February 21. The night opened with a parody of the ""Mamma Mia"" song, ""Dancing Queen,"" and ended with ""Love Guru"" being named worst picture. ""It wasn't just the economy that tanked, so did the qualities of the movies being offered,"" Razzie founder John Wilson told CNN several weeks before the show. ""I would suggest putting away all sharp [instruments] before putting the DVDs in your machine."" Paris Hilton and Mike Myers came out on top -- or bottom -- for the awards. Hilton earned both the worst actress and worst supporting actress awards for her roles in ""Hottie & the Nottie"" and ""Repo: The Genetic Opera."" She was also awarded worst screen couple for her on-screen time with her co-stars Christine Lakin and Joel David Moore. Razzie host Gretchen Enders said that ""Hottie & the Nottie"" was ""a vanity production in the worst sense... Hilton, who served as executive producer, has no one to blame but herself."" Hilton's film had a budget of $2 million but only earned about $27,000 at the box office. ""Under Obama's new plan, they wouldn't even have to pay taxes,"" Wilson deadpanned. Myers added worst actor to the ""Love Guru"" worst picture and worst screenplay Razzies. To save anyone else from having to watch it, Wilson shredded a DVD copy of the film on stage. Parody films ""Disaster Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans,"" each nominated in five categories, came away empty-handed. However, that doesn't mean the Razzie foundation thinks they were worthwhile. ""When you invest the kind of money that a mainstream, big-budget star film requires, you want some insurance that your investment is going to come back to you. So... you're going to do what worked before,"" Wilson said. ""Financially that may make sense, but in terms of the audience's enjoyment, surprise or appreciation of what you're doing, it doesn't work."" Enter ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" this year's winner of the worst prequel, remake, rip-off or sequel award. ""A fourth installment of a beloved franchise, but this one found itself loved by almost no one,"" hosts Katsy Chappell and Josh Thoemke said. The approximately 740 voting members of the Raspberry Foundation also found Pierce Brosnan's singing voice sorely lacking. His role in ""Mama Mia"" earned him the worst supporting actor award. ""An actor who could not sing, should not sing and arguably did not sing, in a role he should not have accepted,"" Razzie hosts Chip Dornell and Kelie McIver said about the former James Bond. But perhaps the biggest ""winner"" of the night was Uwe Boll. Recipient of the worst director award, the foundation also recognized his lifetime work with the worst career achievement award. Boll is the ""worst living director on Earth,"" Wilson told CNN. Boll had a sense of humor about his Razzie success. He sent in a video rejection speech from a fake set of Darfur, Sudan, saying the Razzies had ruined his life and he would never be back. The Razzie team is already predicting next year's nominees. A few to watch out for: ""Hannah Montana,"" ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Bride Wars,"" -- the last of which has already grossed more than $50 million. ""It's kind of like watching a train wreck, isn't it?"" Wilson said.","Razzies honor worst film achievements of the past year .

"(CNN) -- Software giant Microsoft is offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of hackers behind a powerful computer virus that could lead to millions of PCs being hijacked. Experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm. Experts have so far been baffled by the true purpose of the Conficker or Downadup virus, but have described its spread as one of the most serious infections ever seen. The worm exploits a bug in Microsoft Windows to infect mainly corporate networks, then -- although it has yet to cause any harm -- it opens a link back to its point of origin, meaning it can receive further orders to wreak havoc. Microsoft has issued a patch to fix the bug, however if a single machine is infected in a large network, it will spread unchecked -- often reinfecting machines that have been disinfected. The threat from the virus prompted Microsoft in collaboration with other technology industry names to this week announce a $250,000 reward for information to track down those behind Conficker. ""As part of Microsoft's ongoing security efforts, we constantly look for ways to use a diverse set of tools and develop methodologies to protect our customers,"" said George Stathakopoulos, of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing Group. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at anti-virus firm F-Secure says the true scope of the virus is not known, but in the past 24 hours his company monitored Conficker signals from two million Internet protocol addresses. ""That's a lot,"" he told CNN. ""And one IP address here does not mean one infected computer, it means at least one infected computer. ""Many of those IP addresses are obviously company proxies or firewalls, hiding hundreds of more infections behind it. Unfortunately this also makes it impossible to estimate the total count of infected systems. ""So it's still big. Very big."" Microsoft has previously paid out similar rewards to informants who helped identify the creator of Sasser, another notorious worm let loose in 2004. The perpetrator was tracked to Germany, where he was sentenced a year later.","Software giant Microsoft offers $250,000 bounty to catch Conficker author .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Heavy rains smashed through a dam near Indonesia's capital Friday, unleashing a torrent of water that plowed into hundreds of homes and killed at least 52 people in what some survivors described as a suburban ""tsunami."" Members of a search and rescue team look for bodies around upended trees and vehicles near  Jakarta Friday. Sleeping residents were taken by surprise by the powerful flash flood as it crashed through Jakarta's crowded Cirendeu suburb, in the early hours of the morning. Rescue crews suspended their search for survivors overnight Friday evening, the National Disaster Coordination Agency said. The agency put the death toll at 52 with 17 missing. It said 33 people were injured and 1,490 left homeless. The Indonesian Health Ministry put the death toll higher at 58 people. After the deluge, drenched, injured and shivering survivors took refuge on the rooftops of their homes as rescuers in rubber boats struggled to reach them. Social affairs spokesman official Mardjito, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, said relief efforts were being hampered by debris from the dam. ""We're still trying to get into the houses, but the problem is, mud is getting in our way,"" he said. Pictures from the scene showed the pulverized ruins of wooden buildings emerging as brown muddied waters subside.  Watch scenes of the flood devastation » . Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, currently on the campaign trail ahead of elections later this year, said he had ordered senior ministers to visit the scene of the disaster. ""On behalf of the government, I express my condolences to the families of the dead victims and may their souls be accepted by God almighty,"" he said, according to the official Antara news agency. The rain obliterated a 255-meter-long section of the dam at around 4 am local time, releasing a wall of water from the 20-hectare lake that some survivors said reminded them of the tsunami that hit Indonesia in 2004. ""They said they had heard loud rumbling sounds like during a powerful earthquake. They later found out that the sounds came from the water rushing out from the dam's lake,"" Antara said. Survivors told stories of dead relatives and harrowing brushes with death as they struggled to escape rising waters. Dewi Masitoh, a 40-year-old housewife, told the AFP news agency that she escaped with her husband and two daughters after they saw rising water reach the door of their stilt house. ""We were on the second floor but my daughter went back downstairs when the window broke and water gushed in. My husband jumped in and pulled her out of the water by her neck. ""I punched a hole through the roof and we all climbed up through,"" she said, showing cuts and scratches on her arms."" Floods from heavy rains are an annual occurrence around Jakarta, a low lying city on the northern coast of Java island, where poor infrastructure often results in polluted canals and rivers spilling their banks and spilling into thousands of homes. In 2007, 38 people were killed and 430,000 forced from their homes when storm waters three meters deep in some places swamped 75 percent of the capital, which is home to about 9 million people. With poor sanitation and a hot and humid climate, the risk of water-borne diseases is usually a major concern following floods in the city, where mosquito-transmitted malaria is also a threat. CNN's Andy Saputra contributed to this report.","Death at now at least 52 from dam burst in Jakarta .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has arrested a suspected al Qaeda militant who intelligence officials say is tied to the London subway bombings in 2005, authorities there said Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Comedian and TV host Stephen Colbert has warned NASA to name a new wing of the international space station after him or he would ""seize power as space's evil tyrant overlord."" Stephen Colbert threatened NASA that he might become ""space's evil tyrant overlord."" A NASA spokesman said the U.S. space agency is aware of Colbert's threat, issued Monday night on Comedy Central's ""Colbert Report,"" but no decision will be made on the node's name until next week. Colbert topped NASA's online poll soliciting names for the wing, with 230,539 of the more than 1.1 million votes cast, according to NASA spokesman John Yembrick. The runner-up was Serenity, which Colbert said is not an appropriate name. ""That's not a space station,"" Colbert said. ""That's an adult diaper."" Serenity was the name of a spaceship in the television series ""Firefly,"" which spawned a 2005 movie. The contest rules spelled out that NASA reserves the right to ""ultimately select a name in accordance with the best interests of the agency. ... Such name may not necessarily be one which is on the list of voted-on candidate names."" NASA's hedging prompted a Pennsylvania congressman to urge the agency to name the node after the comedian. ""The people have spoken, and Stephen Colbert won it fair and square, even if his campaign was a bit over the top,"" Rep. Chaka Fattah said. Fattah sits on the congressional committee that oversees NASA's funding. ""NASA, I urge you to heed Congressman Fattah's call for democracy in orbit,"" Colbert said. ""Either name that node after me, or I, too, will reject democracy and seize power as space's evil tyrant overlord."" NASA's Yembrick said he watched Colbert's show Monday, but he would not directly respond to his ""evil tyrant overlord"" threat. ""We think it's great that he and his audience are taking an interest,"" Yembrick said. Several media outlets have reported that NASA is working on a compromise in which it would slap the droll Colbert's name on a piece of ""mission essential"" equipment in the new wing: the toilet. Colbert's loyal fans, lovingly called the Colbert Nation, have in the past bombarded polls to have things named after their idol. Thanks to them, the comedian out-polled every other name in a bridge-naming contest in Hungary. The country's government later said it cannot name the bridge after him because he does not speak Hungarian and is not deceased. Colbert also tried to get himself on Democratic and Republican primary ballots in his home state of South Carolina in 2007. The Democratic Party's executive council voted against his inclusion, and he did not qualify for the Republican primary because he missed the deadline. But ice-cream maker Ben and Jerry named a flavor in honor of him, Colbert's AmeriCone Dream. And Virgin America named one of its planes Air Colbert.","TV host's name topped poll seeking new name for space station wing .

"(CNN) -- President Obama's address to Congress was full of lofty promises to make unprecedented investments in government programs, even as he aims to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. President Obama on Tuesday outlined an ambitious agenda to help revive the economy. But it takes more than a proposal to bring about real change. Will Obama be able to meet his goals? CNN political analyst David Gergen says the answer will be ""one of the greatest political dramas of our time."" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs says the budget Obama sends to Capitol Hill Thursday will help show how the president plans to tackle his ambitious agenda. Here's a look at some of Obama's goals, and what experts are saying about them. Economy . Promise: ""To ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system."" Promise: ""I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office."" Promise: ""My administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. As you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time, but we have already identified $2 trillion in savings over the next decade."" Analysis: Democratic strategist Lisa Caputo said so far, Obama is taking the right steps to revive the economy, but the country needs to see his plans put into action. He's already passed a massive stimulus bill, and he has a housing bill and a banking regulatory reform bill in the works. ""He's doing all the right things. Hopefully he'll come forth with a balanced budget. ... He's saying all of the right things. He's got to do them,"" she said. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ed Rollins pointed out that what Obama did was put forth proposals, not an action plan. ""This was a speech about aspirations. There was not a strategy or the details. They may come later, but it's an overly ambitious program, and if he can accomplish just the financial part of it, he'll move the country forward,"" he said. The success of Obama's budget goals will fall heavily on Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Rollins said. ""Can she control her members? The last two years the Congress has controlled the spending, it's been a Democrat Congress. It's still a Democrat Congress and will be for the foreseeable future. There's a lot of pet projects these people want, there's a lot of entitlements that people aren't willing to cut,"" he said. Larry Winget, a personal finance expert, said he agrees with everything that Obama said needs to be done, but said he doesn't agree that the country can borrow or spend its way out of debt. ""If you came to me and said, 'I'm in a financial crisis, I've screwed up everything based on all of my bad decisions, what should I do?' the last thing in the world I would tell you is to go borrow more money or go try to spend something that -- money you don't have on something you don't need,"" he said. Winget said instead, the country should work its way out of debt. ""The practical thing would be to put more money in the hands of people, which would always go back to, we need to give bigger ... tax cuts,"" he said. Education . Promise: ""By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. That is a goal we can meet."" Promise: ""It will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education, from the day they are born to the day they begin a career. That is a promise we have to make to the children of America."" Analysis: Rollins pointed out that this is the first time the federal government is taking a such a major role in education. ""We have $59 billion in this year's education budget. We added another $100 billion to build schools and do those things. That's never been the role of the federal government. So it's a whole new way to go, and obviously if it works, it may benefit the country,"" he said. CNN Senior Political Correspondent Candy Crowley said Obama's proposals are just the start of a new direction. ""It is the beginning of shaping the country differently when it comes to a lot of these programs. And the different shape, again, is a more liberal shape of the country, than really the conservative country it has been since Ronald Reagan,"" she said. Energy . Promise: ""We will invest $15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power, advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America."" Promise: ""Thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation's supply of renewable energy in the next three years.""  Watch Obama say, 'It begins with energy' » . Analysis: Lakshman Achuthan, managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, said Obama laid out a ""tall order"" of what needs to be done, and tried to show how everything is connected. ""So he showed, here's the short term, which is stimulus, banking, housing. Here's the longer term: If we want to own the century, we have to deal with energy, education, health, for example, and connecting those things,"" he said. ""And one of the critical things is that it's not clear -- you know, the stimulus is great, we passed it, but it doesn't work unless the banks lend. The banks won't lend unless the housing sector stabilizes. So, it's -- this is much tougher than chewing gum and walking at the same time,"" he said. Health care . Promise: ""[The recovery plan] makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that's one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control."" Promise: ""To preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing cost in Medicare and Social Security. Comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come, and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.""  Watch Obama explain his plans for health care reform » . Analysis: Larry Elder, a libertarian commentator, thought that Obama gave a ""great political speech"" but Elder questioned the president's economics. ""I just wish he was a limited-government, personal-responsibility, hard-core-fiscal-responsibility Republican, which, of course, he isn't. Look, he's got a faith in government that I don't share,"" he said. ""Whenever I hear somebody talk about investing in health care, investing in education, investing in energy, I put my hand on my wallet and I say, 'These guys are not good stewards of your money the way you are of your own money.' "" Pamela Gentry, a senior political analyst with BET, said Obama's big promises will keep people watching because they play to the drama of this presidency. Health care, she said, will be the issue to watch. ""Health care has got to be one of the toughest ones. I mean, Medicare is the second largest budget after defense. So, if he can pull this off, it would be remarkable,"" she said. Gibbs said Wednesday that the president is well aware of the difficulty of reforming health care. ""But he understands the only way to do that is bring together the stakeholders on both sides of the aisle, business and labor, doctors, providers. That process will begin next week here to discuss health care reform,"" he said. But, Gibbs said, the president doesn't plan on setting any ""artificial deadlines"" to pass health care reform. Military . Promise: ""To relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and Marines. And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned."" Analysis: Patricia Murphy, editor of Citizen Jane Politics, said she thought Obama's speech was strong, but she didn't follow Obama's math.  Watch: How to cut defense spending » . ""The problem in this speech, I think, is his promise to cut the deficit in half and layering on program after program after program, saying we'll pull the troops out of Iraq, but we'll increase the size of the military. Those numbers don't add up,"" she said. CNN contributor Roland Martin on Tuesday compared Obama to rapper Kanye West. Martin: Obama's ambitious agenda is a good thing . All of the president's promises -- fixing health care, fixing the economy, halving the deficit, boosting funds to troops, curing cancer, achieving energy independence and solving Pakistan's problems, to name a few -- are just the markers in terms of his presidency, Martin said. ""Sort of when like Kanye West had his new album, and he said, 'I want to make it as bad as Stevie Wonder's [Songs in the Key of Life].' ... He said, 'If it doesn't get to that, it's still a great album.' ""[Obama] is a guy who is saying, a president who's saying, 'Look, I want to raise the stakes.' And, so, isn't it amazing that we're sitting here, saying, 'Wow, an ambitious president'? Well, shouldn't we have an ambitious president? Shouldn't we have a president saying, 'We can do more'?""","President Obama promises to halve deficit by 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Forty-four people were killed during an attack on a wedding party in Turkey's southeastern Mardin province Monday. A child lies wounded on a stretcher following the attack by gunmen on the wedding party. The casualties, which included the bride and groom, were slain while many of them were praying, authorities said. Three others were injured and eight people were detained in the attack sparked by a feud between families, said Besir Atalay, Interior Minister of Turkey. There were 17 women and six children among the dead, said Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. ""It is inhuman beyond words to open fire on people including a one-year old child who were having a wedding, living a happy moment, praying,"" Erdogan said. ""The fact that the eight suspects and the victims who died have the same surname increases cruelty of this murder."" The assailants attacked the party in the small village of Bilge with bombs and automatic weapons, according to the Cihan news agency. With only 32 households in the village there were too many victims to fit into the local morgue, authorities said. Some of the victims had the same last name, Celebi, as the suspects who were detained, Atalay added. The bride, Sevgi Celebi, and groom, Habip Ari, both died in the attack, Anatolian Agency, Turkey's semi-official news agency, reported. The chief and the former chief of the village were among those killed in the attack, the agency added. Police have blocked access to the village while they conduct their investigation. Mardin Mayor Besir Ayanoglu told Turkish television network NTV that the incident was not terror related.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Opponents of controversial plans to use hybrid human-animal embryos for research spoke out Tuesday, calling the practice unnecessary, unnatural, and reprehensible a day after British lawmakers voted to allow it. Advocates of hybrid cells say animal eggs from which a nucleus has been removed are simply ""empty shells."" The British parliament debated the issue Monday as part of its discussion of the Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill, which will update legislation on reproduction and embryos. ""Crossing the species barrier in this way is deeply, deeply reprehensible, undesirable,"" said Josephine Quintavalle, a bioethicist who founded Comment on Reproductive Ethics (CORE). The research involves emptying an animal egg and filling it with human cells. The resulting embryo is allowed to develop for 14 days -- during which time scientists harvest the stem cells -- before being destroyed. Scientists hope working with those stem cells will lead to treatments for serious conditions like motor neuron disease, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, and they say using hybrids overcomes the shortage of human embryos. ""The use of animal eggs will provide a valuable resource to embryo research scientists,"" argued Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo. Lawmakers were allowed to vote according to conscience and the legislation passed comfortably, though not without opposition. ""If an embryo could talk, perhaps it would echo what Mary Shelley did say in 'Frankenstein': 'I, the miserable and the abandoned, an abortion to be spurned out and kicked and trampled on,'"" Conservative Party lawmaker Edward Leigh told parliament. Supporters of the research dispute the numerous ""Frankenstein"" references and say it does not create monsters. Stephen Minger, director of the stem cell biology lab at King's College in London, said the practice begins with the removal of an animal egg's nucleus, which contains all of the chromosomes, thereby stripping the egg of its ""species identity."" ""It's an empty shell,"" Minger said. ""By putting a human cell -- not just a nucleus, but in our case an intact human cell -- into the egg, you confer a human genetic identity onto that."" The approved bill creates a legal framework for the scientific research on hybrid embryos. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown feels so strongly about the benefits of the research that he wrote a column Sunday in The Observer newspaper calling it an ""inherently moral endeavor,"" but ethics groups and others disagree. ""I think we all know that we don't reproduce with animals,"" Quintavalle said. ""Humans do not reproduce with animals. Whether it's done in the laboratory or not doesn't make it right."" Quintavalle urged the government and the scientific community to wait until a new method of research emerges which does not mix animal and human genetic material. Human Genetics Alert, a secular independent watchdog, said it found defects among existing hybrid embryos which raise doubts about whether mixed embryos can produce useful stem cells. ""I'm very, very unimpressed with the scientific case for doing that,"" said David King, a former molecular biologist who now heads the HGA. ""The science is so weak and the ethical concerns are so significant, I think you have to weigh that."" The scientific arguments in favor of the research have been ""overhyped,"" King said, and offer no hope of a cure for those suffering with genetic disorders. ""Very little, I think, will come out of it and I think hopes are being raised that will be cruelly disappointed,"" King said. The Human Fertilization and Embryology Bill was drawn up in 1990, when science and government were unaware that current hybrid-embryo developments were possible, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health told CNN. The original bill did allow the mixing of human and animal eggs, but only for the purpose of testing the fertility of human sperm, said the spokeswoman, who declined to be named in line with policy. The practice was known as the ""hamster test"" because hamster eggs were used. The revised bill now allows hybrid embryos for further research but specifies they may not be placed in a woman or an animal, the spokeswoman said. Also, those using the embryos must prove that the use is for research, and that use of an embryo is necessary, she said. Creating hybrid embryos is not the only way to develop useful stem cells, said Minger. A new method called pluripotency, developed in December, allows scientists to turn adult cells into something resembling an embryonic stem cell, he said. Pluripotency, however, requires extensive genetic manipulation of the cells and yields few that are of use to research, Minger said. ""We will pursue that (research) but it's just too early to know which is the best approach,"" Minger said. ""Most rational scientists would say we need to proceed down as many tracks as possible because we just have no idea what's going to lead to the best benefit."" CNN's Phil Black contributed to this report.","UK lawmakers approve bill allowing use of hybrid embryos in stem cell research .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A yellow taxi sits idle at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, leaving its Somali immigrant driver visibly frustrated. Abdullah Hagi, a cabdriver in Atlanta, Georgia, has had to cut back on expenses as the economy has declined. ""I've been here two hours, and you're my first customer,"" Abdullahi Hagi, formerly of Mogadishu, said as he tightened his grip on the leather-bound steering wheel. ""When the economy is bad, people don't ride cabs."" Often considered a bellwether for consumer spending, cabdrivers and the tough times they now face could mean worse times for relatives living in places like Somalia, where war and famine have made remittances from emigres like Hagi more important. Amid a financial crunch that has many of Hagi's customers feeling the pinch, fewer fares and mounting bills have not stopped him from sending a big chunk of his paycheck home to his family. Despite a bit more empty space in his hand-stitched wallet, Hagi said he has worked out a solution to keep his family fed back home. He is pooling his paycheck with fellow cabdrivers.  Watch how cabbie gets by with less » . An informal lending system has emerged in major U.S. cities, akin to an old-world style of community banking that is fending off starvation in places like Somalia. In Atlanta, cabdrivers lend to each other based on need, depending whose family is in more dire straits. ""I could never borrow from any bank,"" Hagi admits. ""You take loans, not from institutions but from friends."" However, Hagi is still struggling to make ends meet. ""Should I pay the student loan or should I pay for my starving relatives?"" he asked. ""That's the kind of choice you've got to make every day."" ""Lately, it's been getting harder and harder to accumulate enough to survive and also send back home,"" he added, shifting his weight in the cab's cracked leather seats. ""You try to cut corners in your lifestyle to be able to send money to your people because they're always in much worse condition -- always on the brink of collapse or starvation."" Hagi and his family are not alone. Figures from the United Nations put nearly half of Somalia's population in need of humanitarian assistance, according to a report released in September. One in six Somali children under the age of 5 are acutely malnourished, the report found, and food is getting more costly. The price of sorghum, used for grain and found on the dinner plates of most Somali households, soared 600 percent since last year, according to a separate U.N. report. Civil war and drought have made food both scarce and a source of political power. Pitched battles between an Islamic insurgency and Ethiopian-backed transitional government forces have left thousands dead and rendered what many have called a ""failed state"" now teetering on the brink of its worst humanitarian crisis in over a decade, according to a World Food Program report. The United Nations says ""all information indicates that the key factors driving this humanitarian crisis will continue to worsen over the coming months."" That crisis, coinciding with a financial one that clobbered Wall Street and sent U.S. automakers begging for bailouts, may leave cabdrivers like Hagi facing the perfect storm. ""You cut your groceries. You cut even the clothes you buy the kids. You cut everything,"" he said. ""Whatever you can think of."" There may not be much more to cut. For now, cabdrivers like Hagi are turning to each other to keep food on the family table back home.","U.S. economic woes take toll on Somali cabdrivers .

"NEWARK, New Jersey (CNN) -- The most ""far-flung and exotic fugitive investigation ever conducted by the U.S. Marshals Service"" ended early Sunday with convicted child molester Alan Horowitz in custody on U.S. soil. Alan Horowitz was convicted in 1991 on 34 counts of child molestation. Officers from the U.S. Marshals service arrested the 60-year-old at Newark Liberty International Airport after a 15-hour flight from New Delhi, India. The ordained Orthodox rabbi and former child psychologist was arrested on May 22 at a seaside resort in Mahabalipuram, India, according to parole officer Robert Georgia. An agent from the Diplomatic Security Service escorted him aboard the Continental Airlines flight, authorities said. He is being held at a correctional facility in New Jersey and will appear before an extradition judge on July 16th before being taken to New York to face a parole violation charge there. He also faces a federal charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.   Watch Horowitz in custody at Newark airport » . A number of Internet tipsters in India were responsible for alerting the Marshal's service to Horowitz's whereabouts, said U.S. Marshal Gary Mattison, who was assigned to track down Horowitz last year. Horowitz served 13 years of a 10-20 year sentence for child molestation and was released on parole in 2004, authorities said. In June 2006, he fled the country shortly after meeting with his parole officer, setting off the manhunt that involved the Indian police, agents from the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service, and U.S. Marshals, U.S. Marshals told CNN. Horowitz's 1991 conviction was on 34 counts of child molestation in Schenectady, New York. A dual citizen of the United States and Israel, Horowitz has also been convicted of ""perverted sexual practices"" in Maryland, where he was found guilty of abusing one of his patients, federal marshals said. During the 1980s, while he was living in Israel, he was the subject of a police investigation into charges he was sexually abusing his second wife's children, according to the U.S. Marshal service. He also faced another sexual misconduct investigation while living in North Carolina, authorities say. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Anna Nicole Smith's longtime partner and attorney Howard K. Stern and two doctors were charged Thursday with conspiring to furnish drugs before her death in 2007, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend Howard K. Stern was among those charged Thursday. Smith, 39, was pronounced dead February 8 after being found unconscious in her hotel room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino near Hollywood, Florida. The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. At the time of her death several prescription medications -- both in Smith's name and that of her partner and lawyer, Stern -- were found in the room. Officials said prescription and over-the-counter drugs were found in Smith's system, including three antidepressants or antianxiety drugs. Also found in toxicology testing was human growth hormone and chloral hydrate, a sleep medication, officials said. Stern, 40, and doctors Sandeep Kapoor, 40, and Khristine Eroshevich, 61, were each charged with eight felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions between June 2004 and January 2007 -- only weeks before the playmate's death. Kapoor and Eroshevich were each also charged with obtaining a prescription for opiates by ""fraud, deceit or misrepresentation."" Each were also charged with one count of obtaining a prescription for opiates by giving a false name or address, according to the DA's office. All three were charged with one count of ""prescribing, administering or dispensing a controlled substance to an addict.""

"LONDON, England -- A severe rabies epidemic has claimed the lives of at least 83 children within three months in Angola's capital, Luanda, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. Luanda, which has a large population of stray dogs, also has some of the world's worst slums. Describing the situation as ""very worrying,""  WHO rabies expert Francois Meslin told CNN: ""This is a huge number and could be the tip of the iceberg."" A doctor working at the country's biggest referral hospital Hospital Pediatrico David Bernardino said staff were unable to save any of the children as rabies vaccines had run out. Some of the children were also brought into the hospital too late to be saved, Luis Bernardino, head of the hospital told UN humanitarian organization IRIN. He warned that the number of deaths could be much higher. ""The children were brought to our hospital and are the only ones we know of, so the number could be higher,"" Bernardino told IRIN. ""It is a sad moment for us,"" he added. ""I think it was probably that no one was prepared for such a high case load."" The number of cases has now started declining, however, said Bernardino. According to Meslin, this could be because the current infected pack of dogs has died. Meslin told CNN that the Angolan government needed to embark on a dog rabies control program urgently to prevent further outbreaks. Angola's capital, where most of the population live in slums, has a large number of stray dogs who are said to have caused the epidemic. ""We have had some sporadic cases in other provincial capitals in the country; we think the virus was brought into Luanda and then spread through the dogs -- Angolans love dogs,"" Bernardino said. ""When the first 10 deaths were reported in December 2008 we alerted the authorities, but we do not have veterinary services in the city, no kennels [to keep and observe the animals] and vaccinate them,"" he added. Another problem contributing to the crisis is that vaccines are too expensive for the average family. ""One dose of vaccine costs about $10 and five of those have to be administered, which makes the total cost of treatment $50 which is more than a month's salary for families in most developing countries,"" Meslin added. In 2008 the WHO wrote that rabies, a disease transmitted from animals with infected saliva to humans, is present on nearly every continent of the world but more that 95 per cent of human deaths occur in Asia and Africa. It can be prevented by vaccination, either prior to exposure or as part of post-exposure treatment. But once symptoms of the disease develop, rabies is fatal. According to the WHO, rabies can affect the lungs, stomach and central nervous systems. In the critical stage, a victim slips into a coma and death, usually due to breathing failure. More than 55,000 people die of rabies each year, the WHO wrote, with 30 to 60 per cent of the victims of dog bites being children under the age of 15.","A severe rabies epidemic has killed at least 83 children in 3 months in Angola .

"Editor's note: Dr. Anthony S. Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci: Progress has been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, but ""our work is just beginning."" (CNN) -- When we commemorated the first World AIDS Day on December 1, 1988, we had little to celebrate. The number of reported AIDS cases in the United States was nearing 80,000 and rising rapidly. Untold thousands more in this country were living with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Globally, AIDS cases already had been reported from more than 135 countries. An AIDS tsunami clearly was looming, but we had few defenses at our disposal. For those of us caring for people with AIDS, it was a dark time. We had just one anti-HIV medicine in our pharmacies, AZT, a drug that the virus rapidly defeated by mutating and developing resistance. Lacking other medicines to slow the relentless replication of HIV and its destruction of a person's immune system, we did our best to help our patients by managing to the extent possible their AIDS-related infections and complications. But the life span of most of the patients was measured in months. Two decades later, much has changed. An unprecedented research effort has led to more than two dozen anti-HIV drugs, more than for all other viral diseases combined. Taken in proper combinations, these medications have dramatically improved the prognosis for people living with HIV by increasing their life span by at least a decade and providing the possibility of a normal life span with continued therapy. Scientifically proven prevention approaches -- education and outreach to at-risk populations, voluntary HIV testing and counseling, condom distribution, prevention of HIV transmission from mother to baby, harm reduction approaches for drug abusers, mass-media campaigns and the screening of donated blood -- have been deployed with great success in the United States and many other countries. Innovative programs such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as the efforts of nongovernment organizations, have reached millions of people in low- and mid-income countries worldwide with HIV-related services, at a scale unimaginable a few years ago. And gradually -- but too slowly -- we have begun addressing AIDS-related stigma in this country and abroad. Much has been accomplished in the fight against HIV/AIDS from scientific, medical and public health standpoints. However, now is no time to rest on our accomplishments or our laurels. The statistics of the HIV/AIDS pandemic tell us that much more needs to be done. Around the world, a staggering 2.7 million people were infected in 2007 alone. Globally, 33 million people are living with HIV infection, most of them in the developing world. In the United States, more than 1 million people are living with HIV. And 56,000 more people are infected each year in the U.S., driving HIV prevalence rates in some of our communities to levels that rival those seen in sub-Saharan Africa. Gay and bisexual men, and African-Americans in general, are disproportionately affected. The true ground zero of the HIV epidemic in the United States is in those communities. What is the way forward? First, even in the face of a world economic crisis, the global community must scale up the delivery of proven HIV therapies and prevention services. In low- and middle-income countries, less than one-third of people in need of anti-HIV therapy are receiving it, and only one in five people at risk of HIV infection have access to prevention services. All around the world, access to HIV services -- and medical care in general -- remains a challenge in many poor communities. The global community must sustain our commitment to investing resources for medicines, clinics, as well as training and salaries for doctors, nurses and community health care workers to provide care for HIV/AIDS and other diseases in the settings where they occur. Here in the United States, more than one-fifth of people living with HIV are unaware of their infection and not receiving appropriate care for their own health or the prevention services that would help them avoid transmitting the virus to others. A frequent scenario is that people learn of their infection status only when they have advanced symptoms of HIV disease, when their health may by irreparably damaged. Now is the time for the medical community and policymakers to embrace U.S. guidelines for all Americans aged 13-64 to be voluntarily  tested in routine medical care. Barriers to implementation of HIV testing guidelines, such as state, local or agency regulations that conflict with the recommendations, variability in payment coverage for the test, and concerns about the stigma and discrimination that may accompany an HIV diagnosis, must be addressed. Meanwhile, we also must continue to invest in the next generation of treatment and prevention modalities. Encouragingly, new means of preventing HIV infection are emerging from well-designed and well-implemented clinical research trials. One exciting concept is pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP, giving preventive doses of anti-HIV drugs to individuals who are at an increased risk of HIV infection. This still-experimental strategy is based on the concept that if HIV replication can be inhibited immediately following exposure to the virus, permanent infection might be thwarted. Multiple clinical studies of PrEP are under way in the United States and in populations around the world. Ongoing research to develop microbicidal gels or creams to be applied before sex offer the hope of people being able to protect themselves from HIV infection in situations where saying no to sex or insisting on condom use is not an option. Finally, a preventive HIV vaccine remains the greatest hope for halting the relentless spread of HIV/AIDS. We must solve the mystery of how to prompt the human body to produce a protective immune response against HIV, which natural infection with the virus seems unable to do. Historically, it has taken decades to find effective vaccines to combat most infectious diseases. Researchers usually experienced numerous setbacks and disappointments before reaching success, yet they persevered. Finding a safe and effective HIV vaccine demands an equally intense resolve. On this World AIDS Day, we should be proud of the many scientific advances that have been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS. But it is hardly a time for self-congratulation. Rather, we must understand that our work is just beginning. Developing HIV interventions and delivering them to the people who need them will require scientific and public health vision, and dedication from all sectors of society, in good times and bad. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci.","Dr. Anthony S. Fauci: Access to HIV services, medical care a challenge in poor areas .

It may be two years since Wimbledon and the French Open joined the other major tournaments in offering women the same cash prize as men, but for some tennis fans the issue is far from resolved.

The author went on: ""Political correctness, sexual equality and feminism all prevent many commentators from stating the bleeding obvious ... no sports watcher in their right minds could honestly say female tennis players, or golfers for that matter, deserve as much money as their male counterparts."" The writer -- a woman -- went on to lambaste the world's best female tennis players, describing world number one Serena Williams' defeat of Dinara Safina in the Australian Open final as ""embarrassing, pitiful and pathetic."" ""Her humiliation of Dinara Safina was a terrible advertisement for a sport that has apparently disappeared up its own backside."" Rather than provoking a tirade of abuse, many readers agreed with the author, outspoken Australian journalist and sports commentator, Rebecca Wilson. ""Right on the money. Women's tennis is boring. Typical game. ""Ugh. Grunt. Ugh. Grunt. Ugh. Grunt. Out. Love-Fifteen,"" one said. Another added: ""It's about time someone said what everyone was thinking."" More chimed in: ""Everyone agrees, few will say it"" and ""totally agree. Women's tennis is pathetic."" A couple of dissenters in the crowd urged Wilson to turn her attentions elsewhere: ""The usual tripe that Wilson dishes up week after week,"" and ""please go away and let someone with something important to say use your space."" What do you think? Do women deserve equal prize money in tennis? Sound Off below. Billie Jean King has heard it all before. The former world number one has spent a good part of the last forty years campaigning for equal prize money, and equal status, for women. The decision by the All England Tennis and Croquet Club in February 2007, and then the French Open one day later, to award equal prize money to women marked the end of a fight that started in 1968, the first year of Open tennis. ""When Rod Laver won Wimbledon, he got £2,000. And when I won Wimbledon in the same year, 1968, I got £750,"" she told CNN in an interview filmed for this month's edition of ""Revealed."" ""I knew then that was going to be one of our next battles that we would have to fight over the years,"" she added. King hoped to put the matter to rest in 1973 when she took on self-proclaimed male chauvinist Bobby Riggs in now famous match known as ""The Battle of the Sexes."" Riggs, a former men's number one, claimed the women's game was so poor that even he, as a 55-year-old retiree from the sport, could beat the top female players. King accepted the challenge and thrashed Riggs 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 in front of a television audience of millions. Those who argue for lower pay for women's tennis say they play fewer sets and attract a smaller television audience so they should receive less money. Campaigners for equal pay say that it's not an issue of time on the court, but an matter of fair and equal treatment . As current world number six Venus Williams once argued in an open letter published in The Times, ""we enjoy huge and equal celebrity and are paid for the value we deliver to broadcasters and spectators, not the amount of time we spend on the stage.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The family of a retired FBI agent who was reported missing in Iran two years ago said Monday that they remain hopeful for his return. Photos from Robert Levinson's family show him in 2006, left, and as he might look today. Monday marks the second anniversary of the disappearance of Robert Levinson, a father of seven children and grandfather of two. ""After two years of constantly praying for his return, we continue to anxiously await word of his whereabouts,"" said Christine Levinson, the missing man's wife, in a statement. ""Two years [have passed] since our seven children and I last heard his voice, saw his warm, loving smile, and since we last hugged him hello or kissed him goodbye,"" she said. Tuesday will be Levinson's 61st birthday. Levinson disappeared during a business trip to Iran's Kish Island in 2007. Iranian authorities have said repeatedly that they do not know what might have happened to him, but the claim is widely doubted in the United States. ""Since that day our family has been living a nightmare,"" Christine Levinson said. ""This has brought so much darkness to our lives."" Christine Levinson released a computer-enhanced photograph showing what the family thinks Bob Levinson may look like today. The State Department has consistently denied Levinson was working for the U.S. government and has unsuccessfully pressed Tehran for information about his whereabouts. ""We reiterate our commitment to determining Mr. Levinson's welfare and whereabouts, and reuniting him with his family,"" acting State Department spokesman Robert Wood said in a statement on Sunday. Congressional reaction in Levinson's home state of Florida has been more pointed. ""On several diplomatic occasions when Bob Levinson's name has been brought up to Iranian officials, the standard answer is, 'We don't know anything about that.' But the next thing out of the Iranian officials' mouths are to discuss the matter of the Iranians held by the Americans in Irbil, Iraq,"" Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, told reporters last month. ""You can draw your own conclusions,"" he said. U.S. troops arrested five Iranians accused of being members of an elite Iranian military unit during a January 2007 raid in the Iraqi city of Irbil. The Iranians were accused of supporting Shiite militias in Iraq, but Iran said they were diplomats and accused the United States of violating international law by raiding a consulate. Nelson and Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Florida, have said they plan to introduce legislation in their respective chambers calling on Iran to cooperate with the United States and come up with information about Levinson. Levinson had been working as a private investigator in Dubai. He was last heard from on March 8, 2007, when he checked into a Kish Island hotel and then checked out to return to the United States the following day. Wexler has said Levinson never arrived at the airport for his flight home. In December 2007, Levinson's wife and other relatives traveled to Iran and met with officials. Christine Levinson has said the Iranian government was polite and guaranteed her family's security on their trip, but provided no details regarding her husband's whereabouts. ""In the past two years, our family's grief has grown to despair,"" Christine Levinson said. The State Department is asking anyone with information about the case to contact the department or the Levinson family via their Web site, www.helpboblevinson.com.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The chairman of India's UB Group, which includes Bangalore-based Kingfisher Airlines and United Breweries, made the winning $1.8 million bid on a number of Mahatma Gandhi's personal items on auction. Mahatma Gandhi was known for his peaceful opposition to tyranny, which led to India's independence. Vijay Mallya was expected to return the items to the Indian government, according to CNN-IBN, CNN's sister station in India. Controversy surrounded the sale Thursday of Gandhi's items -- among them his metal-rimmed glasses, pocket watch, sandals, bowl and plate -- prompting the seller, James Otis, to ask that the items be withdrawn from the auction. India voiced strong objections to the auction. Its Ministry of External Affairs said the bidding would ""commercialize and thereby demean the memory of the Father of the Nation and everything that he stood for in his life, beliefs and actions."" On Tuesday, a New Delhi court issued an injunction to stop the sale.  Watch the auction stoke high interest » . But the Antiquorum auction house in Manhattan went ahead with the auction as scheduled. The Indian government had rejected an offer from Otis, who had asked the Indian government to expand its spending on the poor in exchange for the items. India's government already spends a large amount of money on the country's disadvantaged sectors, India's culture minister Ambika Soni told reporters Thursday. Still, the government had hoped Otis would not allow the public to bid on the items. Soni, the culture minister, said that India's government exercised several options to stop the auction at the Antiquorum in New York. Gandhi, who waged a long struggle against British rule in India, was assassinated in New Delhi by a Hindu fanatic on January 30, 1948. He is still widely revered for his insistence on non-violent protest to achieve political and social progress. Many Indians believe selling Gandhi's items for profit is outrageous. ""I feel very sad about it because Gandhi himself never believed in private possessions,"" said Varsha Das, director of India's National Gandhi Museum, using a term of endearment for Gandhi. ""He gave away everything. He did not even have a home to live in."" CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Mallya expected to return items to Indian government, CNN-IBN reports .

"(CNN) -- Authorities who seized $8,500 and assorted jewelry from a Tennessee man after a traffic stop in east Texas have agreed to return the property after his case drew attention from CNN. Police in the small East Texas town of Tenaha are accused of unjustly taking valuables from motorists. Roderick Daniels said police in Tenaha, Texas, took the money in October 2007 after they stopped him for doing 37 mph in a 35-mph zone. He said police threatened him with money-laundering charges and promised not to prosecute if he signed over the cash, which Daniels said was to buy a new car. Daniels and other motorists who have been stopped by Tenaha police are part of a lawsuit seeking to end what plaintiff's lawyer David Guillory calls a systematic fleecing of drivers passing through the town of about 1,000. On Friday, after Shelby County District Attorney Lynda Russell refused repeated requests to discuss cases like Daniels' with CNN, her office filed papers dropping its claim on his property. ""I just feel blessed,"" Daniels said. ""I am happy everything is going good right now. ... I just want to celebrate."" Texas law allows police to confiscate drug money and other personal property they think is used in the commission of a crime. If no charges are filed or the person is acquitted, the property has to be returned. Russell issued a statement through her attorneys denying impropriety, and George Bowers, Tenaha's longtime mayor, says his police follow the law. But Guillory, who brought the lawsuit challenging the seizures, called cases like Daniels' ""a shakedown"" and ""a piracy operation."" Guillory said authorities in Tenaha, about 180 miles east of Dallas, seized $3 million from 2006 to 2008. In about 150 cases, virtually all involving African-American or Latino motorists, the seizures were improper, he said. All defendants in the lawsuit deny wrongdoing. In a written statement, Russell's attorneys said the prosecutor ""has used and continues to use prosecutorial discretion ... and is in compliance with Texas law, the Texas constitution and the United States Constitution."" But the attention paid to Tenaha has led to an effort by Texas lawmakers to tighten the state's forfeiture laws.","Tenaha, Texas, police confiscated money in 2007 after traffic stop .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Veterans groups are warning President Barack Obama against going ahead with a possible administration move to charge veterans' private health care for service-related injuries. Veterans groups say it's ""wholly unacceptable"" to charge their private insurance for service injuries. In a letter sent by 11 of the most prominent veterans organizations, the groups warned that the idea ""is wholly unacceptable and a total abrogation of our government's moral and legal responsibility to the men and women who have sacrificed so much."" CNN obtained a copy of the letter sent to the White House last Friday by groups including The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. Read the letter (PDF) A White House spokesman would neither confirm nor deny the option is being considered. ""The details of specific proposals will be transmitted with the full submission in April. The president has made it clear that meeting the needs of veterans is one of his priorities, and as a result has requested an 11 percent increase in discretionary funding for 2010, and the administration is actively working with the veterans community to ensure we get the details of this budget right,"" said White House spokesman Nick Shapiro. In the letter, the groups said they have been told by sources on Capitol Hill and at the VA that the idea under consideration would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to bill health insurance for a treatment of a disability or injury that was a result of military service. The argument for the proposal is that it frees up money for the VA by charging the private insurers, allowing the VA to spend on more services, said Joe Violante, legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, who opposes the idea. While there could be savings, Violante warned it also could lead to an increase in premiums for veterans with private coverage. """"We cannot and would not agree to any proposal that would expand this concept any further,"" the heads of the 11 groups wrote in the letter. ""While we understand the fiscal difficulties this country faces right now, placing the burden of those fiscal problems on the men and women who have already sacrificed a great deal for this country is unconscionable."" Currently, veterans' private insurance is only charged when they receive health care from the VA for medical issues that are not related to service injuries, like getting the flu. Charging for service-related injuries would violate ""a sacred trust,"" said Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Joe Davis. Davis said the move would risk private health care for veterans and their families by potentially maxing out benefits paying for costly war injury treatments. It could also make it harder for veterans to get private insurance if the companies decide to reject them for pre-existing conditions, rather than be billed for service-connected injuries, Davis said. ""This seems like bad politics and bad policy,"" said IAVA Policy Director Vanessa Williamson, noting that every veterans group opposes it and warns it will adversely affect veterans. ""I don't see this as a tenable option.""","Possible change in billing angers veterans groups .

"(CNN) -- Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk was deported to Germany on Monday evening after he was removed from his Cleveland, Ohio-area home in the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers earlier in the day. German officials claim John Demjanjuk was an accessory to 29,000 murders in a Nazi death camp. An ambulance transported him to an airstrip at the Cleveland airport. The plane carrying Demjanjuk departed at 7:13 p.m. Demjanjuk, 89, is wanted by German authorities for his alleged involvement during World War II in killings at Sobibor, a Nazi death camp in Poland. His deportation closed a chapter in one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged Holocaust perpetrator in history. It  also sets the stage for what likely will prove to be an extraordinary German war crimes trial. The Supreme Court last Thursday denied a stay of deportation for Demjanjuk. Justice John Paul Stevens without comment refused to intervene in the planned transfer from the United States. Federal courts have all rejected his appeals, and the order from Stevens cleared the way for the Justice Department to move ahead with the deportation. Demjanjuk's lawyers had asked the high court to consider their claims that he is too ill and frail to be sent overseas. They also raised human rights and other legal issues in their last-minute appeal. A German court last Wednesday had also ruled against a request for a stay. Officials in Berlin have issued an arrest warrant charging Demjanjuk with being an accessory to the murder of about 29,000 civilians at Sobibor in 1943. The native Ukrainian has long claimed he was a prisoner of war, not a death camp guard. Immigration officers previously entered Demjanjuk's Cleveland-area home April 14, and carried him out in his wheelchair to a waiting van. He was held for a few hours and then returned to his residence after a federal appeals court ruled temporarily in his favor. Demjanjuk had appealed unsuccessfully to the Supreme Court last year. He was once accused by the United States and Israel of being a notoriously brutal S.S. guard at the Treblinka camp known as ""Ivan the Terrible."" After appeals, that allegation was eventually dropped by both countries, but later other allegations were made against him.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed an executive order Monday repealing a Bush-era policy that limited federal tax dollars for embryonic stem cell research. President Obama signs the executive order on stem cell policy Monday at the White House. Obama's move overturns an order signed by President Bush in 2001 that barred the National Institutes of Health from funding research on embryonic stem cells beyond using 60 cell lines that existed at that time. Obama also signed a presidential memorandum establishing greater independence for federal science policies and programs. ""In recent years, when it comes to stem cell research, rather than furthering discovery, our government has forced what I believe is a false choice between sound science and moral values,"" Obama said at the White House. ""In this case, I believe the two are not inconsistent. As a person of faith, I believe we are called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering. I believe we have been given the capacity and will to pursue this research -- and the humanity and conscience to do so responsibly.""  Watch as Obama announces he's lifting the funding ban » . The president pledged to develop ""strict guidelines"" to ensure that such research ""never opens the door to the use of cloning for human reproduction."" Such a possibility, he maintained, is ""dangerous, profoundly wrong and has no place in our society or any society."" Obama's order directs the NIH to develop revised guidelines on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research within 120 days, according to Dr. Harold Varmus, president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and co-chairman of Obama's science advisory council. ""The president is, in effect, allowing federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research to the extent that it's permitted by law -- that is, work with stem cells themselves, not the derivation of stem cells,"" Varmus said in a conference call with reporters Sunday. While conceding that ""the full promise of stem cell research remains unknown"" and ""should not be overstated,"" Obama nevertheless expressed hope that the order will help spur faster progress in the search for cures to afflictions such as Parkinson's disease, cancer and spinal cord injuries.  See a map of nations that have taken a lead in using human embryos in stem cell research » . Researchers highly value embryonic stem cells because of their potential to turn into any organ or tissue cell in the body. Stem cells have this ability for a short time. A few days before the embryo would implant in the uterus, it starts to develop into specific cells that will turn into skin or eyes or other parts of a developing fetus.  Watch a doctor explain why embryotic stem cells are so important » . When the embryo is 4 or 5 days old, scientists extract the stem cells and put them in a petri dish. With the removal of these stem cells -- of which there may be about 30 -- the embryo is destroyed. Twenty-one of the 60 stem cell lines authorized for research under the Bush policy have proven useful to researchers. Bush twice vetoed legislation -- in July 2006 and June 2007 -- that would have expanded federally funded embryonic stem cell research. At the time, Bush maintained that scientific advances allowed researchers to conduct groundbreaking research without destroying human embryos. Conservative leaders echoed Bush's rationale in their criticism of Obama's decision. ""Advancements in science and research have moved faster than the debates among politicians in Washington, D.C., and breakthroughs announced in recent years confirm the full potential of stem cell research can be realized without the destruction of living human embryos,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Sunday. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, said the Bush policy imposed proper ethical limits on science. ""My basic tenet here is I don't think we should create life to enhance life and to do research and so forth,"" Shelby said Sunday. ""I know that people argue there are other ways. I think we should continue our biomedical research everywhere we can, but we should have some ethics about it."" The issue of whether to lift the ban on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research has, however, exposed a clear rift between the more moderate and conservative factions of the GOP. In February, a group of six moderate GOP congressmen sent a letter to Obama urging him to lift the funding ban. Former first lady Nancy Reagan also issued a statement Monday thanking Obama for lifting the ban. ""These new rules will now make it possible for scientists to move forward,"" Reagan said. ""Countless people, suffering from many different diseases, stand to benefit from the answers stem cell research can provide. We owe it to ourselves and to our children to do everything in our power to find cures for these diseases."" President Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after leaving office -- an affliction that many scientists say eventually may be cured with the help of embryonic stem cell research. Obama's presidential memorandum, however, may turn out to have a broader impact than his executive order. The memorandum is expected to create a clear change of tone from the Bush administration on a broad range of scientific issues. Bush's critics argued the former president allowed political factors improperly to influence funding decisions for science initiatives as well as to skew official government findings on issues such as global warming.  Watch a GOP congressman say Obama is 'behind the times' » . Obama's memorandum directs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy ""to develop a strategy for restoring scientific integrity to government decision-making."" In a thinly veiled criticism of his predecessor, Obama reiterated a promise to base ""public policies on the soundest science"" as well as to ""appoint scientific advisers based on their credentials and experience, not their politics or ideology.""","NEW: Former first lady Nancy Reagan thanks President Obama for lifting funding ban .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda ended days of speculation Sunday by confirming that one of its chemical weapons experts was killed last week along with three other ""heroes,"" according to a statement posted on a radical Islamist Web site. Midhat Mursi al-Sayid Umar was among four ""heroes"" killed last week, an al Qaeda statement says. The statement, dated July 30, provided no details on how or when the al Qaeda operatives were killed. It was signed by al Qaeda's top leader in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid. A senior Pakistani official said last week it was a ""near certainty"" that weapons expert Midhat Mursi al-Sayid Umar died in a U.S. airstrike Monday in Pakistan's tribal region. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said that if reports of the strike were true, the U.S. violated Pakistani sovereignty. Umar, who is also known as Sheikh Abu Khabab al-Masri, was on the U.S. State Department's list of 37 wanted terrorists, and the U.S. had offered $5 million for information leading to his death or arrest. ""Although Abu Khabab is gone, he left behind him a generation who will seek revenge and punishment with God's help,"" the al Qaeda statement said. ""And while the 'expert' is gone, he left behind experts who were taught and trained under his hands throughout the years."" Umar was killed along with Abu Mohammed Ibrahim Bin Abi al-Faraj al-Masri, Abd al-Wahab al-Masri, and Abu Islam al-Masri, the statement said. Umar, a 55-year-old Egyptian, ran a chemical-and-explosives training camp for terrorists in Derunta, Afghanistan, before the fall of the Taliban, U.S. officials said. ""Since 1999, he has distributed training manuals that contain instructions for making chemical and biological weapons,"" according to the U.S. Rewards for Justice program. ""Some of these training manuals were recovered by U.S. forces in Afghanistan."" Rewards for Justice said Umar was believed to be in Pakistan, continuing to train al Qaeda terrorists and other extremists. He was reportedly near the site of a U.S. airstrike more than two years ago in the Pakistani mountain village of Damadola. The strike targeted a dinner gathering believed to include terrorists. Initial reports that Umar died in the January 2006 strike later proved erroneous.","Statement provides few details, is signed by al Qaeda leader in Afghanistan .

"LONDON, England (UK) -- Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown has apologized on behalf of parliamentarians of all parties for a series of revelations about their expenses claims, revelations which have seriously damaged the authority of government and parliament. UK PM Gordon Brown, pictured here in north-east England Monday, apologized Monday on behalf of all lawmakers. Brown's words have been echoed by David Cameron, the leader of the opposition Conservatives and currently the favorite to win the next general election by a large margin. Cameron acknowledges all MPs must say sorry and that the whole system must be changed. The scandal has come to light because The Daily Telegraph newspaper obtained copies of all the receipts for MPs expenses, which were due to be published in two months time under Freedom of Information legislation. The newspaper has been devoting several pages every day to the details of how the system has been milked, with MPs claiming that expenditure on bath plugs and lawn mowers, silk cushions and television sets, potted plants and dog food, was ""wholly and necessarily incurred for the purpose of performing their parliamentary duties."" Do you think politicians in your country are paid enough? In Britain, as in many other countries, parliamentarians are compensated for the expense of living both in the parts of the country they represent and in the capital where parliament meets. There is help too with travel costs and staffing their offices. But the so-called ""additional costs allowance,"" designed to help them with the additional costs of a second home has, by common consent, been particularly abused. This is not an ""expenses scandal"" about a couple of notepads and pens taken home from the office stationery cupboard for the kids' school project; or the annual phone call to an aged aunt in Australia, made on an office line rather than from home -- although doubtless politicians will have been doing that too.  Watch more on the expenses row » . We are talking about the deliberate exploitation of a poorly-policed system by a large number of parliamentarians, who appear to many of their constituents to have come close to enriching themselves corruptly at public expense. There is particular horror at the practice which has emerged of so-called ""flipping."" MPs have, in a number of cases, designated one residence as their second home for the purpose of the allowance. Having drawn heavily on public funds for redecorating, refurbishing and refurnishing it, they have then switched and named a different house or flat -- only to do the same with that. In some cases they have sold these properties on for a significant profit. I spent more than 30 years at Westminster as a political correspondent. Much of my time off duty was spent explaining to skeptical neighbors, barbers and taxi drivers that MPs did a much better job than outsiders thought. I knew and respected MPs whom I saw imperil their health or their marriages or their bank balances by working extremely hard on behalf of their constituents. I argued constantly that we underpaid our politicians. Now, when I hear them call each other ""honorable members"" I am constantly reminded of Ralph Waldo Emerson's dictum: ""The louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted the spoons."" The truth is that the good ones are still underpaid. They could earn far more outside the House of Commons. But the poor ones are overpaid -- and sadly there is no way of differentiating between the two categories. It was never the right time, certainly in the eyes of the media, for MPs to have a decent pay rise; and they never had the guts to stand up and argue their case. So parliamentarians instead built themselves, while nobody was watching, a generous and poorly policed expenses system which allowed them to make up the difference between what they got and what they thought they should be paid. What they seem unable to grasp, even now, is that in picking taxpayers' pockets by subterfuge they have all but destroyed parliament's moral authority. Cynically, they have led us all into a ""help yourself to what you can get"" mockery of public service which may take a generation or more to repair, if indeed it can be repaired. And remember that they did their damnedest along the way to make sure that we, the public, should not find out what they were doing. Led by the Speaker of the House, the man who presides over debates and should be the beacon of Commons probity (and who along with his wife has claimed £4,000 - about $6,000 - on taxis for shopping trips), the Commons Commission spent £150,000 (approx. $225,000) of public funds going to the High Court to try to prevent public disclosure of how MPs have been spending taxpayers' money. A horrified public, combing through the details of the Telegraph's revelations, is asking how MPs could ever have justified their ""flipping."" At a time of economic stringency for others, they are asking why MPs, who benefit any way from subsidized canteens, should be allowed to charge £400 (approx. $600) a month for their food on top of their salary. How can it be part of the necessary expenses in carrying out MPs' duties, they ask, to charge for children's buggies and the eradication of moles from their country lawns? Just how many have been paying inflated ""rents"" to close relatives; or claiming the ""additional costs allowance"" for second homes they do not actually inhabit on more than token occasions? Why should it be legal for ministers who live in ""grace and favor"" apartments (where they are allowed to live for free) to claim additional costs allowances for properties they are meanwhile renting out? The MPs are meeting all these complaints by saying that nothing they have done was outside the rules. But these were rules that they themselves set up as the nation's legislators. And only now are they beginning to realize the wider damage that they have done . By creating the expenses system they did, which is only now becoming transparent, they insulated themselves from the problems faced by ordinary people. British MPs expenses, unlike those of the rest of the population, are not taxable. They have also, as the cannier ones now admit, destroyed any moral authority they might have had in criticizing and curbing the greed of bankers and others who have brought us to near ruin and wrecked the pensions of half the nation. (The pensions of MPs are provided at the taxpayers' expense -- with inflation proofing, of course.) With the expenses binge having infected all the mainstream parties, there is another potential ramification too, which is likely to show up in next month's elections for the European Parliament. Traditionally British electors, without the election of their national government at issue, tend to treat these as an opportunity for a protest vote, to punish politicians who have incurred their wrath. As a result we may see significant advance for the parties of the far right, the United Kingdom Independence Party and the British National Party. The expenses excesses of many of the 646 Westminster parliamentary MPs could give those groups a new legitimacy -- and their biggest advance yet.","UK lawmakers have been accused of over-milking the system for claiming expenses .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 33 people were killed and 20 wounded in a suicide car bombing targeting a national reconciliation conference in Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official told CNN. Abu Ghraib attack victim in Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad, Amjad Hameed . The attack -- which occurred outside the municipal building of Abu Ghraib in western Baghdad -- also wounded 46 others, the official said. The attacker was targeting the latest effort by the government to foster national reconciliation between religious and ethnic groups. Sunni Arab and Shiite tribal leaders were attending the meeting, backed by the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. Another Interior Ministry official told CNN the attack occurred when people gathered outside as the conference in the building ended. Al-Baghdadiya TV said two of its journalists were killed in the explosion. An Iraqi journalists' group confirmed those deaths and said a number of journalists were also wounded. Along with meeting attendees and journalists, Iraqi soldiers were among the casualties. No one has claimed responsibility for the strike, but in the past, such gatherings have been targeted by al Qaeda in Iraq, the anti-American Sunni Arab militant group. Staffan de Mistura, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for Iraq, deplored the attack and passed along condolences to grieving families. He said the bombing targeted the tribal leaders after their meeting, and called the strike a ""horrible crime that is designed to sabotage reconciliatory efforts by the Iraqi people, who, I am confident, will continue on the road of dialogue."" The blast follows another huge attack on Sunday, when a man wearing an explosives-laden vest drove a motorcycle rigged with bombs into a group of police recruits in eastern Baghdad. That attack killed 30 people and wounded 61 others. Most of the victims of Sunday's strike were police officers and recruits who had gathered outside a police academy on Palestine Street. The same academy was targeted on December 1 in a double bombing that killed 16 and wounded 46. The violence came after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Saturday rallied sheikhs of the nation's tribes to participate in Iraq's government. It was the latest official effort to further reconciliation among Sunnis, Shiites and tribes of different sects and bring some former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath party into the political fold. After the invasion, the U.S.-led coalition decided to purge Iraqi institutions of Baathists, most of whom were Sunni Arabs. Al-Maliki, who is Shiite, has been criticized in the past by minority groups for not fairly representing Iraqi's ethnic groups. CNN's Yousif Bassil and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","33 killed in suicide bombing at reconciliation conference in Baghdad .

"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida (CNN) -- With space shuttle Atlantis on its way to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope, that leaves one shuttle, Endeavour, at the ready on the other launch pad here. Space shuttle Endeavour, in background, sits poised to launch in case Atlantis, in foreground, meets trouble. And that's where everybody at NASA wants it to stay. ""We have high confidence that we're just having that thing over on pad B to make it look nice,"" said mission flight director Tony Ceccaci. Endeavour is far more than a postcard picture -- it's on standby in case something goes seriously wrong with the Atlantis mission. For example, NASA has estimated there's a 1-in-221 chance the shuttle could be struck and crippled by orbiting space debris. If such an incident were to thrust the seven Atlantis astronauts into danger, Endeavour would blast off within days in a last-ditch attempt to save them. Endeavour Cmdr. Christopher Ferguson believes his crew is up to the task. ""I feel as confident about our ability to pull this off, if need be, as I would any other mission,"" he said. The idea of a standby rescue spacecraft grew out of the 2003 Columbia disaster, in which that shuttle disintegrated over Texas during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. But until now, there's been no need. All the previous missions since Columbia have gone to the International Space Station. The crew of a damaged shuttle could take refuge there for months if need be until another shuttle was readied to retrieve them. But Atlantis is going to Hubble, whose orbit isn't anywhere near the space station. If their spacecraft malfunctioned, the seven-member Atlantis crew would have to survive aboard -- probably for days -- until they could be rescued. ""In this case it's a much shorter fuse,"" Ferguson said. ""Consumables like food and oxygen would run out quickly. So the reason we've gotten this crew trained and spooled up and ready to go on literally a moment's notice is because they [Atlantis's crew] have no place comfortable to go stay for a long period of time."" But the rescue would be no cakewalk. Endeavour would need to pull up underneath Atlantis and hook on to the other shuttle using its robotic arm. Over the course of two days, the seven Atlantis astronauts would spacewalk over to Endeavour by holding on to a tether line strung between the two spaceships. Atlantis mission specialist John Grunsfeld would go first -- and, actually, twice. Grunsfeld would spacewalk to Endeavour, grab an extra EMU (extravehicular mobility unit) spacesuit and take it back to Atlantis. He would then return to Endeavour with one of the Atlantis astronauts not trained in spacewalking. With the Atlantis crew safely aboard, Endeavour would pull away and begin preparing to head home. Atlantis Cmdr. Scott Altman said that knowing Ferguson and the other three members of the Endeavour crew are ready in case of an emergency gives him peace of mind. ""Even in the worst-possible imaginable case, we can stay up there and last until somebody comes up and gets us,"" Altman said. ""So it feels like we have all our bases covered."" So what would happen to Atlantis? Ferguson said mission leaders would prepare the crippled shuttle for what they call a ""disposal burn"" -- a safe, remotely controlled landing of Atlantis. ""If it comes to it, we certainly don't want a space shuttle coming in over a populated area,"" he said. ""So we want to control the burn so it does end up in the ocean."" In all, eleven astronauts would be stuffed into Endeavour. A space shuttle has never carried that many. The four Endeavour crew members would hang out in the flight deck, while the seven Atlantis astronauts would squeeze into the mid-deck area. The journey back to Earth would be uncomfortable. But Ceccaci, the flight director, says that wouldn't matter as long as everyone was safe. ""Wrap me in bubble wrap and get me home safely, I wouldn't care,"" he said. ""I wouldn't care how cramped it is.""","The shuttle Endeavour and its crew are standing by in case of a emergency in space .

"Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose book ""When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams"" will be published in a new paperback edition this week. Bob Greene says he and his family didn't expect to be able to enjoy this Mother's Day. (CNN) -- This is the Mother's Day we thought was going to be empty. Last summer, my brother, my sister and I got the news like a sucker-punch to the stomach: Our mother's health, which had not been good for some time, had taken a sudden turn for the worse. A very compassionate hospice evaluator came to her home and said that, although one could never be absolutely certain, the end was quite near. ""It may be two days. It may be two weeks."" Those were the words. We tried to process them. She would be gone from us by the fall. Except ... ""Debby just picked me up a book from the library, and I'm a few chapters into it,"" my mother said to me on the phone the other day. She got better. ""Better"" does not mean great; she walks with some difficulty now, she is fragile in ways she once was strong, but on this Mother's Day that we all expected to be such a desolate one for us, she's here. On that morning the woman from hospice first came to visit, our mother was in her bed in the same room where our father, 10 years ago, had slowly died. Toward the end, he had not been able to get out of his bed, and we foresaw the same awful drama unfolding in the same way in the same bedroom. It was going to be even more wrenching to witness this time around. But somehow, from somewhere inside herself, she decided: ""Not yet."" I don't say that glibly; I know that most men and women, in the months of their dying, do not have a choice about whether they will regain a semblance of their health. There comes a point when there is little to do but give in as gracefully as possible. Our mother didn't. And while my brother and sister and I cherish the extra time we have been given with her, the most moving thing is to quietly behold how fiercely she is cherishing the extra time she has been given with the world -- the extra time she has been given with life itself. That book from the library my sister brought her, it is one of many she has read since last summer. It's as if she realized that, if the prediction had been right -- if she had left us within two days or two weeks -- she never would have known the pleasure of reading another book. She has loved reading all her life; now she is reading new books with a sense of gratitude that we can literally feel. She got to watch one more presidential campaign. She has always taken her responsibility as a citizen with utter seriousness. She thought, last summer, that she would never know who the next president would be. But as, little by little, she got better during the fall, I can guarantee you that not even Wolf Blitzer or John King followed the day-to-day fluctuations of the campaign with more devotion than she did. She used to joke with our father that their trips together to the polling place were ultimately a waste of time: He was on one end of the political spectrum, she was on the other, and, as she put it, ""Our votes always canceled each other's out."" She was born during the Woodrow Wilson administration -- and in November, against all odds, she got to cast a ballot for president one more time. Whenever my brother flies to central Ohio to visit her, he goes not straight from the airport to her house; he makes a stop. He picks up some pizzas at Rubino's on East Main Street in Bexley, and he has them in his hands as he walks through her front door. She hasn't tasted her last Rubino's pizza, not yet -- she thought she had, and each slice is a reminder of the good things that life still holds for her. She enjoys the television series ""Brothers and Sisters""; each Sunday evening, as she tells us that she is preparing to watch it, we know that it is seemingly small things like that, things that once felt mundane to her -- an hour with a favorite program -- that she relishes anew. Over the holidays, I bought her the complete DVD series of ""The Sopranos."" She is an admirer of great acting, and she was enthralled by the talent of James Gandolfini during the original run of the show; she has watched the entire arc of ""The Sopranos"" again, from the first episode to the last, and she did it in a hurry. You never know how much time you are given. It might not be the worst way for any of us to live, even those of us who are much younger than she is; it might not be a bad idea for us to live as if someone has told us, ""It may be two days. It may be two weeks."" Imagining those words is a pretty good reminder that we should savor every hour we are given. My brother, my sister and I don't fool ourselves; just as warm days in March are sometimes followed by snow and ice, we realize that our mother's return to vibrancy may turn out to be a false spring. Yet even if it is a brief illusion, it is a springtime that brings tears of thanks to our eyes. In October, she will turn 90, if she, and we, are lucky. But that's the wrong way to put it. If we are lucky? We are. This is the Mother's Day we didn't think we'd have. And I think she knows exactly what is in our hearts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: This Mother's Day is one my family didn't expect to enjoy .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A U.S. soldier fired on his fellow troops at a counseling center at a base outside Baghdad, Iraq, on Monday, U.S. officials said, killing five people in the worst such attack of the six-year-old Iraq war. U.S. Army troops get a safety briefing before departing Camp Liberty, Iraq, in December 2008. The shooting occurred at 2 p.m. at a stress clinic at Camp Liberty, near Baghdad International Airport, two senior defense officials said. Though initial reports indicated the attacker was killed in the incident, the U.S. command in Baghdad said late Monday a suspect in the killings was in custody. Neither the suspect nor any of the victims had been identified, but a defense official with access to the latest reports on the incident told CNN that the suspect had been a patient at the treatment center. ""Any time we lose one of our own, it affects us all,"" Col. John Robinson, a U.S. military spokesman, said in a written statement. President Obama said that he was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the ""horrible tragedy."" ""My heart goes out to the families and friends of all the service members involved,"" he said in a written statement. ""I will press to ensure that we fully understand what led to this tragedy, and that we are doing everything we can to ensure that our men and women in uniform are protected."" The president said he discussed the issue in a meeting with Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Monday afternoon. And Gates expressed his own ""horror and deep regret"" at a press briefing.  Watch the defense secretary talk about the incident » . ""If the preliminary reports are confirmed, such a tragic loss of life at the hands of our own forces is a cause for great and urgent concern,"" Gates said. ""And I can assure you that it will get this department's highest priority attention."" Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added the incident shows a need to ""redouble"" efforts regarding troop stress levels. Camp Liberty is tightly guarded, and U.S. troops are required to clear their weapons of ammunition while on the base. The only service members who have loaded weapons are those guarding high-ranking officers and military police. Monday's attack marks the sixth incident in which a service member was killed by a fellow service member since the launch of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. Camp Liberty is part of the Camp Victory Complex, one of the largest U.S. military bases in Iraq. It lies just northeast of Baghdad International Airport and is also near the massive al-Faw palace of executed former dictator Saddam Hussein. Once known as Camp Victory North, the base was renamed Camp Liberty in September 2004, or Camp Al-Tahreer in Arabic, according to GlobalSecurity.org, a Web site that provides background on military and security issues. Like other American facilities in Iraq, Camp Liberty provides a host of amenities for the thousands of U.S. troops who call it home during their combat tours. The base resembles a giant trailer park, dotted with air-conditioned two- or three-person units that house thousands of service members. It boasts several dining facilities catered by a private company, fully equipped gymnasiums, recreation centers and a post exchange that rivals Wal-Mart. In recent years, a number of fast food restaurants such as Burger King and Pizza Hut have opened, as well as private stores and a bazaar that sells local wares. The military set up several chapels, and each unit operates stress-relief clinics -- such as the one at which the shootings occurred Monday -- where troops can request counseling. CNN's Cal Perry, Chris Lawrence and Mike Mount contributed to this report.","Defense official: Suspect had been a patient at the treatment center .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Iran has condemned the kidnapping of one of its diplomats in northwest Pakistan on Thursday, calling it an ""act of terrorism,"" an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said. Pakistani policemen inspect a bullet-riddled car of a kidnapped Iranian diplomat on Thursday. ""Pakistan should do its best to protect foreign diplomats and their residential places,"" the spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency. At least four gunmen abducted Heshmatollah Attarzadeh near his home in Peshawar as he headed to work at the Iranian consulate, according to Pakistani police and Iranian diplomatic officials. His bodyguard, a Pakistani police officer, was shot and killed when the two men tried to resist, a Peshawar police official said. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also ""strongly condemned"" the attack, and informed Iran that the government ""will take all necessary measures for his safe and early recovery."" Attarzadeh is a commercial attache for the Iranian consulate in Peshawar. It is the second attack targeting a foreign worker in Peshawar in two days. An American aid worker was shot and killed outside the Iranian consulate in Peshawar on Wednesday. Stephen Vance worked for a non-profit foundation funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development that helped find jobs for people in Pakistan's tribal regions, according to a statement from his employer, the Cooperative Housing Foundation International. ""Stephen had fully immersed himself in the community in which he worked,"" the statement said. ""He dressed traditionally and even sent his children to local schools."" Vance, 52, a native of California, is survived by his wife and five children -- all of whom lived with him in Peshawar -- CHF International official Bill Holbrook told CNN. The attacks come less than three months after gunmen opened fire on a vehicle carrying the senior U.S. diplomat in Peshawar, Lynne Tracy. She escaped unharmed. Peshawar is the capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, an area rife with Islamic extremists and the site of recent clashes between security forces and militants. In late June, Pakistan's military launched an offensive in the province -- the biggest push against extremists in the tribal region since the civilian government took power in March. Islamic militants vowed to retaliate. Since then, militants have launched several deadly attacks. Pakistan's new government has tried to negotiate a deal with militants as part of its efforts to bypass military might and achieve peace through talks.","Diplomat was kidnapped and his bodyguard killed in Peshawar, northwest Pakistan .

"GARUT, Indonesia (CNN) -- The people of Indonesia's Java Island still follow wedding traditions passed down centuries ago by their ancestors. Cucu and his bride, Yati Supriyatna, plant two saplings during their wedding ceremony. Family members gather for an all-day ceremony that begins with the groom bringing a gift to the bride's house. On a hot and sticky morning in a village near Garut, 26-year-old Cucu carries a sapling to give to his bride. The young tree is not exactly a unique gift; it's part of a government initiative to bring back the Garut province's devastated forests. Newly married couples must plant 10 trees under the program. If they divorce, they must plant 50 others. Cucu and his bride, Yati Supriyatna -- both dressed in all white -- headed to a mosque in the foothills of West Java's mountains, where they carefully planted two saplings, a symbolic gesture. The young couple met in school three years ago and began dating last year.  Watch as Indonesia tackles deforestation » . ""We're just meant to be,"" said 18-year-old Yati, giggling in her white flower-adorned veil. They will plant the other saplings -- eucalyptus, avocado and mahogany -- at the sleepy village about an hour outside Garut where they plan to settle, for now. Indonesia's landscape has been devastated by massive deforestation. Though not a heavily industrialized nation, Indonesia is behind China and the United States as the world's third largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions. That is largely the result of the removal of its trees, which cut down the absorption of carbon dioxide. While Garut province is not the country's worst offender, a Garut forestry official said he can no longer ignore the damage. ""Most people here work in agriculture which is of course highly dependent on the fertility of the soil,"" said Eddy Muharam of Garut's forestry department. ""The fertility is decreasing now because of deforestation and intensive use of soil."" Forestry officials have identified ""critical land"" in Garut, which has been overfarmed and needs to be reforested. The overfarming leads to erosion, which can cause major flooding. Environmental officials estimate that 50 million trees are needed in Garut alone to reverse the harm done by overfarming. Indonesia's government does not have the funds to pay for such an initiative. So they hope the trend of planting saplings will catch on among other newlyweds in Indonesia. ""It's sacred and a once in a lifetime moment, so we thought that it would be a good time to encourage people's participation,"" Muharam said. CNN's Andy Saputra contributed to this report.","Newlyweds in Indonesia plant trees under program to replenish forests .

"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida (CNN) -- So, what's harder, steering a space shuttle or out-machoing Tom Cruise on the set of ""Top Gun""? Scott Altman is commander of the current space shuttle mission to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. Scott Altman laughs when he answers the question. ""Flying a space shuttle is a little more challenging than what we did in the movie, although the flying was a lot of fun,"" said Altman, who knows more than a little about both. The retired Navy F-14 fighter pilot is the commander of the current space shuttle Atlantis mission to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. He also doubled for the actors, including Cruise, during the Southern California shoot of the 1986 hit movie. Then a young pilot, Altman had just gotten back from a 7½-month tour onboard an aircraft carrier when he got the ""Top Gun"" call from his commanding officer. ""The skipper of our squadron picked four guys he thought he could trust to have this kind of carte blanche to break the rules a little bit,"" Altman said. That included a scene in which a brazen Navy pilot buzzes the base's control tower. That would never happen in real life, Altman said. The movie features Cruise as a young naval aviator, Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, selected to attend fighter-pilot training school at the then-Miramar Naval Station north of San Diego. To prepare for the film, Cruise flew in the backseat of an F-14 several times, including once with Altman. ""The actors were all pretty easy to get along with. Tom Cruise, for example, was very motivated,"" recalled Altman, who is making his fourth trip into space this week. ""He enjoyed flying. He listened to what we told him and became a pilot himself after that."" Altman is not one to brag about his flying in ""Top Gun."" The U.S. space agency, NASA, doesn't mention his film heroics, either. But Altman is in one of the movie's most memorable scenes. While flying upside down, inverted, Altman gives an obscene gesture to the pilot of an enemy plane. ""They said go ahead and gesture at the other airplane,"" said Altman, 49, with a smile. ""So when you're looking at the scene where he's communicating with the Russian, or the bad-guy pilots in the movie, that would be my finger."" But the flying scenes with the actors didn't all work out as director Tony Scott had hoped. ""The director had to pay $7,600 an hour to rent an airplane,"" Altman recalled. ""But after a week of spending that much money on the airplanes, he decided he couldn't use the footage. The actors all looked a little green, he said."" Altman and the other pilots earned $23 a day for their trouble. But his biggest disappointment was not getting to see the film as soon as it was released. He and the other pilots were invited to a preview screening, but a commanding officer would not let them go. And by the time the movie hit theaters, Altman was busy. He was overseas, on another seven-month tour of duty.","Ex-fighter pilot Scott Altman is commander of space shuttle Atlantis mission .

Thank you for joining us. We're gonna start things off with a quick check of some headlines. First Up:  Headlines . AZUZ: Fierce battles are still raging in northwestern Pakistan, where the country's military is waging an assault against Taliban forces. Officials say as many as 200 members of the militant group were killed in a single day over the weekend. CNN can't confirm that information, because journalists aren't allowed in the region. The United Nations is concerned about this impact on civilians. Hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis are leaving the area to try and get away from the violence. And in California, firefighters are getting some help from the weather as they battle that blaze in Santa Barbara. Authorities say low winds and increased humidity are helping to keep the flames under control. The fire, which had destroyed or damaged about 80 homes, was at least 55 percent contained by Sunday. Russia Victory Day . AZUZ: And Russia is celebrating the end of World War II with its 64th annual Victory Day. The occasion, which took place on Saturday, marks the date in 1945 when Nazi Germany officially surrendered to the former USSR, which Russia was part of at the time. As Matthew Chance shows us, the weekend ceremony gave Russia an opportunity to show off its military might. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is the biggest show of force in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Columns of tanks and missile launchers thundered over the cobblestones of Red Square in the center of Moscow for these Victory Day celebrations, marking the defeat of Nazi Germany but also reflecting the Kremlin's efforts to revive Russia's armed forces and global power. Well, opening the parade, Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev told spectators that Russia's military is ready to respond to any aggression, and he referred obliquely to the country's brief war with the neighboring former Soviet republic of Georgia last year. DMITRY MEDVEDEV, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (TRANSLATED): Now more than ever, it is clear a safe world is possible only where international law is strictly abided by. And that is why our country has initiated a new treaty on European security. Security based on safe arms control and reasonable sufficiency of military construction for the broadest cooperation of states and the exclusively peaceful settlement of conflicts. And we will firmly pursue the execution of these principles. CHANCE: About 9,000 troops took part in a display of military equipment which, for the first time, included state-of-the-art S400 air defense missiles, which the United States and others is concerned may be sold to Iran. Russia also rolled out its new Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles, a stock reminder that this fast country remains a formidable nuclear power. Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow. (END VIDEO CLIP) ID Me . ERIK NIVISON, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I first appeared in the United States in the late 1600s. I'm a printed item that's usually published daily or weekly. I've been a major source of news for millions of people around the world.  I'm the newspaper, the answer to that old joke, ""What's black and white and read all over?"" Charging for Content? AZUZ: Except newspapers aren't being read as much these days. In fact, at least 120 of them have closed in the U.S. since January of 2008. One reason: Readers are getting their news for free online at sites like CNN.com. But a major media tycoon who just happens to own some newspapers, says the days of free, online content could be coming to an end. Jim Boulden covers the unfolding issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIM BOULDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Rupert Murdoch has floated the idea that some of his general newspapers, like the New York Post, the London Times or The Sun, could follow the model of his Wall St. Journal and charge readers for online content. But with content free for so long, will people pay? WOMAN ON THE STREET #1: No, probably not. You can find almost all the same information somewhere. WOMAN ON THE STREET #2: No. I would look somewhere else. BOULDEN: Though Mr. Murdoch will be happy to hear this man would pay for his London Times online. MAN ON THE STREET #1: Just because it's quicker and easier to get it online when you are at home. BOULDEN: Still, some don't even bother to view the free stuff. WOMAN ON THE STREET #3: Newspaper. MAN ON THE STREET #2: Actual physical newspapers. BOULDEN: Many news sites, like the New York Times, ask users to register for free. That information can tell potential advertisers who uses the site and for how long. The New York Times.com does charge those who don't get the physical paper for a little bit of premium content. Others, like Reuters, hold back a lot. TOM GLOCER, CEO, THOMSON REUTERS: The high grade, the high octane stuff we really reserve for our professional customers. So, they've always paid on a subscription basis and we never make that content free, because it's vital for people to their jobs. BOULDEN: The Financial Times also charges for anyone wanting to go beyond the basics. It currently has 110,000 paid subscribers. Managing director Rob Grimshaw wants to enhance its charging model. ROB GRIMSHAW, FT.COM: I am very, very interested in exploring some of the possibilities around micro payments, either for individual articles or for access to the site for a shorter period of time. And I think we ought to have a pricing model which actually suits how each individual user wants to access the site. BOULDEN: The FT points out that it can count on subscriptions and focus on increasing those with advertising eroding, something sites that don't charge can't fall back on. That is why Murdoch's News Corp. empire is keen to see if people will pay to play. (END VIDEO CLIP) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! When did the Hubble Space Telescope send its first pictures back to Earth? Was it in: A) 1980, B) 1985, C) 1990 or D) 1995? You've got three seconds -- GO! Hubble has been taking pictures since 1990, although initial problems caused its first images to be fuzzy. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Final Visit . AZUZ: Despite some early setbacks, the Hubble Telescope has revolutionized the field of astronomy. Earth's atmosphere, look up and you'll see it, makes it difficult for astronomers on the ground to get a complete view of things in outer space. But from its orbit outside the atmosphere, Hubble has a perfect spot. NASA is getting ready to upgrade the telescope. John Zarrella explains how they plan to do it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: For nearly twenty years, the Hubble Space Telescope has been sending back breathtaking images of galaxies and stars and planets. It has transformed how astronomers and cosmologists view the universe and our place in it. JOHN GRUNSFELD, SHUTTLE ATLANTIS MISSION SPECIALIST: Where do planetary systems, where do stars come from? Hubble has been a tool to answer these fundamental questions that get right at the heart of who we are. ZARRELLA: Now, a team of astronauts will make the fifth and final visit to repair and upgrade Hubble. The objective: extend the telescope's life at least another five years. It won't be easy. The pressure on the shuttle Atlantis crew, immense. SCOTT ALTMAN, SHUTTLE ATLANTIS COMMANDER: We know there's nobody coming after us to do anything we don't get done. This is it. We either get it done or it doesn't happen. ZARRELLA: 350 miles up, Atlantis will chase down and grab hold of the telescope. For five consecutive days during five seven-hour spacewalks, astronauts will perform the ultimate high-wire act. They'll change out gyroscopes and batteries, repair and replace cameras. They'll change circuit boards, remove dozens of screws and delicately cut through aluminum. GRUNSFELD: It's almost as if I'm not doing it. It's kind of a Zen thing, and once we finish the task and I climb back out of the telescope, I'll look around and go, ""Wow, we're in space."" ZARRELLA: Hubble has been such an incredible watershed of knowledge, the dark days right after its launch in 1990 have largely been forgotten. JEFFREY HOFFMAN, RETIRED SHUTTLE ASTRONAUT: There was a time when Hubble was a laughing stock. You know, the ""techno turkey."" You know, pictures in editorial cartoons, denounced on the floors of Congress, ridiculed in late night television programs.

"(CNN) -- For the first 45 of her 50 years of living, Bonnie Neighbour used to wake up feeling sorry to be alive. Bonnie Neighbour has struggled with mental health issues for almost all of her 50 years. ""Even when I wasn't actually depressed, I would open my eyes in the morning and wonder if there wasn't something else; I would have preferred an alternative to being alive,"" she says. She recalls being depressed as a young child. In her late teens, she started having mood problems that eventually escalated into clinical depression. ""At some point, I was suicidal. I would suffer cycles of depression and mania,"" Neighbour said. ""I wouldn't sleep for days, and the less sleep I would get, the more revved up I'd become, and then I would make irrational decisions and act out. Then I'd alternate with serious depressive episodes. ""At one time, for nine months, I wasn't even able to leave the house [because of depression]."" At age 30, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Neighbour's story isn't uncommon. ""Action Steps for Improving Women's Mental Health,"" a new report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office on Women's Health (OWH), explores the role gender plays in the diagnosis, course and treatment of mental illness. It calls for specific actions to counteract the inadequacies in this field. According to the report, women are nearly twice as likely as men to suffer from major depression. They are three times as likely to attempt suicide, and they experience anxiety disorders two to three times more often than men.  Chart: Gender and mental health » . While these statistics are not new, their importance is generally underplayed, says Wanda Jones, Dr.P.H., health scientist and director of the OWH. She notes that whereas past reports have focused on bringing mental health to the forefront of concern -- such as the 1999 publication ""Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General"" -- few have focused primarily on the specific mental illness issues specific to women, hence the need for such a publication. Among the actions recommended by the new report are the needs to underscore the essential importance of women's mental health to overall well-being, improve how primary care doctors and mental health professionals interface with each other, develop a greater understanding in the role of gender in mental illness,  recognize the role of trauma and violence against women and its subsequent impact on mental illness and address cultural biases that serve as barriers to treatment for many women. Reasons for the gender disparities in mental health are still unclear, according to Jones. Part of the difference is based on biology. Female hormones, thyroid disease and brain biochemistry have all been cited as possible reasons. Genetics also play a part, as family history has proven that mental illness repeats itself across multiple generations. Socio-cultural reasons also contribute to the difference. Jones stresses that the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to diagnosing and treating mental illness is not an effective approach and that acknowledging the gender differential is key to adequately and appropriately treating women. The new report also underscores the relative young age at which mental illness often sets in for both males and females. Half of all mental illnesses occur before age 14, and three-fourths occur by the age of 24, according to the publication. Among the more common mental illnesses seen among young women: eating disorders, which can start in advance of puberty and yet last a lifetime. Jones emphasizes the dire need for early detection and treatment of mental illnesses in young women. ""When these young people grow into adults, they're more likely to end up in the criminal justice system, homeless on the streets, poor performers in school and ultimately bounced into a system that's incapable of helping them with their needs,"" she explains. Another point Jones stresses is about the negative stigma around women's mental health issues. ""We have to accept that mental illness is not a sign of weakness; it's not a choice. But it is treatable, and our own innate resilience protects us and plays a critical role in combating mental illness, especially depression and anxiety,"" she says. Despite the relief Neighbour initially felt after finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she recalls that instead of getting better, she started to get worse. The mood-stabilizing medications she was prescribed were so sedating that she slept 16 hours a day, which led her deeper into her depression. ""The doctor said, 'This is how things are, and it will only get worse,' and that's what I started to believe. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" she says. There is a common thread to Neighbour's experience and that of other women suffering from mental illness: societal beliefs often pressure women into accepting their mental illness as ""just how things are,"" citing hormones and traditional views of women as the emotional, weaker sex as reasons to simply accept their current situation. According to Jones, it's a barrier that keeps women from seeking treatment for an otherwise largely treatable disease. Despite numerous barriers to access and adequate mental health treatment for women, recent developments in female-specific care provide a new area of hope. Over the last decade, researchers have begun to develop trauma-informed care services, which focus on the high prevalence of trauma -- such as childhood sexual abuse, relationship violence and coerced sex -- that women are more likely to have experienced compared to men. The HHS reports that 40 percent of women report a history of sexual violence, compared to only 10 percent of men. In some mental health treatment programs, recognizing these underlying factors and treating women accordingly has led to dramatically improved outcomes. In 2005, Neighbour discovered the concept of mental health recovery, which is focused on identifying triggers and symptoms that would cause her behavior to get worse, and responding with actions that she recognized helped her calm herself. She learned that there were other tools beyond medications that could help treat her mania and depression. ""I went from focusing everything on 'being' my illness, to focusing on finding fulfillment."" After holding 30 jobs in 15 years, Neighbour now holds a steady full-time job and serves as a volunteer to help others in their own recovery from mental illness. She describes her healing as an ongoing process and critical to it is a network of peers who have had similar life experiences. ""Now I wake up, and I ask how can I go out and change things? I just get excited when I wake up every morning,"" she says.","HHS's Office on Women's Health releases new report on women's mental health .

"(CNN) -- The body of a University of Georgia professor accused of killing three people was found Saturday buried in woods near Athens, Georgia, authorities said. George Zinkhan, a professor at the University of Georgia, disappeared after the slayings of his wife and two others. George Zinkhan, 57, is suspected of fatally shooting his wife and two other people last month outside a community theater in Athens, which is home to the University of Georgia. Cadaver dogs discovered the body with two guns in a wooded area of northwest Clarke County, about a mile from where Zinkhan's red Jeep Liberty was found last week, Athens-Clarke Police Chief Joseph Lumpkin said. Athens-Clarke County police confirmed the identity of the body, citing results from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The guns are like those authorities believe were used in the shootings, Lumpkin said. The body was found ""beneath the earth,"" Lumpkin said, without any clothes. ""A person who's not accustomed to the woods would never have found the body,"" he said. Significant ""efforts"" were undertaken to conceal the body's location, Jim Fullington of the GBI said. Authorities say Zinkhan fatally shot Marie Bruce, 47, Zinkhan's wife and a prominent Athens attorney, Tom Tanner, 40, and Ben Teague, 63, on April 25. The victims all were associated with the Town and Gown Players, a theater group that was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings. Zinkhan arrived while the Town and Gown event was under way and got into a disagreement with his wife, police said. Police believe he went to his car -- where the couple's children apparently were waiting -- and returned with two handguns. In addition to the three deaths, two other people were wounded, police said. After the shooting, Zinkhan left with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- in the car, police said. He drove to a neighbor's home in nearby Bogart, Georgia, where he lived, and left the children with the neighbor. Authorities put out bulletins across the nation for Zinkhan after the shootings and revealed that he had purchased a May 2 ticket in March to the Netherlands, where he owns a house. The day of the flight passed without any sign of Zinkhan. He had been an endowed marketing professor at the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business. The university fired Zinkhan the day after the shootings. CNN's Marylynn Ryan contributed to this report.","NEW: Efforts made to conceal body found unclothed with guns, police say .

"(CNN)  -- The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has confirmed that Richard Gasquet has been provisionally suspended after the French star admitted testing positive for cocaine at the Miami Masters tournament in March. Gasquet is left to contemplate a possible two-year ban from tennis. A spokesman for the ITF Anti-Doping Programme told CNN Gasquet's ban from competition has been put in place in accordance with rules revised by the 2009 WADA Code. ""Players may now be served with a provisional suspension if their A sample tests positive for a non-specified substance (eg a hormone or steroid). Richard Gasquet has consequently received a provisional suspension according to the rules of the programme."" The spokesman added: ""In accordance with the programme's confidentiality provisions, the ITF will not release any further details until an independent anti-doping tribunal has issued its decision, which will be in due course."" The former world number seven issued a statement to news agencies on Sunday after the French sports paper L'Equipe had revealed in a report on its Web site the failed doping tests. Gasquet, who has slipped to 23rd in the rankings, faces a two-year ban from tennis, but is hoping for leniency. ""The test of the B sample submitted at the end of March 2009, confirmed the positive result of the A sample taken on the same day,"" he said. ""I want to prove my innocence and will explain myself at an appropriate time,"" he added. If Gasquet exercises his right to a hearing, an independent anti-doping tribunal will be held, ordinarily within 60 days of the player's request. The tribunal will determine whether an offense has been committed, and if so, what penalty will be issued. Earlier Sunday, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) admitted they would be ""very surprised"" if the reports proved to be true. The FFT added in a statement released to Press Association that it ""would be very sad for Richard Gasquet himself, for tennis in general, for French tennis in particular, whose image would be dented"" if the positive test was officially confirmed. Gasquet, a teenage prodigy, has failed to match his early promise but did reach the semifinals of Wimbledon in 2007. Only this week the 22-year-old was confirmed as one of the star attractions at the pre-Wimbledon tournament at Eastbourne, but now faces a battle to clear his name. In ATP tennis action on Sunday, Novak Djokovic continued his fine form on clay with victory in his home tournament in Belgrade. The Serbian top seed beat Lukasz Kubot of Poland 6-3 7-6 in the Serbia Open final. It was Djokovic's fourth successive appearance in an tour final. The BMW Open title in Munich went to Czech Tomas Berdych who edged out Mikhail Youzhny of Russia 6-4 4-6 7-6.","Richard Gasquet tests positive for cocaine at ATP Miami Masters in March .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- J.J. Abrams' franchise reboot boldly went where no Star Trek movie has gone before, grossing a stellar $72.5 million from Friday through Sunday, according to early estimates by Hollywood.com Box Office. In the film, Spock (Zachary Quinto, left) and Kirk get off on the wrong foot. That's the second-best opening of 2009 (after X-Men Origins: Wolverine's $85.1 million last weekend), and it includes a whopping $8.2 million earned in IMAX showings, a new one-weekend record for the large format (beating The Dark Knight's $6.3 million). What's more, if you add in the $4 million that the movie starring Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto earned in late-Thursday showings, Star Trek has banked an impressive $76.5 million so far -- well ahead of most expectations. This result is highly logical. Considering all the hype and buzz and strong reviews that Star Trek has garnered, it's no surprise that this film's opening sum is by far the biggest of any Star Trek movie: Of the 10 previous flicks in the franchise, 1996's Star Trek: First Contact bowed best, with (only) $30.7 million over three days. Moreover, a look at the movie's CinemaScore report card reveals some potentially good news. While it drew an expected crowd mostly comprised of older males, Star Trek's solid-A grade shows that word of mouth could be strong enough to bring in fans outside of the franchise's usual demographic (i.e. people who weren't alive in the 1980s...and women) as the weeks go on. Unless said folks are too distracted by Angels & Demons, Night at the Museum 2, and all the other big flicks on tap, of course. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (No. 2) was next with $27 million on a 68 percent decline. Fanboy-driven films always fall hard, but this drop is particularly hefty. Nevertheless, Hugh Jackman's franchise flick has already banked $129.6 million in 10 days. Fellow holdovers Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (No. 3 with $10.5 million), Obsessed (No. 4 with $6.6 million), and 17 Again (No. 5 with $4.4 million) rounded out the top five. And the comedy Next Day Air failed to take off, grossing just $4 million at No. 6. And in limited release, neither Rudo y Cursi nor Little Ashes made much of a mark, as each averaged well under $7,000 per theater. Overall, the box office was up nearly 22 percent from the same frame a year ago (when the infamous Speed Racer hit a bump in the road).

"ATHENS, Georgia (CNN) -- A wanted University of Georgia professor killed himself with a single gunshot to the head after he dug his own grave and covered it with brush, police said Tuesday. George Zinkhan, a professor at the University of Georgia, disappeared after the slayings of his wife and two others. The manhunt for George Zinkhan ended Saturday when cadaver dogs discovered his body in Georgia's Clarke County, about a mile from where his red Jeep Liberty was found more than a week earlier, police said. ""Zinkhan's body was found in a small dugout area in the ground, covered with leaves and debris, and it was apparent that he took significant steps to try to conceal his body from being located,"" a statement from Athens police said. Law enforcement officials determined that Zinkhan, 57, committed suicide after killing his wife, Marie Bruce, 47, Thomas Tanner, 40, and Ben Teague, 63, outside a theater in Athens on April 25. Another University of Georgia professor, Barbara Carroll, believes that she was also targeted by Zinkhan but escaped because she was at a movie theater the day of the slayings. In an e-mail obtained by CNN, Carroll had warned her colleagues at the university's Terry College of Business that Zinkhan, a marketing professor, was ""dangerous."" The e-mail was sent after the shootings but before Zinkhan's body was found. Carroll could not be reached Tuesday, but in her e-mail she said that law enforcement officials surrounded her house early on the morning of May 1 after authorities found MapQuest directions to her house, printed on April 24, in Zinkhan's Jeep. She said she was advised to go into hiding. ""I do not believe Zinkhan had a map to my house for any reason other than he planned to kill me as well on April 25,"" Carroll wrote. ""This also suggests premeditation for the three murders he did commit. By the grace of God, I was at the movies all Saturday afternoon after being at school in my office (like a sitting duck) all that morning."" All three of Zinkhan's victims were associated with the Town and Gown Players theater group, which was holding a reunion picnic at the time of the shootings. Police did not give any motive for the slayings but said in a statement that Zinkhan and his wife were having marital problems. Zinkhan targeted Tanner and shot him first, the statement added. Authorities said Zinkhan arrived while the Town and Gown event was under way and got into a disagreement with Bruce. Police believe that he left, went to his car -- where the couple's children apparently were waiting -- and returned with two handguns. In addition to the three deaths, two people were wounded, police said.

"(CNN) -- Treasure hunter Christian Hanisch told CNN Thursday that the hunt for Nazi Gold and possibly the legendary Amber Room will end Friday after the two men leading the expedition had a disagreement. Treasure hunters began drilling again Tuesday to try to locate the lost Nazi gold. Heinz-Peter Haustein, the other treasure hunter, told Germany's Bild newspaper that geophysicists will now re-evaluate the situation and that digging may resume in two weeks. CNN has so far not been able to reach Haustein for confirmation. ""Haustein told me to get out of here immediately,"" an angry Hanisch told CNN in a telephone interview. He said Haustein, who is also the mayor of the village Deutschneudorf, where the digging is taking place, told him he wanted to make the expedition more credible by calling in the scientists.  See photos from hunt for lost Nazi gold » . ""It can't get any more credible than now,"" said Hanisch, whose measurements had allegedly pinpointed the treasure. He said the drilling taking place at the site never focused on the exact coordinates he had provided. ""They just always dug around there, but never at the exact location where I wanted them to dig,"" he said. The two treasure hunters had said geological surveying had revealed an underground cave holding large amounts of precious metal. They said it could be a holding area dug by the Nazis who used it to stash valuables in World War II. Haustein said he also believes the legendary Amber Room, an interior made of gold and amber that the Nazis had looted from a palace in St. Petersburg,  after Adolf Hitler's forces invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, was also hidden somewhere in the mountains around Deutschneudorf -- and that finding a stash of gold could give clues as to the whereabouts of the Amber Room. Now Hanisch says he never believed in the Amber Room theory. ""I never talked about finding the Amber Room anywhere here, that was all Haustein's idea,"" he said. Hanisch said that his father was one of the soldiers who helped transport gold and other valuables to the area around Deutschneudorf near the end of the Second World War and that when he died he left behind coordinates allegedly leading to a cave holding gold and other valuables. Haustein has been paying for the excavation.  Watch hunt for Nazi gold at German mountain » . Earlier this week, Haustein said digging at the site was stopped more than a week ago amid safety concerns, as German authorities and the treasure hunters feared that the shaft dug so far might collapse, and that the alleged cave may be rigged with explosives or poisonous booby traps. Deutschneudorf is in Germany's Ore Mountains, and the mountain where the treasure hunters were looking was a copper mine until the 19th century. Though the mine was shut down in 1882, geologists have found evidence that soldiers from Hitler's Wehrmacht -- the German armed forces -- had been there: machine guns, parts of uniforms and explosives that are on display at the town's museum.

"Fareed Zakaria is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" on CNN at 1 and 5 p.m. ET Sundays. Zakaria says granting autonomy to groups generally produces peace and stability. (CNN) -- The Dalai Lama says the key to stopping violence around the world is to stop ""destructive emotion."" In an interview to air Sunday on CNN's ""GPS,"" he tells Fareed Zakaria that he doesn't think even Osama bin Laden wished for violence when he was a child but that it grew of out hatred and frustration. The Dalai Lama also addressed relations between Tibet and China in the interview, which Zakaria discussed with CNN. CNN: Why is Tibet such a hot-button issue for China? Fareed Zakaria: China sees the issue as a separatist movement, as President Lincoln did when the South wanted to secede from the Union. They feel their territorial integrity is being threatened. And Tibetans see their culture, language and religion as being slowly but surely extinguished by the Chinese. CNN: So who's right? Zakaria: Well, that depends on who you ask. You need to look at the history to get a complete picture. It all goes back to Genghis Khan, who captured Tibet in 1207. He united Tibet » with China under the Mongol empire. The Chinese have claimed an unbroken line of sovereignty over Tibet ever since. The Tibetans, however, reject that claim, saying they have been an independent kingdom for many periods during that time, some centuries long. That was the situation until 1912, when Tibet declared itself an independent republic. China never recognized it, nor did the U.N. or any major Western power. CNN: Well, that seems to indicate that China has a point. Does it? Zakaria: It's not so simple, because although China never recognized an independent Tibet, neither did it exercise any control of Tibet. That is, until 1950, when Chairman Mao sent the Red Army in to liberate -- as the Chinese saw it -- the Tibetan people from the feudal serfdom they were living under. However, the Tibetans saw the act as an invasion, and in 1959, the political and spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama, fled to India, where he set up a government in exile. CNN: So we've been with the current situation since 1959. Why hasn't there been any resolution? Zakaria: Well, the Chinese are hoping to wait it out. By letting the issue drag on, they are hoping more and more ethnic Han Chinese move into the region and slowly let the Tibetan freedom movement die out. CNN: Will it work? Zakaria:That could happen -- and has worked with other regions. But, it could also work the other way. The Chinese sometimes use force, as they did last year against the Tibetan monks, which causes a huge backlash in Tibet and outside. This has resulted in some Tibetans becoming more strident in their calls for independence and aggressive in their demands. However, the Dalai Lama has repeatedly said that he does not seek independence, only cultural autonomy, and urged his followers to engage in no violent protests whatsoever. If there were ever a leader of a separatist group whom one could negotiate with, he's it. And once the 72-year-old Dalai Lama passes from the scene, Beijing might have to deal with a far more unpredictable and radical Tibetan movement. CNN: Do you think granting what the Dalai Lama is asking for makes sense? Zakaria: If you look at other cases, such as in Turkey and India, granting autonomy to groups that press for it has in the end produced a more stable and peaceful national climate. But that is a lesson the Chinese government will have to learn for itself; it is unlikely to take instruction from outsiders. CNN: What ultimately causes this age-old mistrust between the Chinese and the Dalai Lama? What's the stumbling block that keeps them from finding resolution? Zakaria: The Chinese government has always believed that when the Dalai Lama speaks of ""autonomy,"" what he really means is independence, a sovereign nation for Tibet. I asked the Dalai Lama about this, and he denied it vehemently. He insists that Tibetans would truly be content to live within the Chinese system, as citizens of its government, as long as they are allowed to preserve their culture and practice their religion. It is difficult to see how this gap -- the difference in perception between the two sides -- can be bridged.

"(CNN)  -- When Kellogg's dumped its endorsement of Michael Phelps after a photograph surfaced of the Olympic gold medalist using a bong, the company was stuck with thousands of boxes of cereal featuring the swimmer's image. Kellogg's ended its Michael Phelps endorsement, so it sent two tons of cereal with his face on it to a food bank. No problem. The company, based in Battle Creek, Michigan, made short order of the already-printed and filled boxes, donating two tons of cereal to the San Francisco Food Bank late last month. With food banks across the country reporting shortages of food, the donation was a welcome one, said the food bank's director of development, Christopher Wiley. It took only two weeks for about 3,000 boxes to move through warehouse. ""Thousands of families benefited from the donation"" Wiley said. ""It was a surprise to us. We were lacking a lot of cereal. It is a great product many low-income families really need."" ""The real story for us was not the box but what's inside the box. The food is so valuable for the community. It's making good from bad,"" Wiley said. The food bank has seen a 6 percent increase in its customer base since the beginning of the year, he said. Phelps, 23, won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China. He admitted ""regrettable behavior"" after a British newspaper published the controversial photograph in early February. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. A bong is a device commonly used to smoke marijuana. The Phelps box attracted considerable attention to the food bank. Administrators received several calls from people wanting to get the box as a novelty item. But, said Wiley, all the cereal went to food bank customers. Kellogg's was the only one of Phelps sponsors to drop the athlete, although U.S.A. Swimming, the nation's governing body for competitive swimming, suspended him for three months, withdrew financial support and barred him from competition during the period of his ""reprimand.""

"(CNN) -- Freed Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi thanked friends and family Tuesday for their support during her ordeal in an Iranian prison, and said she plans to spend the next few days relaxing. Roxana Saberi smiles ouside her home in Tehran, Iran, on Tuesday. ""I am, of course, very happy to be free and to be with my parents again,"" a smiling Saberi, 32, told reporters. Saberi, who was dressed in a black tunic and a blue headscarf, said she was only now learning of a global support campaign on her behalf. ""I want to thank all the people all over the world, who, whether they knew me or not, helped me and my family during this period,"" she said. ""I don't have any specific plans for the moment. I just want to be with my parents and my friends and to relax."" Reza Saberi, her father, said they plan to leave Iran soon. Saberi was convicted last month on espionage charges in a one-day trial that was closed to the public. She was sentenced to eight years in prison after being accused of spying for the United States. A judge changed Saberi's sentence during an appeal hearing Monday. The court agreed with her lawyers that, because Iran is not at war with the United States, Saberi cannot be punished for cooperating with agents of a hostile nation, according to Saberi's spokesman, Abdolsamad Khorramshahi. Her sentence was changed to a two-year jail term, suspended for five years, Iran's state-run news agency IRNA reported. Saberi was detained in January after initially being accused of buying a bottle of wine and working as a journalist without proper accreditation, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an advocacy group. She was soon charged with espionage. Saberi went on a hunger strike while imprisoned, but her father said she has since put on some weight.","Father of Roxana Saberi says they plan to leave Iran soon .

"(CNN) -- Police in San Bernardino, California, released pictures of two suspects in the abduction of a 3-year-old boy who was taken at gunpoint from his home last weekend. Authorities say these men purchased tape from a store and used it 3-year-old Briant Rodriguez's abduction. Briant Rodriguez has been missing since May 3, when two Hispanic males armed with handguns burst into the home, tied him up, along with his mother and four siblings. They ransacked the home before leaving with Briant, a small amount of cash and some personal property, San Bernardino County Sheriff's Public Information Officer Cindy Beavers said. A motive for the abduction is still unclear, and the authorities have not received a demand for ransom, Beavers said. Investigators traced samples of the tape used to tie up the family to a home improvement store where they believe the suspects purchased the tape the Friday before the abduction. The unidentified store's surveillance camera captured two men who matched the description of the kidnappers given by Briant's mother, purchasing tape believed to have been used in the abduction, Beavers said. The home improvement store's exterior surveillance cameras also caught a green Ford Bronco believed to have been used in the abduction, Beavers said. The same car was later seen driving past a convenience store near Briant's home about three minutes after his mother called police on Sunday to report the abduction, Beavers said. Authorities distributed screen grabs of the footage on Friday showing the suspects and the vehicle in an effort to draw more tips, which have been coming in steadily since an Amber Alert was issued earlier this week. ""You've got two men that resemble the description given by Briant's mother, they're buying tape that matches the tape used to tie them up, then they leave the store in this green Bronco and then on Sunday, just a few minutes before the emergency call for help, the same vehicle is seen leaving the victims' neighborhood,"" she said. ""Detectives put these two incidents together, and they're confident that these are the suspects and that was the vehicle used,"" she said. Both suspected kidnappers are Hispanic males -- one 5-feet, 5 inches tall, between the ages of 18 and 20 with a thin build, unknown hair and eye color, last seen wearing a black baseball hat, blue jeans and green T-shirt. The other is 5-foot-10, around age 24 with a thin build, black boots, a black shirt and a bandanna. Neighboring law enforcement agencies are on alert, and the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Border Patrol are assisting in the investigation. The FBI and the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department have both put up $25,000 rewards for Briant's return. The FBI has also established a Facebook page with the latest information in the case. ""We became involved in the beginning and that's customary in kidnapping cases because of the potential for cases to go out of state or out of the country,"" FBI Spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. Despite early speculation that the abduction was related to Mexican cartel violence, both spokeswomen said they were unaware of specific evidence suggesting the family had ties to the drug trade. ""We've seen an escalation nationwide in south-of-the-border-related kidnappings, whether it be drug cartels exacting revenge or carrying out violence in exchange for drug debts, or in another type of scenario, Americans who do business in Mexico being targeted for ransom,"" Eimiller said. ""Of course that's being looked at as a scenario here, but we have no conclusive evidence suggesting that's the case just yet."" Briant is described in the Amber Alert as a Hispanic male who was last seen wearing a yellow shirt with blue sleeves and blue-striped shorts with two different colors of blue. The boy's hair is longer than shoulder length.","Tape used in abduction leads police to store where suspects seen purchasing item .

"(CNN) -- As President Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon talk tough about cracking down on the deadly drug war, the United States is changing tactics in the battle against illegal narcotics at home. Legalizing marijuana is off the table, the White House says. The man Obama picked to be the new ""drug czar,"" Gil Kerlikowske, has made it clear that the United States is going to do a better job of treating addicts to try to reduce the demand for narcotics. Kerlikowske, 59, is a military veteran with 36 years of law enforcement experience. The drug czar oversees an agency that sets the country's drug-control strategy. The White House and Congress want to see more drug courts, and increased funding for the program 250 percent in the spending bill signed in March. It's a campaign pledge that the Obama administration thinks will give nonviolent offenders ""a chance to serve their sentence, where appropriate, in the type of drug rehabilitation programs that have proven to work better than a prison term in changing bad behavior,"" according to the White House Web site. Judge Paul Gluchowski, who works with the Prince William County Juvenile Drug Court in Virginia, dismissed the notion that a drug treatment program is the easy way out.  Watch what it's like inside the drug court » . If anyone thinks that, he said he'd tell them they should ""come and talk to some of the participants. A lot of them probably wish they never agreed to undergo drug court. And a lot of them have given up because it's too hard."" Those who slip up in drug court can be forced to wear ankle-monitoring bracelets or put into juvenile detention. ""If they don't give up, then when it comes time for graduation and you see the shine on their face, when you know that they have accomplished something, and they know that. That's what it's all about,"" Gluchowski said. Vice President Joe Biden stressed the importance of drug courts and prisoner re-entry programs when he announced Kerlikowske's position in March, saying they ""can serve as the light at the end of the tunnel, of a very long, long dark tunnel, for those who are stuck in the cycle of drug addiction and incarceration."" Kerlikowske said he was committed to tackling the nation's drug problem, but noted that it would take a ""coordinated and multifaceted effort."" ""The success of our efforts to reduce the flow of drugs is largely dependent on our ability to reduce demand for them,"" Kerlikowske said, calling the nation's drug problem one of ""human suffering."" ""It requires prosecutors and law enforcement, courts, treatment providers and prevention programs to exchange information and to work together. And our priority should be a seamless, comprehensive approach,"" he said. In meeting with Calderon on Thursday, Obama tried to show Mexico's president that he is committed to ending a crisis that hits so close to home. Obama vowed to beef up security along the border and to work to slow the flow of guns and drugs. He said the United States shares responsibility for the drug problem, saying ""a demand for these drugs in the United States is what is helping to keep these cartels in business."" But he also tried to limit expectations that there could be any sort of quick fix. ""Now, are we going to eliminate all drug flows? Are we going to eliminate all guns coming over the border? That's not a realistic objective,"" he said. ""What is a realistic objective is to reduce it so significantly, so drastically that it becomes once again a localized criminal problem, as opposed to a major structural problem that threatens stability in communities along those borders."" The White House has listened to those who say legalizing marijuana will pull the rug from under the violent cartels in Mexico and boost the U.S. economy, but that option is not on the table. Asked Thursday if that is something realistic, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano quickly responded, ""No, it is not."" Sixty percent of drug criminals sent to prison re-offend, compared to 17 percent of graduates of drug court, according to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. Drug policy experts like those numbers, but say the nation needs more treatment options. ""For individuals who don't have the resources, don't have public health insurance, can't afford it themselves, the single best way that they can access treatment is to get arrested,"" said Ryan King, a policy analyst with the Sentencing Project. ""And that's wrong. What we need to do is make sure for every American that is abusing drugs and wants to stop, that they have the resources made available to them, regardless of whether they can afford them.""

"(CNN)  -- At least 10 people were killed, and an unknown number remained missing Wednesday, after a boat authorities believe was used for human smuggling capsized off the coast of Florida. The Coast Guard said it rescued 26 people from a capsized boat off the coast of Florida. Almost all of the victims are believed to be from Haiti and the Bahamas, according to the U.S. Coast Guard -- which said a dangerous number of people was packed onto a small pleasure cruiser. The Coast Guard said it rescued 26 people from the boat, and searchers didn't know how many more people had been on the boat. ""You don't put 26 people on a small boat. It was way overloaded, completely unsafe,"" said Capt. Jim Fitton, the Coast Guard's sector commander in Miami, Florida. ""With smugglers, you have the potential for this because smugglers aren't interested in people's welfare. They're interested in making money."" The boat capsized about 15 miles east of Boynton Beach, Florida, some time around 2 a.m. Wednesday, the Coast Guard said. The agency was notified more than nine hours later by someone who saw the boat. There were women and children on the boat, Fitton said. A pregnant woman was taken to a hospital, while most of the victims remained onboard a Coast Guard cutter that was being used in the continuing rescue efforts, he said. Only eight of the people rescued by Wednesday afternoon were wearing life jackets. The Rev. Luke Harrigan, a Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, pastor to members of the Haitian community who is working with the Coast Guard, said he is contacting family members of the victims who were killed. ""Most of them now didn't even know they were coming to the United States,"" he said. ""Sometimes the person organizing the trip doesn't even tell them where they are going."" He said it's not uncommon for smugglers to charge people from the impoverished island nation as much as $4,000 for passage into the United States. Coast Guard rescuers were continuing to search the area of the crash Wednesday evening.","Coast Guard rescues 26; searchers unsure how many others missing .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Hundreds of Indian army troops were using helicopters and boats Wednesday to deliver supplies and rescue villagers stranded by the worst flooding in decades, after the Kosi River breached an embankment in Nepal to the north. The death toll in the hard-to-reach Bihar state in northeastern India has been difficult to determine. Bihar emergency management official K.K. Agarwal confirmed 10 deaths to CNN on Wednesday, but the news agency Press Trust of India (PTI) reported 55. Phone lines and electricity are out in the flooded areas. In the Supaul district city of Birpur, Mohd Rauffudin's hopes were fading. He told IBN -- a CNN partner station in India -- that while he was trying to stay afloat, he lost contact with his wife and children, as well as his nine brothers and his parents. ""I wish the help had reached (us) on time. That way at least my children could have been safe,"" he said. A woman who called herself Ruby told IBN her baby has been sick for four days, she can't reach medical help and she has lost track of her family. ""My child is so ill. I cannot do a thing about it. I wonder what I did wrong that my child must suffer,"" the mother said. The flooding began when the river burst through an embankment in Nepal more than a week ago, swallowing villages and destroying about 225,000 homes, officials and UNICEF India said. Water flowed so forcefully from the breach that the river changed course, making a new channel about 75 miles (120km) east of its river bed, flooding areas unaccustomed to water that high.  Watch survivors find safety on roofs » . Agarwal said the disaster affected about 2 million people and 725 villages in Bihar, India's poorest state. Ninety-five relief shelters had been set up, 44 health-care camps and 22 shelters for animals, he said. Army spokesman Lt. Col. A. K. Mathur said 400 troops were involved in rescue operations, and the military had dispatched at least 20 rescue boats. Three army helicopters were dropping thousands of food packets, he said. PTI reported earlier in the day that bad weather had prevented Indian air force choppers from conducting relief drops in the worst-hit districts of Bihar: Supaul, Saharsa, Araria and Madhepura.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish court convicted four men Tuesday but acquitted 10 others of charges that they helped four suspects from the Madrid train bombings to flee. The rush-hour train bombings killed 191 people and wounded 1,800 others. The National Court convicted Kamal Ahbar, 31, of Algeria, and Samir Tahtah, 32, of Morocco, of belonging to an Islamic terrorist group, and sentenced them to nine years in prison, according to a 136-page court ruling. The court also convicted Mohamed El Idrissi, 32, of Morocco, of collaborating with a terrorist group and sentenced him to five years. Tarek Hamed Hamu, 30, a Spaniard from Spain's enclave of Ceuta on Morocco's north coast, was convicted of document forgery and sentenced to two years. But 10 other men, from Morocco, Algeria or Spain's Ceuta, were acquitted. Most were arrested in June 2005, a year after the Madrid commuter train bombings in March 2004 that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800. In June 2005, police closed in on a rundown locale, the court said, in a Barcelona suburb, on suspicion it was a hive for Islamic terrorist recruitment, indoctrination and logistical support to move men to Iraq to fight against western forces there, including as suicide bombers. Prosecutors said the group helped four train bombing suspects flee. But one was later caught and convicted in Morocco; another was thought to have died in Iraq, while a third was among seven key train bomb suspects who blew themselves up in Madrid suburb as police closed in on their hideout a month after the train bombings.","Four men convicted of helping Madrid bombing suspects flee .

"(CNN) -- The days of being cut off from the Internet while you're on a plane are quickly disappearing. An American Airlines passenger uses Wi-Fi to access the Internet during a flight. A number of domestic airlines have recently begun offering Wi-Fi Internet access aboard planes, and other airlines say they are working toward making it happen. ""This is the year"" for Wi-Fi on planes, said Jack Blumenstein, president and CEO of Aircell, whose Gogo® Inflight Internet service provides access on Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, AirTran and Virgin America flights, and will begin testing on United flights later this year. Gogo is installed on more than 200 commercial planes, and Blumenstein said he expected 1,200 aircraft to have Gogo capability by the end of 2009. For now, Wi-Fi on domestic carriers' planes is limited to flights within North America. Gogo, which operates by transmitting signals from ground-level towers, functions across the United States and up to about 300 miles offshore. The company's access will cover the entire continent within a year or two, Blumenstein said. Row 44, which uses satellite technology to provide connectivity to Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines, already covers much of North America and will roll out trans-Atlantic and European service in the third quarter of this year, said the company's CEO, John Guidon. Neither company would release the exact cost of turning airplanes into Wi-Fi hot spots. But Blumenstein said Aircell managed to equip a plane for ""substantially"" less than $100,000. Row 44, which bills itself as the ""industrial-strength solution"" to airplane connectivity, costs hundreds of thousands of dollars per plane, Guidon said. Another company, LiveTV, is a subsidiary of JetBlue that provides free e-mail and messaging aboard flights but doesn't offer open Web surfing. LiveTV, which uses air-to-ground technology, provides the service on select JetBlue flights and also is working with Frontier Airlines on offering Internet access aboard its planes. The Wi-Fi venture has the potential to be ""very profitable,"" said Harlan Platt, an airline industry expert and professor of finance at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. ""Normally, air carriers rush to purchase capital equipment that raises their cost but doesn't raise their revenue. ... This is actually a revenue-producing tactic. And it's a good one because it's providing value to the passenger and it's creating incremental revenues for the airline,"" Platt said. Aircell, which shares its revenue from Gogo with the airlines, charges $9.95 for flights under three hours, $12.95 for flights longer than three hours and $7.95 to use a Wi-Fi capable handheld device for any flight length. Passengers can begin using the service once the plane reaches 10,000 feet. If the plane remains in flight for longer than three hours as part of a delay, passengers do not pay the higher fee, Blumenstein said. Platt believes that business model will evolve to entice more passengers to use it. The size of those fees could result in ""a whole segment of the market that they're not going to capture,"" said Platt. The airlines will maximize their profits by convincing more passengers to use the system with a lower price, he said. Platt predicted Aircell and the airlines would create a second tier of service, which would be less expensive but with fewer capabilities. He compared the strategy to airlines' price-reducing tactics to avoid empty seats on planes. As Aircell and Row 44's services expand, LiveTV is monitoring passengers' usage to gauge how to move ahead with its own business model, said Mike Moeller, vice president of sales and marketing for the company. ""Yes, broadband is coming. We're sitting there asking, 'Who pays? Is it the airlines or the customers? And what will they pay? What is the right technology? ... When does all of this happen?' We're in weird economic times,"" Moeller said. As for the possibility of passengers offending their seat-mates by surfing for inappropriate content, Blumenstein said nine months of Wi-Fi availability on American yielded no such incidents. Still, airlines including American, Delta and United have requested screening for potentially offensive content, he said. On the other hand, Alaska Airlines, which uses Row 44, does not plan on using the company's content-blocking capabilities. Instead, flight attendants will follow standard protocol for objectionable material -- they'll ask passengers to stow it away, said Bobbie Egan, an airline spokeswoman. Here is what major U.S. airlines offer, and what is coming up: .","Many domestic airlines have begun offering Wi-Fi Internet access aboard planes .
Provider Aircell expects to have 1,200 planes equipped by the end of this year .
Another company, Row 44, says it will have trans-Atlantic Wi-Fi in the third quarter ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai discussed his sometimes-turbulent relationship with the United States on Friday as more details emerged about U.S. airstrikes in his country that killed dozens of people this week. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said his government does not tolerate corruption. Karzai reflected on the past seven years of his leadership of Afghanistan and characterized his relationship with the United States as having ""serious bumps along the way, especially in the conduct of the war on terror."" The theme he emphasized Friday was the problem of Afghan civilian casualties caused by American airstrikes. Karzai said he has raised the issue repeatedly since 2007. ""We have complained bitterly about civilian casualties,"" he said. ""We needed to get Washington's attention."" The issue of civilian deaths has been at the foreground of Karzai's trip to Washington, where he's meeting with President Obama and other top officials. Afghan officials say that more than 100 civilians were killed in a U.S. airstrike Wednesday in Farah province, on the western border with Iran. If that death toll is confirmed, it will be the single deadliest incident involving Afghan civilians since the American-led invasion of the country in 2001 to oust the Taliban from power. A senior U.S. military official said Friday that 30 to 50 people were killed in the strikes, most of them insurgents. But the rest were civilians, including women and children. The U.S. military thinks some civilians were killed when they were caught up in the ground fighting and others in the airstrikes. The Taliban held some civilians against their will in the buildings that were attacked, according to the official. Karzai said senior Obama administration officials immediately and personally apologized to him about the incident when he met with them this week.  Watch Karzai discuss U.S. airstrikes that allegedly killed civilians » . At the White House on Wednesday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Karzai and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari that she ""deeply regretted"" the death of Afghan civilians and pledged that  the United States ""will work very hard with your governments and with your leaders to avoid the loss of innocent civilian lives."" In response to recent suggestions by U.S. military officials that the civilian deaths in Farah province might have been staged by the Taliban, Karzai said that an Afghan government team was investigating the incident and that ""there was no doubt that the casualties were caused by bombings... and the use of air power."" As the president grapples with the latest incident, he's also dealing with criticism of his administration by American officials for its perceived tolerance of corruption. An independent assessment by the non-governmental organization Transparency International rated Afghanistan as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Karzai said his government does not tolerate corruption. ""That is not right! That is not right!"" he said firmly. The president pointed out that Afghan courts had recently convicted 600 people on corruption charges or on counts of major drug dealing. Karzai used the issue of corruption to segue into a critique of the way in which aid has been disbursed to Afghanistan. He asserted that of the $32 billion the international community had given his country since 2001, only $6 billion -- or 20 percent -- has been funneled through the Afghan government. The other $26 billion has been spent by the donor countries themselves, and Karzai implied that the Afghan government should not be held accountable for how those funds have been spent. Support for Karzai's critique came last year in a study by the leading British charity Oxfam that concluded that a large portion of the money the international community has given to Afghanistan does not end up in the country itself. The report estimated that 40 percent of the money spent is returned to donor countries, such as the United States, in the form of consultants' salaries and corporate profits. Turning to the election, to be held August 20, the Afghan president said that if he wins another five-year term, he will put a special emphasis on building dams and bringing electricity to the Afghan people. The U.S. government assesses that less than 10 percent of Afghans have access to electric power. Karzai is likely to win the vote in a landslide, given his advantages of incumbency, relative popularity and the few plausible opposition candidates. Karzai emphasized also the importance in the coming years of what he described as the ""peace process"" with the Taliban. He characterized it as being at ""the heart"" of what his government hopes to achieve and said he is ""glad that the Obama administration is backing this."" The Afghan president said Saudi Arabia, one of the few governments to recognize the Taliban when they were in power, is ""very important"" in this process because of its leadership of the Islamic world. CNN's Nic Robertson reported that in September, representatives of the Afghan government and former Taliban officials met in Mecca for preliminary discussions about peace in a meeting hosted by Saudi King Abdullah. But peace with the Taliban may be a long time coming. Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar has in the past several months announced at every opportunity that he has no interest in a deal with the Afghan government. And one of Mullah Omar's deputies announced last month on a Taliban Web site that the militants would launch ""strong and robust"" operations in Afghanistan to counter the additional 21,000 American soldiers who are deploying to the country this year.","Afghan president says airstrikes have strained dealings with Washington .

"(CNN)  -- Husbands are allowed to slap their wives if they spend lavishly, a Saudi judge said recently during a seminar on domestic violence, Saudi media reported Sunday. It is OK to slap Saudi women who spend too much, a judge has told an audience. Arab News, a Saudi English-language daily newspaper based in Riyadh, reported that Judge Hamad Al-Razine said that ""if a person gives SR 1,200 [$320] to his wife and she spends 900 riyals [$240] to purchase an abaya [the black cover that women in Saudi Arabia must wear] from a brand shop and if her husband slaps her on the face as a reaction to her action, she deserves that punishment."" Women in the audience immediately and loudly protested Al-Razine's statement, and were shocked to learn the remarks came from a judge, the newspaper reported. Arab News reported that Al-Razine made his remark as he was attempting to explain why incidents of domestic violence had increased in Saudi Arabia. He said that women and men shared responsibility, but added that ""nobody puts even a fraction of blame"" on women, the newspaper said. Al-Razine ""also pointed out that women's indecent behavior and use of offensive words against their husbands were some of the reasons for domestic violence in the country,"" it added. Domestic violence, which used to be a taboo subject in the conservative kingdom, has become a hot topic in recent years. Groups like the National Family Safety Program have campaigned to educate the public about the problem and help prevent domestic abuse. Saudi women's rights activist Wajeha Al-Huwaider told CNN that Saudi women routinely face such attitudes. ""This is how men in Saudi Arabia see women,"" she said in a telephone interview from the Saudi city of Dahran. ""It's not something they read in a book or learned from a friend. They've been raised to see women this way, that they're less than a person."" Al-Huwaider added that ""I'm not surprised to see a judge or a religious man saying that - they've been raised in the same culture - a culture that tells them it's ok to raise your hand to a woman that this works."" Another Saudi judge, in the city of Onaiza, was the source of a separate recent controversy: he twice denied a request from the mother of an 8-year-old girl that the girl be granted a divorce from her 47-year-old husband.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Taliban spokesman issued a series of threats and ultimatums against Pakistani officials Wednesday as the country's military continued its offensive against the militant group in the Swat Valley. Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan has courted local and international media in jovial telephone conversations. Speaking on the telephone with CNN, Muslim Khan announced that all national and provincial parliament members from the Malakand Division, the northwestern region where the Swat Valley is located, must resign within three days. ""Otherwise, we will arrest all their families,"" Khan threatened, ""and we will destroy all their buildings."" The Taliban spokesman issued a separate directive aimed at prompting a public show of support for the militants from Pakistan's Islamist political parties. ""All these parties must help the Taliban,"" Khan said. ""They must give a press conference to show the people that we need sharia [Islamic law] in the Malakand Division."" Members of the Islamist party Jamaat-i-Islami have spoken out against the military's offensive in the Swat Valley, but they have stopped short of announcing support for the Taliban.  Watch more about the victims of the war » . Throughout the fighting over the past three weeks, the gray-bearded Khan has been the public face of the Taliban, enthusiastically courting local and international media in jovial telephone conversations. In an earlier phone interview with CNN, he described how he had spent four years living in the United States, working as a painter in the Boston, Massachusetts, area. On Wednesday, Khan denied reports from many refugees emerging from the Swat Valley that Taliban militants had carried out a campaign of violence and intimidation in the region for the past two years. Several terrified Swat residents, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the Taliban, described how insurgents kidnapped and killed their critics, beheaded government informers and blew up girls' schools. Khan denied the accusations. ""We are killing the people which are only no good for society, like thieves and people who are making problem for the poor people, like people who are working for army,"" he said. ""We are only killing these people."" On Tuesday, the Pakistani army announced that it had dropped special forces soldiers by helicopter into the Peochar area of Swat, which is thought to be the headquarters for the region's Taliban's leader, Maulana Fazliullah. Local media report that the Taliban have training camps in Peochar. Khan confirmed that Pakistani troops had attacked Peochar, which he described as a ""place for mujaheddin,"" or holy warriors. The Taliban spokesman said militants and soldiers have been fighting in the mountains around Peochar since Tuesday, and that the clashes continue. He said two Taliban fighters had been killed so far in the battle, along with five Pakistani troops. Meanwhile Wednesday, Taliban militants attacked NATO supply terminals, torching at least 10 supply trucks in northern Pakistan, local officials said. About 70 Taliban fighters attacked the facility in Peshawar, police said. A gunfight ensued between the insurgents and police. No casualties were reported. Peshawar is the capital of the North West Frontier Province, which intelligence officials say is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of recent clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants there must be trucked in from Pakistan. Convoys carrying food and military supplies have regularly come under attack in the area. Journalist Janullah Hashimzada contributed to this report.","Taliban spokesman threaten Pakistan's ruling political class .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- His was one of the first photos of a missing child to appear on a milk carton. Almost 30 years later, Etan Patz is still missing. Etan Patz, 6, disappeared while walking to a school bus stop. It was the first time he'd gone alone. Etan was 6 when he disappeared on May 25, 1979, the Friday before Memorial Day. He was on his way to school in what is now the upscale Soho neighborhood of New York. It was the first time he'd walked to the bus stop by himself. It was just a few blocks away. Etan, like any 6-year-old, argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone, and his parents relented. His mother, Julie Patz, learned that Etan hadn't been in classes when he failed to return home. She called the school at 3:30 p.m., then called the homes of all his friends. When no one had seen Etan, she called police and filed a missing person's report. By evening more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds. The search continued for weeks, but no clues to Etan's whereabouts were found.  Watch an update on the case » . The boy's disappearance was one of the key events that inspired the missing children's movement, which raised awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children. Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s. ""In our minds there were only two possibilities,"" said Stan Patz, the boy's father. ""Either Etan was taken by a stranger and killed or he was taken by a very sad woman desperate for a child of her own, and we hoped that such a woman would at least take care of him and keep him safe."" Patz lived with this hope until 1982, when he learned of Jose Antonio Ramos' arrest and the surprising connection between him and a former babysitter of Etan's. Ramos was a drifter who in 1979 lived in Alphabet City, a neighborhood not far from Soho. In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge, where he lived, said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who spent years investigating the case. When police found Ramos in his drainpipe home, they found he had many photographs of small blond boys. They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book about the case, ""After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive."" Bronx police questioned Ramos, and he denied having anything to do with Etan's disappearance. But he did tell police that his girlfriend used to baby-sit for the boy, GraBois said. Prosecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead, but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan's disappearance, GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said. Ramos was released when the parents of the Bronx boys chose not to press charges against him, according to published reports. He left town and disappeared for six years  -- until GraBois reviewed Etan's case.  GraBois said he focused on Ramos as the prime suspect. GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had  been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison. GraBois said he brought Ramos to New York for questioning and surprised him with the question: ""How many times did you have sex with Etan Patz?"" Ramos told GraBois that he'd taken a little boy to an apartment he had on the lower East Side on the same day that Etan went missing. ""He was 90 percent sure it was the same he'd seen in the news that was missing,"" GraBois said. According to GraBois, Ramos claimed he released the boy and brought him to a subway station so the boy could go visit his aunt in Washington Heights. ""Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights,""  GraBois said. When questioned further, Ramos refused to say anything more and asked for a lawyer, according to GraBois. Ramos is serving a 10- to 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania. He is scheduled to be released in November 2012, GraBois said. GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates.  He wouldn't go into detail about what Ramos might have told them, but said he's convinced he's eyeing the right suspect. GraBois turned over his evidence to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, but prosecutors have not brought charges. They say that without a body, they don't have enough evidence. Etan's case is still considered by the NYPD to be a cold case. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI/NYPD Etan Patz hotline: 212-384-2200.","Boy, 6, begged his parents to let him walk to school bus stop for first time .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Margie Brandquist wears a framed photo of her sister, who died in a plane crash three months ago. Flowers are left at a makeshift memorial near the site of a plane crash in Clarence Center, New York, in February. Her sister, Mary Pettys, 51, was engaged to be married when her Continental Connection Flight 3407 went down in icy conditions near Buffalo, New York. The flight, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, killing all 49 people on board and one man in the house. Brandquist is one of several of the victims' family members attending this week's National Transportation Safety Board hearing on Capitol Hill. Brandquist wants to know why the pilot, who failed several flight tests before joining the airline, never received hands-on training with the emergency equipment that was activated before the crash. ""We put our lives in the hands of people that we assume that the [Federal Aviation Administration] and the airlines are properly training,"" she told CNN's Randi Kaye. The safety board resumed its three-day hearing Wednesday.  Watch hearing consider whether crash could have been avoided » . At Tuesday's hearing, Colgan Air acknowledged that Capt. Marvin Renslow never trained on the ""stick pusher"" emergency system in a flight simulator. But in a written statement, the carrier said that both Renslow and First Officer Rebecca Shaw had received other specific training about how to handle situations like those that preceded the crash. It said that the company provides FAA-approved ground training and that ""Captain Renslow and First Officer Shaw had thorough initial and recurrent training"" on how to handle a stall. ""Captain Renslow and First Officer Shaw did know what to do, had repeatedly demonstrated they knew what to do, but did not do it,"" the statement said. ""We cannot speculate on why they did not use their training in dealing with the situation they faced."" Anne Marie Russo, whose daughter Madeline died in the crash, watched Tuesday's televised hearing at a hotel in Newark, New Jersey, with other families who lost loved ones on the flight. ""This should not have happened,"" she said. ""These 50 people should be enjoying their life right now."" She said she believes that cost-cutting measures by airlines may have been a factor in the crash. ""Maybe the training has to be more safer, more satisfactory for the public,"" she said. ""This is tragedy that happened to these 49, 50 people, it could happen to any one of us."" Dan Marzolf, who also lost a loved one in the crash, said the hearing was very technical, but he hopes ""to get to some conclusions."" ""I really do hope good will come from these meetings,"" he told CNN's affiliate in Buffalo, WGRZ. On Tuesday, the safety board investigators released a transcript of the cockpit voice recording from moments before the crash. The last sounds heard were Shaw saying, ""We're"" and then screaming at 10:16 p.m. Seconds earlier, Renslow said, ""Jesus Christ"" as a sound ""similar to stick shaker,"" an emergency warning system, was heard, the transcript said. Renslow said, ""We're down,"" and a thump was heard. About five minutes before the crash, Shaw had shared with Renslow her fear of flying in icy conditions. ""I don't want to have to experience that and make those kinds of calls. You know, I'd've freaked out. I'd've had like seen this much ice and thought, 'oh, my gosh, we were going to crash,' "" Shaw told Renslow. The safety board's preliminary investigation determined that there was some ice accumulation on the Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 aircraft but that ""icing had a minimal impact on the stall speed of the airplane."" At Tuesday's hearing, Colgan Air said Renslow, though not training physically on the ""stick pusher,"" received more training on it than the law requires. ""In the ground school portion, it is covered,"" said Paul Pryor, head of Colgan Air's pilot training program. Such training is not required by the Federal Aviation Administration. ""That's a significant problem,"" veteran pilot Douglas Moss said. Moss, an expert in stall recovery, believes that flight simulator practice with a stick pusher should be mandatory for aspiring pilots. ""It's similar to picking up and throwing a ground ball in baseball. You can study it academically all you want to, but you really need to develop the proficiency, the skill, the muscle memory required to do that,"" Moss said. Since the accident, Colgan has added demonstrations of the technique on its flight simulator . ""This is one of a number of additions that Colgan has made to its training and safety programs in the wake of the accident,"" the statement said. Renslow had failed five pilot tests, known as check rides, three of which occurred before he joined the airline, Colgan Air said. Renslow had revealed only one of those failures to the airline, according to Colgan. Wally Warner, a Bombardier test pilot who testified Tuesday, said he believes that the pilot could have overcome the stall that caused the crash. ""Obviously, the initial reaction to the stall warning was incorrect, and that set the course of action for what followed,"" Warner said. CNN's Allan Chernoff contributed to this report.","NEW: Airline says officers ""did know what to do ... but did not do it""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The last survivor of the Titanic, 97-year-old Millvina Dean, is auctioning off her remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills. Millvina Dean, 97, is trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers. The auction, which is expected to raise up to $50,000 for her, is set to take place Saturday near her home in England. It is the second auction in less than a year for Dean, who was a 9-week-old when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. Among the items going under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, said Alan Aldridge of the auction house. ""Historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto Carpathia, the rescue ship, in a mail sack,"" Aldridge said. After her rescue, Dean, her mother and her brother returned to England with a canvas sack, among other possessions. ""There is speculation that this would have been the bag. It's a leather and canvas bag. You would easily get a child or infant in it,"" Aldridge said, though he added that research by the Smithsonian, the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag. Given that the auctioneer cannot prove Dean was rescued in the bag, ""we expect it to fetch £3,000 ($4,480). If it was the bag she was rescued in, it would be £30,000 to £40,000, ($44,800 to $60,000), but we can't prove it. It depends on what people are prepared to believe."" Aldridge said he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible. ""She's in a residential nursing home. She's 97 years of age. She's paying £3,000 a month in nursing home fees,"" he said -- the amount he hopes her canvas bag will sell for. ""As she said, £3,000 a month is £36,000 a year, which is a lot of money,"" he said. ""When she runs out of money, the state will pay fees for her, but while she can pay her fees, she decides where she gets her care. When the state pays, they decide."" Dean's previous sale, in October, raised just over £30,000, Aldridge said. ""It's made a lot of people aware of her plight; a lot of people have sent her funds,"" he said. Dean never married and had no children. ""There are cousins, but there is no one directly to support her,"" Aldridge said. ""The property she lived in [before she moved to the nursing home] was not hers. She's just an ordinary little old lady. ""If she's lucky, she'll get another four or five years; she's quite a fit lady,"" he said. Dean was not available to speak to CNN herself because of a throat infection, Aldridge said. The auction will include 17 items from her collection, most of them memorabilia related to the Titanic and signed by her but not from the ship itself. The auction, in Devizes, southwest England, will also include a collection of letters from the estate of Titanic survivor Barbara Dainton-West, estimated to fetch £40,000 to £60,000 ($60,000 to $90,000). The letters include descriptions of her family's trip to board the Titanic and the immediate aftermath of the sinking. Dainton-West, who was 10 months old when the ship went down, died in October 2007, the auctioneer said.","97-year-old was 9 weeks old when Titanic sank in 1912 .

"(CNN) -- Three years ago, the film based on Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" was the focus of protest and controversy, with a Vatican archbishop calling for a boycott and Catholics at many levels refuting plot points. From left, actors Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer and Ewan McGregor join director Ron Howard at the film's premier. But when it comes to the new film based on a Brown novel, ""Angels & Demons,"" star Tom Hanks says talk of controversy is much ado about nothing. ""Everybody is looking for some scandal whether a scandal exists or not,"" Hanks said of the film. ""I think a kind of natural reaction is now that somehow because it's the second Robert Langdon mystery that there is some degree of controversy over it. And there is really not."" The movie ventures into similar waters as its predecessor, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" with Hanks reprising the role of Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbology expert, and conspiracy theories galore. It also reunites the Academy Award-winning actor with director Ron Howard, who helmed ""Da Vinci,"" and teams Hanks with actor Ewan McGregor and Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer. While ""The Da Vinci Code"" centered on the complex investigation of a murder in the Louvre and the theory that a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene produced descendants, the new film features a murder at the Vatican and a secret and powerful society known as the ""Illuminati."" McGregor,  known for his role as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the ""Star Wars"" films, said that while ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels & Demons"" are inextricably linked, the latter can stand on its own. ""If I thought [Angels & Demons] was pinned to 'The Da Vinci Code' in some way then it would've been a lesser script to read and it wasn't,"" McGregor said. ""It's a standalone movie ... it's not relevant whether you've seen 'Da Vinci Code' or not."" Both films, like the Brown novels they're based on, have been met with criticism for their melding of history and storytelling. ""I have a strong objection to the genre of mixing fact with fiction,"" said Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League. ""You've got [Dan] Brown, [Ron] Howard and [Tom] Hanks in the movie all alleging that the Illuminati was this secret society which was brutalized by the Catholic Church in the 1600s."" ""It's all a lie,"" Donohue said. ""[The Illuminati] never even existed until May 1, 1776, but they have to pitch it back into the 1600s so they can trot out their favorite victim, Galileo. What happens is you get the audience thinking 'Well, maybe it's not all true, but probably some of it is true.' "" Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide and the Christian Film & Television Commission, first issued an advisory alert about the film in April and reiterated it days before the movie's May 15 release. ""Now that we've previewed 'Angels & Demons,' Movieguide has decided to keep in effect our caution alert,"" Baehr said. ""Faith is often denied throughout the movie."" Director Howard wrote in the The Huffington Post that he believes Donohue is on a mission ""to paint me and the movie I directed, 'Angels & Demons,' as anti-Catholic,"" a claim Howard emphatically denies. The director told CNN that he attempted to reach out to the Catholic Church regarding the film, but had no success. He also downplayed reports that Rome and the Vatican tried to hinder filming. Hanks said shooting the movie in the ancient city was complicated given the vibrancy of Rome. At one point, Hanks said, make-believe collided with one woman's fairy tale. ""We had a lady showing up who was getting married at the Pantheon and she had to get married and we had to get our shot,"" Hanks said. ""She showed up right between shots, when we were moving cameras."" Fortunately, both the wedding and the day's filming were able to be completed, Hanks said. McGregor said Howard was to be credited for how well the production came together. Howard's background as an actor undoubtedly helped enhance the actors' performances, McGregor said. ""A lot of directors are able to tell you what they're after, but Ron's able to tell you what he's after and help you for how you might play that ... which is kind of total directing,"" McGregor said. Zurer said she had a blast being the only female lead in the film. Viewers should see the film for what it is, she said, and not focus on the controversy. ""It's fun fiction,"" she said. ""It's a fun movie to watch, it's thrilling and that's what I saw in it."" CNN's Lisa Respers France contributed to this story.","Tom Hanks stars in ""Angels & Demons,"" a sequel to ""The Da Vinci Code""

"WASECA, Minnesota (CNN) -- When you think of protection from the H1N1 flu virus, you may not think the hog population is what needs protecting. But that's precisely the concern among pork producers and those who use swine in research studies. Professor Samuel Baidoo wears specially issued gear as he checks on the hogs at the research facility. Forget any worries you may have had about catching the often-called ""swine flu"" from a pig. University of Minnesota Professor Samuel Baidoo, a swine nutrition and management expert at one of the school's swine research facilities, says it's actually the other way around. ""If we are sick and we come in here, we can easily transfer [diseases], especially flu, to these pigs,"" Baidoo says. Baidoo took CNN on a tour of the university's research facility to demonstrate the precautions in place year-round to make sure its pig population remains safe. For starters, anyone who wants to visit the facility has to shower and put on specially issued overalls and boots  and that rule applies to reporters and even the hog farmers themselves. ""They will shower to go and see their own pigs,"" Baidoo says. This university's swine research barn is typical of most large-production hog facilities, Baidoo says, stressing that it's so secure ""flies cannot even come in here."" ""Flu can be transferred by flies, by birds. There's no way a bird can get into this building. So these pigs are very, very safe,"" he explains. ""We are more a risk to them than they to us."" So let's say a pig does happen to come down with a disease, specifically with H1N1. Then what happens? Baidoo says the first sign that something is wrong is usually lack of appetite. ""They go off feed, so we know there's something not right."" If it does turn out to be a flu virus, Baidoo says, the treatment is very similar to what humans undergo. ""We put them on medication and within three days it's over. Just like when we get [the] flu -- we go to the doctor and then they prescribe medication and we get well."" Baidoo points out that since H1N1 is a respiratory illness, the actual carcass of the pig -- the pork we eat -- is still harmless. Still, Baidoo says he understands the initial knee-jerk reaction. After all, ""swine flu"" was what everyone called it at first -- before health organizations began referring to it as H1N1. ""I also see the concern of consumers. When there is this situation everybody tends to connect the two. But there is no connection at all between the flu and pork,"" he says. ""There's no fear in eating pork based on the scare of the flu pandemic."" The disease most people in the United States and worldwide have been calling swine flu is actually a combination of human and animal strains. It has not been shown to be transmissible through eating pork. In an already suffering market, the negative news is something the U.S. pork industry says could have been prevented. ""This flu is being called something that it isn't, and it's hurting our entire industry,"" Dave Warner, communications director for the National Pork Producers Council, said last week. ""It is not a 'swine' flu, and people need to stop calling it that ... they're ruining people's lives.""","Researchers say hog population needs protection from human diseases .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- An internationally known Catholic priest who was shown in photographs last week embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman on a Florida beach has admitted they had a two-year affair. The Rev. Alberto Cutie was removed from his duties after pictures showed him bare-chested with a woman. The Rev. Alberto Cutie -- sometimes called ""Father Oprah"" because of the advice he gave on Spanish-language media -- said Monday on CBS' ""Early Show"" that he is in love with the woman and is considering his options: Whether to break up with her or leave the priesthood and marry her. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, wants to get married, Cutie said. The priest was removed from his duties last week at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach, Florida, and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace networks. ""I take full responsibility for what I did, and I know it's wrong,"" he said Monday. The photos of the Cuban-American priest, also known as ""Padre Alberto,"" appeared on the cover of last week's TV Notas magazine and on eight inside pages. The cover says in Spanish: ""Good God! Padre Alberto. First photos of a priest 'in flagrante' with his lover."" Other media outlets throughout Latin America, including the official Notimex news agency in Mexico, picked up the story, and it became an Internet sensation. Cutie has millions of followers in the Spanish-speaking world. In a message posted on the Miami, Florida, archdiocese Web page last week, Archbishop John C. Favalora apologized to parishioners and radio listeners for what he called a ""scandal."" ""Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God,"" Favalora said. ""Father Cutie's actions cannot be condoned despite the good works he has done as a priest."" Cutie expressed his regret in an online statement last week and again Monday on the CBS program. ""I deeply apologize to the Catholic community and especially to my bishop and to my brother priests who are faithful and who are committed to celibacy,"" Cutie said. The priest said he believes in celibacy but thinks it should be optional. He said he had never had a sexual relationship with anyone other than the woman since leaving the seminary 15 years ago.  Watch Father Cutie question the celibacy requirement » . ""I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise,"" Cutie said. ""I understand fully that this is wrong. ""I don't want to be the anti-celibacy priest. I think that's unfortunate,"" he said. ""I think it's a debate that's going on in our society, and now I've become kind of a poster boy for it. But I don't want to be that. I believe that celibacy is good, and that it's a good commitment to God. This is something I've struggled with. And something that I never expected to become a public debate."" He also talked about the woman, saying they have been friends for a long time and the attraction was there from early on, but it was not acted on until a couple of years ago. They have ""both struggled"" with the relationship, he said. ""She's also a woman of faith,"" Cutie said. ""She's also somebody who cares about the priesthood, who cares about these things. So it hasn't been easy. And those who have helped me through this process know it hasn't been easy. Obviously, you know, through the photos, it looked like a frivolous thing on the beach, you know, and that's not what it is. It's something deeper than that."" Cutie was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network, his information on the LinkedIn online professional network says. In addition to his TV and radio appearances, he has written newspaper advice columns and a self-help book, ""Real Life, Real Love."" Before being removed, he was president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications, home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace in Miami.","Catholic priest was removed from duties in Miami archdiocese .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Chester French is giving its music away. Chester French, Max Drummey, left, and D.A. Wallach are earning buzz as a band to watch. Go to the duo's Web site and you can scoop up an entirely free ""athletic-themed"" album. The idea is that you'll be so impressed by the free stuff, you'll feel inspired to buy the band's official debut album, ""Love The Future"" (Star Trak/Interscope), which came out last month. ""We're doing something that's never been done by a band before,"" says lead singer D.A. Wallach. ""It's great because when you put out free music, people can spread it around as much as they want. And right now as we're just trying to expose ourselves to more people. Every new supporter helps."" The band has even come up with a fancy name for its fans: ""VIP Concierge Service."" So who are these two clever, skinny dudes who jokingly claim to ""put in a lot of burn at the gym""? Wallach and Max Drummey met at Harvard, but found music to be more interesting than their studies. Fortunately for them, sought-after producer Pharrell Williams liked what he heard and signed the group to his label. So far things seems to be working out for Chester French (named for sculptor Daniel Chester French, though the group is sick of explaining). They won a place on Rolling Stone's ""Artists to Watch"" list in 2008. HBO's ""Entourage"" showed some love for their catchy single ""She Loves Everybody.""  Watch Chester French get punched by a pretty girl » . And then there's the transportation situation. ""Right now we're on the first tour bus we've ever had,"" says Wallach. ""We were driving around in a van for the past year and a half and it's a real luxury now to be able to sleep while we're driving."" The band spoke to CNN about the challenges of navigating a rapidly changing industry, getting punched by a pretty girl in a music video and why the Beach Boys have nothing on them. CNN: How does it feel to be called the next big thing? D.A. Wallach: You know what, we actually haven't been called that in those words too often. But if we did, that would be very flattering. CNN: Things get a bit violent in the music video for your song ""She Loves Everybody."" Who's idea was it to have you both get beaten up by an angry girl? Wallach: It was the director's. We worked with Paul Hunter on the video and it was our first music video. ... He had the concept that love hurts. So this girl was going to take it out on us and we were going to be all about it and still smiling and enjoying it. CNN: So it was a lot of fun? Wallach: Yeah it was great. It was painless. Actually we both got hit accidentally by her. I mean most of the hits were kind of staged punches. But we both got hit once each, and it was fun. CNN: You're both Harvard graduates. Does that make you the smartest dudes in pop music? Wallach: Probably not. We were kind of nerds in high school. And the hardest part about Harvard is getting in, people say. After that you take it at your own pace. And at different times we were more or less engaged there, but we met some other really intelligent, thoughtful people. Max Drummey: And there's definitely a lot of stupid people at Harvard. CNN: Tell me how you both met. Wallach: We met in the dining hall our freshman year and we started the band with three of our classmates. It was just a funny hobby at first and it wasn't until sophomore year that we really got serious about it and said, ""OK, let's actually try and make this a possibility as a career."" CNN: And didn't you record most of your new album on campus? Wallach: Yeah, there was a recording studio in the basement of one of the dorms at Harvard and we were both recording engineers there. So we recorded lots for other people as well. And in our free time we were working on the record we just released, ""Love the Future."" CNN: Is it true that there was a bit of a bidding war between Jermaine Dupri and Pharrell Williams (over the record deal)? Wallach: No. ... There were several people all at once who were interested in working with us and it was a little awkward because they're all friends with each other. And since we've been working with Pharrell we've stayed cool with everyone. ... We couldn't have gone wrong. CNN: Why do you think there's been all this interest from hip-hop producers? Drummey: We're the hottest rappers out. Wallach: I'm from Milwaukee, he's from Boston. They're both very diverse cities and we grew up with friends and all different kinds of music around us. So the records we make are inspired by a lot of different places. And certainly having grown up in the '90s, hip-hop is a part of the soundtrack for us and so it's very natural for us to have learned things from Dr. Dre or Pharrell and people like that. CNN: A lot of people compare your sound to the Beach Boys. How do you feel about that comparison? Drummey: I mean we're definitely better. And we came first too. So it's sort of a ridiculous comparison. CNN: Don't you play the theremin? Drummey: Yeah. Not well. Wallach: There are only a couple of people who play it at a virtuoso level. You'd have to really have something off to put the time in as a theremin artist. CNN: What has been the most surprising aspect of the music business so far? Wallach: I think the biggest surprise has been that people don't really know a hundred percent what they're doing. Everyone is trying to figure out how the music business is going to look in 10 years. And as a new artist there's not a blueprint. I figured you'd get signed and you're instantly on billboards. And the reality of it is that we find ourselves in a situation where all we can focus on is building our audience one person at a time. And it's just a brick-and-mortar, nose-to-the-grindstone process. CNN: What musicians do you admire as being fellow brainiacs? Wallach: Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails I think is really brilliant, not just on a musical level. Pharrell's been incredibly helpful and his advice is always really apt. Jay-Z. Really, when you're in the thick of it, anybody who's built a real career has something figured out. Or they got really lucky.","Chester French a duo of two Harvard grads .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- A 22-year-old medical student suspected of killing a woman he may have met through a Craigslist online ad was arraigned Tuesday and will be held without bail. Medical student Philip Markoff, 22, appears in court Tuesday in Boston, Massachusetts. Philip Markoff, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, listened intently but did not speak during the hearing in Boston Municipal Court. Dressed in a blue-striped shirt and slacks, Markoff was handcuffed and wearing leg irons. His attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is ""not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything."" A woman identifying herself as Markoff's fiancee also maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News. Megan McAllister said Markoff ""is the wrong man"" and ""was set up."" ""Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public,"" McAllister wrote. ""All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!"" She accused Boston police of ""trying to make big bucks by selling this false story to the TV stations. What else is new??"" Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley told reporters, ""This was a brutal, vicious crime -- savage. And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them."" A procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, Conley said. A Boston University spokeswoman said the school suspended Markoff, who has no criminal record, when it learned of the charges on Monday. Markoff is charged with killing 26-year-old Julissa Brisman of New York on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Evidence from the scene suggests that Brisman ""put up a fight,"" prosecutor Jennifer Hickman said during the hearing Tuesday. Police said Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service. She sustained blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of those bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said. Markoff is also charged in connection with the robbery four days earlier of a woman at a Westin Hotel. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items, and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, Hickman said in court Tuesday. Police said earlier the Westin victim was 29. She was not identified. Authorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters, and she was killed during a struggle. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.  Watch police say assailant has perused Craigslist ads » . Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who sought public assistance identifying the man. Police traced the Internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in Quincy, Massachusetts, he said. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and ""the case just begins to build from there."" ""This poor woman, Julissa Brisman, no matter what choices she made or decisions she made in life, she is a human being who's entitled to dignity and respect,"" Conley said. There may be more victims that authorities are unaware of, he said, adding that the prosecutor's goal is to hold Markoff accountable, not to pursue women who may be advertising on Craigslist. ""If you have been a victim like these victims have, please come forward,"" he said. Markoff is ""bearing up,"" according to attorney Salsberg. ""It's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him. ... He's pleaded not guilty. He is not guilty,"" said Salsberg. McAllister, in her e-mail to ABC, wrote, ""Philip is an intelligent man who is just trying to live his life, so if you could leave us alone we would greatly appreciate it. We expect to marry in August and share a wonderful, meaningful life together."" The couple's wedding Web site had been taken down or was unavailable as of Tuesday afternoon. Authorities in Boston are working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, on what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney said. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, McCartney said. He said no conclusions could be made yet, but allowed that the incident ""may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area."" Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster told CNN the company is ""horrified and deeply saddened that our community services have been associated in any way whatsoever with a crime of violence."" He promised that Craigslist will evaluate the incident to see if additional measures could be introduced to protect users. CNN's Mary Snow and Jason Kessler contributed to this report.","Not-guilty plea entered in Philip Markoff's behalf in woman's slaying in Boston .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Tino Schaedler is an architect-turned-digital design artist whose groundbreaking work has been seen in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" Tino Schaedler, Jean-Lucien Gay and Michael J. Brown talk about design, virtuality and the future . Schaedler's next film project is ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,"" a fantasy epic starring Jake Gyllenhaal and due in 2010. In 2007 he joined with Michael J. Brown and Jean-Lucien Gay to found NAU, a cross-disciplinary design collective positioned between architecture and film. CNN talked to Schaedler and his NAU colleagues, as well as collaborator Ken Leung, a graphic designer. CNN: You have said that graphic design is very powerful. Can you explain why? TS: I think graphic design, for us, is very important as it helps to break down very complex information into digestible, easy-to-understand buttons or whatever. In the world we're living in, we're flooded with information and need someone to almost kind of channel it and create signs that we can read. That's why I think graphic design becomes more important, the more complex our world becomes. CNN: Can you explain the work that NAU does? TS: NAU is a company that I founded with Michael and Jean-Lucien, friends from the architect firm I worked at. I guess we all wanted to collaborate, and me being interested in drifting back from the world of architecture to the world of film, I guess Michael and Jean-Lucien had something to offer. They usually take over the architectural side of things and I can be more free and visionary. I push them further with the kind of ideas I come up with and at the same time they make my ideas real. JLG: The idea was really to create a label, a structure that could cope with all the different locations that we're working from. It's also about the idea of remote collaboration. CNN: How important is it for you to collaborate with people? TS: For me, working with Ken has been like adding a whole new layer to the 3D worlds that I'm designing. I always liked the combination of high-end 3D graphics and subtle 2D graphics. I think for me, collaboration is also about creating situations that we'll both profit from. Also there are new tools we use that are a combination of Skype, video conferencing and Photoshop which allow you to do a video conference, which allow me to use a sketchpad that the other person can see. We can sketch correspondingly with each other and create something although we are not sitting in the same office. KL: Working with Tino, I've seen my work transformed into 3D. My background is print and magazines, so in this sense, things come alive, they move, it makes it real. CNN: How does architecture tie in with digital or 3D design? TS: You need two images and through the images you can interpolate the architectural spatial design which creates a 3D model... that technique also comes into film because it is photogrammetry, (a way of measuring 2D or 3D objects from photo-grammes or photographs as well as electronic imagery.) CNN: Didn't the makers of ""The Matrix"" use similar technology? TS: They basically just have the actress [Carrie-Ann Moss] up in the air and they take a photograph each at the same time so that's why she's in that movement... the camera moves around her but she doesn't move because its all different shots so you stretch the whole experience in two or three seconds. We're doing something similar on [the film] ""Prince of Persia"" that I've just finished. We record some action with five cameras... from these five images they recreate the actors as 3D objects and then project according to which angle. It's fascinating what kind of technology is out there. CNN: Can you define the relationship between working as architects and still working on a project like the Cocoon? MB: For us, it's less about the physical infrastructure that you are creating and more about the spaces and the experiences that you have there. In that sense I see a development of designers who are working across many media. CNN: Let's talk more about the Cocoon. What is it? TS: I actually had the idea for the Cocoon when I was walking down Oxford Street on a Saturday afternoon. We know how manic it can be when everyone is shopping. I thought it would be brilliant to have something like a telephone booth that could help me disappear from the madness and allow me to relax or walk through the Amazon or let me sleep under a starry sky or whatever. You also have to see it like a retreat, it's to chill out. MB: I think the important elements for us were to be able to ask, ""Can I communicate with this piece through physical actions that are not so much tied to moving my fingers across the keyboard, but are much more about how I walk down the street, how I wave to people."" How can I break down the barrier which is typically this sort of 2D screen between me and this digital world? CNN: Will we end up wired to computers and never see each other? KL: It's very different from gaming in the 80s. Then, you'd go to a computer game parlor and sit in a car for example. This is kind of taking it one step further, you're a bit more enclosed and the graphics are a lot better. I wouldn't be so daunted going into it. TS: For me, the true potential evolves more once the virtual information is completely freed from any medium that displays it. That's actually not far from the Cocoon because the next big step is the interface - if I can interact with something that's in front of me, I'm also using my body and that's also what the Cocoon is establishing. I see virtuality, once it's fully unfolded, as contributing to the slowing process that puts us back in tune with ourselves. CNN: What appeals to you most about the Cocoon project? KL: It's almost like being in your own virtual world. You see people with their iPods. They want to be in their own worlds, this is taking it one step further. But the good thing is you're using your whole body and almost becoming part of it. TS: I think [the Cocoon] frees virtuality from the computer. I've been dealing with this concept for probably ten years, because it was a big theme in architecture in the 90s. Everyone was afraid that architecture would disappear and be completely replaced by virtuality. I think it's got such amazing potential to make the world so much more exciting. When we think about our childhoods or watching ""Star Trek"" - seeing people being beamed - there's so much cool stuff and ideas... the future is now. CNN: Is the world ready for it? TS: I think it always takes some time to invent something, then for people to adapt it. I think with technology accelerating we also accelerate in the way that we adapt it so I think it's always no problem to get used to that and to enjoy it as well. CNN: What role do you see the Cocoon playing in the real world? TS: While working on the project, I read an article which talked about how in the future we would be much more limited in the way that we can physically travel. It will be a luxury to have a car or travel across countries and continents. It also mentioned that virtuality and Internet communication will be much more enhanced and will be even more importance. I think with the Cocoon and the technology that we propose in there, to travel to places, to work remotely, to have enhanced communication for remote shopping, will be even more important. Michael: For us the Cocoon is, I hope, the first step in trying to bring people a little bit more freedom from how they work and how they communicate. CNN: Do you think we're getting better at it? KL: I do. Personally, I loved the modernism of the 60s and 70s; everything was boiled down and focused on central points. Now we've got so many tricks with computers that we tend to go overboard, but I think the ideas are lacking and that people need to focus on the ideas first. I think we kind of share the same visual sensibility as well. Tino will send back a brief and I will send three options and we'll narrow it down from there. We work together quite well. CNN: Is it weird being together? TS: You know something like this always evolves. You start a project with certain expectations and I've had other collaborations that don't work that well and some where there's kind of a chemistry where things kind of create a synergy and something evolves that you would not be able to do yourself. CNN: Ken, where do you see the future of entertainment from your perspective, from print and magazines as entertainment, what's the future? KL: Well I think there is a future in magazines, I think people still want to have time and space from all the rush of the world. To me, when I'm on a plane, I'm happy because I'm not going to be interrupted by anyone and that's kind of the same with the Cocoon. I think its kind of getting away from reality; it's just the need to get your thoughts together.","Tino Schaedler, colleagues talk about NAU, a remote collaboration project .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A source close to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now confirms that Pelosi was told in February 2003 by her intelligence aide, Michael Sheehy, that waterboarding was actually used on CIA detainee Abu Zubaydah. Source says Nancy Pelosi didn't object about waterboard usage because she wasn't personally briefed about it. This appears to contradict Pelosi's account that she was never told waterboarding actually happened, only that the administration was considering using it. Sheehy attended a briefing in which waterboarding was discussed in February 2003, with Rep. Jane Harman, D-California, who took over Pelosi's spot as the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. This source says Pelosi didn't object when she learned that waterboarding was being used because she had not been personally briefed about it -- only her aide had been told. The source said Pelosi supported a letter that Harman sent to the administration at the time raising concerns. The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of matters discussed in classified intelligence briefings. Pelosi admits attending one briefing in September 2002, but at a news conference last month, she was adamant that she did not know waterboarding was used. ""At that or any other briefing, and that was the only briefing that I was briefed on in that regard, we were not -- I repeat, we were not -- told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used, "" Pelosi said on April 23. Some Republicans have called for Pelosi to testify at congressional hearings. The number two House Democrat -- Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland -- said Tuesday, ""I think the facts need to get out"" regarding what members of Congress had been told about harsh interrogations. But when asked whether Pelosi testifying would be appropriate, Hoyer did not directly answer the question, saying, ""The issue is what was done. If you don't have the facts pounded on the table, they (Republicans) are pounding on the table, or they are pounding on Speaker Pelosi. Take your pick. But they are doing so as a distraction, as a distraction from what was done in this case.""","Source says Nancy Pelosi was told by intelligence officer of waterboarding .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jay Leno plans ""something really unusual and different"" when he hands over ""The Tonight Show"" to Conan O'Brien on May 29, 17 years after Johnny Carson left the hosting duties to him. Jay Leno begins ""The Jay Leno Show"" in September. His last ""Tonight Show"" is May 29. But don't expect an emotional final show, since Leno and most of his staff are just moving across the NBC lot to produce a nightly prime time show debuting in September. The traditional desk, chair and guest sofa probably won't follow Leno to his 10 p.m. show, but many of his favorite comedy elements will, Leno said. Making people laugh before they go to bed is still the mission. ""To me, 10 o'clock is like the new 11:30,"" Leno said. ""I hear more and more people, even young people, say 'I can't stay up past 11. I car pool, I gotta get up at 6.' "" ""The Jay Leno Show"" will be competing against scripted dramas, not other comedians telling jokes, which Leno said should give him the edge over the long haul. ""When I was a kid, there was comedy all over TV, and it was fun to watch, whether it was Carol Burnett or any of the sitcoms,"" he said. ""You'd have a whole night of comedy, and now everything is very serious and it's all murder."" The new show will have famous guests, but they will not drive the ratings, Leno said. ""It's all about the joke material,"" he said. He will ""try to keep it moving"" with a longer monologue with dozens of jokes, he said. The last half-hour will be filled with comedy, he said. ""You look right in the camera, you directly talk to people as low-tech as possible, a little humor before people go to bed,"" he said. NBC's decision to put a talk-variety show on at 10 o'clock raised some complaints from affiliate station owners, worried the ratings wouldn't be strong enough to build an audience for their 11 o'clock local newscasts. The network's Boston affiliate briefly threatened to move its news to 10, pre-empting Leno. Leno, who grew up in Boston, said he understood the economics behind the concern. ""Although my job previous to this was to give a good lead-in to Conan, the job giving a good lead-in to the 11 o'clock news is really, really important,"" he said. ""That's really where our local affiliates make their money, is on the 11 o'clock news."" He doesn't expect to beat the dramas the first week out, but he noted those shows produce only about 22 new episodes a year. ""During those repeat weeks and whatever, we'll be live, fresh, original shows,"" Leno said. The last week of ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" will include a lot of looking back and ""best of"" segments, ""because that's easier than writing new stuff,"" Leno said. His guests Monday through Thursday include Mel Gibson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Wanda Sykes, Billy Crystal and Prince. Conan O'Brien will be on the final show, along with singer James Taylor. Taylor's songs were the last thing Leno heard on the radio when he left Boston in the late 1970s to start his career, so he wanted to have him as his last musical guest, he said. Leno hinted the last show would have some surprises. ""I have something really unusual and different planned,"" he said, ""Something really out of left field that we're going to end on."" Pressed for more hints, Leno said it was ""something really personal, something that has to do with show and staff."" ""I think it will make people smile,"" he said. Leno can smile as he moves on, having left the legendary show -- which has had only four hosts in 54 years -- as the top show for the past 16 years. "" 'The Tonight Show' is sort of the America's Cup of television, and you don't want to be the guy to screw it up,"" he said. If he fails in the new show, he will be all right, he said. ""If it didn't work out, then oh well, at least I have this.""","Jay Leno begins the prime-time ""Jay Leno Show"" in September .

"(CNN) -- Donald Trump will let Miss California USA Carrie Prejean keep her title despite controversy over seminude photos and charges by state pageant officials that she had abandoned her duties to devote time to opposition to same-sex marriage. Miss California USA Carrie Prejean caused controversy with remarks she made at the Miss USA pageant. Trump, no apprentice at turning a negative into positive publicity, brought several weeks of controversy to a conclusion at his New York headquarters Tuesday with winners all around. Trump said his Miss USA pageant stays ""so relevant,"" unlike the rival Miss America pageant seen only on a small cable channel. Prejean gained a national following that could help her post-pageant career.  Watch Prejean defend herself » . The Miss California USA organization has a beauty queen better known than the woman who won the Miss USA title -- Kristen Dalton of North Carolina. Celebrity bloggers, such as Perez Hilton, whose question to Prejean ignited the firestorm, gained a higher profile and more readers for their Web sites. And groups both for and against same-sex marriage gained energy for their fundraising and publicity campaigns. Prejean stepped into the limelight unexpectedly just over three weeks ago when she declared her opposition to same-sex marriage in response to a question asked during the national pageant by Hilton, a pageant judge.  Watch Hilton get dismissive » . Prejean finished as first runner-up, but it was not clear if her answer cost her the crown. ""He [Hilton] gave her very low marks,"" Trump said. ""It certainly didn't help."" Hilton, who is openly gay and a strong supporter of same-sex marriage, later posted a video rant online in which he called Prejean ""a dumb bitch."" This caught the national mainstream media's attention, and Hilton was invited to appear on TV shows to talk about it. Prejean -- with pageant approval -- also talked publicly about her same-sex marriage opposition. But when she appeared at a news conference for the National Organization for Marriage, a same-sex marriage opposition group, the controversy intensified. Lawyers for the Miss USA group demanded that NOM stop using video clips of the pageant in its TV ads. The controversy boiled to a new level last week when a photo of Prejean, wearing only pink panties but showing mainly a bare back, was published by gossip Web sites. Miss California USA officials -- some of them outspoken advocates of same-sex marriage -- suggested that the seminude photo breached the contract Prejean signed with the pageant. Her title might be taken away, they said.  Watch Miss California USA offficials scold Prejean » . These officials also complained they couldn't reach Prejean and she had missed important pageant events. They charged that their beauty queen had been hijacked by anti-same-sex marriage forces. But it was up to Trump, who bought the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants a decade ago, to decide what to do about Carrie Prejean. Trump united her with California pageant co-executive directors Shanna Moakler -- a former Playboy centerfold -- and Keith Lewis in his New York office Tuesday morning for a peacemaking session. It ended with hugs and smiles at Trump's news conference.  Watch Trump's announcement » . Those photos of a topless Prejean do not violate the contract she signed when entering the pageant competition, Trump said. ""Some were very beautiful,"" he said. ""Some were risque, but again, we're in the 21st century."" Trump praised Prejean for giving a ""very, very honest answer"" to a tough question during the pageant. ""It's the same answer that the president of the United States gave,"" he said. And he said he would not hesitate to invite Hilton back as a pageant judge, despite the firestorm he set off. ""He's doing his thing,"" Trump said. ""What's the big deal?"" ""We want tough questions,"" he said. ""We don't want to be in a position that Miss America is in that they're now on a small cable channel."" He noted that NBC recently extended the Miss USA and Miss Universe TV contracts for three years. Prejean said she has forgiven Hilton and the other critical bloggers. ""I willingly forgive them before all of you today,"" she told reporters. She said she was the victim of ""hateful attacks, despicable rumors and false allegations"" for exercising her freedom of speech, but the situation has given her a new message to carry as a role model to young people. ""Think about how much better our society would be if we could just agree to disagree and show respect,"" she said. As she resumes public appearances as Miss California USA, Prejean said she will not be an activist against same-sex marriage. ""I'm going to resume my duties as Miss California, but also stay true to who I am and have my own personal opinions,"" she said. ""We will see how we will balance the two.""","Carrie Prejean to keep title despite disputes over photos, duties .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Kyrgyzstan's decision to close a key U.S. military base is ""regrettable,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, but it won't affect the U.S. military effort in nearby Afghanistan. Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan serves as a U.S. supply route for troops and supplies into Afghanistan. On Friday, Russia announced it would assist the U.S. in transporting nonmilitary cargo to Afghanistan, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. The United States uses Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan as a route for troops and supplies into Afghanistan. Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev announced Tuesday that ""all due procedures"" were being initiated to close the base. ""It's regrettable that this is under consideration by the government of Kyrgyzstan, and we hope to have further discussions with them,"" Clinton told reporters Thursday after a meeting with French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner. ""But we will proceed in a very effective manner no matter what the outcome of the Kyrgyzstan government's deliberations might be."" Bakiyev made his announcement at a news conference in Moscow, Russia, following news reports of a multimillion-dollar aid package from Russia to Kyrgyzstan. Lavrov said on Russian television that his country intends to help get vital cargo -- but no weapons or troops -- to NATO troops in Afghanistan. The United States asked to transport the cargo through Russian territory to Afghanistan, Lavrov said. The U.S. military is planning to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to halt a resurgence of the Taliban. Gen. David Petraeus, who oversees U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central Asia, described Manas as having ""an important role in the deployment of these forces"" and in refueling aircraft. Senior State Department officials said the State and Defense departments are working with Kyrgyzstan to keep the lease to the base. The officials said the Kyrgyzstan government has not yet responded to an offer to renew the lease. Discussions are being conducted through the U.S. Embassy in Kyrgyzstan and relevant State Department and Pentagon bureaus, the officials said. One official said the United States has almost 18 months to renegotiate the lease before it expires and hopes Kyrgyzstan will reconsider their position. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell called Manas ""a hugely important air base."" ""It provides us with launching point to provide supplies in Afghanistan. We very much appreciate [Kyrgyz] support in using that base, and we hope to continue,"" he said at a daily news briefing earlier this week. Clinton said the Defense Department ""is conducting an examination as to how else we would proceed that will not affect whatever decisions we make."" Petraeus was in Kyrgyzstan last month, partly to lobby the government to allow the United States to keep using the base. He said he and Kyrgyz leaders did not discuss at all the possible closure of the base and said local officials told him there was ""no foundation"" for news reports about the issue. The mountainous former Soviet republic is Central Asia's second poorest country. The United States pays about $63 million a year for use of the base and employs more than 320 Kyrgyz citizens there, Petraeus said. The base has been in operation since December 2001 under U.N. mandate. The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported Tuesday that Russia would offer Kyrgyzstan a $300 million, 40-year loan at an annual interest rate of 0.75 percent, and write off $180 million in Kyrgyz debt. Kyrgyzstan also is home to a Russian military base, at Kant, that officially opened in 2003. Kyrgyz Prime Minister Igor Chudinov told Russian news agency Interfax it was coincidence that talk of the base closure comes at the same time as the loan. ""The Russian decision to grant a major loan has nothing to do with the pullout of the U.S. air base from the Kyrgyz territory,"" Chudinov said. The relationship between the United States and Kyrgyzstan was damaged when a U.S. airman killed a Kyrgyz citizen in December 2006. The airman was transferred out of Kyrgyzstan, and the dead man's family was offered compensation. Petraeus said in January an investigation into the death was being reopened. In announcing the base closure, Bakiyev said he was not satisfied with the inquiry and that his government's ""inability to provide security to its citizens"" was proving a serious concern.

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Fans of porn star Stormy Daniels are drafting her to run for the U.S. Senate seat in Louisiana now held by Republican Sen. David Vitter. And it's no racy gimmick, they say. Porn star Stormy Daniels, who has no party affiliation, says she's ""always up for a good fight."" The Draft Stormy Web site says that ""2010 presents the Pelican State with the opportunity to start with a clean slate -- to elect a representative that we can be proud of, who will work tirelessly, and who will challenge the status quo. We at the Draft Stormy campaign feel that Baton Rouge native Stormy Daniels is best suited to fulfill these duties."" Vitter is famous -- or infamous -- for his link to the ""D.C. Madam,"" the woman who ran a prostitution ring. Elected to the Senate in 2004, he admitted to ""a very serious sin in my past"" in July 2007 after his phone number turned up in records of an escort service run by the late Deborah Jeane Palfrey, known as the D.C. Madam. Running for re-election, Vitter said his wife has forgiven him and is banking on the same sentiment from his constituents. Will the Draft Stormy move mean stormy weather for Vitter? The senator's office didn't return calls by CNN. But a spokesman for the state GOP said voters ""are concerned with real issues that affect their everyday lives and not with political or publicity stunts."" The Draft Stormy campaign was started by New Orleans resident and Daniels fan Zack Hudson, who insists it's for real. Daniels, 29, isn't affiliated with a party but is embracing the idea of a possible candidacy.  Watch the adult entertainment star talk about a possible run » . She said she's planning a ""listening tour"" around Louisiana to talk about a range of matters, including the economy -- which along with women in business and protection of children are the three issues listed on her Web site. When told Vitter can be a tough opponent, she said she's ""always up for a good fight."" ""I think anyone that knows me ... is more than aware of that,"" Daniels said. ""Politics can't be any dirtier of a job than the one I am already in."" According to a capsule bio on the Draft Stormy Web site, Daniels has been ""breaking barriers and shattering glass ceilings her entire life,"" serving as editor of her high school newspaper and president of her school's 4-H Club and eventually transferring ""her determination and talents to the professional level, becoming a featured performer in the adult entertainment industry."" Another stride was ""signing an exclusive contract with the video production company Wicked Pictures, a company committed to a health and safety first policy, as pertaining to its video performances. Stormy's decision to sign with Wicked highlighted her commitment to sending a positive message to young people of the importance of practicing safe sex,"" the bio said. Daniels has directed films for the company, won awards for writing, directing and acting, and has appeared in mainstream films such as ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" ""Originally, the focus wasn't even about making me as a candidate,"" Daniels said. ""I think it was about bringing attention to the Senate race in general. Then the response was overwhelmingly positive. And I think everyone is just running with it."" While her political aspirations may be a light diversion for Louisiana voters, reality will set in if Daniels tangles with Vitter. Clancy DuBos, political director of the New Orleans alternative newspaper Gambit, said Vitter is a brilliant politician with a campaign war chest worth $2 million. If the Daniels campaign is meant to remind voters of Vitter's D.C. Madam link, the move could backfire, DuBos said. ""You are going to need someone better than a porn star, or a lap dancer, or a sex worker to nail David Vitter on this,"" he said. ""You need a serious opponent who is himself, or herself, not guilty of something like that to say, 'Let's talk about family values, shall we?' "" The Draft Stormy movement said Daniels' ""real world experience and special understanding of the economic hardships facing Louisianans and Americans make her uniquely qualified to take on the tough challenges we face. ""Our grass-roots movement spans the political spectrum and champions Stormy's philosophy of personal responsibility and the promotion of individual enterprise. We eschew partisanship and labels, instead judging our leaders on their integrity, character and effectiveness.""

"(CNN) -- French parachutist Michel Fournier vowed Tuesday to try again to launch a record-breaking skydive in August, hours after a ""freak"" accident over Canada aborted his second attempt to do so. Michel Fournier tests his equipment a few days before his attempt to break four world records. ""I'm not about to give up,"" the 64-year-old adventurer said of his shot at setting a world record for the highest jump and fastest, longest free fall by a man riding a balloon. Tuesday's attempt was thwarted when an electrical charge broke the cable connecting the balloon to the gondola, causing it to slip away from his ground crew and rise into the Saskatchewan skies over North Battleford. ""The question is, why was it electrically activated?"" said Michel Chevalet, a balloon expert working on Fournier's technical team. He suggested that static electricity may have been to blame but that it had been an unforeseen possibility. ""Unexpected freak accidents do happen,"" he said.  Watch report on Michel Fournier's failed free-fall quest » . Fournier said the failure came as a blow. ""It was like having a hammer over the head,"" he said.  Watch Fournier talk about trying again » . The former paratrooper had hoped his ""Big Jump"" would start 40 kilometers (25 miles) above the Earth's surface. But his hopes dissipated over the Canadian prairie shortly after 5 a.m. (7 a.m. ET), when the balloon took off before his capsule could be attached. Still clad in his bright yellow pressure suit, a visibly frustrated Fournier waved away cameras after his balloon's abrupt departure. It drifted back to the ground about 40 km away. Fournier says he spent nearly 12.7 million euros ($20 million) on his quest, a risky endeavor that French authorities refused to allow him to attempt over France. Canadian authorities approved the mission over the town of North Battleford, in sparsely populated Saskatchewan. The town's mayor, Julian Sadlowski, said Monday's failure was ""a disappointment."" ""I thought this was going to be the day that we saw history made in the Battlefords,"" he said. Balloon trouble also doomed Fournier's effort to break the record in 2003. Fournier holds the French record for the highest parachute jump at 12,000 meters (40,000 feet). He says his next chance is in August because that is when the jet stream will next be favorable. The ""Big Jump"" will collect data that will help astronauts and others survive at high altitudes, he says. Fournier estimated that Tuesday's failed effort cost him and his sponsors about 600,000 euros ($946,000).","NEW: Parachutist Michel Fournier promises to try record jump again .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Nearly a year after being beaten into a coma, Bryan Steinhauer said Wednesday he does not hate the Serbian basketball player witnesses said brutally assaulted him. Bryan Steinhauer, who was beaten into a coma, is making significant progress in his rehabilitation. ""I am not full of hate; hatred kills progress,"" he said. Appearing alongside his parents and doctors at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, Steinhauer struggled to speak but his message was clear. ""Please don't feel sorry for me,"" he said. ""Tragedy leads to wisdom, and this experience has taught me so much about life.""  Watch Steinhauer talk about his recovery » . The 22-year-old from Brooklyn was about to graduate and had a job lined up at accounting giant KPMG when he got into an argument last May that nearly cost him his life. According to police, witnesses said Steinhauer and college basketball player Miladin Kovacevic had exchanged harsh words at an upstate New York bar near Binghamton University after Steinhauer danced with the girlfriend of one of Kovacevic's friends. The witnesses said the fight went outside the bar, where several men attacked Steinhauer, with Kovacevic beating him about the head, according to police. Kovacevic is 6-foot-9 and 260 pounds while Steinhauer was 130 pounds. Kovacevic was arrested but jumped bail and fled to Serbia with the help of Serbian consular officials in New York. The case strained relations between the United States and Serbia.Hillary Clinton intervened, first as U.S. senator from New York and later as secretary of state, as did Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, to make sure Kovacevic was prosecuted. Serbia has no extradition treaty with the United States, but Serbian officials arrested Kovacevic last October and are working on prosecuting him with the assistance of the district attorney of Broome County, where the beating took place. In addition, the Serbian government recently paid the Steinhauer family $900,000 in recognition of the misconduct of Serbian government officials and the financial burdens placed upon the Steinhauer family as a result of the beating. Steinhauer awoke from his coma last August, three months after the beating that left him with skull fractures, a severe brain injury and no memory of the attack. He weighed less than 100 pounds, could not speak or walk, and was fed through a tube, doctors said Wednesday. ""He had hemorrhages and contusions affecting almost every lobe of his brain,"" said Dr. Brian Greenwald. Working with specialists and boosted by the support of his family, Steinhauer surprised even his doctors in his quick recovery, they said. He now has outpatient rehabilitation four times a week, goes to a gym, and receives acupuncture treatments. While he can eat on his own now and is making significant progress, Steinhauer continues to undergo intensive therapy. Steinhauer says he doesn't think about Kovacevic because he's not concerned about other people. ""I've had a second birth and raising at Mount Sinai,"" he said. ""Live long and prosper.""","Witnesses: Bryan Steinhauer was beaten into a coma by college basketball player .

"(CNN) -- A cancer treatment that comes in a pill is as effective as the standard chemotherapy for lung patients who had previously been treated for their cancer, according to a study released Thursday. The intravenous chemotherapy treatment had more severe side effects than the pill in this study. Results of a large clinical trial were published in the British medical journal The Lancet. The trial was designed to compare Iressa, a daily pill, to Taxotere, an IV-chemotherapy drug that's administered every three weeks. This international study included more than 1,400 patients for whom standard chemotherapy had been ineffective. ""Iressa and Taxotere have same survival outcomes,"" according to Dr. Edward Kim, lead author of the study and assistant professor in M.D. Anderson Cancer Center's Department of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology in Houston, Texas. The study was paid for by the maker of Iressa, AstraZeneca. Kim says the Food and Drug Administration mandated that the pharmaceutical company conduct this clinical trial. In the study, patients taking Iressa had an average survival of 7.6 months, and 32 percent survived one year, compared with patients getting the chemotherapy drug Taxotere. Their survival was an average of eight months; 34 percent of patients survived one year. Kim says this is the largest study in lung cancer comparing an oral therapy with chemotherapy. Dr. Bruce Johnson, a lung cancer specialist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, who was not involved in this research, says, ""this study did what it intended to do in showing equivalency. I can't imagine any clearer evidence."" One significant difference between the two drugs is in side effects. Patients taking Iressa mainly experienced skin rashes and/or mild diarrhea. Patients on Taxotere had many more severe side effects, including hair loss, numbness in hands and feet, severe diarrhea, a drop in blood cells and nausea. Given the difference, ""the single pill trumps chemotherapy,"" said Dr. Paul Bunn, who heads the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Research and also was not involved in the clinical trial. Johnson says that 5 to 10 percent of patients taking Taxotere will drop out every three weeks because of side effects. Kim points out that if the two treatments have the same survival benefit but one has fewer side effects and is easier to take, doctors want their patients to have the option for this treatment. Currently, no new lung cancer patients can get Iressa, because doctors are no longer allowed to prescribe it. In 2003, Iressa got fast-track FDA approval as a treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, specifically for patients in whom standard chemotherapy had failed. The approval was based on two small phase II clinical trials that showed Iressa was able to shrink tumors by about 10 percent, which led the FDA to believe that the drug would lead to a ""positive effect on survival or benefits."" More on Iressa from the FDA . When the FDA gives a drug accelerated approval, it requires that the manufacturer continue testing it to determine whether there's a clinical benefit to the patient. If further studies can't show this type of benefit, the FDA has the power to withdraw that drug from the market. But a year later, results were revealed from a larger, phase III clinical trial that compared Iressa with placebo in patients for whom chemotherapy was ineffective. ""Iressa was better but not statistically significant,"" said Bunn, who also directs the University of Colorado Cancer Center. Given this information and because another lung cancer pill -- Tarceva -- had shown a survival benefit, the FDA decided that "" it is not reasonable to start new patients on Iressa."" Since 2005, the FDA allows only those already getting Iressa prescribed or those enrolled in clinical trials that were under way at the time to continue taking Iressa. All three lung cancer experts CNN spoke with regularly see patients and have treated them with Iressa or the other available lung cancer drugs. All said they couldn't predict whether the FDA would allow new patients to be treated with Iressa based on this and other recent studies. Kim believes that based on this data, Iressa ""is a valid treatment option for patients with pretreated non-small lung cancer."" Both Bunn and Johnson say that more choices in treatment will always benefit the patients.","Study compared pill Iressa and IV-chemotherapy drug Taxotere .

"(CNN) -- When pitcher Josh Faiola walks out of the dugout on opening day with the Lake Erie Crushers, he'll already have a large group of fans in the stands -- his new roommates at the Belvedere of Westlake assisted living facility. Pitcher Josh Failoa stands as residents and friends of The Belvedere of Westlake welcome him Tuesday. The 25-year-old, who was drafted in 2006 by the Baltimore Orioles and is trying to work his way to the majors, admits he was caught a little off guard when he was told about his new housing situation. ""At first I was like, 'OK, that's a little different,' "" he said. ""I was taken aback at first."" And he was also the butt of a couple jokes from his teammates. ""They were saying things like 'So what's the deal? Do you have to go to bed early?' "" Faiola said. But then he told them about his room -- a large suite, with his own kitchenette, washer and dryer, furniture and a TV. ""Then they changed their tune,"" he said. ""They were like 'That's awesome. Are they any other vacancies?' "" Like many of the players in the independent Frontier League who don't rake in the big bucks, Faiola is living with a host family. But his host family is a little different. Most of the players live with families with younger children. But in his case, Faiola is the young one -- about 55 years younger than the rest of his ""roommates."" Eighty-four-year-old Meda Dennis, who has been living in the center for four years, said Faiola's arrival is the most exciting thing to happen since a good Elvis impersonator showed up. ""It's been quite exciting because he's young and new and interesting and we're old,"" she joked. Faiola made his way to the assisted living center in Westlake, Ohio, near Cleveland, with the help of Cindy Griffiths-Novak. She heard the new local baseball team was looking for host families for the players. But because she has a 3- and 4-year-old at home, she turned to her family's assisted living center as an option for Faiola. Griffiths-Novak went to the residents with the idea and they unanimously voted for Faiola to live there. But his new housing situation is about more than just a place to crash after the game. ""It certainly is great for the residents because now we get a lot of energy and youth and excitement,"" Griffiths-Novak said. It has turned into an exciting time for the residents, who jumped at the chance to decorate the entire facility before the pitcher's arrival. ""You should see the decorations,"" Griffiths-Novak said. ""The residents all signed motivational good luck pennants for him, there's a 40-foot banner, we have a whole thing dedicated to Josh. I'm sure he is so embarrassed with all of the baseball cards with their face on it."" They've made signs telling him he's in a league of his own, but they've also set their expectations high for him. ""Some of the pendants say things like 'Don't get cut, move your butt,' "" Griffiths-Novak said. ""He's certainly going to be under the microscope! We'll be watching and keeping track of all of his stats."" Faiola was awestruck when he walked in and saw all of the decorations. The activity director has been doing craft activities with the residents -- making visors with baseball logos and Crushers necklaces in anticipation of the game. Dennis is looking forward to watching their new ace pitcher hit the mound even though she hasn't seen a baseball game live in a while. ""Anything's better than the Indians right now,"" Dennis joked. ""We'll definitely be cheering for him, though, and if he happens to have a bad game, he'll have a lot of shoulders to cry on. But I don't think he'll need them."" Norma J. Lane, 85, said even though she's more of a football fan, she's looking forward to following Faiola and baseball more closely. ""We are just wishing him well because it's such a great experience for all of us,"" Lane said. ""We're looking forward to having him around."" Faiola said he is excited to help bring some fun to the residents, some of whom are already considering him to be like a grandson. ""I always loved spending time with my grandparents and one of my great-grandparents was in an assisted living home and I remember how excited she was to see us when we went to visit her,"" he said. ""And they are being so nice to open up this place to me, so hopefully I can bring a little bit of joy."" Faiola, who had surgery two years ago and was dropped from the Orioles during spring training, is hoping his stint with the Crushers can help get him picked up by a Major League team. Regardless of what happens, he knows he has the support of his new roommates. ""They've all really come out and supported me, they even bring me food and give me snacks,"" he said. ""I couldn't ask for anything better. And with all of them watching so closely, I'll have to keep my game up. They've definitely set a high bar for me.""","Because of little pay in independent league, players stay with host families .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The mother of the co-pilot who died in a plane crash near Buffalo, New York, in February, said Thursday that her daughter and the pilot were ""being used as a scapegoat."" Lynn Morris says she was shocked at how her daughter, the plane's co-pilot, was portrayed in the NTSB hearings. Lynn Morris' daughter, First Officer Rebecca Shaw, was among the 50 people killed in the crash of the plane, operated by Colgan Air. Morris made the comments on the final day of investigative hearings held by the National Transportation Safety Board. ""I think I walked out of the hearings in shock, because I truly felt that both she and the captain were being used as a scapegoat,"" Morris said. Testimony from the hearings, which began Tuesday, revealed that fatigue may have contributed to the failure of Shaw and Colgan Air Capt. Marvin Renslow to save the plane as it approached Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Testimony on Wednesday indicated that crews on a number of airlines could be suffering from lack of sleep. Many crews live far from their base of operations, causing them to come to work already tired from travel, NTSB investigators said. Renslow had nearly a full day off before assuming command of Continental Connection Flight 3407. Yet the NTSB investigation found he slept in the Newark Airport crew lounge -- against Colgan Air regulations. The airline, though, appears not to have been enforcing that rule. ""Nobody argues that the human body needs to have its rest, and sometimes it doesn't gel with the schedules of an airline,"" testified Capt. Rory Kay, executive air safety chairman for the Air Line Pilots Association.  Watch hearing address issues of crew fatigue » . NTSB board member Kitty Higgins said the Colgan policy ""is that they're not to sleep in the crew room, but it turns out they are sleeping in the crew room."" Daniel Morgan, Colgan's vice president for flight safety, said, ""People can come in between their flights to take a nap."" Asked if napping was considered sleeping, he replied, ""That's a definition I'm probably not prepared to answer."" A nap of about 10 to 20 minutes can be restorative for most people, Dr. Michael Silber, a co-director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told the clinic's monthly ""Women's HealthSource"" publication last year. However, a longer nap can make people feel groggy, Silber said for the publication's October issue. Shaw had three days off before the flight. She commuted through the night from Seattle, Washington, catching rides on connecting Fed Ex flights to get to Newark, New Jersey, where the Colgan flight originated. ""It is shocking. It's hard to believe that it is allowed to go on,"" said Kathy Johnson, whose husband, Kevin, died in the crash. She said Wednesday she was furious that the crew may have been functioning on little sleep.  Watch family members question pilot training standards » . The NTSB, which has not issued its report on the February 12 crash, said it scheduled the hearings to gather information. The plane plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, killing everyone on board and a man on the ground. The NTSB's preliminary investigation determined there was some ice accumulation on the Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 aircraft, but the ""icing had a minimal impact on the stall speed of the airplane."" On Thursday, safety board member Deborah Hersman questioned why Renslow and Shaw apparently didn't notice, as they approached the Buffalo airport, that the plane's speed had abruptly dropped from 207 mph to 150 mph (from 180 to 130 knots). She asked R. Key Dismukes, chief scientist for the NASA division that focuses on human-centered design and operations, whether this was a period in every flight that is a time of high workload for the crew, meaning their attention may have been diverted. Dismukes noted that there was a lot going on, including conversations between Renslow and Shaw and communication with a control tower. ""That certainly didn't help the workload situation,"" Dismukes said. ""There were a number of concurrent tasks, and this is a vulnerable period. No questions about it."" Hersman said she had seen the same failure to note a drastic, quick change in speed in other crashes. She suggested that the crew receive an alert in those cases. ""I think an alert that your air speed is deteriorating is kind of like a fire alarm,"" Hersman said. On Wednesday, it was revealed that Renslow, in his Colgan Air job application, failed to reveal two pilot exam failures. The crew also violated a rule that requires cockpit conversation to be focused on the flight. At Tuesday's hearing, Colgan Air acknowledged that Renslow had never trained on the ""stick pusher"" emergency system in a flight simulator. The system warns pilots when the plane's speed is too slow. But in a written statement, the carrier said both Renslow and Shaw had received other specific training on how to handle situations like those that preceded the crash.

"(CNN) -- A Belgian city has decided to go ""veggie"" for a day in an effort to highlight the environmental and health costs of eating meat. Stock breeding is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. The city authorities in Ghent, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Brussels, have declared Thursdays ""Veggie Day,"" (Veggiedag) and are asking residents to get involved and opt for vegetarian meals at least one day a week. It says Ghent is the first city in Europe to try such a scheme. According to the city's campaign publicity, eating less meat can help to minimize the ecological footprint of your food because stock breeding has a detrimental impact on the environment. It points to data from the United Nations which says livestock is responsible for generating around 18 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. It is also hoped that Veggie Day will have a positive health impact in the fight against diet-related illnesses such as obesity, cancer and diabetes. On Wednesday organizers provided residents with meat-free recipes and a list of vegetarian restaurants at a ""launch party"" in the center of the city. Ghent claims to have more vegetarian eateries per inhabitant than Paris, London and Berlin. Demonstrations were also on offer to people looking for green cooking tips.","Thursdays will be declared ""Veggie Days"" in Ghent .

"MARDAN, Pakistan (CNN) -- Inside a hospital ward in northwest Pakistan, I found myself surrounded by sobs and screams. One scream was so high-pitched that I didn't think it was human. These were the sounds of agony, and they belonged to innocent civilians who were injured in the cross fire of Pakistani troops and the Taliban in the Swat Valley. CNN's Reza Sayah with Shaista, who lost most of her family in an explosion as they fled fighting. Behind each cry at this ward was a story of loss. Doctors told me no one here had lost more than Shaista, an 11-year-old girl who watched as an explosion instantly killed most of her family. Shaista and her family were among hundreds of thousands of people who fled Pakistan's Swat Valley on the day the Pakistani Army launched an all-out offensive against the Taliban.   She says she was walking along a road with her family when a mortar shell suddenly fell from the sky. ""We were coming,"" Shaista told me, ""then my mother died, my brother died, and my two sisters also died.""  Watch Reza Sayah's interview with Shaista » . Doctors said the explosion shattered Shaista's foot. Moments later she passed out. The next time she woke up she was in the female orthopedic ward of the GHQ Hospital in Mardan.   Doctors said Shaista will recover from her shattered foot, but the trauma of losing a family will last a lifetime. ""She kept saying it all happened in front of me,"" said Salma Shaheen, a nurse. ""She said something fell on top of my mother and she got cut in half."" It was clear that Shaista had won over the hearts of the doctors and nurses who said that they, in three days, had treated more than 800 civilians injured in the battle zone. Like many hospitals in northwest Pakistan, this one was under equipped. To hold an elderly woman's broken leg together, doctors had made a make shift traction using a brick, a plastic shopping bag and rope.  Watch Reza Sayah's report from inside the hospital » .

""I'm just going to tell her, 'you're my daughter,'"" said Muhammad. ""I'm going to educate her, teach her the Koran and do what I can for her."" Sixty miles away from the hospital, the battle between Pakistani troops and the Taliban raged on. On Wednesday General Athar Abbas, the army's top spokesman, told CNN the troops were making significant progress but the most intense stage of the fighting in the battle zones' most populated areas was still to come -- a near guarantee of more sobs and screams at area hospitals.","CNN's Reza Sayah meets Shaista in a crowded hospital in northwest Pakistan .

Many watching Thursday night's ""Daily Show"" on Comedy Central felt that comedian-turned-media-critic Jon Stewart held bombastic financial guru and CNBC ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer's feet to the fire. And Cramer flinched. Stewart, known for his zany, satirical take on the news, was serious as he took Cramer's network to task for what Stewart viewed as their ""cheerleading"" of corporations at the heart of the nation's current economic crisis. And despite the title of his financial show, Cramer came off as less mad and more apologetic.  Watch Stewart vs. Cramer » . ""If it was a prize fight, they would have stopped it,"" said Howard Kurtz, the ""Washington Post"" media critic and host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" ""I was stunned that Jim Cramer kind of did a rope-a-dope strategy and didn't really defend himself against Jon Stewart's assault."" Kurtz is very familiar with the style of both men. He has appeared on ""The Daily Show"" and is the author of ""The Fortune Tellers: Inside Wall Street's Game of Money, Media and Manipulation,"" in which Cramer is featured. Kurtz said Stewart ""made clear at the outset that he wasn't going for laughs"" and displayed very much the same passion for holding the media accountable as he did when he appeared on, and denounced, CNN's ""Crossfire."" Watch the debate on ""Reliable Sources"" ""When I went on [Stewart's] show last year, he was so wound up in ripping the media that he went on for another 10 minutes, knowing full well that we were out of time,"" Kurtz said. ""Stewart, as funny as he can be, is a very trenchant media critic who cares passionately about this stuff, and we saw that Thursday night."" iReporter David Seaman of New York said he was surprised at the vigor with which Stewart ""attacked Cramer's credibility."" Check out David's iReport . The public wants answers as to how the country got into such financial distress, and viewers really want someone to answer for the mess, Seaman said. ""People want to see a lot of the financial gurus on a shish kabob, being skewered,"" Seaman said. ""It's really important to hold people accountable, and as we saw last night, Jon Stewart is a bit of a wild card, so if you aren't living up to expectations, he may call you out."" David Brancaccio, host and senior editor of ""Now on PBS,"" commended Cramer for his bravery in going on the show, though he said he was surprised that the brilliant founder of TheStreet.com seemed ill-prepared for Stewart's very thoughtful questioning. Brancaccio, the former host of American Public Media's ""Marketplace"" radio program, echoed the comments of many in that he found the exchange visibly uncomfortable for the usually showman-like Cramer. ""You have the comedian as journalist, and you have the financial journalist as clown, in that on his show, Cramer's goofing around and plays the clown,"" Brancaccio said. ""What a role reversal."" Brancaccio said Stewart's show has emerged as an important vehicle for media criticism. Thursday night's show marked an important moment in journalism, especially financial reporting, Brancaccio said. ""It's really important that tough questions are asked, because when tough questions aren't asked, we end up with Enron,"" he said. ""It's interesting that the tough questions came from Jon Stewart, brilliant comedian that he is."" Brancaccio thinks the episode may serve as a cautionary tale for those in the media who don't do their due diligence. White House approves of smackdown . ""I don't think any financial journalist wants to be in Cramer's position,"" Brancaccio said. ""I think [journalists] may redouble their efforts to be dispassionate reporters asking the tough questions."" Steve Krakauer is associate editor of TVNewser.com, one of the leading blogs about the television news industry, and said comments at his site have been mixed about the show. Although some thought it was one of the best interviews they had ever seen, others found Stewart arrogant and said his outrage might have been a bit staged. Krakauer said the question now is where Cramer -- who has said he plans to make some changes to his show -- goes from here. Krakauer said he doubts that there will be a complete overhaul of ""Mad Money."" ""I can't see things drastically changing,"" Krakauer said. "" 'Mad Money' is one of the most successful shows on CNBC. Despite what has been written about Jim Cramer, the things he's gotten incorrect and the calls he has made, he's still popular and one of the most entertaining for people who are interested in that type of financial news."" If anything, Cramer's appearance on ""The Daily Show"" may have just stoked the flames. Comedy Central's Web site played it up with clips from the show that it called ""an historic moment in basic cable."" The topic is such a hot one that Kurtz will lead ""Reliable Sources"" with it Sunday, with journalist Tucker Carlson, radio show host Stephanie Miller and ""Baltimore Sun"" television critic David Zurawik as guests. ""Beyond the entertainment value, and we are not above that, this is a really important moment for holding financial journalists accountable,"" Kurtz said. ""It may have taken Jon Stewart to blow the whistle on some of the hype and shortsightedness at America's top business news channel, but those failings were repeated throughout the business press, which stumbled badly in reporting on what turned into a huge financial meltdown.""","Critics and viewers see Stewart as victor after interview with ""Mad Money"" host .

"(CNN) -- Three years ago, the film based on Dan Brown's novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" was the focus of protest and controversy, with a Vatican archbishop calling for a boycott and Catholics at many levels refuting plot points. From left, actors Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer and Ewan McGregor join director Ron Howard at the film's premier. But when it comes to the new film based on a Brown novel, ""Angels & Demons,"" star Tom Hanks says talk of controversy is much ado about nothing. ""Everybody is looking for some scandal whether a scandal exists or not,"" Hanks said of the film. ""I think a kind of natural reaction is now that somehow because it's the second Robert Langdon mystery that there is some degree of controversy over it. And there is really not."" The movie ventures into similar waters as its predecessor, ""The Da Vinci Code,"" with Hanks reprising the role of Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbology expert, and conspiracy theories galore.  Watch Hanks talk aboout the controversy » . It also reunites the Academy Award-winning actor with director Ron Howard, who helmed ""Da Vinci,"" and teams Hanks with actor Ewan McGregor and Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer. While ""The Da Vinci Code"" centered on the complex investigation of a murder in the Louvre and the theory that a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene produced descendants, the new film features a murder at the Vatican and a secret and powerful society known as the ""Illuminati."" McGregor,  known for his role as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the ""Star Wars"" films, said that while ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels & Demons"" are inextricably linked, the latter can stand on its own. ""If I thought [Angels & Demons] was pinned to 'The Da Vinci Code' in some way then it would've been a lesser script to read and it wasn't,"" McGregor said. ""It's a standalone movie ... it's not relevant whether you've seen 'Da Vinci Code' or not."" Both films, like the Brown novels they're based on, have been met with criticism for their melding of history and storytelling. ""I have a strong objection to the genre of mixing fact with fiction,"" said Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League. ""You've got [Dan] Brown, [Ron] Howard and [Tom] Hanks in the movie all alleging that the Illuminati was this secret society which was brutalized by the Catholic Church in the 1600s."" ""It's all a lie,"" Donohue said. ""[The Illuminati] never even existed until May 1, 1776, but they have to pitch it back into the 1600s so they can trot out their favorite victim, Galileo. What happens is you get the audience thinking 'Well, maybe it's not all true, but probably some of it is true.' "" Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide and the Christian Film & Television Commission, first issued an advisory alert about the film in April and reiterated it days before the movie's May 15 release. ""Now that we've previewed 'Angels & Demons,' Movieguide has decided to keep in effect our caution alert,"" Baehr said. ""Faith is often denied throughout the movie."" Director Howard wrote in the The Huffington Post that he believes Donohue is on a mission ""to paint me and the movie I directed, 'Angels & Demons,' as anti-Catholic,"" a claim Howard emphatically denies. The director told CNN that he attempted to reach out to the Catholic Church regarding the film, but had no success. He also downplayed reports that Rome and the Vatican tried to hinder filming. Hanks said shooting the movie in the ancient city was complicated given the vibrancy of Rome. At one point, Hanks said, make-believe collided with one woman's fairy tale. ""We had a lady showing up who was getting married at the Pantheon and she had to get married and we had to get our shot,"" Hanks said. ""She showed up right between shots, when we were moving cameras."" Fortunately, both the wedding and the day's filming were able to be completed, Hanks said. McGregor said Howard was to be credited for how well the production came together. Howard's background as an actor undoubtedly helped enhance the actors' performances, McGregor said. ""A lot of directors are able to tell you what they're after, but Ron's able to tell you what he's after and help you for how you might play that ... which is kind of total directing,"" McGregor said. Zurer said she had a blast being the only female lead in the film. Viewers should see the film for what it is, she said, and not focus on the controversy. ""It's fun fiction,"" she said. ""It's a fun movie to watch, it's thrilling and that's what I saw in it.""

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Taliban suicide bomb squad disguised as regular Afghan army troops stormed a strategic city close to the border with Pakistan Tuesday, prompting a fierce six-hour battle with U.S. troops, local officials and the U.S. military said. A U.S. soldier on patrol in Khost province in February 2009. The insurgents attacked a municipal building in the center of the city of Khost, a U.S. military spokesman said. At least 10 suicide bombers were killed in the attacks, which also left five troops and four civilians dead, Afghan police said. Local police chief Abdul Qayum Baqee Zoi told CNN the attacks, which ended at 4:30 p.m. involved 10 Taliban suicide bombers in Afghan National Army uniforms and explosive vests. Seven detonated and three were shot dead. A U.S. military spokesman said the city -- a hotbed of Taliban activity --remained volatile as reports of running battles, kidnappings and fatalities surfaced. The developments came shortly after the United States announced it was changing its military leadership in Afghanistan, replacing Gen. David McKiernan with Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a former special operations chief. Tuesday's fighting began when U.S. forces responded to a suicide bomber at a government compound in the city and came under heavy attack, the U.S. military spokesman said. Officials in Khost told CNN that insurgents attacked the municipal building, and the police chief there said attackers killed two police officers, two security guards and two civilians in that incident. A Taliban spokesman in Afghanistan earlier told CNN 30 Taliban fighters were involved in the attack, and confirmed they were suicide bombers wearing explosive vests. The U.S. military spokesman said U.S. troops killed several militants but had to fall back. A U.S. quick reaction force from a nearby base was called in, entering the city with U.S. ground forces, he said. The spokesman said additional Taliban suicide bombers then entered government buildings, killing additional Afghans.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Liu Yan, regarded as China's top classical dancer, was to give the performance of a lifetime: She was to dance a solo at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Liu, in red, performs on the 2008 Beijing Television Chinese New Year Festival Show. She was to perform a dance entitled ""Silk Road,"" a piece intended to convey the rich cultural history of China. But it never happened. Twelve days before she was to take the stage at the Olympics, in an event that China hoped would catapult the nation to international glory, she fell while rehearsing the dance -- leaving her paralyzed from the waist down. ""When the music stopped, I made my exit as usual. I was dancing on a thin layer of electrical mat, I was standing on that, and there was a platform powered by a vehicle moving underneath,"" Liu said from the Beijing 306 Military Hospital. ""Right when I stepped on the platform, it moved away quickly ... then, like that, I fell.""  Watch more on Liu » . ""It was extremely painful."" Liu, who was knocked unconscious, was later told she would never walk again. Doctors operated on her for six hours, and the hospital where she was being treated was near the Bird's Nest -- the landmark national stadium built for the Games. The stadium can be seen from Liu's hospital room window. ""I could not see it, because I was unable to sit up. But then, I could see the fireworks from the rehearsal,"" Liu said through tears. She did not watch the opening ceremony. ""I was afraid to watch it,"" she said. ""I was listening to Lisa Ono (a bossa nova singer) with the volume up to the highest on the stereo that used to be here in the corner. But, I watched it later."" Liu began attending the Beijing Dance Academy in 1993. She spent 10 years studying professional dancing, and classical Chinese dance was her major. She repeatedly received the annual Best Student award and went on to win gold awards in the national dancing competition in 2004, the Lotus Dancing competition and the first Asian Youth Art Festival. She also won many top cultural awards in China for dance plays. ""When I was young, I was the kind of child who studied dancing very hard. I never gave up. I love dancing very much. When practicing some dancing movements, which other students considered boring, I saw the practice as very interesting,"" she said. ""People thought that I took dancing very seriously because of my love for it, but I think it's very interesting."" Apart from the physical pain, Liu said: ""The damage on my dancing career is the most painful part for me."" ""I think this is very sad. But I am injured and it is a fact that cannot be changed. But I believe I will keep dancing or at least doing work related to that, because that is what I love."" Liu said she spends most of her time recovering in the hospital, exercising her legs to help develop her muscles. She said she feels much better now but it is still tough. ""I often cry. After I got injured, I feel fragile every time I reflect on the past. But I think of it as a process,"" she said. ""I will learn to face the reality rationally. Human hearts are made of flesh; it is not one flat surface. The important thing is how you adjust yourself."" She has since started to return to her normal life. ""For example, going back home and staying overnight, going out with friends for dinner, even going to see a show, a movie, drink coffee, drink Champagne, going back to classes."" Liu does not blame anyone for the accident, saying that in big events, ""accidents happen."" ""I think you should not blame one person, or one particular moment,"" she said. ""I think I will use the word 'unfortunate.' I was very unfortunate to have that accident."" She also said she did not know about reports her family and witnesses to the accident were told not to talk about what happened afterward. ""That probably happened. I didn't know about it back then and I didn't really care. I was in the middle of an operation that lasted six hours."" As for the future, Liu said she might go back to school, to learn more about dance, and get a master's or a doctorate degree. ""Healthy dancers practice every day, I will do the same. This is how I am different from other patients -- I believe that I will recover when I do my exercise. I will live with hope.""","Liu Yan is paralyzed while rehearsing her solo dance for the Olympics' opening .

"Editor's note: The Rev. Robert Barron is Francis Cardinal George Professor of Faith and Culture at Mundelein Seminary and author of several books, including ""Eucharist,"" ""Word on Fire: Proclaiming the Power of Christ"" and ""The Priority of Christ: Toward a Post-Liberal Catholicism."" Barron is the director of WordOnFire.org, a global media ministry based in Chicago, Illinois. For another view on this topic, read here. The Rev. Robert Barron says celibacy sets the priest apart as a symbol of the world to come. (CNN) -- The scandal surrounding the Rev. Alberto Cutie has raised questions in the minds of many concerning the Catholic Church's discipline of priestly celibacy. Why does the church continue to defend a practice that seems so unnatural and so unnecessary? There is a very bad argument for celibacy, which has appeared throughout the tradition and which is, even today, defended by some. It goes something like this: Married life is spiritually suspect; priests, as religious leaders, should be spiritual athletes above reproach; therefore, priests shouldn't be married . This approach to the question is, in my judgment, not just stupid but dangerous, for it rests on presumptions that are repugnant to solid Christian doctrine. The biblical teaching on creation implies the essential integrity of the world and everything in it. Genesis tells us that God found each thing he had made good and that he found the ensemble of creatures very good. Catholic theology, at its best, has always been resolutely, anti-dualist -- and this means that matter, the body, marriage and sexual activity are never, in themselves, to be despised. But there is more to the doctrine of creation than an affirmation of the goodness of the world. To say that the finite realm in its entirety is created is to imply that nothing in the universe is God. All aspects of created reality reflect God and bear traces of the divine goodness -- just as every detail of a building gives evidence of the mind of the architect -- but no creature and no collectivity of creatures is divine, just as no part of a structure is the architect. This distinction between God and the world is the ground for the anti-idolatry principle that is reiterated from the beginning to the end of the Bible: Do not turn something less than God into God. Isaiah the prophet put it thus: ""As high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are my thoughts above your thoughts and my ways above your ways, says the Lord."" And it is at the heart of the First Commandment: ""I am the Lord your God; you shall have no other gods besides me."" The Bible thus holds off all the attempts of human beings to divinize or render ultimate some worldly reality. The doctrine of creation, in a word, involves both a great ""yes"" and a great ""no"" to the universe. Now there is a behavioral concomitant to the anti-idolatry principle, and it is called detachment. Detachment is the refusal to make anything less than God the organizing principle or center of one's life. Anthony de Mello looked at it from the other side and said ""an attachment is anything in this world -- including your own life -- that you are convinced you cannot live without."" Even as we reverence everything that God has made, we must let go of everything that God has made, precisely for the sake of God. This is why, as G.K. Chesterton noted, there is a tension to Christian life. In accord with its affirmation of the world, the Church loves color, pageantry, music and rich decoration (as in the liturgy and papal ceremonials), even as, in accord with its detachment from the world, it loves the poverty of St. Francis and the simplicity of Mother Teresa. The same tension governs its attitude toward sex and family. Again, in Chesterton's language, the Church is ""fiercely for having children"" (through marriage) even as it remains ""fiercely against having them"" (in religious celibacy). Everything in this world -- including sex and intimate friendship -- is good, but impermanently so; all finite reality is beautiful, but its beauty, if I can put it in explicitly Catholic terms, is sacramental, not ultimate. In the biblical narratives, when God wanted to make a certain truth vividly known to his people, he would, from time to time, choose a prophet and command him to act out that truth, to embody it concretely. For example, he told Hosea to marry the unfaithful Gomer in order to sacramentalize God's fidelity to wavering Israel. Thus, the truth of the non-ultimacy of sex, family and worldly relationship can and should be proclaimed through words, but it will be believed only when people can see it. This is why, the Church is convinced, God chooses certain people to be celibate. Their mission is to witness to a transcendent form of love, the way that we will love in heaven. In God's realm, we will experience a communion (bodily as well as spiritual) compared to which even the most intense forms of communion here below pale into insignificance, and celibates make this truth viscerally real for us now. Though one can present practical reasons for it, I believe that celibacy only finally makes sense in this eschatological context. For years, the Rev. Andrew Greeley argued -- quite rightly in my view -- that the priest is fascinating and that a large part of the fascination comes from celibacy. The compelling quality of the priest is not a matter of superficial celebrity or charm. It is something much stranger, deeper, more mystical. It is the fascination for another world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the Rev. Robert Barron.","The Rev. Robert Barron: Why does Church back practice that seems unnecessary?
He says he rejects the ""marriage is spiritually suspect"" defense of celibacy .
But celibacy sets the priest apart as a symbol of another world, he says ."
