"(CNN) -- A black Louisiana teenager at the center of the racially charged ""Jena 6"" case was ordered Thursday to spend 18 months in a juvenile facility, after a judge ruled he had violated his probation for earlier juvenile convictions, a source with knowledge of the court proceedings said. Supporters joined Mychal Bell after he was released from jail last month. Mychal Bell, 17, who was freed two weeks ago after his adult criminal conviction for beating a white classmate was overturned, was sent to the Renaissance Home for Youth in Alexandria, Louisiana, the source said. The decision came at the end of a two-day juvenile court hearing that was closed to the media and public. Carol Powell-Lexing, one of Bell's attorneys, said the judge's decision would be appealed. Bell was freed on $45,000 bail on September 27, after an appeals court threw out his conviction on battery and conspiracy charges in adult court and remanded the case to juvenile court. But Judge J.P. Mauffrey agreed with prosecutors that Bell had violated the probation he was given for four previous juvenile offenses, including two simple battery charges, the sources said. Bell had been placed on probation until he turned 18. Civil rights activist Al Sharpton, who has championed Bell's case, denounced Thursday's decision as ""revenge"" by the judge and called on Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco to intervene. Demonstrators in September took to the streets of the small town of Jena to protest how authorities handled the cases of Bell and five other teens accused of beating white student Justin Barker in December 2006. The incident was a culmination of fights between blacks and whites. Many said they were angry that the students, dubbed the ""Jena 6,"" were being treated more harshly than three white students who hung nooses from an oak tree on Jena High School property. The white students were suspended from school but did not face criminal charges. The protesters said they should have been charged with a hate crime.

"(CNN) -- Israel has halted a plan that would have displaced tens of thousands of Bedouins in the southern part of the country. The controversial plan would have involved destroying ""unrecognized"" villages in the Negev, and resettling the displaced Bedouin citizens into ""recognized"" villages. Benny Begin, a former lawmaker who helped construct the plan, said Thursday it does not have enough votes in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, to move forward. The Prawer Plan was based on an effort to better integrate Israel's Bedouin population into Israeli society. Following recommendations of a committee chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Eliezer Goldberg, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan in 2011. The Cabinet also approved more economic development in the Bedouin sector of the Negev, the government said at the time. But the plan to displace Bedouins sparked anger. Last month, Israeli riot police broke up a demonstration comprising more than 1,000 people who were protesting. According to Israeli sources, more than 40,000 Bedouins would have been affected by the plan; Bedouin elders estimate the total at more than 70,000. In a statement Thursday, Begin said he has suggested that the law be halted, but efforts to develop the Bedouin communities in the Negev continue. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""accepted my suggestion,"" he said.","Israel halted a controversial plan that would have displaced tens of thousands of Bedouins .

"(CNN) -- UK police dropped their case Wednesday against the brother of a British-Iraqi man who was killed with his wife, mother-in-law and a French cyclist in a mysterious attack in the foothills of the French Alps. The bodies of Saad al-Hilli, his wife Ikbal and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, were found in a car in a secluded parking lot on the outskirts of Chevaline, an Alpine village near the picturesque Lake Annecy, in September 2012. French cyclist Sylvain Mollet was found shot dead close by. The couple's two young daughters survived the attack, although one was beaten and shot. The other hid for hours behind her dead mother's skirts and was unharmed. Saad's brother Zaid al-Hilli, who lives in the county of Surrey, southwest of London, was arrested in June last year on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. He was later released on bail, but Surrey Police said Wednesday that the 54-year-old's bail had been canceled since he could not be charged. ""At this stage there is insufficient evidence to charge him with any criminal offence and no further police action is being taken at this time,"" the force said in a statement. The French-led investigation into the murders continues, Surrey Police said, adding that British officers had carried out ""exhaustive"" inquiries in the United Kingdom as part of the joint probe. Annecy Prosecutor Eric Maillaud told CNN the French investigators agreed with their British counterparts that there was not enough evidence to pursue the case against Zaid al-Hilli. Nonetheless, he ""remains one of the main suspects in the case,"" Maillaud said. Investigators suspected that financial issues between the two brothers might have been a motive. The team continues to work on the case, Maillaud said. ""There are still important leads in Iraq but we cannot go out and work there so it's on standby,"" he said. ""The other one is industrial espionage with state participation and that is still under investigation."" Born in Baghdad in 1962, Saad al-Hilli was a naturalized British citizen who had lived in the United Kingdom for decades. He was an engineer working at Surrey Satellite Technology, a high-tech company owned by EADS, an aerospace corporation that builds satellites. The family lived in the well-heeled town of Claygate, in Surrey, but was vacationing in France. Ikbal's mother lived in Sweden.","UK police drop the case against Zaid al-Hilli, citing insufficient evidence .

"Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- The passage of a landmark marijuana legalization measure Tuesday means Uruguay is set to become the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production, sale and consumption of the drug. It's practically a done deal. President Jose Mujica has to sign the bill before it becomes a law. But he's long backed the measure, and there's little doubt that he remains behind it. Applause and cheers rang out in Uruguay's Senate on Tuesday after the high-profile vote at the end of a lengthy debate on the bill. The measure passed Uruguay's lower house in July. Supporters of the proposal have said it marks a turning point and could inspire other Latin American nations to take a similar approach. It places the South American country at the vanguard of liberal drug policies, surpassing even the Netherlands, where recreational drugs are illegal but a policy of tolerance is in place. ""It is understood that a regulation-based policy has positive consequences for health and public security, given that, on the one hand, it can produce better results when it comes to education, prevention, information, treatment and rehabilitation in relation to the problematic uses of drugs,"" said Sen. Roberto Conde of Uruguay's Broad Front coalition, which supported the measure. ""On the other hand, it helps fight drug trafficking, which fuels organized crime and criminal activities that affect the security of the population."" Critics said legalizing marijuana could have dangerous consequences. ""This bill, which proposes an experiment in social engineering, as it was described in the public health commission, does not comply with any of the ethical safeguards of experimentation with human beings,"" said Sen. Alfredo Solari of the Colorado Party. ""Those safeguards are extremely important ... given that we're talking about marijuana, a substance that harms human beings."" A letter sent by Mujica's government to lawmakers last year presented the bill. He told CNN en EspaÃ±ol last year that he supported legalizing marijuana. ""If we legalize it, we think that we will spoil the market (for drug traffickers) because we are going to sell it for cheaper than it is sold on the black market,"" he said. ""And we are going to have people identified."" Conservative critics of the measure have said it promotes drug addiction and have suggested that Mujica's comments were uninformed. Details still in the works . The proposed law would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as many as 480 grams for personal use. Marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to 99 plants at a time. Users would have to register, and those claiming to use cannabis for medical reasons would have to show a doctor's prescription. Marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies. Once the bill becomes law, there will be a 120-day period to give the government time to adopt regulations and implement it. Consumption of marijuana has been legal Uruguay, but its production and sale are not. ""We seek to eliminate that incongruence,"" the country's top drug official, Julio Calzada, told CNN earlier this year. The same debates about marijuana that exist in the United States -- about medicinal properties, recreational use, the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in Uruguay for a long time, Calzada said. The decision to push legislation to overhaul its drug policies did not come overnight. ""We have reflected on our problems,"" Calzada said, and the government felt that Uruguay's tradition of tolerance and equality merited action on the marijuana issue. Widespread debate . But many in the traditionally Catholic country of 3.3 million people feel supporters are espousing the wrong policy for the wrong reasons. In a July poll from CIFRA/Gonzalez, Raga and Associates, 63% of Uruguayan respondents said they disagreed with the bill. Only 26% said they approved of the measure in the poll, which surveyed more than 1,000 Uruguayans and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Opponent Solari says making marijuana widely available has the potential to create even higher levels of addiction. ""It's a very bad piece of legislation, mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market,"" he said. Backers of the bill say the legislation addresses some of the concerns expressed by the opposition. For one, violators of the law would face sentences of 20 months to 10 years in prison. Those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances. The legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention and bans the advertising of cannabis in any form. Video: Seattle marks one year of legalized marijuana .

"(CNN) -- There was no winner in the Mega Millions lottery Friday, pushing the jackpot to $550 million, lottery officials said. That drawing will be Tuesday. The winning numbers for the $425 million Mega Millions were: 19, 24, 26, 27, 70 and Mega ball 12, lottery officials said Friday. The Mega Millions jumped to more than $400 million, rolling over for the 20th time after no winner was picked in Tuesday's drawing. Odds of getting all six numbers correct for the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot are about 1 in 259 million, according to the lottery company. You have more than 1,000 times better chance of an asteroid or comet killing you -- and that's using the long odds, according to Tulane University. Which is to say, astronomical. The latest probability is up from the old odds, which were about 1 in 175 million. Of course, you'd probably have a hard time telling this to the trio from Illinois, Kansas and Maryland who split the record $656 million kitty last year. It's worth mentioning that you have a one-in-15 chance of winning something, even if it's just getting your dollar back, while the odds of winning the second-place $1 million prize (that is, matching five balls but not the megaball) are about 1 in 18.5 million. Those numbers are hard for the average person to fathom, so maybe it's easier if we provide you a list of things that are way more likely than collecting a Mega Millions jackpot. From the Harvard School of Public Health: . • Chances of dying from a bee sting: 1 in 6.1 million. • Chance you will die from being struck by lightning: 1 in 3 million.

"(CNN) -- In the seven years since its founding, Twitter has become a go-to place for news updates, witty one-liners, political one-upmanship and even absurdist storytelling. It's also become a go-to place for intolerant bile. On Sunday night, Nina Davuluri, an American of Indian ancestry, was named Miss America. Immediately, the Twitterverse started spewing. ""This is Miss America... not Miss Foreign Country,"" said @MeredithRoanell. ""Congratulations Al-Qaeda. Our Miss America is one of you,"" posted @Blayne_MkItRain. What is it about Twitter? Whether the events are earthshaking or trivial, the site of more than a half-billion accounts has something to say -- and often, it's upset. Ben Affleck is named the new Batman; the anger flows. George Zimmerman is acquitted; people fly off the handle. Comments on sports, TV shows, politics, news media -- when there's something negative to be said, it will be said (occasionally with poor spelling and IN ALL CAPS) on Twitter. As Stephen Colbert summarized the Miss America outcry on ""The Colbert Report,"" ""And Twitter, as usual, could not be happy."" David Reiss, a San Diego-based psychiatrist who specializes in personality dynamics, observes that Twitter's impulsiveness can get the best of people. ""It's very easy to jot something off and hit send, and you can impulsively say something without thinking it through,"" he says, noting that it's the reverse of the classic angry letter you write and then put in a drawer until you cool off. ""With Twitter, you don't need to (do that). And if there is feedback or push back, you don't necessarily even see it."" As of Friday afternoon, Twitter had not responded to a request from CNN for comment. 'Anger is more influential' Such anger isn't just limited to Twitter, of course. You can find it on other social media platforms, news site comment boards -- including on CNN.com -- and pretty much all over the Internet. YouTube, for example, also has been known for attracting mean-spirited comments. Still, Twitter is an easy target. Besides the impulsiveness Reiss mentions, there's a typical litany of virtual-world reasons for Twitter's vitriol: anonymity, a perceived lack of consequences, a troll-ish desire to stir the pot. But perhaps the most intriguing was revealed in a study published recently by Beihang University researchers. By analyzing posts on Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter, they determined that anger is the most powerful online emotion. Of the four basic emotions into which they classified tweets, sadness and disgust barely travel. Joy does better. But anger, like a potent virus, spreads the fastest and most widely of all. ""Our results show that anger is more influential than other emotions like joy, which indicates that the angry tweets can spread quickly and broadly in the network,"" the researchers wrote. 23 key moments from Twitter history . The idea of Twitter anger is so prominent that Monica Stephens, a geography professor at Humboldt State University in California, put together a map titled ""The Geography of Hate."" The project was inspired, in part, by racial slurs on Twitter after President Obama's re-election. The map highlights sections of the country that engage in certain hate speech based on keywords, aggregated by county and adjusted for population. The results have favored rural areas, which Stephens attributes to insularity and fear of outsiders. Indeed, a more accurate title for the map would be ""the geography of xenophobia,"" she says. The map certainly hit home with certain parts of the country, Stephens says. ""So many people lashed out in anger towards me after seeing it,"" she says. ""I have hundreds of really angry e-mails that start with the term 'racist bitch.'"" Anonymity and distance . This isn't the sort of thing that tends to happen as widely on Facebook or other social media sites. There are a couple reasons for that, says Tammy Vigil, a professor at Boston University's School of Communication. One is that Facebook is largely a closed system in which you mainly communicate with people you know -- unlike Twitter, where a tweet goes out to the whole world. Moreover, Facebook friends can react more directly to vitriolic posts, either by calling the poster out or simply unfriending him or her, she says. In May, the site strengthened policies to stamp out hate speech. ""With Facebook, there's more accountability,"" says Vigil. ""Most people's Facebook accounts have multiple pictures of them, they've got connections to 'these are my friends.' There's a lot less of the anonymity, so there's a little less of the disinhibition that occurs."" Twitter also creates more distance, adds Lesley Withers, a communications professor at Central Michigan University. ""It's asynchronous -- you're not chatting real-time with another person -- so there's less of a sense that the other people out there are real,"" she says. A phone call or even some kinds of online dialogue establishes a connection that you're dealing with actual human beings. But on Twitter, that connection isn't there, so ""that allows us to go off in ways that we wouldn't choose to do if we had to look at another person's face when we did it."" Consequences? Twitter's brief screeds seldom have consequences, though that may be changing. The site recently created a ""report abuse"" button and the media -- which is often to blame for highlighting anger -- is paying more attention to bullying on the site. But the idea of consequences is hard for Twitter users to understand, observes Withers. ""I think people don't think about the long-term ramifications,"" she says. ""When I talk with students about how they use social media and say that a lot of employers will look to see what kinds of things you're posting on Facebook or Twitter, I'm surprised by the number of people who say, 'Any employer that would stalk me that way online, I wouldn't want to work for them anyway.'"" There are signs that a growing number of Twitter users don't like the venom in their midst. After the nastiness with Miss America, a number of people responded with positive tweets congratulating her. Some even reprimanded the angry tweeters -- and received apologies. ""I am so sorry. I didn't think before I tweeted what I did. I absolutely did not mean to hurt or offend anyone. Again I am SO very sorry!!!"" tweeted @JAyres15. Withers points out that the system has much to overcome. ""People use Twitter to get reactions out of others,"" she says. ""It's like a popularity contest: If you can put something out there that's quick and inflammatory and it gets retweeted a ton, that's your feedback -- that's how you know that it was an interesting or effective tweet. And people don't seem to be as concerned if the response is positive or negative."" And what works? Let's all scream it at the top of our lungs: Anger. ""Anger is an empowering emotion. You can post something angry and it can make other people feel something. It allows us an opportunity to be dramatic,"" says Withers. ""And a lot of people really like drama.""","The crowning of Miss America on Sunday led to angry, often bigoted tweets .

"(CNN) -- The New Mexico middle school shooting allegedly by a 12-year-old boy highlights how such gunfire is now occurring in America's earlier grades, raising disturbing issues on whether such youngsters know the devastating consequences of such violence and on how they should then be adjudicated, experts say. ""It's becoming more and more common, especially in the middle-school age, for these kids to be committing these violent acts,"" said Sheela Raja, clinical psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Raja was referring to a list of school violence compiled by CNN tracing violence in U.S. schools, including shootings in middle and elementary schools. That tally includes last October's shooting in Sparks, Nevada, by a 12-year-old boy who killed himself after fatally shooting a teacher; a 2010 shooting in a Madison, Alabama, by a ninth-grader who fatally shot a boy, 14, in the head; a 2000 shooting in Mount Morris Township, Michigan, in which a 6-year-old boy killed another 6-year-old; and the 1999 shooting in Deming, New Mexico, in which a 12-year-old boy killed a classmate, 13. Horrific as it is, the aftermath of such violence is complicated by the immaturity of the shooter. ""Middle-schoolers are impulsive and they can't think of the consequences of their actions, and they can't think of empathy,"" Raja said. ""Some of them have difficulty with empathy or taking on the perspective of another person."" Not even the word ""gunman"" applies because the alleged assailant is still a boy. ""People should remember that a 12-year-old is barely past the age of believing in Santa Claus,"" said Wendy Walsh, a behavior expert and psychologist. ""While there is great variance in cognitive development, plenty of kids this age are unable to fully comprehend that death is permanent,"" Walsh said. ""Add to that the impact of violent video games where 'downed' characters get up again, and there is good reason to assume this child does not think like an adult."" But it will be society's adults who must decide on how to charge a preteen suspect. In this week's shooting in Roswell, New Mexico, a 12-year-old boy is accused of walking into his school's gym and opening fire with a 20-gauge shotgun upon schoolmates who were gathered indoors to stay out of the cold before classes began. Two students at Berrendo Middle School, ages 11 and 13, were wounded and are hospitalized. The 12-year-old boy accused in the shooting, which lasted about 10 seconds, is in custody, and authorities hadn't yet filed charges as of Wednesday. His name isn't being released by authorities. ""It's a very complex case, and we need to make sure we get it right,"" New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said of his investigators' work with prosecutors in preparing juvenile court charges. ""We believe the suspect modified the weapon by cutting off its stock,"" which gave the shotgun a pistol grip, Kassetas added. The boy may have warned some students not to go to school before the attack, police said. New Mexico law requires anyone under age 15 to be charged in juvenile court, no matter how violent the crime is, said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan. Nationwide, ""for a long period of time, if you were under 16, it didn't matter what crime, you would end up in juvenile court,"" Callan said. ""But states began providing exceptions for (juvenile) violent crimes to go to adult court, but none of those go below the age of 13. It varies from state to state."" Still, the 12-year-old suspect could face a serious charge in New Mexico juvenile court. For example, Callan cited how a 10-year-old boy in Belen, New Mexico, was accused of fatally shooting his father in 2009 after being grounded and told not to play with the X-Box or computer. But last year, when the boy turned age 14, he was charged with first-degree murder -- in juvenile court. ""You can be tried in juvenile court of the same offense (as in a criminal court) -- first degree murder -- but the penalty is different. For a juvenile, he's looking at a maximum incarceration until age 21. It's safe to say you would remain incarcerated in a juvenile facility for the majority of your sentence,"" Callan said. The goal of the juvenile court system is rehabilitation, whereas the court system for adults seeks punishment, deterrence, and societal protection from offenders as well as rehabilitation, experts say. ""Our laws exist to protect minors because it has been understood that adolescents and children do not fully understand the consequences of their actions, and that rehabilitation is more likely with a developing brain,"" Walsh said. Between ages 12 and 17 -- roughly the middle and high school years -- youngsters begin to develop an ability to comprehend multiple perspectives, Raja said. ""It can happen earlier for some kids and it can start later for other kids,"" Raja said. ""The ability to understand consequences can happen later, but we don't what's happening for this particular kid"" in the Roswell case, she said. ""Clearly, he wasn't one of those kids who was able to do that,"" she added, referring to the 12-year-old boy's ability to understand the implications of his actions. Raja is concerned about how troubled youths may respond to their issues, especially when they read or hear about school shootings. ""Part of it is, too, they hear what else is happening in the country,"" Raja said of the growing frequency of school shootings. ""It may be a depressed or isolated child and they may have trouble with impulse control, and they see another kid in the country doing it, and they think, 'Maybe I can do that, too, as an option.'"" As trauma psychologist, Raja advocates a recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics that pediatricians provide firearm safety counseling to patients and their parents. But that APA recommendation has been controversial and been challenged in several states, including Florida, where gun rights advocates have sought gag laws against such physician counseling. The APA also advocates gun control. ""I think pediatricians should ask about guns in the home,"" Raja said. ""I don't think that endangers anyone's privacy.""","Experts express concern about how shootings now occur in middle schools, too .
Middle-school youths are often impulsive and can't think of consequences, expert says .
""A 12-year-old is barely past the age of believing in Santa Claus,"" another expert says .

"Nicosia, Cyprus (CNN) -- In the old town of Cyprus's capital Nicosia, something subtle and unexpected is happening. In the wake of the economic crisis, the historic center -- an attractive old town ringed by vast 16th century Venetian walls -- is gradually coming back to life with new cafes, shops, and art galleries emerging from the labyrinthine streets. Ledra Street, at the heart of town, has been a symbol for the island's division since 1974, when, in July of that year, a Greek military junta backed a coup d'etat in Cyprus. In response Turkey launched military intervention and by August it had landed thousands of troops and successfully partitioned the island. Around 180,000 Greek Cypriots were forced south and some 50,000 Turkish Cypriots moved into vacant properties in the northern Turkish occupied zone. Since 2008, Ledra Street has reopened with a checkpoint that can now be crossed. But between the ubiquitous Kentucky Fried Chicken and Starbucks outlets, and the local restaurants selling frozen yoghurt, coffee, and souvlaki by the pita-load, U.N. soldiers still patrol. Gradually however, through the frustrations of separation and the strain of the economic crisis, a new generation of poets, directors and entrepreneurs are reclaiming the area. Band aid . The band Monsieur Doumani have been playing in and around Ledra Street for several years. Many of their songs have a distinctly political edge. The band's lead singer, Antonis Antoniou, says that in his view music and art can help to heal old wounds: . ""We strongly believe that art and music can reconcile and reunite people ... especially in parts of the world where problems are between neighboring countries. For instance, here in Cyprus, the two communities share the same culture, and people used to live happily together listening to the same songs -- in many cases sung in both Greek and Turkish. This should be used as an example to bring people of the communities together."" The Green Line -- the buffer zone between the north and south Cyprus-- stretches almost across the length of the country (interrupted by the British Overseas Territory of Dhekelia), but nowhere is it more visible than in Nicosia. ""The Green Line gives the city a strange energy ... in a good way,"" says Eleni Xenou, a writer who lives in city. ""There is a silence here; an absence. A feeling of the past with the U.N. in the middle. It is very edgy and it gives the city a very interesting charm. You need to get over yourself to get over the line."" Cafe culture . Even though the checkpoints are now open, barricades still snake through the middle of town. On the corner of one inauspicious street, is the popular Xaratsi Cafe, which owner Stavros Lambrakis has managed since before the checkpoints opened up. The cafe attracts all kinds of people, and welcomes anyone from either side of town. ""The vibe of the place is what I believe attracts (my customers),"" Lambrakis says. ""Xaratsi is like no other place. It is on the Green Line, sitting on the 'no man's land.' It carries the energy and history of the city. It is untouched and one can see how the time has stopped."" Retail therapy . Alongside the arts scene are the shops, many of which celebrate their location with an unmistakable irony. A kebab shop called Berlin 2 sits right by a street blockade; a little further down the road you can buy lingerie from No Border Underwear. On Kleanthi Christophides Street Anastasios Gkekas runs a shop called the Office -- a high end men's fashion boutique and art gallery space. The shop has no mirrors, but asks its customers go outside and down the street to look at themselves in the mirrors inside the nearby U.N. guard station. ""I find it necessary to expose my clients to this reality,"" Gkekas says. ""To make them see their reflection among the ruins, (and) get them to think about where it is they are standing, at a very particular level of history."" As there is a high turnover of guards, Gkekas regularly has to explain what he is doing: . ""Officially the access to the guard station 103 is not permitted to anyone. In addition, the guards often change so I do not know several of them and anyway I always have to ask permission, explaining the nature of my request ... I do not know why they let me enter,"" he says. Many younger people in Nicosia see hope for the city and believe that reconciliation, while difficult, is certainly possible. Antoniou believes that opening up the crossings and allowing the two communities to get to know one another has been key to the city's healing. ""For the first time in our lives (especially for us who were born after 1974) we came to have first-hand experiences with the so-called 'other' and create friendships,"" he says. ""Both the propaganda that spread amongst people all these years in both sides and the fact that we had no direct contact with this 'other', helped towards demonizing it. But now, people who manage to get rid of these prejudices are able to construct relationships and have built trust, so the future could be optimistic.""

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic and Boris Becker's working relationship got off to a smooth start as the world No. 1 advanced to the second round of the Australian Open. A winner of the Melbourne grand slam in four of the last six years, top seed Djokovic extended his current winning run to 25 matches with a 6-3 7-6 (7-2) 6-1 defeat of Slovakia's Lukas Lacko. It was the first official match the Serb has played since Becker, a six-time grand slam winner, began work as part of Djokovic's coach team. They may have only been together for a short time, but Djokovic and Becker have already developed a unique way of communication. ""We speak half English, half German,"" Djokovic, who has won 22 consecutive matches in Melbourne, told reporters. ""When we need to speak about serious, serious stuff, we turn to English. ""My knowledge of the German language needs to be updated for the serious stuff. ""But he has accepted my kind request to speak to me in German as much as he can because I would like to refresh my knowledge. I used to speak it."" Third seed David Ferrer took advantage of Monday's kinder conditions to dispatch Colombia's Alejandro Gonzalez 6-3 6-4 6-4. With temperatures predicted to soar above 100 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, last year's semifinalist Ferrer was glad to have secured a second round meeting with Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. ""The conditions, well, it was very hot, sure,"" said the Spaniard. ""I prefer not too hot, but I think everybody prefers that. I know here in Australia every year it is hot. I know tomorrow it is going to be hotter."" On a day when the top seeds dominated, No. 7 Tomas Berdych cruised past Kazakhstan's Aleksandr Nedovyesova. ""I was able to keep with my [game] plan, which was really to be focused on my game and play consistent from the beginning,"" Czech Republic's Berdych said after his 6-3 6-4 6-3 triumph. ""That's what I did all through the match. I didn't have any ups and downs. That was a quite solid win."" Ninth seed Richard Gasquet overcame fellow Frenchman David Guez 7-5 6-4 6-1 to record his 350th win on the ATP World Tour. Next up for Gasquet is Russia's Nikolay Davydenko, who emerged victorious from a five-set battle with Poland's Lukasz Kubot. World No. 8 Stanislas Wawrinka benefited from the withdrawal of Kazakhstan's Andrey Golubev. The Swiss is confident of bettering his performance at last year's event when he reached the fourth round. ""I was feeling good,"" said Wawrinka, who was leading 6-4 4-1 when Golubev was forced to stop. ""I think it's one of the best starts in a grand slam if I look about my game and how I felt on the court. ""I was moving well, playing strong, playing okay.

"(CNN) -- On a warm summer afternoon in Buenos Aires last February, an Argentinian friend dropped me off in the charming historic neighborhood of San Telmo on her way to work. ""You should go see a murga tonight!"" she said. My only association with murga was a love song by one of my favorite musicians, Uruguayan singer Jorge Drexler, called ""Murga Reggae"": ""Con mi amor yo quiero bailar/Murga Reggae."" My Spanish wasn't good enough to understand the entire song, but the lyrics I did get seemed pleasant: Something about summertime, a shower of stars, the end of carnival and how he wanted to dance with his love. Did I want to see a murga? Claro! Hearing the drums of the murga . So as the sun set over the Río de la Plata, I wandered away from the tourists sipping cappuccinos and mates as they watched tango dancers in Plaza Dorrego, one of the city's historic squares. Several blocks later, the tourists had vanished and the smoke of a sidewalk asado, a huge Argentinian-style barbecue, filled the air as lanky men in tank tops demonstrated their grilling prowess. In the distance, I heard the drums of the murga. Murga, it turned out, is far from a slow, romantic dance. It's a lively form of street theater that became a prominent part of carnival celebrations in Uruguay and Argentina at the turn of the 20th century. If you happen to be in this part of the world during carnival, which generally begins in late January or early February, it's also a great way to experience regional culture and history. Murga originally came from Càdiz, Spain, but transformed in the Río de la Plata region into a unique cultural expression also rooted in other European and African traditions of music and dance. It first flourished in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods of Argentina and Uruguay, drawing on sounds of daily life: calls of street vendors, melodies of popular songs and, fundamentally, African drumming. African rhythm pulses through the music . During the 18th and early 19th century Spanish colonial era, enslaved Africans in the region developed elaborate drumming rhythms called candombe, which became a way of preserving their cultures and stories. Today it continues to thrive, particularly in predominantly Afro-Uruguayan neighborhoods in Montevideo. This is the pulse of murga. But murga also has distinct differences in each country. In Argentina, murga corsos are parades in which performers from a given neighborhood, many dressed in satin frock coats and top hats, drum and dance through the streets until reaching a staging area. There the musicians sing and play nasally horns while agile dancers swirl and kick and jump to the rhythm of the bombo, tambor and cymbals in a blur of sequins and feathers. In Uruguay, carnival lasts 40 days (it's the longest in the world). This year it started January 25 and will continue until early March. Murga performances here are much more regimented and elaborate. They incorporate a greater variety of musical instruments, powerful choral song and costumes that recall commedia dell'arte-like characters with painted faces, colorful capes and plumed hats or other outrageous headgear. Filled with parody and political satire . Murga competitions are televised, and groups practice exhaustively for months to develop and perfect their routines in secret -- serious prize money is at stake. The groups perform in theaters and tablados, outdoor staging areas constructed all over Montevideo, and may travel to several venues in one night. Murgas in both countries incorporate social and political criticism. But Uruguayan murga places more explicit emphasis on parody and political satire, often achieved by playing with the lyrics of well-known songs and even advertising jingles to construct clever, humorous critiques of everything from presidents to soccer teams to social issues. In a country where people often feel overshadowed by neighboring Argentina, these distinctions count. ""Murga is one of the only things that a lot of Uruguayans feel is only theirs. So it's viewed with a lot of pride,"" said Natalie Kirschstein, a professor of world music at Regis University in Denver who studies Uruguayan murga. Despite the differences, the tradition remains, in both countries, by and for the community. Murguistas are not professional singers and dancers, but working people -- bakers, vendors, mechanics and factory workers. They achieve a certain celebrity status during carnival, but they derive their material from the joys and struggles of family and neighbors, placing everyday life in a larger sociopolitical context. Repressive regimes banned the murga . Murga's association with working-class neighborhoods, unions and political satire made it a target of the countries' right-wing dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s, when thousands of people deemed threatening to the regime were forcibly disappeared. During this period, murgas tended to align with leftist ideals, in opposition to the repressive regimes, said Kirschstein. Officials responded by barring murga performances in public streets and censoring lyrics. Political messages became more subtle as murguistas found new metaphors to circumvent the restrictions. ""During dictatorship it became a place where people could in a coded way talk about what was going on,"" said Kirschstein. ""(Murguistas) were saying what people want to say and what they couldn't say. There are a lot of metaphors especially from that period around light, home, spring...that was the role that the murga played during the dictatorship -- giving hope."" Today murga is undergoing a renaissance. Popular musicians are integrating the traditional rhythms of candombe and other characteristic murga elements into rock, jazz and other genres. Dedicated murguista masters have introduced it to young people through neighborhood workshops, now with government support. And while many younger murguistas have abandoned some of the hard-edged political rhetoric that developed in response to dictatorship, murgas remain a venue for clever social and political commentary. Buenos Aires, Argentina . Carnival in Argentina is February 2-24. Look for performances in the following neighborhoods, which offer among the most authentic murga experiences. And word to the wise: Don't dress up for murga. More than likely you'll be caught in the crossfire of a popular carnival street fight involving water bombs, shaving cream and children who take no prisoners. Trust me on that. Barracas: High-end housing and restaurants are transforming this neighborhood of old factories and barracks near the city's port area. But it retains vestiges of its working-class roots, even as it has begun to blossom as a center for art and community cultural events. La Boca: This immigrant neighborhood maintains a rough-and-tumble reputation, but today it also has a well-established tourism industry. Sit at a sidewalk cafe with a glass of wine against a backdrop of quaint, brightly painted houses known as coventillos before taking your place to watch the local murguistas. San Telmo: One of the oldest neighborhoods of Buenos Aires, San Telmo will meet every romantic's expectations: cobblestone streets, wrought iron balconies, antique markets and tango. The outskirts of San Telmo, away from the throngs of tourists, is a staging area for murga. Montevideo, Uruguay . It's well worth spending a couple of days in Montevideo -- a three-hour ferry journey from Buenos Aires across the Río de la Plata. Carnival here is under way and continues into early March. Teatro de Verano: It's one of the most important venues for official murga competitions, but smaller open-air tablados also host cheap murga performances throughout the carnival season. It's best to buy tickets well in advance, especially if you're planning to see the top acts compete in the finals. Barrio Sur and Palermo: Candombe drumming performances and llamadas, a call-and-response procession or parade, occur in these traditional Afro-Uruguayan neighborhoods. Like murga, they are central features of carnival, but you generally don't need a ticket. Museo del Carnaval is a great place to learn more about the history of murga and other carnival traditions. The museum can also recommend venues for murga, candombe and llamadas.","Both Uruguay and Argentina have rich traditions honoring murga .

"Washington, Illinois (CNN) -- Now the long, arduous road to recovery begins. Hundreds of families in the Midwest must find a way to rebuild their lives after 76 reported tornadoes destroyed almost everything they had. Here are some of those accounts - stories of those who survived, those who didn't, and those left devastated by the twisters. THE DECEASED . 'She just kept saying, 'Get me out'' Amy Tippin and her two boys survived the tornado that tore through New Minden, Illinois, by huddling in a creek bed. When it passed, she rushed next door to look for her grandparents. She found her grandmother, 78-year-old Frances Hoy, under a pile of rubble. ""She just kept saying, 'Get me out, get me out,"" Tippin tearfully recalled to CNN affiliate KSDK. ""I just was holding her. I told her how much I loved her."" Hoy didn't make it. Neither did Hoy's brother, 80-year-old Joseph Hoy. His body was found in a field about 100 yards from the decimated home the siblings shared. ""They'd do anything for you,"" neighbor Bill Funke told the Belleville News-Democrat. ""They were friendly, outgoing and really liked exotic animals,"" he told the paper. In addition to the Hoys, the storms claimed the lives of four other people in Illinois and two in Michigan. In Washington, Illinois, the body of 51-year-old Steve Neubauer was found near his home, Tazewell County officials said. And three people in Massac County -- Kathy George, 58; Robert Harmon, 56; and Scholitta Burrus, 63 -- were killed when the storm struck southern Illinois. In Perry, Michigan, 59-year-old Phillip Smith was found dead, tangled in live power lines. Officials said a 21-year-old man was killed in Jackson County, but didn't release his name. Video captures twister's incredible power . THE SURVIVORS . 'I don't know how anybody made it through this' Mandy Lancaster begged her husband to stop filming the twister headed straight toward their home in Washington, Illinois. But he couldn't. He was transfixed by the extent of nature's fury as the tornado ripped his house to shreds. ""I got hit by some debris or something and cut my eye in three places,"" Kris Lancaster said, his right eye heavily bandaged. Eventually, he ducked into the basement and survived. His wife and children survived, too. But the house did not. ""I don't know how anybody made it through this,"" Mandy Lancaster said in front of her open refrigerator, which stood alone amid mounds of unrecognizable debris. The couple sifted through the pieces for anything they could start rebuilding their lives with. ""Ah-ha! Hahaha!"" Kris Lancaster shouted as he wrested a DVD from under a pile of furniture. ""The video of my wedding."" How to help . THE DEVASTATED . 'It's gone. I don't know where it went' The storm destroyed or severely damaged as many as 400 homes in Washington alone, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn said Monday. A National Weather Service team confirmed the storm had winds of 170 mph to 190 mph. In Kokomo, Indiana, the roof of a building sat in the middle of a road. A car rested on the mountain of rubble from a leveled home. More than 570,000 people in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan were still without power early Tuesday. The mayor of Washington, Illinois, summed up the situation in a few words: . ""Devastation. Sadness. People that lost everything,"" Mayor Gary Manier said. The storm struck his town around 11 a.m. Sunday, when many of its 10,000 residents were at church. That's where Curt Zehr was when his wife texted him. ""She texted me and said the house is gone,"" Zehr told CNN. ""I said, 'Whose house?' "" She said, 'Our house.' "" Resident Michelle Crumrine said the winds swept her home and everything in it clean away. ""A lot of people have a pile of rubble still, and I don't have anything,"" she said. ""It's gone. I don't know where it went."" Steve Bucher, too, has months of rebuilding ahead. The storm took most of his house down to the decking over his walk-out basement, . ""Within 30 seconds, the house was literally vibrating from the direct hit of this funnel cloud,"" Bucher said. ""I think my attitude was in the next minute and a half, we're either going to be in heaven, we're going to be in the hospital or we're going to walk out of here."" And they did. Neither he nor his wife was hurt. ""Everything else is rebuildable,"" Bucher said. ""I couldn't replace her."" 'The sky was just rumbling' CNN's Gary Tuchman reported from Washington, Illinois. CNN's Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Justin Lear also contributed.","Eight people were killed, including six in Illinois and two in Michigan .
120 people were injured in the city of Washington, Illinois .
More than half a million people were without power in the Midwest early Tuesday ."
"(CNN) -- Indian doctors have successfully removed a 1.2-meter rod from a 3-year-old boy after he was impaled on it at his grandparents' house. Indian doctors say Mehul Kumar is out of danger after operation to remove 1.2-meter iron rod. The Times of India reported that Mehul Kumar had fallen on the rod while playing on his grandparents' under-construction roof terrace in Ranchi, the capital city of Jharkhand state. The rod pierced through Kumar's body and he then fell to the ground, the newspaper reported. He was rushed to a nearby hospital and then taken to the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Bariatu, six kilometers away. Dr. Sandeep Agarwal, the leader of the five-strong team of doctors who spent five hours operation on Kumar, told the Times the boy was out of danger. ""We first removed the rod following which an operation was done to repair the vital organs that had been injured,'' he said.","Indian doctors successfully remove 1.2-meter rod from three-year-old boy .

"(Budget Travel) -- It began by accident. My girlfriend, Ronni, and her twin sister, Marina, rented a documentary on panda bears. We all melted. Then we went online and found videos of tourists, somewhere in China, embracing pandas. One showed a gaggle of cubs eagerly descending a slide in what looked like panda day care. ""We have to find this place,"" Ronni said, eyes lighting up. Hugging baby pandas costs about $130 and the pandas are even cuter in person than you would imagine . A friend of a friend had recently gone to China on a botanical excursion, and I could see the wheels turning in Ronni's and Marina's heads. Soon enough, we had tickets and immunization appointments. Much in the same way you might say, ""Hey, let's go to a movie,"" we made plans to cross the Pacific. We had no basis to believe that meeting pandas was possible for ordinary people. We consulted guidebooks and online travel forums, and our best bet appeared to be a facility for research and visitors at the Wolong Nature Reserve, about five hours away from Chengdu in Sichuan province. Because it was difficult to reach, we figured it must be more rewarding. Once in Hong Kong, I contracted a fixer on the mainland to help sort everything out. His name was Huang, and he'd been to Wolong earlier that year with National Geographic. Ever since Empress Wu Zetian sent a pair of panda bears to the Japanese emperor around A.D. 700, China's public face has been represented by the furry goodwill ambassadors, who even forced a smile from Richard Nixon. Today, we noticed upon arrival in Shanghai, you don't see dour Mao nearly as much as Jingjing, the flower-crowned cartoon panda that's one of the Beijing 2008 Olympic mascots, and just the first in the parade of pandas that adorn China's storefronts, advertising, clothing, and vibrant cell-phone-charm industry. In Chengdu, we were greeted at the airport by a 40-foot column topped with a giant bronze panda. On our way into the city, we also couldn't help but notice that the lampposts, rickshaws, and even highway overpasses were festooned or stenciled or otherwise decorated with pandas. But Chengdu was just a transit point for our trek along the Min and Pitiao Rivers to the Wolong Nature Reserve. We hired a driver, part of a fairly dodgy tour we'd found last-minute on the Internet. All road travel in China happens frenetically--the constant, aggressive brinksmanship of millions of shoddy minivans with toy-like wheels. We left for Wolong at dusk, ascending steep gorges that sometimes disappeared into the mist, on roads that sometimes disappeared altogether. There's no real town, and not many restaurants, other than the shabby ones at the Wolong Hotel and the Panda Inn. The following day, we awoke to a crisp and cool autumn day, with the sound of the river filling the narrow valley. This is the panda's native habitat, a subalpine arboreal wonderland that makes you understand Chinese fairy tales. The China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda has marked off large enclosures for its several dozen pandas. Last summer, the notoriously fickle pandas produced 18 cubs. We could see some of them through the glass of the nursery. The newest born were tiny pink nubs. Those slightly older were fed with bottles. The cubs we had seen online were from the previous summer. A little over a year old, all 16 played together in a single enclosure next to the nursery. Three Japanese girls entered the day-care center and frolicked among the cubs. ""How can we do that?"" I asked Tang, one of the keepers. He took us to an office, where we discovered advance work to arrange a special panda visit is unnecessary. To hug baby pandas, all you have to do is show up and pay the Wolong Panda Club $130 per person. That's nothing for five minutes of nirvana. In the flesh, the cubs were so unbelievably cute that they seemed artificial. With their round heads, big eyes, and rolling gait, they looked and acted like Jim Henson creations. Touching one felt like meeting a unicorn. The cubs moved like puppies in a curious, playful swarm. They didn't lick so much as nuzzle. And grab: To our delight, the desire for hugging was mutual, and what began as a careful encounter quickly devolved into fuzzy mayhem as the cubs attached themselves to our arms and legs. At one point, Ronni was dragged to the ground by a clutch of cubs, and she beamed beatifically. ""I can't believe this is happening,"" she said as she freed herself, only to be taken down again. After the staff pulled the cubs off us, we stood around in a daze. Stepping back outside of the panda pen, Ronni stopped grinning long enough to say, ""I want to do that again.""

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- American soldiers returning from Haiti in the early '20s and '30s came home with arresting tales of voodoo potions, black magic, and living-dead zombies. They published their stories in mass-market pulp novels, which in turn inspired horror movies and eventually made their corporeal way to our supermarket aisles during Halloween. But back in Haiti, zombies are real still. Late last year, just prior to the devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake that ravaged the country, VBS producer Santiago Stelley-Fernandez, a camera crew, and I headed to Port-au-Prince in search of the undead, known locally as Nzambi. We had investigative forbearers. In 1937, American folklorist and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston traveled to Haiti and encountered the case of Felicia Felix-Mentor, a woman who villagers claimed had died in 1907 at the age of 29 but had returned to the living 20 years later. Hurston investigated the rumors and discovered evidence that powerful drugs were used to replicate a death-like state. See the rest of Nzambi at VBS.TV . In 1982, scientist Wade Davis traveled to Port-au-Prince to research the ethnobiological base of the Haitian zombie, procuring the secret poisons used in the procedure and discovering that the undead are far from a folkloric myth, like vampires or werewolves. He concluded that voodoo priests were employing a concoction of tetrodotoxin, a chemical derived from the puffer fish that produces paralysis and can mimic death -- it is 100 times as deadly as cyandide, and something I have a longstanding interest in. After zombification, a mind-controlling drug made from a plant called Datura stramonium was administered to the patient. Despite unlocking the chemical basis of this phenomenon, however, Davis maintained that zombification was not created purely through these poisons, but indeed relied on a tradition of voodoo sorcery hundreds of years old. Thirty years later, and under the guidance of a massive local man who had survived fourteen bullets to the face, I was off to conduct my own zombie investigation. I traveled the countryside, spoke with sorcerers, and collected (and consumed) samples of the legendary poison. I went heavily armed into places that require you to be heavily armed. After months of labor, rigorous chemical analysis of the samples, several incidents that had our entire party mortally afraid, and untold numbers of night visions at the hands of total zombie preoccupation, we're finally ready to share our findings.","Stories of zombies in Haiti have inspired films, shaped concept of the zombie .

"(CNN) -- The implementation of the Affordable Care Act is not going well. First, the volume of people showing up to HealthCare.gov on October 1 completely crashed the site. Then, it turned out the data being passed up and back was completely corrupt. Then, millions of Americans began discovering that plans they ""liked"" were being canceled, and they were being told it was because of the Affordable Care Act. President Obama announced an administrative fix to this problem on Thursday: an extension that allows insurers to keep people on health care plans that the Affordable Health Care act would not have allowed. The cancellations had posed a real problem for the Obama administration, because they flew in the face of what many believe is a core promise of health care reform: that you could keep your policy if you liked it. Millions are finding out this isn't true. Those of us who have been in the weeds of health policy have known this for a long time. Most Americans did not. The Affordable Care Act changes the way insurance is regulated. It declares that many services are now mandatory. This included a lot of preventive care, as well as maternity care. Any policies that don't provide these services will no longer be offered. Other policies had very low annual or lifetime limits. These, too, have to go away. Anyone who had one will need to find a new policy. It's very likely that newer policies, with more robust benefits, will be more expensive. That will make many people unhappy. We can argue that the new policies are still a good deal, or that much of that cost will be defrayed by subsidies, or that future protections to both beneficiaries and their families are worth the added cost, but that's somewhat beside the point. Many people feel like they were told they could keep their insurance, and now they think they have been lied to. Obama knows the law is in trouble. Many Democrats feel like they took hard votes and stuck their necks out to support the law, and now that there's a perception that the executive branch has dropped the ball, their support is not as strong. There are a number of bills and fixes being debated. That won't be easy, though. That's in part because no insurance plan sticks around forever. Plans change from year to year, premiums change from year to year, coverage changes from year to year, and deductibles, copays, and co-insurance change from year to year. They always have. It has never been the case that you could be guaranteed that your plan would exist -- as it does today -- for as long as you would like. I've had plans I've liked canceled many times in my 10 years working at my current job. One bill being put forth in the House would allow insurers to continue to offer plans that have been discontinued due to the Affordable Care Act. The problem with that is that many insurance companies don't want to continue to offer those plans indefinitely. They don't make sense financially. Therefore, passing this law won't stop millions of Americans from getting cancellation notices anyway. A different bill in the Senate would force insurance companies to continue to offer those plans or leave the state entirely. If you thought the Affordable Care Act was a government takeover before, this bill is much, much worse. It would compel insurance companies to comply with a whole new host of potentially unprofitable regulations. The truth of the matter is there is no easy solution here. Disrupting the current system isn't a bug of health care reform; it's a feature. It's what was supposed to happen. All reform will do so. Even Republican proposals, like Sen. John McCain's when he was running for president, to change the health insurance tax deduction, would have completely upended the employer-sponsored health insurance system. Then-Sen. Obama attacked him savagely for just that back in 2008. It's fine for President Clinton and others to just ""demand"" this be fixed. Unfortunately, it can't be, at least not easily and not cheaply. Letting healthy people keep these plans (because most of those in the pre-Affordable Care Act individual market are healthier) and stay out of the exchanges will raise the premiums for everyone else, and thus the amount the government will have to pay in subsidies. Forcing insurance companies to continue to offer old plans in a new marketplace could wind up hurting their bottom line significantly. Obama's administrative fix, much like the House bill, allow plans offered this year to remain in place if people want them. But that will just shift blame to the insurance companies when they cancel them. For many of the reasons above, they won't want to keep them going. The real problem here, and one that few are addressing, is that the old health care system isn't that good. We wanted to change it. Doing so means that it, well, changes. If we liked our old health care system, we could keep it. But we didn't, and so at some point we're going to have to accept a new one.

"(CNN) -- This year, nearly 300,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. With October being Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we are blessed that for 31 days each year, a global community joins together to support survival, find new treatments and develop a cure. While early stage breast cancer survival rates remain high -- with many women and men going on to live long, healthy lives -- there is no cure for advanced breast cancer. Advanced breast cancer -- Stage III and IV (metastatic) -- is a chronic disease for which there will be no remission or survival. Many of us don't realize that 20% to 30% of all breast cancer cases will become metastatic. I know this personally because I experienced it with my mom, Elizabeth, when she was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 2007. My mother was warm, funny and smart. In her response to living with advanced breast cancer, her most striking quality was her extraordinary strength. When she was first diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in 2004, she had hope and determination that we would fight the cancer and win. And we did, for a short time, at least. When it returned as metastatic disease during the start of the 2008 presidential campaign, our family felt disappointment and shock, but my mom's hope remained intact. Even though she knew the disease was not cureable, she was inspired to make sure her remaining time on Earth had meaning. She relished making each and every day count for herself and for the people she loved. One of her goals, and mine, was that her positive days would outnumber the negative ones. And we certainly accomplished that goal. Living with hope, however, requires a great deal of effort for those who are confronted with this disease. Advanced breast cancer is different than early stage breast cancer because the treatment path is much more winding. With early stage breast cancer, we knew that there was a treatment path and only one objective -- we wanted the cancer gone. We could set our lives aside briefly and threw everything we had at the disease. My mom was invested in the best treatment, no matter how aggressive; and as her daughter, I was invested in her survival regardless of the short-term cost to us. Advanced breast cancer was a very different experience. This time my mom's treatment path seemed more daunting and there was no clear timeline to guide us; the cancer would be with us for the remainder of her life. Unlike with early stage breast cancer, we needed to make peace with that fact. Instead of putting life off, my mom did the opposite. She lived with purpose and created meaningful moments, not knowing how many days we would have left. Time is actually a bit of a paradox for people living with advanced cancer and for those who support them. On the one hand, we are grateful for time and want nothing but more of it. On the other hand, that very uncertainty about how much time is left can leave patients and their loved ones reeling with anxiety. For example, if my mom had a headache or back pain, our imaginations could run wild. ""Was this the sign of a tumor progression?"" ""Did this mean our time was drawing near?"" This would remain an underlying fear until her next scan, when (as my mom would say), we hoped she didn't ""light up like a Christmas tree."" But despite this reality of advanced breast cancer, or perhaps because of it, we embraced each day we had together. The value of that embrace, even if it was just being there, together, was one of the most important lessons I learned from advanced breast cancer. I wasn't living in the same state with my mom during her years with advanced breast cancer, but we talked often by phone and she always knew I was there for her. And she was there for me too, always telling me, ""don't forget about yourself."" She recognized the support I was giving her. But as my mother, she also wanted to continue giving me love and support and encouragement to keep following my dreams. As her daughter, at times as her caregiver, I never felt like there was quite enough I could do. But for both of us, the simple act of being together was what mattered. Though my mom passed away nearly three years ago, I am still a part of a very important community. Today, I want to raise awareness about the unique challenges that face those living with advanced breast cancer. And I do mean living. Many of these women are caring for small children, still working and planning for future life events like weddings and grandchildren. Their focus, like my mom's, is making each day count. That is why advanced breast cancer needs not only dollars to help fuel research advances, but solid support from all of us -- family, friends, co-workers or anyone touched by the disease. And that is why I've joined the Count Us, Know Us, Join Us program to help amplify the voice for the advanced breast cancer community. I'm asking everyone to join in with me and support a community that so desperately needs a voice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cate Edwards.","October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month; nearly 300,000 women will be diagnosed .

"(CNN) -- A federal air marshal was arrested Thursday morning at Nashville International Airport after being caught taking multiple upskirt pictures of female passengers boarding a plane, police said. A witness spotted 28-year-old Adam Bartsch, who was on duty, taking pictures with his cell phone underneath women's dresses, police said. The witness grabbed Bartsch's phone and notified a Southwest Airlines flight attendant, a police report said. Airport police removed Bartsch from the flight and took him into custody. According to the police report, Bartsch said he snapped 10 to 12 inappropriate pictures, something he said he had done before. He was charged with disorderly conduct and held on $10,000 bail. The Transportation Security Administration said it is assisting authorities with the investigation. ""TSA does not tolerate criminal behavior. The agency immediately removed this individual from his current duties and is in the process of suspending or terminating his employment."" In an e-mail to CNN, Southwest Airlines spokesman Chris Mainz said the flight, to Tampa, Florida, was not delayed by the incident.

"(CNN) -- The enthusiasm gap between football fanatics and those who can't tell a Raven from a Falcon can widen into a chasm come Super Bowl Sunday. It's hard to resist a nationwide party, so you'll find the clueless mingling with the season ticket holders, which can lead to bitterness from both quarters when apathy meets with bone-crushing enthusiasm. As a colleague wrote in an e-mail upon discovering that a friend who doesn't care for football was hosting a Super Bowl party, ""I think it's totally annoying and now I have to find a reason to tell you to keep your chips and dip to yourself because I don't want to constantly listen to you ramble on while I'm trying to watch the game. Wanna have a party? Then have one. Just don't hijack my Super Bowl. I'm about to go into mourning about football season being over."" Plenty of non-fans are perfectly comfortable taking a pass and indulging in an alternate activity on game day. Many hosts are warm and welcoming to guests who don't know a blitz from a drop kick (so long as they bring a sufficiently chilled six-pack or a semi-competent guacamole). But the occasional ""Shush! I'm trying to hear Jerome Boger's call!"" is bound to happen. Granted, any thematic gathering stands a chance of widening the gulf between devotees and dilettantes. There's always the blowhard at the Oscars party rolling his eyes, delivering a dull indictment of celebrity culture and yammering on about not having seen any of the films (all while hogging the artichoke dip). That's a pretty serious fumble in the decency department. So how about a little teamwork this Sunday? Here are tips on how not to ruin a Super Bowl party for those disinterested in the game yet game for a celebration. Opinion: I hate, hate Super Bowl parties . For the non-fan: . Keep off the field of play . If you go to the beach and you spend the whole time crabbing about sand between your toes while the rest of your friends are frolicking, perhaps you're meant for the museum or the mall instead. It's not fair to bring everyone else down just because football isn't your bag. Have a ""me"" day, indulge in something you love (""Law & Order"" marathon? Puppy Bowl perhaps?) and console or celebrate with the gang after the game. Perform some drills . Dig the company, but know you'll be bored stiff even before kickoff? Assign yourself a labor-intensive task that will benefit everyone. Assemble a 47-layer dip, serve up freshly made guacamole to order or squeeze a few dozen limes to ensure everyone's margaritas stay replenished. Just clear it with the host beforehand, and everybody wins. Consult your bookie . Not into the game, but want to get your share of chicken wings and halftime hijinks? While it would be terribly rude in most other social circumstances, feel free to retreat to a quiet corner with a book or the (quiet) communication device of your choice. Just remember to look up and smile every once in a while (especially if you've been dragged there as someone's plus one) so you aren't just remembered as that party pooper who spent the whole time scowling. Rally an ally . Around bowl time, the Internet abounds with articles about how to sound like you know what you're talking about at a Super Bowl party. That seems exhausting. While the assembled masses might not have time or patience for your questions about what's happening on the gridiron, there's bound to be at least one person dying to take you under his or her wing. Keep that person's nacho plate topped off and he/she will be your No. 1 fan. Hut or shut up . Perhaps you think football is dull, barbaric or hopelessly unsophisticated. There's an awesome place where you can go and yelp about that to your heart's content: It's called the Internet, and it's right there in your pocket. Feel free to tweet, comment or text your heckling to the sympathetic masses -- which might be rather passive-aggressive, but at least you're not out-loud harshing the buzz of the folks who were kind enough to let you take up couch space. For the host: . Kick it off properly . Are casual or non-fans welcome? If your aim is to party down with only the die-hards, (politely) make that clear in the invitation so less-fanatical friends can make alternate plans. Make room on the sidelines . If your gathering is going to be split between die-hard football fans and folks who are just in it for the dip and halftime nip slips, consider drawing some clear lines on the field of play. This might mean you'll have to clean up your bedroom or den, but that's a small price to pay for peace. Draft backup hosts . You might be the best host in the history of the game, and have all your bases covered (apologies for the mixed sports metaphor), but accept offers of help if you can. The guest might simply be at a loss for something to do. Consider tasking them with beer runs, cheese grating or dish duty and consider it a victory for your mad hospitality skills. Are you a non-fan who plans to attend a Super Bowl party with die-hard fans? Share your strategy in the comments section below.","If you aren't a football fan, you might feel out of place at a Super Bowl party .

"(CNN) -- Any minute, the Duchess of Cambridge will birth a new heir to the British throne. CNN has tried to answer every question you didn't even know you had about this kid who's famous before his or her first picture has been snapped. Read more: The Royal Baby . It seems like forever that Catherine Middleton has been pregnant, but the world first learned the news in December, when she was hospitalized with acute morning sickness. Since then, her every mommy-to-be move and maternity outfit has been scrutinized. Read more: Privacy vs. pregnancy . The baby is expected to debut at St. Mary's Hospital in London. Read more: Q&A -- What will happen when the baby is born? Will you be the first to know? Well, you'll definitely know as soon as an official public announcement is made, but Grandma and some other VIPs get dibs. Queen Elizabeth II, British Prime Minister David Cameron and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations will be told, along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families. An announcement will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace, royal sources have told CNN. There, the notice will be placed on an easel on the palace forecourt, the sources say. This will be the first chance for the nation and those watching around the world to find out whether the new baby is a boy or a girl. After it goes onto the easel, a press notice will be dispatched, and it's expected -- but not confirmed -- that Twitter will carry the news. Speaking of the grand gender reveal, if you placed bets on pink, you might win that office pool. Supposedly, the Duchess let it slip in June that she might be having a daughter when she bought a teddy bear. That tidbit led to a media frenzy and a royal source telling CNN that the couple didn't know the sex. Again, your money is probably good if you're predicting frilly smocks and hair bows.

The child will be next in line to the British throne after William, whose father, Charles, is first in line. But first, the child will be ... well, a child.

"(CNN) -- By now, everyone should know that aviation is the safest way to travel: Even in parts of the world with a ""high"" accident rate, that rate is still far below other ways to get from point A to point B. This level of safety is due to a tradition of hard work and technological advances that must continue. New threats emerge every day, but through proactive efforts in data collection and analysis, we don't have to wait for an accident anymore -- we can mitigate these risks before they become real problems. So how do we square those facts with terrible tragedies such as Air France 447? Plane crashes do still occur, even with state-of-the-art aircraft. Everyone in the industry must continue to work hard on safety. With the Air France 447 final report published this week, we now have a clearer picture of the events that led to this tragedy. The report concluded that a series of errors by pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash. We already knew much of what we happened that evening: The autopilot shut itself off when the air speed indicators failed and the plane ""handed itself"" to the co-pilot. For the next several minutes, it should have been a pretty benign situation, but the flight crew made some inexplicable decisions and ultimately the plane crashed in the ocean. What we must now try to understand is why the pilots reacted the way they did. In the past decade, we've seen tremendous advances in automation in the cockpit. This automation has proven to be vital to raising the level of safety in aviation even higher and also to provide more efficient airline operations. It has removed some of the threat of human error during normal operations. Pilots now spend most of their time monitoring the automation. But what happens when the automation turns itself off or fails for some reason? Q&A: Has Air France Flight 447 mystery been solved? The elephant in the room has always been that training standards have not kept up with the technological changes in aircraft. In the early days of aviation, training included how to recover from some of the most commonly-faced emergencies, such as a lost engine during take off. These scenarios are no longer common, yet the training has not changed significantly to recognize this new reality. Automation used to be the pilot's assistant. Now the pilot is expected to back-up the automation. That is a fundamentally new task that the industry hasn't trained for. Regulators around the world need to acknowledge this and work to change the basic requirements in training programs. Pilots need to know what it feels like to stall at high altitudes and train on how to recover. They need to know what to do when an airplane is suddenly handed to them during an abnormal flight situation by the autopilot turning off. They need to learn what to do and perhaps most importantly, what not to do in order to avoid increasing risk. Some of this will require a renewed emphasis on manual flying skills, but new training will also have to be developed to address the fundamental new relationship that has developed between man and machine. There are a number of airlines around the work who are already changing their training standards to reflect this and we applaud this effort. All airlines should do this. They should not wait for their regulators to act. As with any tragedy, there will be a temptation to focus on blame and political posturing, but AF447 is a case where politicians and judges should keep a respectful distance. There is some serious technical work to be done, and the aviation community needs to act quickly and objectively. It is a responsibility that the entire aviation community embraces and we are confident that the safety professionals will find solutions that ensure that tragedies like this don't happen again. It is a debt we owe to those who have been lost. News: Who's really flying the plane? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bill Voss.","Final report on crash of Air France flight 447 concludes human error to blame .

"(CNN) -- For now, Alireza M. is a lucky man. But, like life itself, that may not last. Convicted by an Iranian court of possessing a kilogram of crystal meth, the 37-year-old man was sentenced to death by hanging at Bojnurd Prison in northeastern Iran, according to Jam-E-Jam, an official newspaper that offered this wince-inducing account: . On the morning of October 9, Alireza M. was taken from his cell to the gallows, where the judge who had issued the order read his sentence aloud and official papers were signed. Then, a rope was placed around his neck and he was hanged for 12 minutes, after which his body was lowered and a doctor declared he was dead. The doctor, the judge and the prison head then signed the death certificate, and the body of Alireza M. was taken to a morgue for delivery the following day to his relatives. But the next day, a worker at the morgue noticed that plastic encasing one of the bodies had steam in front of the mouth. The worker told the doctors at the morgue, who took Alireza M. to Imam Ali hospital in the town of Bojnurd, where he was reported to be feeling better. Alireza M.'s family told the newspaper they had been preparing to pick up the body when they heard that he was still alive, that his daughters had rejoiced and that they were hoping for a reprieve. But the judge who issued the sentence, Mohammad Erfan, was unmoved. ""The sentence is approved and the sentence is death, so we will follow through with the execution order again,"" he said. A legal expert cited in the article said a law that mandates the death sentence for anyone possessing more than 30 grams of any illegal drug was passed three years ago. In a statement issued Wednesday, Amnesty International called for a reprieve. ""The horrific prospect of this man facing a second hanging, after having gone through the whole ordeal already once, merely underlines the cruelty and inhumanity of the death penalty,"" said Philip Luther, director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Program. ""The Iranian authorities must immediately halt Alireza M's execution and issue a moratorium on all others."" This year, Iran is thought to have executed at least 508 people, most of them convicted of drug offenses, the group said. ""Carrying out a second execution on a man who somehow managed to survive 12 minutes of hanging -- who was certified as dead and whose body was about to be turned over to his family -- is simply ghastly. It betrays a basic lack of humanity that sadly underpins much of Iran's justice system,"" said Luther. The organization Human Rights Watch opposes execution as an inherently cruel and unusual form of punishment that violates fundamental human rights, said Faraz Sanei, a researcher in the organization's Middle East and North Africa Division. He said the group is particularly opposed to execution of alleged drug offenders because cases like Alireza M's are tried in revolutionary courts, which tend to include violations of due process, . In addition, the group considers hangings to constitute torture, he said. Iran's interpretation of Sharia law allows for individuals to be spared from a second execution attempt in certain circumstances, like stoning in cases of adultery that fails to result in death. Human rights groups estimate that the Iranian authorities currently hold at least 10 women and men who face possible execution by stoning on adultery charges. At least 70 people have been executed by stoning in Iran since 1980. The last known execution by stoning was in 2009, Sanei said. But Iranian judiciary officials say there is apparently nothing in law that would prevent Alireza M. from being executed again. Others have a different interpretation. According to the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency, Ayatollah Saafi Golpayegani said Saturday -- a high-ranking cleric who was being pressed on his position -- said, ""If a person is executed for drug smuggling and returns to life, his second execution is not allowed."" According to the U.N.'s 2010 Drug Report, a massive increase in seizures of high-purity crystalline methamphetamine from Iran began in 2008. That same year, for the first time, the country seized four clandestine meth labs. CNN's Neda Farshbaf and Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Hanged for 12 minutes, Alireza M. is declared dead .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's not just about the website anymore. Republican foes of Obamacare still use words like ""disaster"" and ""epic"" failure in describing the problems with HealthCare.gov, the portal for enrolling in President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms. However, they also concede the technology problems will likely get resolved, as promised again Wednesday by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. The broader GOP focus is on their dislike for the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 with no Republican support and upheld last year by the Supreme Court. At Wednesday's hearing, Republicans accused Obama of lying to the American people in selling the reforms and railed against the impacts, including individual policyholders getting cancellation notices and premium prices rising in some areas. Obama's oft-repeated pledge that people could keep coverage they liked was ""simply untrue,"" said GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, while his conservative colleague Sen. John Cornyn of Texas called it a ""false statement made to the American people."" Obama, Biden meet with Senate Democrats . WH: Obama 'can't go back' and change Obamacare vow . When Cornyn and fellow Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota pushed Sebelius on whether Obama's statement was true or false, she repeated the administration's response that a grandfather clause included in the legislation allows people to keep policies that were in place before the law was signed more than three years ago. The matter involves a relatively small segment of the insurance market -- the 5% of Americans who buy individual policies, unlike the vast majority who get their coverage through their jobs or government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and others. While only a sliver of the overall market, it still involves 12 million people, including more than 1 million who have received letters from their insurers telling them current policies are being discontinued. Sebelius said Wednesday that the goal of the health care reforms known as Obamacare was to ensure everyone has minimum standards of coverage, which didn't exist in the individual market before the reforms. She said Obama's pledge that people can keep policies they liked -- which Cornyn and Thune noted remained on the White House website on Wednesday -- was mostly in reference to the 80% of Americans getting coverage from employer and federal programs, as well as some in the individual markets. Obama further alters 'you can keep your plan' pledge . That was insufficient for Cornyn, who questioned why no one had lost their job so far over the botched website launch on October 1 or false statements by administration officials on people losing health coverage. ""The only thing I can conclude is that it is impossible to do something in this administration that gets you fired. It is impossible,"" he said. ""You can lie to the American people. You can consistently misrepresent the facts, but it is impossible to get fired."" Debunking 4 Obamacare myths: Both sides get it wrong . Obama went to Texas on Wednesday to meet with ""navigators"" -- people hired to help Americans obtain health insurance through the newly established federal and state marketplaces. He spoke about his frustrations with the website. In Dallas, Obama reassures that website fix is coming . ""This is like having a really good product in a store, and the cash registers don't work, and there aren't enough parking spots, and nobody can get through the door,"" the President said. ""We are working overtime to get this fixed and the website is already better than it was at the beginning of October. And by the end of this month, we anticipate that it is going to be working the way it is supposed to,"" Obama said. Back in Washington, Cornyn asked Sebelius if the thousands of navigators had been properly screened. Sebelius said a background check was not required for navigators on the federal exchange, noting such screening also wasn't federally required for insurance agents. ""So a convicted felon could be a navigator and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual unbeknownst to them?"" Cornyn asked. ""That is possible,"" Sebelius responded. ""We have contracts for the organizations and they have taken the responsibility to screen their individual navigators and make sure that they are sufficiently trained for the job ... but it is possible."" Sebelius also came under fire from a fellow Kansan, GOP Sen. Pat Roberts, who said she should resign because of the website woes and other Obamacare problems. ""More people are losing their insurance than signing up on the website,"" Roberts said, adding that the resulting limbo ""means the difference between life and death for many Americans who are at a loss for what to do."" Sebelius called the website problems unacceptable and said they were being fixed, declaring herself accountable for the troubled launch. At the same time, she said an ""even higher level of accountability"" existed involving the tens of millions of Americans previously ineligible or unable to afford health insurance who now can get coverage because of Obamacare. Obamacare: It's about government, future elections . ""The impact on the lives of everyday people is getting lost,"" Sebelius said of the torrid political debate spurred by the website problems and persistent Republican efforts to undermine the law passed with no GOP votes in 2010 and upheld by the Supreme Court last year. Asked how many people had enrolled so far, Sebelius repeated that figures for the first month would be made public next week and that they would be less than originally anticipated because of the website problems that hindered the ability of large numbers to sign up. ""Our early enrollment numbers are going to be very low,"" she said. She rejected calls by Republicans and some Democrats up for re-election next year to delay implementation of Obamacare's vital individual mandate that requires people to have health coverage or get fined. ""Delaying the Affordable Care Act wouldn't delay people's cancer or diabetes or Parkinson's,"" she said. ""... Delaying the Affordable Care Act doesn't delay the foreclosure notices for families forced into bankruptcy by unpayable medical bills. It doesn't delay the higher costs all of us pay when uninsured Americans are left with no choice but to rely on emergency rooms for care. So for millions of Americans, delay is not an option. People's lives depend on this."" The White House announced that Obama met Wednesday with Senate Democrats to discuss concerns about Obamacare, particularly that the website problems will prevent people from signing up in time for new coverage. One participant, Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, said he urged Obama ""to extend the enrollment period to give consumers enough time to make an informed decision about their family's health insurance options."" Udall also said he pushed for assurances that information submitted to the HealthCare.gov website would be protected, a concern stressed by fellow Democrats and Republicans at Wednesday's hearing. It was the second hearing in a week in which Sebelius got grilled by legislators over the website problems and the overall reforms. Earlier: 5 things we learned from Sebelius . Democrats agreed that the website must get fixed as quickly as possible, repeating the ""unacceptable"" label used by Sebelius and Republicans for the inability to log in, lengthy delays, error messages and other problems that occurred with the launch of HealthCare.gov. However, they also backed the health care reforms and called for Republicans to work together to fix problems instead of seeking to wipe out the law. ""Those who seek to ascribe blame are the same folks who have spent every waking hour of the last four years working to dismantle, destroy, obstruct and impede the success of the Affordable Care Act,"" said Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey. Noting that similar attacks faced the advent and launch of other social welfare advances in the past such as Social Security and Medicare, Menendez noted those programs now were popular as part of a government safety net for elderly citizens. Republican opponents of Obamacare, he said, were ""concerned not about its failure, they're concerned about its success."" Website goes dark nightly for fix-it work . Meanwhile, the official in charge of technology at the federal agency that developed the HealthCare.gov website is leaving the government for a private-sector job, according to an internal e-mail. Chief Information Officer Tony Trenkle's departure from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services is effective November 15, according to the email by Chief Operating Officer Michelle Snyder. Asked if Trenkle was being pushed out due to his role in the Obamacare website's development, CMS communications director Julie Bataille declined to elaborate. ""Tony made a decision that he was going to move to the private sector and that is what our COO announced yesterday,"" Bataille told reporters on Wednesday. CNN's Z.

"(CNN) -- For the first time in the history of NCAA Division I college football, there will be a playoff system, starting with the 2014-2015 football season. A group of 12 college presidents -- the Presidential Oversight Committee of the Bowl Championship Series -- approved a plan Tuesday for a four-team seeded football playoff. The deal is for 12 years and will go through the 2025 season. ""A four-team playoff doesn't go too far,"" Virginia Tech President Charles Steger, chairman of the BCS committee, said. ""It goes just the right amount. We are very pleased with this new arrangement."" The playoff system will replace the current -- and controversial -- Bowl Championship Series -- which began in 1998. The new system will have two national semifinal games and a final. The teams will be selected by a committee. This plan is similar to how the NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments are created. Despite the change, the bowl-game structure will still exist. ""It's a best of both worlds result,"" Steger said. ""It captures the excitement of a playoff while protecting the best regular seasons in sports and also tradition of the bowls."" Steger said that some issues -- such as access to nonplayoff bowls and financial distribution -- have not been finalized. Lower college football divisions -- the Football Championship Subdivision, Division II, and Division III -- already have playoff systems in place. The current BCS system uses human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule to match the top two teams in the country to play for the national championship, and the process has always been open to criticism. Even congressional representatives in the past have tried to make headway to change the BCS. In 2005, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, called for a hearing on the BCS before a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. No legislation results from the hearing. In 2008, Reps. Neil Abercrombie, D-Hawaii, Lynn Westmoreland, R-Georgia, and Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, introduced what they called the NCAA Football Championship Equity Resolution, which stated that the BCS was unfair and a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In 2009, President Barack Obama reiterated his preference for a playoff system.","A 4-team football playoff for NCAA Division I will begin with the 2014-2015 season .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The death toll may climb after a series of earthquakes in southwestern China killed at least 80 people and injured 731, a state-run news agency reported Saturday. More than 6,600 homes were destroyed and about 430,000 damaged in Friday's quakes, Xinhua said. 7.6-magnitude quake rattles Costa Rican coast . Premier Wen Jiabao inspected stricken areas early Saturday and visited the injured, the news agency reported. Wen will direct rescue operations. President Hu Jintao called for immediate relief efforts, according to China Central Television. Xinhua reported that 100,000 people have been evacuated and another 100,000 are in need of relocation. Initial estimates put the ""direct economic losses"" from the tremors at more than half a billion dollars, the news agency said. Xinhua described the mountainous area hit hard by the quakes as poverty-stricken. It said telecommunications and traffic infrastructure were seriously damaged. Four earthquakes struck near the border of the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou between 11:19 a.m. and 1:12 p.m. local time, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Their magnitudes ranged between 4.8 and 5.6, according to the U.S. agency. Strong offshore quake kills 1 in the Philippines .

"(CNN) -- While most photos are digital these days, there was a time when sepia-toned hard copies of pictures were regarded as precious relics -- and families would be thrilled to get their hands on any from times past. Some lucky families were recently able to do just that, thanks to the effort of one St. Louis County, Minnesota, man. When Matt Seppo, facilities supervisor for the Chris Jensen Nursing Home, came across bags of old photographs at the center while cleaning up in 2005, he could have just thrown them out with the rest of the trash. But he didn't. A self-described history buff and amateur genealogist, Seppo was already hooked on working with old images. ""I am a collector,"" he told HLN. ""I collected a lot of old military things for years. My interest in genealogy started when my grandmother passed down a photo album from the 1860s."" Seppo traced his own family tree and learned that his family came to the United States from Finland in the mid-1800s. So when he discovered the photos at the nursing home, Seppo decided to take on the challenge of getting the photos back to their owners -- or at least their owners' living relatives. But how do you trace photos that are from so long ago? ""I started by turning them face-down, feeling thickness of paper to separate the batches. I also used stamps to discern time taken and where they were developed,"" Seppo said. He also used phone books, newspaper archives, Census information and the genealogy site of the Church of Latter-day Saints to aid his research. Seppo had the photos for eight years before he finally found a lead that connected him to what he was looking for in November. ""The big breakthrough was that finally I found some of the people they should belong to,"" he said. ""I did it on my own. I used Google for some of the research, but I'm the last person to get a cell phone and a computer,"" he laughed. The bags contained roughly 150 photos, some of them dating as far back as 1890. One man -- Seppo describes him as ""very distinctive"" -- appeared in many of the photos, from baby pictures to older shots. Seppo discovered his name was La Verne Swenson (which was also written on one of the bags the photos were in), but that there was no link between him and the nursing home. ""I found La Verne's brother and sister after doing some research in Wisconsin,"" Seppo said. ""I found a newspaper clipping that led me to believe that a woman named Julie Swenson was married to a man that was related to La Verne. And it turned out that La Verne's sister, Lillian, and her brother, Olaf, had a baby -- and that was Eugene, Julie Swenson's husband."" The Swensons weren't the only family Seppo was able to track down. He also managed to track down the Hunter family in Cloquet, Minnesota, and give Mickey Hunter photos of his great-great-grandfather he had never seen before. ""You know more about my family than I do,"" Seppo said Hunter told him when they met for the first time. He was right, too -- Seppo had managed to find Hunter's relative by tracing a World War I draft registration and then finding descendants of the name. While Seppo has many more photos to go through, he said he feels happy that he has finally met with some success.","Man returns found photos to families in his free time .

"(CNN) -- The Turkish and Egyptian governments engaged in a round of tit-for-tat diplomacy Saturday, with Egypt first expelling Ankara's ambassador and Turkey reciprocating. Cairo blamed its decision to declare Turkish Ambassador Huseyin Avni Botsali ""persona non grata"" -- or unwelcome -- on Ankara's interference in its domestic affairs, Turkey's Anadolu Agency news outlet said. Turkey accused Egypt of not respecting ""the will of the people,"" downgraded its diplomatic relationship with Cairo, and declared its ambassador unwelcome. Cairo had lowered its diplomatic representation in Turkey to the level of charge d'affaires and withdrew its ambassador in August. The diplomatic spat is the latest sign of a worsening relationship between the two nations and one that an analyst said vividly illustrated Turkey's ""growing isolation in the Middle East."" The relationship between the countries went sour after the Egyptian military in July ousted President Mohamed Morsy and his government. Morsy, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, had close ties with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP). After it toppled Morsy, Egypt banned the brotherhood's activities and froze its finances. Erdogan -- who was accorded a hero's welcome when he visited post-revolution Cairo in late 2011 -- has spoken out strongly against Egypt's post-Morsy leadership. Read more: Egypt's war of symbols . Fadi Hakura from the London think-tank Chatham House told CNN that Saturday's events were ""a vivid illustration of Turkey's growing isolation in the Middle East."" ""There's a perception gaining ground in the region that the Turkish government is allied to the Muslim Brotherhood and that its foreign policy is defined by sectarian priorities,"" Hakura said. ""Turkey has tense relations with Israel, the neighboring countries -- Iran, Syria and Iraq -- the majority of the Gulf Arab states and Morocco, Algeria, Egypt and Jordan,"" he said. Hakura said U.S. President Barack Obama also was deeply unhappy with Turkish foreign policy in the region. ""Since early August there has been no telephone contact between the U.S. President and Turkish Prime Minister and that's a reflection in part with Turkey's deepening isolation in the Middle East and also frustration in Ankara at Obama's reluctance to get involved in the conflict in Syria,"" he said. Hakura said while tensions between Cairo and Ankara would not have a major impact on Turkish-U.S. relations, ""what these events do is reduce the importance of Turkey to U.S. foreign policy calculations."" It is a shift from 2012, when Erdogan told an audience at his party conference -- that included then-President Morsy -- that Turkey was a role model for regional democratic Islamist movements in the wake of the Arab Spring. ""This understating that we have put forth has gone beyond our borders and has practically become an example to all Muslim countries,"" Erdogan said. Last month Suat Kiniklioglu, a former lawmaker from Erdogan's AKP party, also warned that Turkey needed to reprioritize its foreign policy objectives in the Middle East after suffering serious setbacks in the region in recent months. ""Egypt is a key actor in the Middle East. There is a clear need to calibrate the language directed at Cairo, as well,"" Kiniklioglu wrote in the English language Today's Zaman newspaper. ""The falling out with Israel, the Arab Spring and especially the civil war in Syria have radically altered Turkey's position in the region,"" he said. ""The coup in Egypt has added insult to injury. Consequently, Turkey is confronted with significant challenges on all fronts in the region.""

"(CNN) -- When a 21-year-old Abby Wambach made her debut for the United States on September 9, 2001, Mia Hamm scored twice in a 4-1 win over Germany. Twelve years later, aged 33, Wambach grabbed four first-half goals in a 5-0 win over South Korea to overtake Hamm as the leading scorer in women's international soccer history. Wambach equaled Hamm's record of 158 with her second goal after just 19 minutes of Thursday's friendly game at New Jersey's Red Bull Arena before adding two more to stand alone in the record books with 160 international goals -- the most by any male or female player.

Hamm had earlier congratulated Wambach on her achievement. The New York native reached the landmark figure in 207 games, while Hamm scored her total in 275 international matches before retiring in 2004. ""So proud of you, my friend.

"New York (CNN) -- Featuring a display of black eyes and bruises, a video of naughty Santas in New York on their worst behavior surfaced on Sunday. The Christmas-themed brawl was caught on camera at the end of a day of heavy drinking and has drawn the holiday ire of some New Yorkers. Police were alerted at 8:20 p.m. Saturday that group of eight to 10 people dressed as Santa Claus were fighting on the snow-covered corner of 17th Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan's Gramercy neighborhood. By the time police arrived, the bad Santas were nowhere to be found. The New York City Police Department is looking into the incident but has no assault complaints, according to Sgt. Lee Jones. Bargoers dressed in Christmas-themed costumes descended upon hundreds of cities worldwide Saturday for the annual bar crawl known as SantaCon. In New York, thousands took to the streets dressed as elves, Santas and holiday-themed characters, as they have since 1997. In recent years, the debauchery of some of its participants has become too much -- even for some who take part in it. ""It was just terrible; they were throwing up in the streets. It was really just disgusting. I just put a red suit on and have a good time,"" Sandy Bachom, who participated in the event last year, told CNN affiliate WABC. ""I think New Yorkers generally are extremely tolerant of visitors, but when they come in such droves, and then combine that with public intoxication, it has a negative impact in our neighborhoods,"" state Sen. Brad Hoylman said to WABC. Despite the brouhaha, city officials are still supporting the event. ""It's what makes New York New York,"" Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said at a news conference Friday. ""There has been some rowdy activity by a small handful of people."" However, NYPD officers were handing out fliers stressing that they would stop revelers who publicly consume alcohol. SantaCon NYC is vowing to clean up its act. ""SantaCon has had growing pains,"" the event's organizers said in a news release on the NYC SantaCon website. ""With a little elbow-grease from the elves, a little patience from the community, and just a pinch of holiday magic, SantaCon can spread joy."" Santacon.info, a website that attempts to keep up with SantaCons wherever they are and assist organizers in publicizing them, maintains a list that on Saturday showed 146 locations where events would be taking place this weekend and next, from Helena, Montana, to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","A video of misbehaving Santas has some New Yorkers saying enough is enough .

"(CNN) -- In South Africa, Nelson Mandela's 95th birthday is being marked by celebrations, good deeds, and an exhibition of stunning new posters of the country's former president. Mandela himself will be spending the day in hospital in Pretoria, where he is said to be in a critical but stable condition, battling a lung infection. Since 2009, Mandela's birthday has been designated ""Nelson Mandela International Day."" The celebration encourages people around the globe to partake in 67 minutes of public service: one minute per year of service that the former statesman, also known as Madiba, has given to his country. In photos: Global tributes to Nelson Mandela . It's a day that many feared might not come, as Mandela has been receiving urgent medical care since June. Now breathing with the help of a machine, family and friends have been optimistic about his response to treatment, with former president Thabo Mbeki even suggesting he may soon be discharged. Admirers worldwide are hoping for the Nobel Peace laureate's recovery, with Mandela Day providing the perfect opportunity to celebrate his life and achievements. A survey released last week found that 89% of South Africans planned to commemorate the day, with thousands of school children across the country singing ""happy birthday"" this morning. Also marking the occasion, at the University of Pretoria the Mandela Poster Project is exhibiting images of Mandela from around the world. Read this: 'Biggest celebration ever' for Mandela's birthday . Launched in May 2013, the project asked designers to submit posters celebrating Mandela's life. It received more than 700 entries from more than 70 countries, and is now displaying 95 posters that reflect Mandela's international legacy. ""He (Mandela) carries across this concept of humanity and selflessness,"" said Mohammed Jogie, co-founder of the project. There are plans for an international traveling exhibition, and the posters will also be made into an online gallery. The team behind the project says it plans to donate any proceeds to the Nelson Mandela Children's Hospital Trust, which aims to establish a pediatric hospital in Johannesburg. It's a fitting tribute to the iconic activist on a day that celebrates the sense of community and charity Mandela has dedicated his life to promoting.","Mandela Poster Project exhibiting 95 posters of the former South African president .

""When you have something precious, you usually hide it. You want to make sure you keep it safe until that treasure is ready to be found."" The nation has heard plenty of debate over racial profiling. But there's a form of religious profiling that some young Muslim women in America say they endure whenever they voluntarily wear the hijab. The hijab, also known as the veil, is the headscarf worn by Muslim women around the globe. It's a simple piece of cloth, but it can place young Muslim women in Western countries in difficult situations. Some hijab-wearers say that strangers treat them as if they're terrorists. Others ask them if they're a nun -- or even allergic to the sun. In some cases, their worst critics are not Americans, but fellow Muslim Americans. The pressure on Muslim teenagers in the U.S. who wear the hijab may be even more acute. Their challenge: How do I fit in when I wear something that makes me stand out? Randa Abdel-Fattah, who has written two novels about this question, says wearing the hijab can ""exhaust"" some young Muslim women in the West. ""You can sometimes feel like you're in a zoo: locked in the cage of other people's stereotypes, prejudices and judgments, on parade to be analyzed, deconstructed and reconstructed,"" says Abdel-Fattah, a Muslim who has Palestinian and Egyptian parents but was born in Australia. Abdel-Fattah says people should not assume that Muslim women who wear the hijab are being controlled by men. She, too, struggled with the choice of wearing a hijab when she was a teenager. ""When it comes to the hijab -- why to wear it, whether to wear it, how to wear it -- there is theology and then there is practice and there is huge diversity in both,"" says Abdel-Fattah, author of ""Does My Head Look Big in This?"" The surprising history behind the hijab . Some women say the hijab makes them feel like they're locked in a cage. But others say it leads to personal freedom. Sarah Hekmati first wore the hijab at age 15 growing up in Detroit, Michigan. She is the daughter of Iranian parents who left Iran in 1979 during the Islamic revolution. Hekmati says the hijab liberated her from some teenage angst: Does my hair look good? Am I cute enough? Should I lose weight? ""It gave me a sense of identity,"" she says. ""I really liked the purpose behind the hijab -- a woman covering herself so that a man should know her for her mind, not her body."" That purpose can be traced back to the Quran, Islam's holy text, which encourages women to dress modestly, says Faegheh Shirazi, author of ""The Veil Unveiled."" Some Muslims take the Quran's advice as a command for women to wear the hijab, while others disagree, she says. ""The Quran is very ambiguous about whether you have to wear the veil or not,"" Shirazi says. The hijab, however, actually predates Islam, Shirazi explains. The first known reference to veiling (Shirazi uses the term hijab and veil interchangeably) was made in an Assyrian legal text in the 13th century B.C., Shirazi says. In the Assyrian, and later, the Roman and Byzantine empires, the veil was a symbol of prestige and status, she says. By the 12th century, the veil had been imposed on women in the Muslim world to exclude them from public life, Shirazi says. ""A sign of distinction had been transformed into a sign of exclusion,"" she writes in her book. People are still debating the meaning of the hijab today. In 2007, British Muslim groups protested when schools were given the right to ban students from wearing full-face veils. In 2008, Turkey's top court upheld a ban on wearing Muslim headscarves at the country's universities. That same year, a Muslim woman was briefly jailed at a suburban Atlanta, Georgia, courthouse after refusing to remove her hijab in court. Some moms against hijab wearing . The debate over the hijab can literally hit home for some young Muslim women. Those that wear the hijab in the United States can befuddle their mothers, who often immigrated to the West so they could be free from wearing the hijab and other rules imposed on women. That's what happened to Hekmati, the Muslim-American from Detroit. Her mother, Behnaz, was puzzled by her daughter's decision to wear the hijab. Behnaz Hekmati grew up in Iran, where she did not wear the hijab. Young women who attended college in Iran like she did generally didn't wear the hijab, she says. Behnaz Hekmati warned her daughter that wearing the hijab would arouse the suspicion of Americans. ""I said Sarah, when you cover your head here the people think you are political -- they see you differently,"" Behnaz Hekmati says. Most of the trouble, though, came from Iranian-Americans, who came to the United States to escape the Islamic fundamentalists who seized power in 1979, she says. ""The Iranians here bother her more than Americans,"" Behnaz Hekmati says. ""They say, 'We got rid of you guys. We came here because we didn't want to see you guys anymore.'"" Hekmati was more concerned as a teenager about more personal issues, like her relations with boys. The hijab made it more difficult, she says. Few asked her on dates. Guys always seemed to put her in the ""friend category."" She wondered if she was attractive. ""I wondered at times: Am I always going to be a guy's friend and nothing more."" Strangers in public saw her as something else -- a subjugated woman. They looked at her with pity, she says. Some were just baffled. ""One guy asked me if I was allergic to the sun,"" Hekmati says. Abdelaziz, the New Jersey high school senior, also had her tense public encounters: angry looks, people feeling sorry for her or assuming her father ordered her to wear the hijab. ""It's not oppression; it's not that I'm accepting degradation -- it's about self-respect,"" she says. But it's more about faith as well. She says the hijab affirms ""Islam in the most respectful and purified way."" ""When you actually wear it, it opens your eyes,"" she says. ""It makes you want to explore your religious faith."" At times, Abdelaziz says she wonders what it would be like to attend her prom, get a tan at the beach and have a boyfriend. But she says her decision to honor her faith is already paying off. ""It really feels good,"" she says. ""It felt like I was missing something and now I'm complete. I finally understand my purpose.""","The hijab is the head scarf worn by Muslim women .

"(CNN) -- When Vincent Tan led a Malaysian takeover of Cardiff City in 2010, the Welsh soccer club was battling crippling debts -- and a long-awaited return to England's top flight was tantalizingly out of reach. The new owners, frustrated by two more near promotion misses, decided that a major overhaul was necessary. Along with major investment, the team's historic blue strip was last season changed to red to appeal to Asian supporters and a dragon put on the club crest in prominent place above its iconic bluebird. One Cardiff fan was so disillusioned that he auctioned his club loyalty on eBay. However, most supporters were won over when the ""Bluebirds"" clinched promotion to the Premier League as champions -- and their delight grew on Sunday with a shock victory over one of the richest clubs in the world. Manchester City traveled to the Welsh capital on the back of a 4-0 thrashing of Newcastle on the opening day of the season, but left smarting after a 3-2 defeat against a side widely tipped for an immediate return to division two. It was the first time Cardiff had hosted a top-flight match since 1962, and Malky Mackay's team had suffered a 2-0 defeat last weekend at West Ham -- a mid-table side last season. ""This was the first time that we've played at home in the Premier League, and the first time in 51 years that we've been in the top division, so it meant a lot to a lot of people,"" he told reporters after two goals from former Manchester United striker Fraizer Campbell set up victory. ""I'm very proud of a lot of people at the club; obviously the players but also the fans who made the atmosphere unbelievable today. Also, the people who work at the club, because they've been through some tough times -- to see them with smiles on their faces as I walked through the tunnel lightens my heart. ""Manchester City are one of the top teams in Britain and Europe, and are full of top Premier League talent."" As Manchester City's new manager Manuel Pellegrini commented afterwards: "" I did not expect to lose."" City, EPL champions two seasons ago, spent more than Â£100 million ($155 million) before the start of the season -- bankrolled by the club's oil-rich Abu Dhabi owners. However, it was Edin Dzeko -- himself a big-money buy during the tenure of previous manager Roberto Mancini -- who put the visitors ahead seven minutes after the break. But the Bosnia striker's stunning strike was soon canceled out by Cardiff's Iceland captain Aron Gunnarson, and one-cap England international Campbell then twice got the better of his marker Pablo Zabaleta to force home from successive corners. Substitute Alvaro Negredo, one of Pellegrini's acquisitions, gave the visiting City hope with a debut headed goal of his own in the 90th minute but Cardiff held on. ""Playing against a Manchester City team that only lost one game from a winning position last season, and to come back and show that character today -- I thought we deserved to win the game,"" Mackay said. ""My players are here on merit -- we proved that today."" Meanwhile, Tottenham became the third team to start with successive victories after beating the EPL's other Welsh club, Swansea, 1-0 on Sunday. New signing Roberto Soldado scored his fourth goal in three games as the London club joined Chelsea and Liverpool on six points. The Spain striker scored the only goal from the penalty spot in the second half, as he did against Crystal Palace last weekend before netting twice in the 5-0 Europa League thrashing of Dinamo Tbilisi. Gareth Bale, Tottenham's top scorer from last season, was given the weekend off due to his apparent injury. The Wales forward is expected to be unveiled by Real Madrid in a world-record signing next week, but Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas said he expected the player to be at training on Tuesday. ""There is interest from Real Madrid. Whether the transfer will happen or not, hopefully you will have more news in the next couple of days but at the moment there is nothing I can tell you,"" he added. ""Tomorrow is a day off. Tuesday is training so I would expect him to be there."" Villas-Boas wryly shrugged off Chelsea's Sunday announcement that the club had hijacked Tottenham's bid to sign Brazil forward Willian from Russian team Anzhi Makhachkala but confirmed that Steaua Bucharest defender Vlad Chiriches is set to join Spurs. ""Maybe someone will steal him as well,"" Villas-Boas joked. Chelsea, meanwhile,will face a big test of the club's title ambition under Villas-Boas' former mentor Jose Mourinho in Monday's clash with EPL champions Manchester United.","Promoted Cardiff shock big-spending Manchester City with 3-2 victory .

"(CNN) -- The mother of a Florida girl who jumped to her death announced Monday that she will sue those she believes responsible for her daughter's suicide -- less than a week after authorities dropped criminal charges against two girls accused of cyberbullying Rebecca Sedwick. The civil wrongful death lawsuit has not yet been filed, and mother Tricia Norman did not specify the targets of the future legal action. Rebecca, 12, died after jumping from the top of an abandoned concrete plant in September. Norman said Monday she wants to use her daughter's suicide ""to make society a better place to live."" ""I'm going to make sure other children are not tormented like my daughter was,"" Norman said in a news conference in Orlando. Authorities said Rebecca killed herself after months of cyberbullying from fellow students. The abusive behavior that authorities say prompted her suicide grew from a dispute between Rebecca and a former classmate over a boy they had both dated, police said in October. Should parents be criminally liable for kids' cyberbullying? Authorities initially charged two girls, ages 12 and 14, with aggravated stalking, but the charges were dropped last week. The state attorney's office declined to comment about the dropped charges and referred CNN to the girls' defense lawyers, who praised the decision and said there was no evidence of stalking. Police said the abuse included messages such as ""nobody cares about u,"" ""i hate u,"" and ""you seriously deserve to die."" Rebecca had already cut open her wrists months before the jump, but survived that suicide attempt. Norman's attorney, Matt Morgan, on Monday called on Florida lawmakers to come up with a ""Rebecca's Law"" -- legislation that Morgan says would allow the state to file bullying charges against minors and their parents.

"(CNN) -- He was the all-action American daredevil who was loved by all that knew him -- but Nick Mevoli's premature death after an ambitious dive has hit the freediving community hard. ""You don't meet many people like Nick,"" his close friend Grant Graves told CNN. ""He was the best diver in the U.S. -- the best. ""He was one of a kind,"" added Graves. ""I'd known him for two years and judged him too -- and he was the best."" Shock and sadness are the two overriding emotions which have surfaced since the man considered to be one of the best freedivers in the world lost his life while doing the thing he loved. The 32-year-old Mevoli, who lived in Brooklyn, New York, had hoped to reach 72 meters (236 feet) with one breath of oxygen without the assistance of fins. When he surfaced, he flashed the OK sign, before losing consciousness soon after, organizers said. William Trubridge, who organized the nine-day tournament canceled the event following Mevoli's death. Mevoli was going for a record at Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas. At 202 meters (663 feet), it is considered the world's deepest blue hole -- an underwater cave or sinkhole -- in seawater. Freedivers are extreme athletes, descending more than 100 meters -- the equivalent of a 30-storey building --without using an oxygen tank. At that depth, the diver's heart rate begins to slow, their blood vessels shrink and their lungs compress to the size of oranges under the huge force of water pressure.. The night before Mevoli died he sat and spoke with Graves. For both men, free diving was an overriding passion and they spent countless hours together talking through their dives, their lives, what lay ahead and what lay below. ""Nick was one of a kind. He was an incredibly passionate and driven man -- but he was also kind with it,"" added Graves. ""He was very sensitive and deep but he had this pitbull-like tenacity about him. ""We had lots of deep conversations. With diving a lot of it is about the mental aspect."" Mevoli, who was born in Florida, worked in the television industry while he pursuing his freediving hobby in his spare time. After making his first foray into competitions in 2012, he claimed second place at the inaugural Caribbean Cup in Roatan, first place at the Deja Blue tournament in CuraÃ§ao, and a silver medal in constant no fins at this year's AIDA Depth World Championship in Greece. In May, Mevoli became the first American man to dive down to 100 meters with a single breath -- an achievement which brought him a third national record. ""When he did mess up then he'd get really angry at himself and he was harsh on himself,"" said Graves. ""He was a guy who was very much in the moment. He wore his heart on his sleeve in a balanced way. ""He could feel very deeply but would always manage to put that to the side when diving. He was so focused."" Photographer Lia Barnett worked with Mevoli at the Caribbean Cup in Honduras earlier this year. ""He was just an all round good guy,"" Barett told CNN. ""He was very altruistic. He cared about others a great deal and did a lot of volunteering and was much loved by everybody."" According to Graves, Mevoli's death is the first to occur in competition in 21 years. ""We are very sad to report that earlier today Nicholas Mevoli (USA) tragically lost his life after a CNF dive to 72m,"" said Vertical Blue, which organized the competition, in a statement on its website. ""He was conscious when he surfaced but then blacked-out more than 30 seconds later. Emergency procedures were followed and despite receiving immediate medical attention, he failed to regain consciousness. ""At the moment we are all extremely shocked and saddened and trying to establish what happened. His family has been informed and all our thoughts and prayers are with them. ""Competition freediving has an enviable safety record but the sport can never be risk-free, something understood by all freedivers. ""We will give more details as soon as they emerge."" Vertical Blue, the competition organizers, paid its own tribute to Mevoli. A statement on its website read: ""At the end we honored his 32 years with a white-water celebration that echoed the celebrations of his many incredible dives."" Watch what freediving looks like .

"(CNN) -- A Chinese company plans to build a full-scale replica of RMS Titanic, complete with a simulation of an iceberg collision, at a theme park in Daying County, Sichuan Province, China. The RMB 1 billion ($165 million) model will be one of the key attractions at the Romandisea Seven Star International Cultural Tourism Resort, which will also feature a museum dedicated to the 1912 maritime tragedy, a man-made beach, Turkish baths and what is being called a ""6D cinema."" The park is slated to open in 2016. The ship's design will be based on the blueprint of Titanic's sister ship, RMS Olympic, and produced in a shipyard in Hubei Province, developer Seven Star Energy Investment Group said in an interview with Xinhua news. The sinking of the Titanic, on its maiden journey from Southampton to New York, resulted in more than 1,500 deaths and inspired James Cameron's hit film. The South China Morning Post said the replica will be permanently docked on the Qi River, some 930 miles from the nearest coast. But visitors will get to safely experience an iceberg ""collision"" thanks to a high-tech simulation involving light and sound effects. ""There are museums dedicated to Titanic in the U.S. and Europe,"" said Su Shaojun, chairman of Seven Star. ""It's time for China to honor the spirit of human responsibility -- how passengers tried to save one another as the ship sank.""

"(CNN) -- Genuine. Funny. The type of guy who'd give you the shirt off his back. That's how friends described Chad Wayne Oulson, who was fatally shot in a dispute about texting in a Florida cinema Monday. ""It is just going to be a huge hole in everybody's lives for him and his family. He'd give you the shirt off his back if he needed to,"" Joseph Trapani told CNN affiliate WFTS. Oulson, 43, was with his wife at the Grove 16 theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel, where they were about to watch the Peter Berg film ""Lone Survivor."" They were on a lunch and movie date, WFTS reported. Her friends said that Oulson's wife had taken off from work to spend the day with her husband during time off from his job. She works for USAA selling insurance, while Oulson did financial work for SKY Powersports in Port Richey, the affiliate said. At the movies, a confrontation arose between Oulson and a 71-year-old retired police officer when Oulson sent a text message during previews to his young daughter, police said. The former officer, Curtis Reeves, told Oulson to put away his cell phone, and a subsequent dispute ended when Reeves allegedly shot Oulson. Oulson's wife was shot in her hand when she raised it as the bullet was fired, police said. The single bullet then went into Oulson's chest. ""She's a wreck. I mean she just lost her husband, the father of her little girl over something that should have never happened,"" WFTS reported Trapani said. Reeves, a former Tampa Police Department officer, has been charged with second-degree murder. He was denied bond during his first court appearance Tuesday. According to an obituary on the website of Loyless Funeral Home in Land O'Lakes, Florida, a memorial service for Oulson is scheduled for Saturday. He was born in Alton, Illinois, and spent the last 20 years in Florida, according to the obituary. Oulson served in the U.S. Navy from 1990 to 1997 and was an aviation maintenance administration petty officer 2nd class, according to Navy news desk Lt. Richlyn Neal. He served during Operation Desert Storm. Oulson rode dirt bikes, loved boating, and was a motor cross enthusiast. He was a devoted father and husband. A sensational crime that strikes many chords .

I remember when we all first started hanging out, I would tell him it's like hanging out with my brother because we would pick at each other make fun of each other, give a hard time,"" Glenda O'Meara, a friend, told CNN affiliate WTSP. Saverio Mongelli, a friend and neighbor, told WFTS that Oulson was always at the pool playing with kids. He loved water and his daughter. ""Good, genuine person, funny guy,"" Mongelli said before breaking into tears. An autopsy on Oulson's body was to be conducted Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- A little over ten years ago the coral reefs of Pemuteran Bay in Bali, Indonesia, were in a state of terminal decay. Fishing with dynamite and cyanide, untreated sewage and rising water temperatures had all pushed the reefs, and life they supported, close to the limit. ""Tourist numbers fell due to destruction of dive and snorkeling sites (while) fishermen had to go further and fish longer for less catch. Hunger was a real threat,"" says Narayana Randall Dodge, project manager of the Pemuteran Coral Regeneration project. The fact that the reef also acted as a natural flood barrier increased the town's exposure to coastal erosion from rising sea levels, he adds. Today however, Pemuteran Bay's coral reefs are once again teeming with life thanks to Biorock -- an electrically-powered coral reef growing scheme. Coral is placed on underwater electrified steel frames that are connected to a power source on land. The electrification speeds up a process called ""mineral accretion"" that helps damaged corals grow and repair themselves. ""Living corals are carefully collected and transplanted onto the structures by attaching with wires or wedged between (electric) steel bars,"" says Narayana . The project has been so successful that not only has it preserved the reef and surrounding marine ecosystem but it has also become a tourist attraction in its own right, says Narayana. Despite the success of the Pemuteran Bay project, Biorock technology -- first discovered by German-born architect, Wolf Hilbertz, in the 1970s -- is it still only used on a small scale. Although now present in over 20 countries, the largest Biorock scheme is in Pemuteran Bay and only covers around 500 meters. This constitutes a drop in the ocean when compared to the 109,800 square miles of coral reef that the United Nations Environment Program estimates to exist, 75% of which is believed to be under threat according to the World Resources Institute. Read more about the threat to coral reef diversity . But according to Thomas Goreau, head of the U.S. based non-profit, the Global Coral Reef Alliance, Biorock is more efficient than any other form of reef regeneration and will become a particularly effective defense against rising sea levels in years to come. ""We have to run cables out into the sea and you can only go so far before you lose a lot of power,"" says Goreau who works to encourage the implementation of Biorock technology in vulnerable ecosystems. The cables dictates how far out at sea the steel frames can be placed (only a few hundred meters) and therefore limits the area of coral reef that can be grown or repaired . As the technology develops though, Goreau sees no reason why Biorock structures couldn't stretch across hundreds of miles of shoreline or far out into the oceans, protecting vast coastal areas that are exposed to rising sea levels. The key to this prospect becoming a reality, he says, is the harnessing of renewable sources such as tidal and wave energy. ""There is a vast amount of energy in the ocean. It's untapped and what it will allow us to do is generate our power on site,"" says Goreau. ""This renewably powered technology is still in the pioneering stage but it will be far cheaper and far more effective when it becomes available.""","Coral reefs in Indonesia are being regrown on electrically powered steel frames .

"(CNN) -- As ""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson returns from his brief ""hiatus,"" he'll do so to the cheers of some surprising supporters â€” southern blacks. Robertson was suspended from the A&E hit show for calling homosexuality a sin and equating it to bestiality in a GQ profile. Receiving less attention were his comments that black people were happier before the civil rights movement. Media have focused on two camps in the controversy. On one side are Robertson's predictable supporters, who include white evangelicals, southern Republican politicians and Fox News. On the opposing team are LBGT activists and progressives. But while Robertson's comments have roiled members of MSNBC's black media elite such as Al Sharpton, Melissa Perry and Joy Reid, Robertson has found pockets of support among church-going, middle-class African Americans. Though I grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana, a city a little over an hour's drive from the Robertson's empire in West Monroe, I've spent my adult life in Washington. So when a high school Facebook friend posted a 10-paragraph open letter of support to A&E for Robertson, which was signed ""Everyone who isn't a left wing extremist (AKA your former customer base),"" I was a bit surprised. In my view, Robertson's comments regarding both homosexuals and African Americans suggest he lacks empathy and the ability to think critically. To be preoccupied with the ""sin"" of 3 percent to 6 percent of the population seems as off-base as the idea that a people could be happy with second-class citizenship. My Facebook friend never confirmed penning the letter he posted, which received nearly 50 ""Likes"" from other college-educated black professionals and blue-collar types. The comments ranged from analogies, ""Where would we be if Rosa Parks had went to the back of the bus. She had rights, he has rights,"" to concern, ""Have you noticed that anything and everything can be said about Christians now. Our beliefs are now wrong and we are outdated."" When two commenters pointed out Robertson's misguided remarks about black people ""singing"" while working the fields, they were quickly rebuffed with, ""From what I heard him say What HE SAW. Are you saying that there aren't blacks who weren't like he said."" Because support for Robertson seemed to be fueled by religious beliefs, I sought some insight from Bishop Larry L. Brandon, pastor of Praise Temple Full Gospel Baptist Church in Shreveport. The bishop explained that though he was ""deeply concerned"" with how Robertson expressed his spiritual views on homosexuality, he added, ""I can't twist scripture to suit a lifestyle ... I speak the truth in love."" Indeed, Brandon's position is held most strongly by the black church. A 2013 Pew Research Center poll found that while the percentage of white evangelicals, mainliners and Catholics who believe homosexual behavior is a sin has dropped 4, 5, and 14 percentage points, respectively, since a similar poll was conducted in 2003, the percentage of black Protestants who regard homosexual behavior as a sin has actually increased 5 points to 79%. Many disagree with Robertson's portrayal of Jim Crow-era African Americans. Brandon said: ""While I believe Robertson has freedom of speech, I respectfully disagree with his remarks regarding black people. In my humble opinion, while our community has a history of overcoming adversity, making lemons out of lemonade regardless of the difficulty of the situation, one should not mistake our ability to endure with our actually enjoying abuse."" LZ Granderson: ""Duck Dynasty"" star's rights weren't violated . Not all of Robertson's black support is due to religious convictions. Black hunters share a pastime with the Robertson clan. While home for Christmas, an uncle who loves ""Duck Dynasty"" shared his perspective with me on camera. Uncle Michael Smith is 53 and has been a hunter all of his adult life. He owns a home, attends church and votes in every election. He honed his hunting skills watching TV outdoorsmen like Roland Martin and Jimmy Houston. For him, ""Duck Dynasty"" is an extension of the hunting show genre he loves. Uncle Michael explained Robertson's comments this way: ""The way (Robertson) talks, it's old talk ...The new generation is a whole lot different. Everything is out in the open ...The comment (Robertson) made (about homosexuality) probably was taught to him at a young age, but I do believe he just made a mistake. He apologized, so I'm gonna continue to watch the show if it keeps coming on."" S.E. Cupp: Don't reject ""Duck Dynasty"" family . While my uncle was unfazed by Robertson's comments about black people, some family members were put off. As a child in the late '70s, I had occasion to scale perch, pick bushels of purple-hull peas and use an outhouse. I've heard kin describe what it's like to pick cotton (hot and painful), and they never sounded happy about it, but another story told in my family might explain the ""happy"" put-on. Annually, my grandmother recounts my Uncle James' Christmas Day birth, explaining that because the hospital was understaffed and didn't execute his birth certificate until the next day, his birth date is listed as December 26. As in past years, someone asked my grandmother why she didn't point out the mistake. Her eyes grew wide, and she shook her head violently. ""No! You don't understand,"" she tells us. ""I was at Charity Hospital! Those white doctors didn't talk to us, and we didn't question them."" While my grandmother was in labor, her mother and aunt would wait in a closet-size room reserved for Negroes. Once a black child was born, a nurse would enter the room with her back to its occupants and write on a chalkboard the mother's name, the baby's sex and weight, and whether the baby was dead or alive. With a frown, my grandmother added, ""The only thing they ever said to me was, 'Guurl, what you gon' name this baby?'"" That my grandmother would not point out such a mistake is unfathomable to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We only know of her strength. To us she is the lifelong domestic who birthed nine healthy babies, buried two grown sons and slept in the bed her husband had died in hours earlier. But in her eyes, when she tells this story, I can see her vulnerability, her fear that ""they'd send me home and not let me come back."" Shannan Hicks, a researcher and storyteller who focuses on the Northern Louisiana post-Jim Crow era, is not surprised that black workers shielded their true feelings from Robertson. ""This was the age of black lynchings. A black person would never have reveled their true self to a white person who looked and talked like Robertson,"" Hicks said before referencing the Paul Laurence Dunbar poem that opens with this stanza: . We wear the mask that grins and lies, . It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,â€” This debt we pay to human guile; . With torn and bleeding hearts we smile, . And mouth with myriad subtleties. Since my visit home, I've thought a lot about Brandon's last comments regarding what he believed to be Robertson's greatest offense â€” saying that homosexuals ""won't inherit the kingdom of God."" The bishop emphasized: ""Only the Lord has the right to condemn one to hell or lift them to heaven. God is our judge."" Clearly, the big guy has his work cut out for him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Yolanda Young.","""Duck Dynasty"" star Phil Robertson returns in new episodes after controversial comments .

"(CNN) -- The crowd at the base of the Space Needle in Seattle began counting down as midnight approached. It wasn't New Year's Day they were anticipating, but the moment that marijuana would become legal in Washington state. As midnight hit, smokers hit their pipes and joints to celebrate. Technically, what they were doing -- smoking marijuana in public -- was still a crime, but police looked the other way. ""It's amazing. I'm not a criminal anymore,"" one pot smoker said. ""I can't go to jail for small amounts of marijuana. I'm free to be free."" But a legal haze still engulfed pot smokers Thursday, when possession of up to an ounce of marijuana by adults become legal, though growing and selling it remains a crime. Initiative 502, passed last month by Washington voters, legalized recreational marijuana use starting December 6, but it will take a year before there are rules for growing and selling it. ""It begs the question, if they can't buy it through a medical marijuana shop, which only people with a prescription and medical marijuana license can, how do they get it?"" Washington State Liquor Control Board spokesman Brian Smith said Wednesday. Growing and selling marijuana will still be prosecuted as a felony, King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg told CNN.

""If you stumble across some on the street or it falls from the sky, then you can have it. Otherwise, you are part of a criminal chain of distribution."" Until the state takes over managing marijuana sales, the black market will thrive as it meets consumer demands, Satterberg said. Recreational pot smokers in Colorado could gain quicker legal access to marijuana thanks to that state's ""sophisticated and pretty elaborate"" medical marijuana system already in place, Smith said. Gov. John Hickenlooper has up to a month to sign into law Colorado's pot decriminalization initiative after its passage is certified Thursday. Trafficking in marijuana is still a federal crime, but the governors of Washington and Colorado have appealed to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to clarify how the Justice Department will view recreational pot sales in their states. ""We don't want to go and spend serious resources only to have it stopped by the federal government,"" Smith said. ""It would sure help Washington state if they weighed in and made clear their expectations."" The Justice Department is reviewing the new state laws, the U.S. attorney's office said Wednesday. But it said that the department's responsibility to enforce the Controlled Substances Act has not changed. Richard Branson: War on drugs a trillion-dollar failure . ""Regardless of any changes in state law, including the change that will go into effect on December 6 in Washington state, growing, selling or possessing any amount of marijuana remains illegal under federal law. Members of the public are also advised to remember that it remains against federal law to bring any amount of marijuana onto federal property, including all federal buildings, national parks and forests, military installations and courthouses."" Twenty Colorado business groups have appealed to Holder to enforce federal pot laws, because of questions about how to deal with workers who are high. ""There is uncertainty about our ability to terminate employees if they come to the job impaired,"" said Sandra Hagen Solin of the Northern Colorado Legislative Alliance. ""There are obligations that we have under the drug-free workplace. There are a lot of questions that have arisen."" Satterberg predicted the Justice Department will intervene with a lawsuit, which could drag on for years. Read more: Is medical marijuana safe for children? Seattle police offered a guidebook explaining Washington's new law. People 21 and older can possess up to an ounce of marijuana -- or 16 ounces of solid, marijuana-infused product, like cookies, or 72 ounces of infused liquid, like oil -- for personal use, the guide says, . ""Please note that the initiative says it 'is unlawful to open a package containing marijuana ... in view of the general public,' so there's that,"" it adds. ""The Seattle Police Department will continue to enforce laws against unlicensed sale or production of marijuana, and regulations against driving under the influence of marijuana, which remains illegal,"" the book says. Growing marijuana at home and selling it to friends or family remains against the law, the guide says. But, it adds, ""In the future, under state law, you may be able to get a license to grow or sell marijuana."" Smoking pot in public, like having an open beer, ""could result in a civil infraction -- like a ticket -- but not arrest,"" it says. In fact, Seattle police officers have been advised not to take any enforcement action other than to issue a verbal warning, if the new law is violated. ""You can certainly use marijuana in the privacy of your own home,"" the guide says. ""Additionally, if smoking a cigarette isn't allowed where you are (say, inside an apartment building or flammable chemical factory), smoking marijuana isn't allowed there either."" What if an officer suspects a motorist is under the influence of pot? ""If an officer believes you're driving under the influence of anything, they will conduct a field sobriety test and may consult with a drug recognition expert,"" it says. ""If officers establish probable cause, they will bring you to a precinct and ask your permission to draw your blood for testing. If officers have reason to believe you're under the influence of something, they can get a warrant for a blood draw from a judge. If you're in a serious accident, then a blood draw will be mandatory."" No longer will the smell of marijuana emanating from a vehicle lead to a search unless the officer has ""information that you're trafficking, producing or delivering marijuana in violation of state law,"" it says. Seattle does not hire police officers who have used marijuana in the previous three years, but the department is consulting its lawyers ""to see if and how that standard may be revised."" Pot use and possession by anyone under age 21 is still a violation of state law. ""It may be referred to prosecutors, just like if you were a minor in possession of alcohol,"" the police guide says.

"(CNN) -- What is it with juries in high-profile cases in Southern California? Over the years, they've become a national joke. But no one is laughing. Instead, with each travesty of justice and every acquittal that should have been a conviction, you're left wondering just what trial these 12 folks were watching and questioning whether we should have higher standards for who sits on a jury. Sometimes, the juries in local and state courts get it wrong, and the Justice Department must step in and make it right. Think back to the acquittal in April 1992 of four Los Angeles police officers who, one year earlier, savagely beat motorist Rodney King. They walked out of a courtroom in Simi Valley, California, as free men -- sparking days of rioting, looting and violence. At the time, the conventional thinking on newspaper editorial pages and on talk radio was the jurors in that largely white suburb of Los Angeles, which was itself home to many active-duty and retired police officers, saw the police force as their line of defense against undesirables like King. So naturally, the argument went, they would cut them some slack. The officers were tried again, and convicted in federal court of violating King's civil rights. Justice was finally served. Here we go again. There hasn't been much civil unrest over what happened to Kelly Thomas, the homeless and mentally ill man who -- on July 5, 2011 -- was beaten to death by a swarm of police officers in Fullerton, California. But now that the verdict is in, literally, on the two former officers who were charged in his death, there is plenty of outrage on talk radio, online and in other public forums. Another 12 people who swore an oath to consider the evidence and the law and make sure that justice is served appear to have gotten it terribly wrong. This week, that jury in Santa Ana, California -- a city about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles -- produced a wave of gasps in the courtroom when it announced that it had found Manuel Ramos, who had been charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Jay Cicinelli, who was charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force, not guilty on all counts. What? The beating was caught on a surveillance tape. When you watch those 33 minutes of footage, assuming you can stomach the experience, it's hard to believe that anyone could declare the perpetrators ""not guilty."" The surveillance camera footage shows Thomas being beaten and stunned with a Taser by police until he was unrecognizable and unconscious. You see a defenseless and compliant young man screaming in pain, saying he's sorry and pleading for help from his father. His words will haunt you, ""Daddy, help! They're killing me!"" According to prosecutors, the young man suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, broken ribs and extensive bruises and abrasions. He wound up lying in a pool of blood. He died five days later. This was not a by-the-book case of police officers using all necessary force to subdue a suspect who was resisting arrest -- a suspect, by the way, who had committed no crime. This was not, as Ramos' attorney claimed, a case of police offices simply ""doing their job"" with ""no malice in their heart."" Check the video. Early on in the confrontation, Ramos appears to tell the young man who is sitting on the ground: ""You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up!"" Another officer is heard telling a comrade: ""We ran out of options so I got to the end of my Taser and I ... smashed his face to hell."" There is the malice. This was abuse of power and an instance of bullying behind a badge. It happens more than we'd like to think in America. But this time, it went too far. And a man died, and a family was shattered. Yet, the jury somehow missed all this? How does this happen? In Los Angeles, people are saying that the mentally ill are the new Rodney King. In the same way that the jury in Simi Valley was inclined to back the officers who it saw as protecting them from people like King, now the jury in Santa Ana is backing the officers who it counts on to prod people like Thomas to move along, leave the streets, and get out of sight. It's a plausible explanation. Human beings aren't perfect, and sometimes those who sit on juries are plagued by their own prejudices -- in this case, against those who behave in erratic ways which we don't understand. This much we can understand: Cops are supposed to protect the weak, not prey on them. Just like they're supposed to protect all of us. The tragedy of Kelly Thomas raises a question: When police officers lose control and go from public servants to violent bullies, who will protect us from them? In this case, there is only one answer and one place left that can right this wrong: The Justice Department. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Too many high-profile cases in California produce travesties of justice .

"Washington (CNN) -- Washington's newest, furriest power player has been given a clean bill of health, the National Zoo said Tuesday. Not so giant yet, the giant panda cub weighed in at a little less than 2 pounds, up from the almost 5 ounces she weighed when she was first examined two days after she was born. She still hasn't opened her eyes yet and measures 10.6 inches long from nose to tail, the zoo said in a statement. Zoo officials are waiting 100 days to name the female cub in accordance with Chinese tradition. Born August 23, she has spent much of the last three weeks cradled in her mother's arms, the zoo said. Mother panda Mei Xiang (may-SHONG) placed her cub down and left her den Monday at 4:11 p.m., just the opportunity zoo officials had been waiting for to conduct an examination. The panda team moved in and performed a lightning fast veterinary exam, completing it by 4:31 p.m. When Mei Xiang returned to the den after the examination was completed, she immediately picked up the cub and began grooming her. ""It's amazing to see how much she has grown in less than one month,"" senior mammal curator Brandie Smith, said in the statement. ""Mei Xiang continues to be a great mom, as she was with her first cub, Tai Shan, and it shows."" The panda habitat will remain closed to the public for now to provide mother and cub needed quiet.

"(CNN) -- Britney Spears' latest album is supposed to be intimate, but it's left a number of critics cold. The 32-year-old singer's eighth record, ""Britney Jean,"" was officially released on Tuesday after streaming on iTunes for the past week. As early reactions indicated, ""Britney Jean"" isn't quite as warm and inviting as Spears has made it sound. ""I poured my heart and soul into this album,"" Spears told her fans in an open letter on her website. ""I know I keep telling you it is my most personal record yet, but it's true and I'm really proud of that. I have been through a lot in the past few years and it has really inspired me to dig deeper and write songs that I think everyone can relate to."" Yet to Entertainment Weekly, which gave the album a B+ grade, ""Britney Jean"" ""tells you virtually bupkus about her struggles over the years. But in just 10 tidy songs, it brings us closer than ever before to that distant dreamer."" The Washington Post wasn't as gentle in its review, finding that the ironic lack of intimacy on ""Britney Jean"" makes the disc ""instantly forgettable."" ""The result isn't remotely personal, doesn't venture much beyond the usual Britney themes -- fame is confusing, sex is fun, I am a totally normal person with the same worries as you, let's dance -- and will do nothing to reassure anyone that the once familiar, pre-2007 Britney is in there anywhere,"" the review says. The Atlantic agrees, dismissing ""Britney Jean"" as Spears' ""most disappointing release yet, a snoozefest of shallow mid-tempos and limp club tracks that chase trends rather than invent them. And the glimpses into Britney Jean Spears, the artist, are, frankly, neither interesting nor informative."" The Los Angeles Times warns that ""whatever unique skills Spears once had -- what were they again, anyway? -- 'Britney Jean' suggests she better prepare herself for the reality that she's losing them fast. ... There's very little beneath the album's many cliches to suggest insight, let alone the unfiltered honesty of autobiography."" That said, if you're a fan of post-2007 Spears, which includes the smash album ""Blackout,"" then ""Britney Jean"" might be your cup of dance-pop tea. Rolling Stone gave Spears' effort three-and-a-half stars, appraising ""Britney Jean"" as continuing ""the roll she's been on in recent years. ... Like her excellent late-summer electro-sleaze hit, 'Work B***h,' 'Britney Jean' adds up the high price of stardom. It's a concept album about the loneliness of pop life -- with a high-profile broken engagement behind her, Brit gets personal and drops her most bummed-out music ever."" MTV, too, was able to see the heart underneath the driving beat. ""Most of the tracks sound like a wild night out,"" the network said in an early review. But added ""it's when you dig under all the reverb and EDM beats that you hear that 'Britney Jean' really is coming from her heart -- one beating at 500 miles an hour.""","Britney Spears' eighth studio album was released on December 3 .

"(CNN) -- Up for auction: Spanish airport costing up to a reported $1.5 billion, little used. Starting price? $150 million. If that sounds improbable, you haven't been keeping up with the fallout from Spain's burst property bubble. The fire sale of the country's first private international airport has become a powerful symbol of the economic downturn triggered by that implosion. With a 4,400-meter-long runway, Europe's longest, on which the world's largest airliner, the Airbus 380, can land, Ciudad Real International Airport sounds as if it has quite a lot going for it. Accepting bids from this week until December 27, the five-year-old facility 200 kilometers south of Madrid also has a passenger capacity of 10 million people a year and, something rare for an airport, star quality. Last year, the Oscar-winning Spanish director Pedro Almodovar shot part of his last film, the high-flying romp ""I'm So Excited!"", at the so-called ""ghost airport,"" the Australian reports. 'Don't land here!' Plus points aside, what the airport equivalent of real estate agents might try to gloss over are the huge yellow crosses painted all over the runway. Like hoardings on an abandoned building to keep squatters out, they're designed to stop pilots landing at the airport by accident, where they could only recently have found themselves surrounded by a gaggle of Almodovar's actors playing screamingly camp air crew. Which would have been confusing. Another downside is that location, which sounds as though it might have been breezily dismissed amid the giddy excitement of the aforementioned 10-year development boom. No one really goes to Ciudad Real, at least not on vacation. Lonely Planet calls it ""an unspectacular Spanish working town."" The sparsely populated surrounding region of Castile-La Mancha is where the Spanish literary character Don Quixote famously ""tilted at windmills."" Indeed, the airport was first called Aeropuerto Don Quijote. Cervantes' hero also gave rise to the word ""quixotic,"" meaning extravagant, unrealistic and impractical. Hmm. More: Man wakes up locked in on United jet . 'Near Madrid' The airport was meant to serve the Spanish capital and the Andalusian coast by high speed rail, but it appears to have been planned in the same vein as other far-flung but optimistically named airports, such as Paris Beauvais TillÃ© (85 kilometers from the French capital). Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Air Berlin flew in to Ciudad Real International, but the airport opened in the same year, 2008, as the bursting of the Spanish property bubble tipped the country's economy into double-dip recession. By 2012, the airport's custom had dwindled to a few private arrivals, including Prince Harry reportedly flying in for a boar hunt. Later that same year, its operators having filed for bankruptcy, the airport closed for business. Only to open up, now, for bids. In a statement to CNN, however, Francisco Perez, one of the bankruptcy administrators, insisted that widely published reports about the $1.5 billion cost to build the airport were untrue. The actual construction cost was only about one-third of that, he said, but it was difficult to determine the overall price tag due to a large number of pending court cases by property owners over expropriation costs for the land where the airport was built. ""We are aware that inside and outside of Spain there's the idea that building this airport was absurd and doesn't make sense economically because it's an airport 'without passengers,'"" Perez wrote. ""Nevertheless...that has nothing to do with reality. ""It's an airport mainly aimed at business and industrial activity -- air cargo and [other] businesses in the aeronautical industry,"" he said in the statement. ""There is a large amount of unbuilt land, zoned for industrial use, around the airport that is being offered to the buyer as part of the airport package,"" he added. Princely sum . Who'd buy an airport? An idle Saudi prince? They probably get enough sun. Amazon's Jeff Bezos could snap it up: he might save on freight. Or maybe Ryanair should actually buy its own airport. They say every cloud has a silver lining. For now, Ciudad Real International is waiting for one to appear.","Airport costing $1.5 billion is for sale at $150 million .

"(CNN) -- A family of six survived two days in wintry Nevada mountains by starting a fire and then bringing warm rocks into their overturned Jeep, preventing frostbite to the couple and four small children, local residents said Tuesday. When three residents finally found the family and their vehicle during a massive search, the family had little food left, so resident Salvador Paredes pulled a candy bar from his pocket and shared it with them, Paredes said. In a search involving 200 people, rescuers finally located the family on Tuesday after they had gone missing two days earlier during a playful outing in the snow in mountainous northwest Nevada. Temperatures on Monday morning, hours after the family disappeared, were about 21 degrees below zero, officials said. Winds were relatively light. The group was found safe in an area called Trinity Canyon, according to the Pershing County Sheriff's Office. They were discovered from a distance by a volunteer searcher using binoculars to scan mountainsides, the sheriff's office said. It wasn't immediately clear which of the three residents made the discovery. All six were in stable condition with ""no frostbite, just some exposure issues,"" said Patty Bianchi, CEO of Pershing General Hospital. The family consists of a man and woman who have two children together; the woman also was traveling with her nephew and niece, the sheriff's office said. The adults ""did a fabulous job keeping them warm,"" Bianchi said, referring to the children. Dr. Doug Vacek said all six were doing ""very well,"" but he had no timetable for their release. ""They just expressed that they're really happy and they're going to enjoy this Christmas"" more than usual, he told reporters. Their Jeep softly rolled onto one side while on a dirt road, went down an embankment and landed in a crevice about 15 miles from Lovelock, said Sheila Reitz of the Pershing County Sheriff's Office. It was upside down when rescuers arrived. Chris Montes, another of the rescuers, told CNN on Tuesday night that ""obviously they knew what to do. They kept those kids safe 48 hours in subzero temperatures."" The group apparently ran out of food on Monday, he said. The children, ages 3 to 10, Montes said, ""did not seem too bothered. They were in good spirits. They just figured they were camping."" Joining Montes in finding the family was Paredes and his fiancee, who will marry this weekend. Survival expert Joseph Teti said the adults ""made all the right decisions."" It's the little decisions that add up to an enhanced chance for survival in brutal conditions, he said: Staying near the vehicle, telling people where you are traveling and refusing to panic. ""Mother Nature will not allow you to make too many mistakes at all,"" said Teti, co-star of Discovery Channel's ""Dual Survival."" The discovery came about midday Tuesday as more than 200 people scoured a vast frozen range of Nevada spanning 6,000 square miles. Officials remained undaunted despite the fact they no longer received pings off the cell phone of the missing persons, Reitz said. On Monday, authorities had been encouraged when they were able to receive a couple of pings from the phone of James Glanton, 34, officials said. Cell service is spotty because the area is so remote. Also rescued were Glanton's girlfriend, Christina McIntee, 25, along with their two children -- Evan and Chloe -- and McIntee's niece and nephew. They all set out to play in the snow in the Seven Troughs mountain range Sunday. A massive search for them involved vehicles, planes and helicopters, Reitz said. The Civil Air Patrol, an auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, said its cell phone forensics experts ""played a critical role in helping rescuers narrow the search area,"" according to a statement by the patrol. ""The cell phone forensics team pinpointed where they could not possibly be,"" Nevada Wing Commander Col. Tim Hahn said in a statement. The forensic efforts ""were very time-consuming,"" he said. ""This morning they provided a key clue that redirected the search and led to the rescue,"" Hahn said. One of the CAP crews spotted the family's silver 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee about the same time that the searcher with binoculars found the lost group, the patrol said. The Air Force Rescue Coordination Center will award the Nevada Wing with six saves, Hahn said. The children's ages are 10, 4, 4 and 3, the patrol said. Amanda Fitzpatrick, mother of 10-year-old Shelby Fitzpatrick, one of the missing children, joined the search in the bitter cold. ""It's been extremely hard, probably the hardest 24 to 36 hours of my life,"" she earlier told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""It's my baby girl."" The family's disappearance was among the most dramatic developments in the Arctic-like weather shocking much of the Lower 48 states. Big flakes of wet snow and ice snarled travel across the country Tuesday and hit major airline hubs in the Northeast, with about 1,200 flight cancellations reported by Tuesday evening. Temperatures in storm-stricken parts of the country are expected to stay about 10 to 20 degrees below normal for the rest of the week, the National Weather Service said. CNN's Ralph Ellis, Holly Yan, Miguel Marquez, Carma Hassan, Sarah Aarthun, Chuck Conder, Shane Deitert, Stephanie Elam, Randi Kaye, Chuck Johnston, Judson Jones and Casey Wian contributed to this report.","Rescuer describes finding the family to CNN .

"(CNN) -- Juventus cast aside the disappointment of crashing out in the Champions League group stage, thumping Sassuolo 4-0 in Serie A on Sunday. The three points were much welcomed by Juve, which exited Europe's top club competition in snowy Istanbul, and Carlos Tevez's hat-trick would have pleased the Argentine striker, too. Tevez also set up Federico Peluso's headed goal with a free kick. Tevez had only hit the back of the net once in his previous seven appearances. Even though Sassuolo hovered just above the relegation zone prior to kickoff, its play in the last month suggested Juventus might struggle. But Tevez's early goal -- in the 15th minute -- put the visitor under pressure at the Juventus Stadium in Turin. He added efforts in the 45th and 68th minutes. Sassuolo rarely troubled Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon without the services of leading scorer Domenico Berardi -- who is on loan from the Old Lady. Juventus, the reigning Italian champion, moved six points clear of Roma, which visits AC Milan in a high-profile encounter Monday. And in the league, Juventus has won eight in a row without conceding. ""It was a good way to make amends for Wednesday,"" Buffon told Sky Italia. ""The elimination hurt us, but now there's another trophy we now have to try and win."" Veteran German striker Miroslav Klose returned from injury and provided some relief for Lazio manager Vladimir Petkovic, scoring both goals in a 2-0 win over Livorno. Petkovic was under pressure following a spell of six league games without a victory. Giuseppe Rossi scored his league-leading 13th goal -- three better than Tevez -- in Fiorentina's 3-0 win over Bologna. In Sunday's late kickoff, Napoli doubled 10-man Inter 4-2 to close in on Roma. Atletico keeps pace with Barca . In Spain, Atletico Madrid rejoined Barcelona on points at the top of La Liga after a stunning second-half performance against Valencia. Diego Costa scored twice to tie Cristiano Ronaldo on 17 league goals and Madrid's less famous team blanked Valencia 3-0. Between his goals, Costa was denied from the spot by Diego Alves. Valencia -- in mid table -- matched Atletico in the first half but the home side upped the tempo in the second. Costa worked his way into the box in the 59th minute and Alves couldn't keep out his low shot. Alves, however, had little chance on Raul Garcia's rocket in the 63rd minute. Alves saved Costa's penalty in the 74th minute but Costa was fouled again in the box and this time converted in the 81st. Atletico and Barcelona each have 43 points and the same goal difference but Barca has scored one more goal. The sides meet in early January. A good day for Bayern . It was a good day for Bayern Munich -- and the Bavarians didn't even play.

"(CNN) -- For a governor described as a ""my way or the highway"" kind of guy, Chris Christie sounded mighty conciliatory on Tuesday in trying to move his administration and his 2016 presidential ambitions past a swirling controversy over alleged political retribution. The New Jersey Republican repeatedly emphasized bipartisan efforts and working together in a State of the State address that took on special prominence because of investigations into whether his staff orchestrated traffic gridlock near the country's busiest bridge to punish a Democratic mayor for refusing to endorse his re-election last year. With the national spotlight on an annual speech normally given little attention outside the state, Christie sought to reframe the political focus away from the George Washington Bridge controversy by citing the successes of his first term and calling for cooperation from the Democratic-led state Assembly and Senate. First came the bad, with Christie addressing the scandal in his first sentences by accepting ultimate responsibility even though he said last week he knew nothing about it. ""Mistakes were clearly made, and as a result, we let down the people we are entrusted to serve,"" Christie told state legislators gathered in Trenton for the speech intended to outline policy plans for the state. His administration will cooperate ""with all appropriate inquiries"" into the controversy to ""ensure this breach of trust does not happen again,"" Christie said before shifting away from the issue by saying the scandal ""does not define us or our state"" and will not delay ""the work that needs to be done to improve the people's lives in New Jersey."" Instead, Christie emphasized economic successes of his first term and called for cooperation from the Democratic-led state Assembly and Senate. In a span of 10 paragraphs, he used the word ""we"" 17 times in describing specific achievements such as job creation and economic growth. Outlining a conservative agenda of no additional taxes and more law enforcement, the recently re-elected governor also proposed education reforms and programs to help drug offenders rejoin society. The most emotional moment came well into the nearly hour-long address when Christie told the story of Craig Hanlon, a former drug addict from his hometown now working as a practicing attorney. Hanlon, who was seated near the front, stood up and hugged the governor to a lengthy ovation. By tradition, legislators stood and applauded when Christie arrived, and he received repeated ovations when citing accomplishments of his first term and outlining new proposals. However, the bridge controversy remains prominent for the early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Last week, the New Jersey State Assembly committee investigating the matter made public more than 2,000 pages of documents suggesting politics was behind the unannounced lane closures on the New Jersey side of the bridge last September that caused traffic gridlock in Fort Lee. The documents suggest that top Christie aides orchestrated the traffic mess to punish that town's mayor for not endorsing their boss, and that they allegedly tried to stonewall media inquiries into the matter. N.J. Dem on bridge scandal: I think laws were broken . Christie fired one top adviser for her apparent role in the scandal and other key advisers have left their jobs. He has repeatedly apologized for being ""blindsided"" by what his aides and appointees were doing. After Christie's reference to the controversy in Tuesday's speech, a top Democrat in the New Jersey legislature who heads an investigating panel rejected the governor's insistence he knew nothing about the lane closures. ""I find that a little hard to believe,"" Assemblyman John Wisniewski told CNN. Wisniewski described relations between New Jersey Democrats and Christie as ""very difficult,"" saying the governor ""set lines in the sand"" and ""said it's my way or the highway."" ""Bipartisan means both sides give. That's not how this governor operates,"" Wisniewski said. Meanwhile, the assembly's GOP leader said he believed that Christie knew nothing about what happened. ""If a governor lies about what he knows, that's troublesome. That didn't happen here,"" Jon Bramnick said. Federal officials also are looking at whether Christie improperly used Superstorm Sandy relief funds to produce tourism ads promoting the Jersey shore's recovery that starred him and his family. In the new inquiry, federal auditors will examine New Jersey's use of $25 million of the funds for the marketing campaign, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone told CNN. In a statement on Monday, Christie's office said the ""Stronger than the Storm"" campaign was part of an ""action plan"" approved by the Obama administration and developed with the goal of showing that the New Jersey shore was open for business just several months after the storm that devastated parts of the mid Atlantic in October 2012. A separate statement Tuesday by the federal Housing and Urban Development agency described the probe as a routine audit ""and not an investigation of the procurement process."" While political observers say the bridge scandal isn't good for Christie, the Sandy investigation has the potential to be much more damaging to his national image since it was his signature achievement following the storm. Feds investigate Christie's use of Sandy relief funds . On Tuesday, Christie did not specifically mention that audit by the HUD inspector general, a watchdog over federal spending. In what might have been an ironic reference to Sandy funding, Christie praised the cooperative spirit in the state that helped its recovery from the storm, seeming to describe his own challenges now. ""Let that spirit of Sandy be a powerful lesson to all of us, that when times are most difficult, cooperation and progress are possible,"" Christie said. ""Indeed, I tell you, they're necessary.""

"(CNN) -- Reactions to Miley Cyrus at the VMAs: People are still having them! Earlier this week, we heard what both Britney Spears and Paula Patton had to say about the performance. (Spoiler alert: They think she's just being Miley.) But while both those stars were shrugging their shoulders, another music legend was sharpening her claws. ""I'm not old-fashioned,"" Cher told USA Today in an interview published Tuesday. ""She could have come out naked, and if she'd just rocked the house, I would have said, 'You go, girl.' It just wasn't done well. She can't dance, her body looked like hell, the song wasn't great, one cheek was hanging out. And, chick, don't stick out your tongue if it's coated."" EW: Paula Patton reacts to Miley Cyrus' VMAs performance . Ouch! It's one thing to slam Miley's choice of outfit or sexually-charged behavior; it's quite another to question the girl's talent itself. And coming from someone who knows a thing or two about rockin' it while wearing revealing outfits — not to mention clearly visible buttocks — that comment is harsher still. EW: Britney Spears defends Miley Cyrus on 'GMA', plus 4 other things we learned . Evidently, Cyrus is taking Cher's burn in stride. She hasn't responded to Cher's words on social media, choosing instead to keep touting the phenomenal success of ""Wrecking Ball,"" her latest single. (""#1 on Billboard. #1 on iTunes. #1 on Spotify. #1 on Streaming. #1 on Digital songs. #1 most added to pop radio. #1 on VEVO,"" according to Miley.) And maybe it was the young star's high-road tactics — not to mention a barrage of criticism about her criticism — that prompted Cher to backtrack on Twitter yesterday. ""What I should have said [is],""I didn't like it that much,but she's Pushing The Envelope,being an ARTIST !"" the Oscar winner wrote. ""She's Talented,& DIDNT COMMIT A FELONY[.]"" Good points all, Cher — though some might argue that ""flicking that tongue as deamons do"" should be grounds for at least a time-out.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A homeless man and two other men were tossing paper into a campfire when a gust of wind apparently spread embers that have since led to a 1,700-acre wildfire burning in the Los Angeles County foothills, authorities said Thursday. The three men, all in their early 20s, were arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting a fire, said Police Chief Tim Staab of Glendora. One man is from Glendora and another is from Irwindale, he said. Bail has been set at $20,000 for each. ""The way it's told to us is that all three of them were together at the time, sitting around this campfire,"" Staab said. ""Breeze kicked up, and that's what caused this fire. ""They told us they were camping out. There's no evidence to indicate they were living up there,"" Staab said. ""It's not a camping area, but people do camp up in the hills above Glendora."" The arrests were made after authorities received a call that at least two people were suspiciously walking away from the fire, the chief said. The three men arrested were identified as Jonathan Carl Jerrell, 23; Clifford Eugene Henry Jr., 22; and Steven Robert Aguirre, 21, police said. They or their attorneys couldn't be immediately reach for comment. The Colby Fire near Glendora destroyed two homes and injured one person Thursday morning, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said. The fire was burning uncontrollably early Thursday afternoon with 30% containment, the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management said. The injured civilian suffered minor burns, Osby told reporters. ""We predicted that this is going to be an intense fire season because this is third year of an ongoing drought,"" Osby said. Added Deputy Chief John Tripp: ""If we don't get the rains that gets us out of fire season that gets the vegetation to be less receptive to fire, we have to keep our diligence up."" There hasn't been a fire in Glendora's foothills since 1968, so the area has lots of brush and other fuel for a wildfire, authorities said. The fire started shortly before 6 a.m. PT, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Five hundred firefighters were battling the flames, according to John Wagner of Angeles National Forest. December: Wildfire in California's Big Sur region . October: Mammoth fire in Yosemite .

"(CNN) -- Villa Park proved to be just the tonic for Manchester United. United hadn't lost an English Premier League game at the home of Aston Villa since 1995 and the Red Devils maintained that impressive run by topping the Villains 3-0 on Sunday. White Hart Lane, meanwhile, hasn't been kind to Liverpool recently but the Reds thumped Tottenham 5-0 in the late kickoff thanks to another sterling performance from Luis Suarez. Liverpool climbed to second, two points behind Arsenal. Danny Welbeck's two early goals put United at ease and ensured the club wouldn't lose a third consecutive league match for the first time since 2001. With Arsenal losing 6-3 to Manchester City on Saturday, United made up ground, too, and now trails the Gunners by 10 points with the busy Christmas fixture list approaching. ""It was a good job from us,"" United manager David Moyes told Sky Sports. ""The players did well and the only thing I would criticize is that we didn't score more goals. ""We were a bit sloppy in the first five minutes but after that played really well."" But he added: ""I think we'll play much better than that. I've told the players that's the least we can do and we've got to keep going and keep winning more games."" With Robin van Persie injured, Welbeck earned the start and took advantage of his opportunity. United had joy down the right side and Welbeck was quick to pounce in the 15th minute after Adnan Januzaj hit the post with a header. It went from bad to worse for Paul Lambert's young side when Welbeck finished off the good work of winger Antonio Valencia. Villa has registered points from losing positions this season but Tom Cleverley's effort in the 52nd minute erased any hopes of a comeback. The assist came from Wayne Rooney, who was making his 500th appearance in club football. There was more good news for United as veteran midfielder Darren Fletcher made his first appearance of the season after battling back from colitis. ""Welcome back Mr Fletcher!"" tweeted United defender Rio Ferdinand. ""Well deserved after working so hard after being out."" Liverpool had lost five straight in the league at White Hart Lane and was without injured captain Steven Gerrard and striker Daniel Sturridge. Yet even before Tottenham midfielder Paulinho was dismissed for a boot in the chest of Suarez early in the second half, the visitor controlled proceedings. Suarez -- filling in as captain -- scored twice to boost his league leading tally to 16 and had two assists. ""It's no different being captain but Liverpool has only one captain and that is Stevie Gerrard,"" Suarez told Sky. ""We played very well and this is more important than who the captain is. ""We played very well. For confidence it is very good."" Tottenham didn't register a single shot on target. ""We could have had 11 man of the matches,"" Gerrard, working for Sky as an analyst, said. Suarez and Jordan Henderson handed Liverpool a 2-0 lead at the interval before Paulinho's red card in the 63rd minute. John Flanagan's first Premier League goal -- a half-volley stunner -- a Suarez chip and Raheem Sterling's low finish completed the rout. Boos rained down at the Lane at the final whistle. Only a few weeks ago Tottenham suffered another embarrassing defeat, 6-0 at Manchester City. ""I assume the responsibility of the failure,"" said Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas. ""We have to bounce back again like we did after City. ""In the Premier League things aren't going as we expected so it's normal the frustration is there from everyone."" Tottenham sits seventh, one spot ahead of United. In Sunday's other Premier League game, Norwich and Swansea drew 1-1. Nathan Dyer scored the opener for Swansea but was later stretchered off with a suspected fractured ankle. ""We have to wait a couple of days for an X-ray and a scan, and we all cross our fingers to hope it is not that bad,"" said Swansea manager Michael Laudrup. ""That will overshadow everything else.""","Manchester United beats Aston Villa 3-0 to end a two-game league losing streak .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Young women in bright miniskirts and high heels line up to sell themselves in the dingy back streets throughout the Russian capital. Moscow's illegal flesh markets are flourishing, with up to 30 women at each pickup point, or tochka, standing in order of price for the night. Russian police acknowledge that human trafficking for sexual exploitation is a major problem. Customers light up the lines with their car headlights and are asked to pay between $100 and $700 for a woman. Aid workers for groups fighting for women's rights say Moscow is witnessing a surge in prostitution, including forced prostitution, as a result of Russia's booming economy. They say thousands of young women are made to work as sex slaves on the city's streets, unable to escape from the ruthless and violent criminal gangs who traffic them.  Watch Moscow's thriving sex trade » . ""It's because of the economic boom they are brought here,"" said Afsona Kadyrova of the Angel Coalition aid agency, which rehabilitates trafficked women and children. ""The fast pace of development in Moscow has fueled demand for a range of cheap workers, including prostitutes."" To investigate the thriving trade, CNN went undercover posing as potential customers and gained access to speak directly to the prostitutes and their pimps. ""Take your pick from any of the girls,"" the female organizer said at one location, lines of women all around. ""The expensive ones are on the right, for $600 and $700 a night. The women on the left are $100."" Aid agencies say many of the women working here are tricked into coming to Moscow on the promise of an education or a good job. They say others are simply kidnapped from their hometowns and forced to work as prostitutes in Moscow.  Watch one woman describe how her uncle duped her into prostitution » . Russian police acknowledge that human trafficking for sexual exploitation is a major problem, saying they do what they can to fight it by raiding brothels suspected of forced prostitution and arresting gang members who run them. But the problem, they say, lies elsewhere. ""First of all, we have virtually open borders, and badly controlled migration flows from nearby countries,"" said Alexander Krasnov of Russia's Interior Ministry Police. ""Secondly, we still don't have a basic law that defines victims' rights. At the moment, it's mostly aid agencies that deal with it."" Aid agencies say they are handling a growing number of deeply traumatized victims rescued from brothels and pimps in the Moscow area. One U.N. organization, the International Organization for Migration, recently opened a treatment and rehabilitation center to cope with the large numbers of sexually exploited and trafficked women who come for help. At this center, Christine, a 27-year-old Nigerian woman, tells how she acquired a painful 4-inch scar across her right cheek. She says she was lured to Russia from Nigeria four years ago by her uncle. He promised to give her a college education, she says. But instead, she says, he sent her to a Moscow brothel. He told her ""the kind of job I'm going to be doing is prostitution."" ""I ask him, 'Why prostitution? Why not another job to pay the money?' He says I didn't speak the language. I cannot do any other job."" She added, ""It made me feel very bad. I felt that I'm not going to do it over my dead body."" But when she tried to run away, her uncle cut her face, says Christine, who asked that her last name not be used. ""He made me know that if I don't cooperate with him, something bad will happen to me -- that if I made an attempt to run away, it would end in taking my life. So I was really scared about that,"" she said. Aid workers say Russia has become a prime destination for trafficked women from Africa, the Far East and former Soviet states. There are no exact figures, but aid agencies estimate that thousands of trafficked women are on Moscow's streets. ""Before, it was just a country of origin for Europe and the U.S. and elsewhere in the world,"" Kadyrova said. ""But right now, we see that Russia has become a destination country also."" According to the group's Web site, human traffickers ""prey on the dreams of impoverished women seeking employment and opportunities for the future."" Most women are young and single with little education; some are orphans and college students; others are married with children. ""All of them are lured by advertising images of a beautiful life beyond the borders of their homelands -- making them easy prey to the thousands of traffickers advertising in newspapers, on radio, television, in the metro and on the streets for wonderful work abroad with no experience necessary,"" the group says. For millions, Russia's new economic prosperity has been a blessing. But for those caught up in the sex trade, it's a curse. Christine managed to escape after meeting a woman from a church who helped her. ""I was crying all the time, telling her, 'I don't want this kind of job,' "" she said.","Aid groups say booming economy has fueled demand for prostitutes in Moscow .

"(EW.com) -- When her Las Vegas residency begins at the end of the month, Britney Spears should probably stay away from the roulette wheel, because numbers are not her friend at the moment. Spears' new album ""Britney Jean"" arrived this week, moving only 107,000 copies for a fourth place finish on the Billboard 200. It's the weakest opening week in Spears' career, both by hard sales numbers and chart position (previously, her slowest sales week was the opening frame of her debut ""...Baby One More Time,"" which tallied 121,000 copies). Album review: 'Britney Jean' The numbers for ""Britney Jean"" are also a giant drop-off from the opening week of her previous album, 2011â€²s ""Femme Fatale,"" which sold 276,000 copies in its first week. It'll be interesting to track ""Britney Jean"" moving into 2014, as she may get a bump from the just-released video for the single ""Perfume"" and another once her Vegas show gets rolling. Britney had to dive out of the way of Garth Brooks, whose ""Blame It On My Roots: Five Decades of Influences"" took the No. 1 spot on the chart this week. In its second full week of release, the WalMart-exclusive box set (containing six CDs, two DVDs, and retailing for around $25) sold 146,000 copies. Brooks is now tied for fourth place all-time for No. 1 albums with nine (same as Barbra Streisand and the Rolling Stones). He trails the Beatles (19), Jay Z (13), Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley (both with 10). Expect ""Blame It On My Roots"" to stay strong during the holiday season. Britney Spears' 'Perfume' video smells like... feelings! Watch it here . Speaking of the holiday season, Christmas releases continue to rack up big numbers. Kelly Clarkson's ""Wrapped in Red"" had another big week, coming in at No. 3 on the chart with 112,000 copies sold. It's looking more and more like Clarkson's album may end up being a perennial champ, like Mariah Carey's ""Merry Christmas"" (which still does big numbers every December). Clarkson is joined by four other holiday-related releases in the top 10: ""Duck The Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas"" (No. 5, 105,000 sold), Pentatonix's ""PTXmas"" (No. 7, 60,000), Michael BublÃ©'s ""Christmas"" (No. 8, 57,000; another perennial juggernaut), and Mary J. Blige's ""A Mary Christmas"" (No. 10, 51,000). Two non-Christmas releases remain strong in the top 10. Last week's No. 1, One Direction's ""Midnight Memories,"" had a very solid second week, claiming the number two slot on the chart with 117,000 copies sold. Meanwhile, Eminem's ""The Marshall Mathers LP 2"" falls in at No. 6 this week with 84,000. See the original story at EW.com.

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- At 23, Asma Al Muhairi has never considered herself a social activist. But a shopping trip to a Dubai mall left her so irate that she started a campaign against revealing clothing and has sparked a major debate in the United Arab Emirates. Al Muhairi's campaign to persuade expats and tourists to dress more modestly began after she and her friend Hanan Al Rayes saw a young woman in shorts that they considered left little to the imagination. She said many people in Dubai Mall were looking at the woman, but no one did anything, so she approached security guards and threatened to call the police. ""We never saw this 10 years ago or even five years ago,"" said Al Muhairi, who began her campaign through a hashtag on Twitter -- #UAEdresscode. ""I'm only 23 but when I was young it was different,"" she added. ""I feel sad for the new generations. My nieces when they go to the mall they think it's fine to look at people dressed like this. ""It makes me sad. In our days people always knew it was wrong. It is in our culture and our religion."" While wearing skimpy clothing is not illegal in the United Arab Emirates, shopping malls have policies that state knees and shoulders should be covered. On returning from the mall, Al Muhairi discussed the issue with Al Rayes and wrote a message on Twitter, saying ""till when will we keep seeing people going against our rules and showing indecent dresses?"" Initially, Al Muhairi and Al Rayes had no intention of starting a campaign, just sharing their views with friends. However, the discussion grew as the issue touched a nerve with many. ""I never though that in 10 days I would become a social activist,"" said Al Muhairi. The campaign has started a debate on how closely foreigners should follow local customs while in the United Arab Emirates, and just what standards of dress are acceptable. Also on Inside the Middle East: Egypt elections: 'Women need a champion' Local newspapers, personalities and those prominent on social media have weighed in on the debate, calling on the country's authorities and shopping-mall managers to enforce a conservative dress code. Some have suggested that tourists arriving at airports should be given a brochure explaining local customs and standards of dress. The British Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Dominic Jermey, had already made his own plea to visitors before Al Muhairi and Al Rayes began their campaign. In an interview with the Ministry of Interior's 999 Magazine in March, Jermey said: ""The vast majority of expats living here dress entirely appropriately, and I think that most British people who live here or visit here get it absolutely right. Some who get it slightly wrong tend to get very bad sunburn! ""But seriously, I think it is really important for expats and tourists to understand the norms of the society they are in, so that is why we, through our embassies in Dubai and Abu Dhabi work very closely with tour operators, local schools, and the airlines, in particular Emirates and Etihad, to run a campaign called Know Before You Go."" The issue goes to the heart of what can at times be a clash of cultures. More than 80% of the United Arab Emirates population is expatriate, according to Visit Abu Dhabi, and much of the country's wealth is built on its foreign workers. The country prides itself on its welcoming attitude to foreigners. Most Emirati women wear abayas -- long robes that cover the whole body -- but the expectation for foreigners is more relaxed. The government advises visitors to respect local culture by avoiding ""excessively revealing"" clothes in public places. Although most of the attention has been focused on women, Al Mulhairi also has her sights on men who wear shorts, go bare-chested or wear clothes that are too tight fitting. She said: ""We should start in the malls distributing booklets with instructions. We need to create awareness and let people know about this campaign and that people here are upset about this issue. ""We should give a deadline -- from a certain date, everyone will know that if they wear certain kind of dress, the mall won't let them in, or maybe give them a fine. Someone suggested giving them something to cover themselves."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Young upstarts plotting Mid East art revolution . Many foreigners, as well as Emiratis, agree that more needs to be done to educate visitors on what is acceptable. Trudy Klein, a 30-year-old South African who has lived in Dubai for six years, said: ""We are living in a Middle Eastern country. There are things we need to respect about the country and the religion. We are guests. ""I've seen girls that really push the limits. It wouldn't be a bad idea to educate some women to show respect."" Khadija Sali, a journalist from the Philippines, said: ""We have to respect the culture and respect ourselves as well. Don't wear anything too short or too tight, it's common sense."" However, she said she would draw the line at shopping mall security guards giving people extra clothes to cover themselves. ""The campaign is good but they shouldn't go over the top,"" said Sali. ""There are more important issues out there that they could do campaigns about -- sick people, children dying, hungry people, not what people wear in the malls.""

"(CNN) -- The hunt is on for the killers of two extremely rare whooping cranes, shot as they spent the winter in Kentucky. The birds are thought to have been illegally shot in a single incident in November, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources said Thursday. Now a reward is being offered to help track down the killers. Whooping cranes are the most endangered of all of the world's crane species, according to the release, and are protected under two federal laws. Fewer than 500 of the long-legged birds live in the wild in the United States. Seven of them were in Kentucky this winter. The first bird was reported injured on November 25 in Hopkins County, the news release said. Two days later it was rescued because it had become very weak, but its upper leg was shattered and it had to be euthanized. Investigators then found the carcass of the bird's mate, about 5 miles from where the first crane was discovered. The birds, which were fitted with radio transmitters, had arrived in Kentucky -- where they'd spent the previous two winters -- only in mid-November. According to Kentucky's Courier-Journal newspaper, the male of the pair became well known to Louisville-area residents in 2007 when it fell behind during its first tricky migration south. The reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of those responsible currently stands at $7,200, and contributions continue to come in, wildlife officials said. Anyone with clues should get in touch with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the Kentucky Department of Fish & Wildlife Resources. The penalty for killing a whooping crane is up to a $100,000 fine and a year in prison. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Wildlife officials seek the killers of two rare whooping cranes in Kentucky .

"Paris (CNN) -- French actress Julie Gayet is suing the magazine Closer over an article suggesting she is having an affair with French President Francois Hollande, the magazine said Thursday. The lawsuit demands 50,000 euros for alleged invasion of privacy plus 4,000 euros in legal fees, according to the magazine. The allegations, which emerged last week, sparked a media firestorm of a kind not usually seen in France, where privacy is closely guarded. When asked questions about his personal life at a news conference Tuesday, Hollande said that he and his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, were going through ""painful moments"" but added that his personal affairs should be dealt with in private. Hollande has not confirmed or denied the alleged affair but has threatened legal action. A statement from his entourage Friday to news agency Agence France-Presse said Hollande ""deeply condemns the attacks on the right to privacy which he has a right to like every other citizen."" Hollande and Trierweiler are expected next month on a state visit to the United States at the invitation of President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. Their itinerary includes a February 11 state dinner at the White House. Hollande said Tuesday he would clarify the situation before the February trip. Trierweiler was hospitalized after Closer published its report Friday. The allegations came at an already difficult time for Hollande, who has seen his popularity slump since his 2012 election. His news conference at the Elysee Palace was intended to highlight his plans for France's economy, which faltered last year amid stubbornly high unemployment rates. A survey last month by French polling organization Ifop gave Hollande an approval rating of 22%, a rise of 2 percentage points from the previous month, when he hit a record low. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","Julie Gayet suit seeks 50,000 euros for alleged invasion of privacy, magazine says .

"(CNN) -- A first-half brace from Arjen Robben eased Bayern Munich to a 2-0 win over bottom-of-the-table Braunschweig at the Allianz Arena on Saturday to keep the reigning champions four points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. The victory is the Bavarians sixth on the bounce since drawing at Leverkusen at the beginning of October, and extends their unbeaten run in the league to 39 games. Pep Guardiola's team, who secured a record tenth successive Champions League win in midweek, have dropped just four league points this term collecting 38 points from a possible 42. ""It's one game more and we won,"" Guardiola said afterwards. ""We dominated possession and, in the first half, we were very strong mentally after (last Saturday's 3-0 win at) Dortmund and the trip to Moscow. ""In the second half we didn't manage to bring (striker) Mario Mandzukic into the game, but at the end, I am happy with the performance."" Read more: Bayern honor president persecuted by Nazis . Second-place Leverkusen posted a resounding 3-0 victory over second-from-bottom Nurnberg thanks to two goals from the promising young South Korean striker Son Heung-min and one from Stefan Kiessling. The result was a welcome return to winning ways for Sami Hyppia's side who were on the receiving end of a 5-0 walloping from Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday. The win sees Leverkusen move up to 34 points. Third-place Borussia Dortmund also kept in touch with a 3-1 away to Mainz in a game which was goalless with 20 minutes to go. Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened the scoring in the 70th minute before Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting leveled for the home side from the penalty spot four minutes later. But two spot kicks from Robert Lewandowski saw the visitors home. The first was awarded in the 78th minute after Mainz midfielder Elkin Soto was shown a red card for using his hand to stop the ball going over the goal line. Lewandowski netted his second in injury time to seal three points. The win keeps Jurgen Klopp's men in third on 31 points, six points clear of fourth-place Monchengladbach who face Freiburg on Sunday. In the bottom half of the table, Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen played out an entertaining 4-4 draw, while the game between mid-table Hertha Berlin and Augsburg ended goalless. Arsenal move seven points clear . Meanwhile in the English Premier League, Arsenal extended their lead at the top of the table with a 3-0 win at Cardiff City. Welsh international Aaron Ramsey scored a brace and Mathieu Flamini added the other as Arsene Wenger's side move up to 31 points from 13 games, seven clear of Liverpool and Chelsea who both play on Sunday -- away to Hull City and home to Southampton respectively. Everton moved up level on points with their Merseyside rivals thanks to a 4-0 hammering of Stoke City at Goodison Park. Gerard Deulofeu opened the scoring on the stroke of halftime before providing a cross for Seamus Coleman who made it 2-0 four minutes after the break. Bryan Oviedo added a third nine minutes later with Romelu Lukaku scoring his eighth goal in nine league games in the 79th minute. Norwich City move up to 14th after beating bottom side Crystal Palace 1-0 at Carrow Road, but fellow strugglers Fulham remain in the bottom three after a 3-0 defeat at the hands of West Ham United at Upton Park. The game between Aston Villa and Sunderland finished goalless. Both Manchester clubs are in action Sunday. David Moyes' United, which is expected to include a now 40-year-old Ryan Giggs, travel to Tottenham Hotspur while City will be looking for another barnstorming performance at the Etihad Stadium when they host Swansea City.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Judging by a preview event at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, one big gadget trend this year will be sensors that track almost everything in your daily life. There are sensors to track your home, your security systems, your pets, your plants, your weight and, in the case of a new ""smart fork,"" even how fast you eat. CES, the world's biggest electronics trade show, officially opens its doors Tuesday and runs through Friday. But at Sunday's preview event here, select companies offered the first real peek at what kinds of products we're likely to see the most over the week. Here are five of the more fun gadgets we spotted. The smart fork that slows you down . The HAPIfork from HAPILABS is smarter than your typical eating utensil. In addition to the standard stabbing of meat and ferrying of food from the plate to your mouth, this fork tracks how many bites you take, how fast you take them and the length of your meal. If you are eating too fast, the fork will let you know with a vibration and a blinking light, eventually training you to take your time. Eating more slowly can help people lose weight (there's more time to feel full), and also help them digest food better. French engineer Jacques Lepine invented the connected eating implement after his family chided him for eating too quickly. He spent three years searching for the right sensor, eventually settling on one that completes a circuit every time your mouth closes over the end of the fork. Naturally, the HAPIfork comes with a mobile app and webpage for tracking your noshing habits. A HAPIspoon is also in development. The fork will cost $99 when it becomes available in April, and the founders are planning a Kickstarter campaign for February. Trends to look for at CES . A hub for your connected home . There are seemingly no limits to the things in your home, such as temperature and lights, you can track and control remotely with sensors. But there are not many good ways to coordinate all of that data, short of having an app for each and every device. The Iris system from Lowe's acts as a hub for a connected home. With the one mobile app you can control and check all your household sensors, or you can program Iris to send you text-message alerts when, say, your back door is open. In addition to thermostat and security sensors, Iris will help you monitor carbon monoxide levels, water heaters, pet doors and the moisture levels of your house plants. Lowe's promises more sensors to come from such third parties as Verizon, Whirlpool and PetSafe. If you doubt the need for a connected home, check out the Iris Care service. It lets you monitor an elderly family member's home and sends you a text message if anything unusual is detected. There's also an emergency alert button your relative can wear around his or her neck. Toyota reveals self-driving car . Track your lost luggage anywhere . Trakdot is like Find My iPhone for your luggage. The small black and orange box is preprogrammed with your phone numbers and dropped into a piece of checked luggage. If you arrive at an airport but your duffel doesn't, you can check its location online with the Trakdot app, or get its location sent to you via text message or e-mail. The device transmits the location using a SIM card, so a few special features had to be worked in to make it FAA compliant. The Trakdot automatically goes into sleep mode when it hits 100 knots and wakes up when the plane is at the destination gate. The Trakdot costs $50, plus an annual $13 service fee and a one-time $9 setup fee. If you're a frequent flier who has been wronged by incompetent airlines, you may find it a good investment to let you know if your bag is in Frankfurt when it's supposed to be in Rome. iPhone case is all touch . Sure, the front of your iPhone is touch sensitive, but all that other surface area is just boring old metal, right? Not anymore. The Sensus case from Canopy adds touch features to the sides and back of your iPhone, turning it into one big touchtastic device. When used with compatible apps, the case adds some interesting navigation and scrolling options. It shines most with games, allowing more interactive play without your big fingers blocking the touchscreen. The device will need more dedicated apps to be truly useful, but Canopy has released a few of its own apps to show off its features and potential. There's a glut of iPhone cases out there, so it's nice to see a new entry that adds to the smartphone experience instead of just dressing up the phone. The case starts at $59, and the company says it is working on iPad versions. The history of CES celebrity gadgets . Smart glasses, but not Google's . The Vuzix M100 smart glasses bring the power and features of a smartphone directly to your eyeballs. The company has been working on a prototype of these specs for a year and is now showing off a working model at CES. Vuzix says it's close to what the final version will be. The glasses run Android 4.0 and can be used to make calls, watch videos and navigate a computer interface. The device has all the fixings, including GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 720p video recording. Vuzix hopes to have the glasses available by this summer for Android and iOS.","Tech companies and gadget startups show new products at the Consumer Electronics Show .

"(CNN) -- Maybe it is the year of the fox, but as Better Homes & Gardens executive editor Oma Ford said, that's not stopping all the other forest critters -- and their habitat -- from showing up in Christmas decor. ""The fox is having this huge moment. In the past it's been the squirrel and the owls and deer always have their place in fall and into winter,"" she said. ""It's part of this much larger theme, a full-on woodland sensibility."" From big box stores to craft stores, department stores to chic boutiques, all manner of Christmas ornaments and decor items are surrounded by bits of nature-inspired elements, she said. ""I don't think woodland is going away,"" she said. What is ""woodland?"" It's a decor trend that brings the woods indoors. Think about what kinds of things you would find in a forest, Ford said. Everything from pine cones, acorns, tree bark, mushrooms and moss to all styles of furry and feathered creatures. In fact, home decor blogger Emily A. Clark routinely ventures to her North Carolina back yard for a touch of woodland to augment her Christmas tree and the rest of her house during the holidays. ""If you expand on nature, you really can't go wrong,"" she said. Clark finds the texture of just-clipped holly, bare sticks and conifer branches to be the perfect starting point when decorating for Christmas. That doesn't mean that every corner of her house looks like some kind of enchanted forest. ""I don't think you have to stick with one theme for your entire house. I think each room can feel a little different when you're decorating for Chrismas,"" she said, but what ties them together is a wintery inspiration. There is plenty of room for cherished family ornaments, playful, childlike decor and sophisticated decor that adults appreciate, she said. ""While it may seem as if the theme has been in the marketplace for a while now,"" said Stephen Cardino, vice president and fashion director for the Home Store at Macy's, ""(woodland decor) has evolved."" What he's noticed in the Christmas ornaments and decor items offered at Macy's is a saturation and refinement of colors, a new and healthy dose of sparkle and an increase in the kinds of materials used to make them. And when it comes to decorating the tree, Cardino points out that there is no one rule of thumb. ""Some decorate by theme, some by color and some prefer an eclectic theme with each ornament having special meaning,"" he said. And when he buys ornaments for the department store, he keeps in mind that very few people go out and buy all their Christmas tree ornaments at once. ""Customers are looking for holiday decorations that support their existing room decor,"" he said. ""The nature-based items we offer are elevated and refined."" Many homes may already have some of these woodland decor elements displayed, Ford said. Faux taxidermy, antlers, moss and pine cones have become everyday decor. ""(The woodland theme) is huge in nursery decor as well as Christmas decor, I mean, it's enormous,"" she said. When those elements are blended with holiday decor, instead of covered up, ""it feels like an extension of what you're already doing,"" she said. Designer Rina Norwood works with colors she already has in her home, like blues and greens, when she decorates for Christmas. Southern cypress and pine provide the perfect texture to balance out the smooth, shiny ornaments and twinkling lights of either modern or traditional decor she said, and their rich green tones make an appearance in her holiday decor. The formality of peacocks, however, is her secret to really bringing color to her Christmas decorations. ""I think the peacock brings colors than we typically see with (other) critters,"" she said. Woodland decor can range from whimsical to high style, Ford said, and had truly taken hold in the decor world during the last decade. One of Ford's favorite examples of the woodland style comes from a recent find: Birch bark made into a paper chain for a Christmas tree garland. ""It just takes the literal natural element and brings it to a very traditional Christmas decorating idea,"" she said. Clark ascribes to some classic woodland decor tricks that Ford described: bare twigs tucked into Christmas trees and very au curant pine cones, birch bark and shed deer antlers. With a decorator for a mom, Clark's five children have learned to expect different looking Christmas decor each year. ""This year I went for a less-is-more approach,"" she said. The simplicity of a plain, natural pine swag across her mantel, a color scheme of green, white and gold and even some paper snowflakes set the mood Clark hoped for. But what if there are some woodland elements that kind of creep you out? Clark remembers the mounted deer head that played a central part in her grandmother's holiday decor. ""That is a vivid memory for me"" she said. ""They put a Rudolph nose on it and tinsel on the antlers. It always really disturbed me."" Norwood knows what she means. ""If you happen to have a moose above the mantle, which I have seen,"" she said, ""some people go beyond leaving them as they are."" Some wives, she said, might compromise with their husbands over a taxidermied woodland decor element. Perhaps, she said, the solution could be, ""OK, let's keep the moose head, but let's paint it white to bring in that modern element."" ""It's just how you approach it,"" she said. ""We can definitely work around something as long as it's done with tasteful grace."" All that hunting trophy really needs for Christmas, Norwood said, is a natural garland around its neck.

"(CNN) -- An eco-friendly building material might have saved some of the 80 homes destroyed in a recent wildfire in Southern California. But it can't be used there. Rajesh Kanwar built his Alpine, California, house out of AAC after his previous house burned down. The masonry material, called autoclaved aerated concrete or AAC, can withstand a 2,000-degree fire for four hours, according to Underwriters Laboratories' test results. ""I just think the material's awesome. There's nothing like it,"" said Doug Edwards, an architect whose Edwards Design Group designs and builds green homes in the Scottsdale, Arizona, area. ""It's the best building material in the world."" AAC is a mixture of sand, water, lime, portland cement and aluminum powder that is formed into blocks and cured in an autoclave, a sort of industrial pressure cooker. It has been used in Europe, where it was invented, for more than 70 years. Besides being fire-resistant, AAC also deadens sound, is energy efficient, is impervious to termites, is bulletproof and waterproof, generates no waste in its creation, and can be recycled, its fans say.  See AAC survive a fire-and-water test » . A sort of concrete bread, it's full of tiny air pockets, making it one-fifth the weight of traditional concrete, which means more can be transported with less use of fuel. Workers can cut it and shape it with hand tools, and its thermal qualities significantly lower energy use, experts say. Exton Quinn, an architect who fled her Santa Barbara, California, home as wildfires approached in early May, learned about the material at a green building seminar. ""It's a natural insulator, it's completely nontoxic, it's just absolutely fabulous,"" she said. ""And with our homes going up here, we should be building with this. ... The idea that we can't build with a fireproof material, I think, is insane."" But in California, wildfires aren't the only concern. Small earthquakes are part of daily life in many areas, and stronger ones occur fairly frequently. And that's the regulators' problem with AAC. ""Autoclaved aerated concrete cannot be used to resist seismic forces because it has not been seismically tested,"" said David Walls, executive director of the California Building Standards Commission in Sacramento. The restriction is based on guidelines from the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, he said. The next International Building Code, slated to take effect in 2011, will permit use of AAC in more places that have minimal seismic activity, Walls said. But even under those somewhat relaxed standards, most of California would not qualify, he added. Advocates for the product say California's qualms are baseless -- and political. ""We've done all the testing, and the testing showed the material works fine in any seismic area,"" said Felipe Babbitt, a Mesa, Arizona, engineer who helped develop code standards for AAC block. ""It has not been approved by California not because it can't perform, but because they have not done a thorough review of the testing data and are not convinced that it performs."" California's standards are no different from those of other states, Walls insisted. ""We base ours off the national model code. For the most part, for private buildings in California, we do not add any extra stuff,"" he said. ""So it would be strictly based on what is the national standard."" That's not entirely true, Babbitt said. California is the only state that adopted the 2006 International Building Code without the companion housing code that includes acceptance of AAC in seismic areas, he said. The two documents were meant to be applied in tandem, he said. ""A lot of it's politics,"" Babbitt said. ""Everybody's protecting their own interests. You've got the wood industry protecting theirs, you've got the steel protecting theirs, and the AAC is just going up against all these people."" The AAC industry hasn't been around long enough yet to earn its place in the code, he said. Wood, on the other hand, faces no challenge despite its obvious vulnerability to wind, fire, flood, pests, mold and earthquakes, he said. ""Each state has different code adoption laws and processes,"" Walls responded by e-mail. ""I cannot explain what or why any other state makes their choices. I can tell you that California has never adopted a residential code."" Another architect isn't satisfied. ""What is baffling is this is a product that could be enormously beneficial in California,"" said Michael McDonough, a world-renowned New York architect who specializes in sustainable industry. ""The testing standards they are rejecting are the testing standards that are used in 49 other states, and they've been extant for 10 years. ""Therefore we believe it's reasonable to assume there's some other agenda than the standards,"" he said. ""This stuff has been tested within an inch of its life."" Walls denies that politics played a role. ""I have been involved in the code adoption in California for more that eight years and I am not aware of any 'agenda' in California,"" he wrote in an e-mail. Mike Quaka, vice president-general manager of manufacturer AERCON Florida in Haines City, Florida, defended his company's product. ""From all of our independent testing, it meets all the seismic zones, just as it does in Europe,"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of external variables floating out there when we talk about California and AAC. ... We can build anywhere else without a hiccup."" Richard Klingner, an expert in earthquake-resistant design at the University of Texas at Austin, conducted what the industry considers the definitive tests of AAC in 2000 and found it more than adequate to handle seismic loading. ""In my opinion, testing done by me and others has demonstrated that ductile shear walls of AAC can safely be used anywhere in the U.S.,"" Klingner said in an e-mail from Venezuela, where he was giving a lecture on the seismic resistance of masonry. Ductile shear walls are walls that flex slightly to resist lateral force, the main cause of damage in earthquakes. ""I do not know why AAC has not had wider acceptance in California,"" he wrote. ""It may be a combination of lack of familiarity, caution, and 'not invented here.' That's too bad, because AAC offers many advantages."" A few houses made of AAC are scattered around California, built before restrictions were put in place. One is in Alpine, built by Rajesh Kanwar and Lori Ende after their previous house burned down in the 2003 Cedar Fire, which killed 13 people and destroyed more than 2,000 homes. ""When our home burned down, I looked into materials that were less likely to burn down,"" said Kanwar, who runs a small business.   ""Before I went to the material, I did a substantial amount of ground work to make sure I wasn't doing something which was going to come back and bite me,"" he said. ""So when I looked into that, I didn't just look into the fireproof aspect of it, I also looked into the seismic aspect of it, because I was really concerned about that. ""And from everything I learned ... it has done very well under earthquake conditions."" AERCON's Quaka admits to being a little discouraged by the long struggle for acceptance in California. ""You beat your head against a door so many times, your head gets sore. And we're not there yet with California, but our heads are pretty bloody.""","An eco-friendly masonry material can withstand a 2,000-degree fire for four hours .

"(CNN) -- Eleven pilot whales were found dead Sunday in the lower Florida Keys, doubling the number of dead whales found in the past week. Officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration believe the 11 whales were part of an pod of 51 whales stranded on the edge of Everglades National Park. Scientists are working to determine their cause of death. ""This totals 22 dead whales and 29 still missing,"" NOAA said in a statement. ""Given our knowledge of past mass pilot whales strandings, the outlook for finding the remaining whales alive is bleak."" The last time the group was spotted alive was Friday. Then, a pod of 20 whales was seen five nautical miles offshore, moving inshore and in a southward direction. They were reportedly swimming slowly and in a disorganized fashion, which could have suggested exhaustion, dehydration or malnutrition, according to NOAA. Pilot whales are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, but they are not endangered. Mass strandings by pilot whales are not altogether uncommon in Florida. In 2012, nearly two dozen pilot whales stranded and beached themselves. In 2011, 23 pilot whales stranded and beached themselves.","22 pilot whales have died; 29 are still missing .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese rock star, Cui Jian, has declined to appear on the state broadcaster's annual Lunar New Year television extravaganza, his manager told CNN Wednesday. The invitation to perform had surprised many because Cui, sometimes called China's ""father of rock"", had sided with student protesters during the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations. ""Mr. Cui Jian did indeed receive an invitation from the Spring Festival Gala. However, Mr. Cui Jian ultimately won't perform,"" his agent, You You, said in an email, without giving further details. During the protests in 1989, students on hunger strike on the square adopted Cui's hit ""Yiwu Suoyou"" (Nothing to my Name) as their anthem. At the height of the protests, Cui gave an impromptu performance in the square -- days before the government sent in tanks and troops to crack down on the demonstrators. In the 1990s, authorities refused him permission to perform in big venues due to the political content of his lyrics, state newspaper Global Times reported on its website, although in recent years he has performed at some music festivals. Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival in China, is the country's biggest holiday and families have traditionally gathered around the TV set on New Year's Eve to watch CCTV 's ""Spring Festival Eve Gala."" For years, it was China's most watched variety show, raking in huge advertising revenues and catapulting artists to stardom. However, with its cheesy sketches and patriotic songs, the marathon broadcast has lost some of its appeal among audiences recently and organizers have tried to spice it up with performances by international stars like Celine Dion.","Cui Jian declines to appear in state broadcaster's Lunar New Year television gala .

"(CNN) -- Former rebels in the Central African Republic killed almost 1,000 in a two-day rampage earlier this month, Amnesty International said, as together with Human Rights Watch it warned of a surge in sectarian violence. War crimes and crimes against humanity are being committed in the country, Amnesty International said. ""Crimes that have been committed include extrajudicial executions, mutilation of bodies, intentional destruction of religious buildings such as mosques, and the forced displacement of massive numbers of people,"" said Christian Mukosa, Amnesty International's Central Africa expert. The country has seen violence and chaos since the Muslim-backed Seleka militia and other rebel groups from the marginalized northeast seized the capital Bangui in March. President Francios Bozize fled to Cameroon, and Michel Djotodia, who had been one of the Seleka leaders, made himself President. Djotodia later officially disbanded the Seleka, but as many as 15,000 kept their arms and instead continued to wreak havoc in Bangui and elsewhere. They mainly targeted Christian communities, which in turn formed their own vigilante group, the anti-balaka (literally ""anti-machete""). Anti-balaka forces staged an early morning attack in the capital on December 5, going door to door in some neighborhoods and killing approximately 60 Muslim men, Amnesty International said. De facto government forces, known as ex-Seleka, retaliated against Christians, killing nearly 1,000 men over a two-day period, according to the rights group. A small number of women and children also were killed. In a statement, Amnesty International called for the deployment of a ""robust"" U.N. peacekeeping force, with a mandate to protect civilians, and enough resources to do so effectively. ""The continuing violence, the extensive destruction of property, and the forced displacement of the population in Bangui are feeding enormous anger, hostility and mistrust,"" said Mukosa. ""There can be no prospect of ending the cycle of violence until the militias are disarmed and there is proper and effective protection for the thousands of civilians at risk in the country. Residential neighborhoods must be made safe as an urgent priority in order to allow people to go back to their homes and resume their normal lives."" Violence in Bossangoa . In a separate report, Human Rights Watch cited a surge in violence around the northern town of Bossangoa since September, adding concerned countries should immediately bolster the African Union peacekeeping force in the country and support efforts by France to protect civilians. In the report, Human Rights Watch said Christian militias attacked Muslim communities, cutting the throats of children while forcing parents to watch. Muslim groups retaliated, setting fire to Christian homes and killing their occupants with the apparent approval of commanders present, Human Rights Watch said. The recent violence has created a humanitarian crisis. Both sides have burned down large swathes of villages in the norhtern Ouham province, the rights group said, adding relief workers have found it difficult to provide assistance, particularly emergency medical aid, as aid workers have also been the targets of attacks. ""The brutal killings in the Central African Republic are creating a cycle of murder and reprisal that threatens to spin out of control,"" said Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch and author of the report. ""The UN Security Council needs to act quickly to bring this evolving catastrophe to a halt."" The Central African Republic is about the size of France and a country rich in resources, including diamonds, gold, timber and ivory. The former French colony has rarely seen political stability or economic growth in the 53 years since it gained independence. CNN's Susanna Capelouto and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","NEW: Human Rights Watch report documents surge in violence around the northern town of Bossangoa .

"(CNN) -- Sorry, America: Support for emergency care patients barely receives a passing grade and needs extra help, according to a new report. The American College of Emergency Physicians, a national medical specialty society, issued a ""report card"" assessing the country's emergency medical services. As a whole, the United States got a measly D-plus. ""This report card is saying: The nation's policies are failing to support emergency patients,"" Alexander Rosenau, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said Thursday. The report does not single out any physicians or hospitals but shows how well states and the federal government are doing in terms of supporting emergency care, said Dr. Jon Mark Hirshon, an emergency physician at the University of Maryland and board member of the American College of Emergency Physicians. Categories included access to care and disaster preparedness, among others. The country's emergency care environment has actually worsened since 2009, the last time the organization graded the United States on support for emergency care. Five years ago, the nation received a C-minus. The American College of Emergency Physicians used 136 measures for grading the states. The report card rated some categories in 2014 as better than others, nationwide. Quality and patient safety environment got a C; so did public health and injury prevention, and disaster preparedness. The medical liability environment got a C-minus. But access to emergency care scored a dismal D-minus. ""If I'm in a car crash and they bring me to hospital that's not ready for me, my chances of survival are less,"" Hirshon said. ""So you want a state that has that type of trauma system. And when you look at patient safety, that's one of the components of patient safety."" Medical liability environment affects your ability to access a specialist in an emergency, Hirshon said. Appropriate physicians may not be available because they are afraid of being on call for patients they don't know for liability reasons, he said. There have also been trends of physicians migrating from states with high-liability insurance premiums to others where it is not such an issue, such as Texas, Rosenau said. Winners and losers by state . In a state-by-state breakdown, grading the 50 states and the District of Columbia on these parameters, the report card found that the District of Columbia leads in emergency care support, with a grade of B-minus. Massachusetts, Maine and Nebraska ranked second, third and fourth, respectively, also getting B-minus. Colorado squeezed into fifth place with a C-plus. At the bottom of the list: Wyoming got an outright F. Arkansas got a D-minus; New Mexico, Montana and Kentucky came out with Ds. Access to emergency care was particularly lacking across many states, the report card said. In this category, 21 states received an F. At the front of the class in this category, with As and Bs, were the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Massachusetts and Maine. ""You can have the best medicine in the world, but it won't matter if people can't get to it,"" Hirshon said. Medical liability was good enough in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas and Texas to score those states As, but 10 states got Fs. Three states got As for policies that support patient safety: Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah and North Carolina. But 10 states got Fs in this category. For public health and injury prevention, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Utah and Washington got As. But 28 states got Ds or Fs. Disaster preparedness was also a big problem, with nearly half of all states receiving Ds or Fs. On the flip side, the District of Columbia and North Dakota aced this category. Supply is down, demand is up . The report also highlighted that there were 130 million emergency department visits, or 247 visits per minute, in 2010, and there were 37.9 million visits related to injury, according to the CDC's National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey: 2010 Emergency Department Summary (PDF). From 1995 to 2010, there was a 34% increase in emergency department visits, according to CDC's data. During this same time period, the supply of emergency departments went down by 11%. The number of patients visiting emergency departments is likely to increase as baby boomers age and develop more medical problems. And the report projects that with the Affordable Care Act going into effect, millions of people who can't find physicians who accept their insurance, and who were added to Medicaid, will also seek emergency care. A recent study in Science suggested that Medicaid increases the use of emergency departments. ""We'll be asked to do more with less resources, which has the potential to impact emergency patients,"" Hirshon said. The report card did not include free-standing emergency departments, as they are new entities and need to be better understood, Hirshon said. What can be done? The Affordable Care Act calls for a work force commission to examine shortages of physicians and nurses, and the American College of Emergency Physicians wants to see that funded. Graduate medical education funding should also be expanded, Hirshon said. The physicians group would also like to see enhancements of the Emergency Care Coordination Center in Washington to help with disaster response. Improvements have been made since the 2009 report card; one state started a new trauma system, while another enhanced medical liability laws. ""We know that in every single category, there was one state that was able to garner an A on this report card,"" Rosenau said. Those are examples for other states unhappy with their grade, he said.","The American College of Emergency Physicians graded states .

"(CNN) -- His girlfriend Lindsey Vonn thinks he's ""dorky,"" but what does Tiger Woods think? ""I guess so. My teammates used to call me 'Urkel' back in college,"" Woods told CNN's Rachel Nichols in an exclusive interview ahead of his appearance at the Turkish Airlines Open this weekend. Like the bespectacled character from 90s sitcom, ""Family Matters,"" Woods freely admits to having a ""nerdy side"" but his attraction to Olympic skiing champion Vonn, who also described him as ""funny"" and ""a great guy"" in a recent interview, has far more to do with mutual passions. ""I like to have fun. I enjoy life. I'm very competitive. I think that's why we get along so well,"" Woods said. The pair, who went public with their relationship in March, also share an understanding of the physical demands of top athletes, although Woods concedes golf isn't exactly littered with glorious physical specimens.

""In her sport, unless you're feeling close to 100% you are not going to win. So it's very different."" Return to fitness and form . Woods famously won the U.S. Open in 2008 (his last major triumph) playing through the pain barrier of a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament and a double stress fracture of his tibia, and injuries (knees, Achilles and elbow) have dogged him since. But barring the withdrawal from the AT&T National at Congressional in June, 2013 has been kinder physically, enabling the Tiger of old to re-emerge more regularly. Read more: Woods dropped by EA Sports . ""I knew I could get back, but I had to get healthy first. I couldn't practice unless I got healthy. And in order to play tournaments you gotta practice,"" he says. Enlisting the help of swing coach Sean Foley in 2011 has also paid dividends creating more consistency in his game, he says. ""I've won eight times these last two years, so I'm very proud of that."" Major frustration . There is, however, the small matter of Woods' continuing failure to make an impact on the biggest stage -- Woods remains stuck on 14 major titles, four short of Jack Nicklaus' record of 18. It's a frustration, admits Woods, after being in contention at two majors this year. For once, his feted accuracy landed him in trouble during the second round of the Masters in April. While tied for the lead, Woods' third shot to Augusta's par-five 15th hit the flagstick before ricocheting back into the water. After taking a drop -- in the wrong place as it later transpired -- Woods ended up with a triple-bogey eight and eventually finished in a tie for fourth. Woods felt the same sense of lost momentum three months later at Muirfield. ""At the British Open on Saturday at the 17th I just spun one up in the air and it ended up in the bunker. I blasted out made bogey, Lee (Westwood) made birdie so there was a big shift there. I've been there with chances to win at the weekend, I just haven't done it yet,"" he said. Time, insists the 37-year-old, is still on his side. ""A lot of golfers peak in their 30s. You start eliminating mistakes as you get older. I might not bomb it as far, but strategic awareness improves. You understand how to attack the golf course and that's why there are so many great players -- (Ben) Hogan for instance, won most of his majors at my age and over. ""For Jack (Nicklaus) it took him until he was 46 ... You are going to have your years when you play really well -- you may clip two or three -- and then you have years when you just don't win anything -- you are there, you just don't happen to win,"" he said. ""Quite frankly, since 2008, I've been there with a chance to win about a half of them. I just haven't seemed to have won one."" Rules of the game . Woods may have enjoyed his most successful season since 2009, but not everyone has been pleased with his progress. Last month, golf journalist Brandel Chamblee awarded Woods a grade ""F"" for his 2013 labors, noting provocatively that he had been ""a little cavalier with the rules"" -- a reference to four rules violations this year including the controversial two-shot penalty at Augusta. Woods' agent Mark Steinberg raged on his behalf calling the slur ""shameless"" and ""baseless,"" before Chamblee offered an apology of sorts via Twitter. The constant scrutiny has become par for the course for Woods who says its just the nature of 21st century media landscape. ""It's a new world for everyone because it's a 24-hour news cycle. Everyone has outlets via blogs, the Internet has changed everything in how our sport is looked upon."" 'Watermelon guy' Woods takes refuge in practice, ""hanging out with my boys"" at the Medalist Golf Club near his home in Florida and focusing on his children: six-year-old daughter Sam and son Charlie who turned four this year. ""It was pretty neat that he was at Akron (WGC-Bridgestone International in August) when I won this year. It's the first time he's seen me win a golf tournament. It was thrilling for me and he got pretty excited. ""He's been out on a golf course with me (before), but he's never seen people following me playing. So that was a little bit different -- he was a little bit nervous about that because obviously it's a different type of crowd. It was a little bit shocking to him and he also loved it at the same time."" Much like his late father Earl, Woods is taking pride in watching his kids as they take their first, less public strides onto the sports field. ""I don't yell at them when they play T-ball or soccer. I just watch, support and let the coaches coach. ""Lately, I've been the watermelon guy -- so if they need a little bit of sugar, get a little tired they will come over and say: 'do you have any watermelon?' Other than that, I just watch and to me that's just a thrill.""","Tiger Woods speaks to CNN's Rachel Nichols about match-up with Lindsey Vonn and kids .

"(CNN) -- If you set your alarm this morning for quarter-past ungodly (California time) to catch the predawn announcement of the Oscars nominations, then we're in the same twisted little club. The Order of the Oscars Freaks. Years before Oscars handicapping became an official Olympics sport -- What? It's not? -- two fellow Oscars-obsessed friends and I made an annual game of trying to predict who'd get nominated. I never won (I tied once), but I never lost my enthusiasm for it; that is until every magazine and website came along with their own predictions and took the fun out of it. This year for old times' sake we revived our game, only doing the best actor category because it's been an impossibly full year of great male lead performances that have stumped the prognosticators. My 14-year-old nephew Miles was in on it because he's been a rabid Oscar fiend since he was at least, oh, 12. Call out a category -- best actress say -- and a year -- 1966 -- and he'll holler back ""Julie. Christie, not Andrews."" Am I proud, or concerned? Today the results came in and we all tied with four corrects each, but with different names on our lists. Jude must have known Christian Bale had the gale winds of ""American Hustle"" at his back. David, a great strategist, and Miles the Scorsese devotee, both recognized Leo DiCaprio's high standing with the Academy, even if Miles won't be seeing that film anytime soon, I pray. We all had faith in Bruce, Matthew and Chiwetel (funny how we know them all by first name.) I held out for Robert Redford because, well, he's Redford, and because I'm un-young. That should teach me to stop leading with my heart. But did anyone ever imagine that betting against Mr. Oscars himself, Tom Hanks, could pay off? If I had I would have won for once. Of course, Oscar mania is not just about the horse race. It's also the spectacle, the show around the show. The history. I'm a diehard. I haven't missed an Oscars since I got hooked as a teen. My favorite year was 1978, the night Jane Fonda and Jon Voight took the best leads categories for ""Coming Home."" Justice! Glory! As a professional plower of the fields of celebrity, with a license to fawn and gush (want to see my card?) I've attended the Oscars, been inside the crimson cocoon, felt the collective shock when ""Shakespeare In Love"" beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for Best Picture. I've stepped on a few gowns. Not even the cruel realization that there are essentially two red carpets -- velvet stanchions separate the stars on one side from the rest of us attendees -- could squelch my blind and blinded-by-the-flashbulbs enthusiasm. But like most true believers I have my moments of doubt. If you are not in our little club, I get where you're coming from. To the Osc-nostics it is all too much, too little, and certainly, should you try to slog through the entire three-and-a-half hour ceremony on March 2, too late. It is kind of preposterous: over-hyped, over-scored, overwrought. In poor Oscar's defense, for the past decade or so Hollywood's big night has had to suffer indignities that the Academy of Old couldn't have imagined: dwindling viewership, the cultural-relevance supremacy of TV over movies, an attention deficit that just can't sit still for the live-action shorts category, acting and directing victories basically pre-called by critics and Tweeters and bookies, James Franco. There's desperation in the air. Oscar's been trying too hard. This year's host Ellen Degeneres will take care of some of that, I'm sure. You never see her sweat. Plus, there's red carpet fatigue, as the Oscars limp on high heels to the finish line of a bloated awards season as overextended as Christmas and the NFL. Critics' awards, the People's Choice Awards, the Golden Globes, the SAG Awards â€” you can only cut to a reaction shot of Jennifer Lawrence so many times before it constitutes stalking. But is it Oscar's fault that everyone else wants in on the action? I recognize the madness -- struggle with it -- but it's hopeless. I just can't shake my addiction. Will I sound like I'm on the Academy's payroll if I argue that the Oscars really are a great national tradition? Movies, of course, which might actually be getting better. And stars, our collective guilty delight. And glamor, maybe even a modicum of sophistication. And there are less-lofty traditions to savor: Carping about his speech, dissing her dress. Trying to catch a loser register a little disappointment. Enduring campy production numbers with aerialists. Dutifully filling out the ballots at your friend's Oscars party even if the only movie you saw that year starred Adam Sandler. It's all part of the ritual. The knowing that it's all too much, but the kind of too much that some of us just can't get enough of. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tim Allis.","If you watched early morning Oscars nominations, you're in Tim Allis' Order of Oscar Freaks .

"(CNN) -- Searing temperatures in Melbourne have disrupted play at the Australian Open, where tennis players have been struggling in the heat in recent days. Organizers of the grand slam event said Thursday that they had introduced an ""extreme heat policy"" after temperatures rose above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). That means that matches already under way on court will be suspended at the end of the set being played. The organizers said the roofs would be closed at the Rod Laver Arena and the Hisense Arena so that players could continue their matches on those courts. But new matches won't start on outdoor courts ""until the temperature falls back down to a temperature deemed fit for play by the tournament director,"" the statement on the website said. The severe heat at Melbourne Park this week has already caused problems for players. Canadian Frank Dancevic fainted during his defeat in the first round on Tuesday. He said he thought the conditions were ""inhumane."" On the same day, China's Peng Shuai blamed the heat after she cramped up and vomited during her defeat to Kurumi Nara of Japan. And it's not just players who have succumbed to the elements. One of the ball boys fainted during 11th-seed Milos Raonic's four-set victory over Spain's Daniel Gimeno-Traver on Tuesday. Some players worried . Several players have voiced concerns about the conditions. ""Whether it's safe or not, I don't know. You've just got to be very careful these days,"" Britain's Andy Murray, who has been a finalist in Melbourne in three of the last four years, said Tuesday. ""There's been some issues in other sports with, you know, players having heart attacks."" Women's world No. 1 Serena Williams said Wednesday the fear of dehydration was giving her sleepless nights. But 17-time Grand Slam winner Roger Federer appeared unfazed. ""Just deal with it, because it's the same for both (players),"" he said Tuesday after defeating spirited Australian James Duckworth in the first round. Before Thursday, tournament officials had already introduced heat-related measures for matches in the women's draw, allowing for an extended break between the second and third sets. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology forecasts maximum temperatures in Melbourne of 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees Fahrenheit) for Thursday and Friday. Temperatures are then expected to drop into the low 20s (high 60s and low 70s in degrees Fahrenheit) starting Saturday. The heat wave currently blasting southern Australia comes after the country experienced its hottest year on record in 2013, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Tournament officials issue an ""extreme heat policy"" after temperatures top 40 Celsius .

"(CNN) -- Lake Louise specialist Aksel Lund Svindal secured his fifth Super-G win at the Canadian ski resort Sunday to put down an early marker in an Olympic season. The Norwegian made the most of his experience on the lower part of the course to record a time of one minute 28.53 seconds -- 0.38 faster than second placed Matthias Mayer of Austria. Svindal was winning at Lake Louise for the second straight year and his 22nd World Cup victory has taken him past Kjetil Andre Aamodt's Norwegian record. I think it's cool,"" he said of beating the record. ""It is something to know that my idol is at home and that I beat his record. I will call him later and I will see what he says. I think he must have some mixed feelings."" The win has also left him top of the overall World Cup standings, his cause helped when American hope Ted Ligety skied out on the top part of the course. Svindal, a four-time World Cup champion in the Super-G, will also be defending his Olympic title in Sochi next February and on this early form will be favorite for gold again. Only fourth in Saturday's downhill behind Italy's Dominik Paris, Svindal was behind Mayer at the mid section before powering to the finish. Another Austrian, Georg Streitberger, occupied the final podium position. Six of Svindal's 22 wins have come at Lake Louise with Super-G success previously in 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2012. American Bode Miller continued his comeback to the World Cup circuit by taking 24th place, just ahead of Paris, who was unable to repeat his heroics on a technically demanding course, shrouded in fog. On the women's circuit, there was a first giant slalom success for 29-year-old Swede Jessica Lindell-Vikarby. She held off the challenge of precocious American teenager Mikaela Shiffrin by just nine hundredths of a second over two legs at Beaver Creek in Colorado. The race on the famous Birds of Prey course had a dramatic ending as 18-year-old Shiffrin, second last to go on the second run, took the lead from Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein. But Lindell-Vikarby kept her nerve to disappoint the home crowd, who included many of Shiffrin's family. Earlier, Lara Gut's bid for a third win of the Beaver Creek weekend came to an end when she skied out in the first leg. Switzerland's Gut had won Friday's downhill and Saturday's Super-G.","Aksel Lund Svindal claims men's Super-G at Lake Louise .

"(CNN) -- No, there may not be an NBA season this year. But there is another installment of ""NBA 2K,"" the top-rated basketball video game for 11 years running. This year's version, ""NBA 2K12,"" will let you end the debate about what historical team is the greatest by offering 15 classic teams and players to battle on the court. The enhancements to the My Player mode, which allows you to create your own player and guide his career through the NBA draft, his rookie season and beyond, are what really make this an engaging game. Like in previous versions of the game, you start off by creating your player's physical attributes (height, weight, age, etc.). The game then assigns your abilities based off what type of player you want to be (perimeter shooter, post player, etc.). In theory, you could create a 7-foot point guard with zero post abilities, but I'm guessing the high dribble would make you susceptible to steals. After finalizing your player, you immediately play in a rookie showcase game that helps determine where you are selected in the""NBA Draft. This game shows off ""NBA 2K12's"" improvements over previous versions in replicating players' movements and facial features. The game's announcers also do a good job of mixing your player's performance into their play-by-play chatter. In the game, you try to play flawlessly while improving your teammate grade by making good passes, playing transition defense and demonstrating other skills that lead to victory. Meeting these goals help increase your skill point totals, which translate into improved attributes. I created a 6-foot-6 shooting guard from Marshall University (my alma mater) and picked up 18 points and a B-minus on my teammate grade in the rookie game. After the game, your player has to answer two questions from teams that will be interested in drafting him. How you answer is taken into consideration prior to the draft. The Charlotte Bobcats (No. 9 pick), Golden State Warriors (No. 11) and Utah Jazz (No. 12) were interested in my shooting guard. I answered the questions in a way that I hoped would get me selected by each team, but there was an answer choice, ""I do not want to play for your team,"" that would have automatically dropped me off that team's list. Then it's time for the draft. Just like in real life, the draft starts off with NBA Commissioner David Stern (yes, it was really his voice) announcing the first pick and continuing on until your player gets selected. If you don't get picked early, this can be a rather drawn-out process since there is no way to skip to your selection. (Developers say the highest any created player can be selected is No. 3 (Utah Jazz), so don't set your sights on being the top pick.) After walking to the podium and signing your rookie contract, your team's public relations department contacts you and shows you a new billboard touting you as the future of the franchise. Having been selected by the Bobcats, it was pretty cool to see my player on some outdoor advertising in Charlotte. Now it's time to earn that contract. Your player's skills can be improved through buying skill points with your contract money or by doing individual and team drills -- most of which are new to this game. My shooting guard took advantage of the new arsenal of moves in ""NBA2K12"" to put up 33 points in 16 minutes in his first game. (Oh, you didn't think your rookie was going to be in the starting lineup, did you?) After every game, there is a press conference where you are asked about the game action. Your answers impact what your teammates think of you, your league-wide reputation and how you are perceived by your hometown fans. The answers were tough to interpret, and I came off as a jerk sometimes when I was trying to praise my teammates. One flaw with this game: My player still looked awkward when he was speaking. His bottom lip didn't seem to move, making him appear frightening when he addressed the media. As your season progresses, you can earn more playing time and more endorsements depending on your skills and reputation. (Those press conference answers are important.) Later in your career, you can request trades, negotiate contracts and guide your player to the NBA Hall of Fame. How long that takes depends on how fast your avatar becomes one of the best players in the league. Thanks to this My Player mode, ""NBA2K12"" has the depth and versatility to challenge even the best gamer to achieve basketball immortality. This improved feature personalizes pro hoops in a way that will have you cheering your player on -- maybe even to greatness.","""NBA2K12,"" the top-rated pro-basketball video game, goes on sale Tuesday .

"New York (CNN) -- Mayor Bill de Blasio bit into some unexpected publicity recently when he was photographed politely eating pizza -- with a knife and fork. At a Staten Island pizzeria, no less. Now, the act that sent the Internet into a frenzy with chatter about what most New Yorkers scorn as a serious food flub portends to deliver some dough -- as in money -- to charity. Goodfella's Pizzeria co-owner Marc Cosentino says he will auction off the infamous fork that de Blasio used in a charity fundraiser. After the mayor and his entourage went their way following a Friday stop at Goodfella's, Cosentino decided it would be a good idea to hold on to the notorious fork. A retired NYPD sergeant, Cosentino baked up the idea to store the fork in an evidence bag and put it on display at the bar. ""You can't imagine all the people that come in that want to look at the fork and take pictures of it,"" Cosentino told CNN on Wednesday. Dubbed by some with tongues firmly in cheek as the new mayor's ""pizzagate,"" the ensuing publicity has prompted multiple charities to reach out to Cosentino in hopes of getting a piece of the pie. When asked how much he thinks the renowned utensil would sell for, Cosentino referred to a previous charity benefit in 2013 for New York's hungry when a dozen ""cronuts"" -- half-croissant and half-doughnut pastries -- reportedly were auctioned for $14,000. ""I think we can beat that,"" Cosentino proudly said. As for the mayor with manners, his office released a statement to CNN giving the idea of a charity auction an extra topping. ""We hope they include the knife to raise even more funds,"" the statement said. Will de Blasio be welcomed back in Goodfella's Pizzeria following what some consider a pizza faux pas? ""Absolutely! He was a total gentleman,"" Cosentino declared. ""As long as people are eating pizza it's okay with me.""

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic might have hit upon a formula to contend with the searing heat at the Australia Open -- beat your opponents as quickly as possible. A record-equaling nine players retired from their first round matches as temperatures lingered at a stifling 40 degrees Celsius, matching the highest number of withdrawals from a single round of grand slam set at the 2003 U.S. Open and Wimbledon 2013. Complaining players, vomiting, fainting, melting bottles and burning feet have marred the first few days of competition in Melbourne, but world No. 1 Williams and four-time champion Djokovic were both in a hurry as they registered commanding wins.

Rafter return . Pat Rafter's return from retirement fell short as Australia's Davis Cup captain and his partner Lleyton Hewitt crashed out of the men's doubles at the first hurdle. The Australian duo were beaten 6-4 7-5 by American Eric Butorac and South African Raven Klassen but at least Rafter, who retired in 2001, was pleased to avoid an embarrassing scoreline. ""I got through it and that was the main thing,"" Rafter, who won the Australian Open men's doubles title in 1999, told the Australian Open website. ""It wasn't embarrassing but I just wasn't able to build any pressure to help Lleyton out on his return when they were serving."" Hewitt had coaxed his 41-year-old Davis Cup captain out of retirement for a one off return in Melbourne and he said afterwards: ""It was a lot of fun to team up with Pat, especially at the Australian Open which means a lot to us. ""I threw it up to Pat and he thought I was joking. He still goes all right."" Hewitt, who also lost his first round singles match to Italian Andreas Seppi to dampen home hopes, said he and Rafter would return to the court at the French Open and Wimbledon's All England championship. But before Australian tennis fans get their hopes up, Hewitt made it clear he was only joking.","Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic seal commanding wins at Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- Manny ""Pac-man"" Pacquiao punched his way to victory over Brandon ""Bam Bam"" Rios to take the WBO International Welterweight title in a unanimous decision on Sunday in Macau, China. The bout came just two weeks after Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated his homeland of the Philippines, giving the country's most famous sportsman added incentive to return home a hero. READ MORE: Pac-Man defeats Bam Bam . Before the fight, Pacquiao told CNN he was moved to tears by the devastation wreaked by Haiyan which slammed into the coast early on November 8. More than 5,200 people were killed, and many are still missing. ""I was crying,"" the 35-year-old said. ""I feel so bad ... what happened. I want to visit them personally but I can't because I'm in training. I sent my people there to help them, what I did is focus on my training and pray to God."" In Tacloban, one of the hardest struck cities by the deadly typhoon, thousands gathered to watch the Pacquiao-Rios fight in a public park, climbing up trees, cars and buildings to catch a glimpse of the match, chanting, ""Manny, Manny, Manny"" as Pacquiao pummeled his rival. ""You don't feel the sadness that happens here,"" said Jacoba Mado, a typhoon survivor in Tacloban told Reuters news agency, about the brief respite from Haiyan's devastation. ""You just feel happy."" In an air base in Pasay, south of the Philippines, Filipino troopers, U.S. staff, aid workers and typhoon survivors watched the fight together. Watching their national hero fight his way to victory gave the storm-weary nation an opportunity to cheer and think of something different . One newspaper, the Manila Bulletin News tweeted: ""When all else fails, Pacman is there to lift everyone up,"" referring to Pacquiao's nickname. Another Philippines news group, the Inquirer tweeted: ""@MannyPacquiao made #YolandaPH survivors forget misery, then back to reality."" Boxing's first and only eight division world champion left his training camp in Genereal Santos City earlier this week to head to Macau for the bout. Pacquiao said he was attempting to help his compatriots by sending aid to those affected by the typhoon. ""Right now we've sent them food, food is the most important thing,"" said Pacquiao, who is an elected official in the Philippine House of Representatives, serving Sarangani's Lone District. ""After that I have to help give them a fresh start in their lives."" Saturday's fight with Rios was Pacquiao's first since he was knocked out for just the third time in his career by Juan Manuel Marquez in December 2012, only his fifth loss in 61 professional fights. ""I learned a lot,"" Pacquiao said of his loss to Marquez. ""It's part of boxing, sometimes you lose sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose and you have to accept it. ""I decided to continue my boxing career because I think I can still fight ... I'm not thinking negative, I'm always thinking positive."" During the fight, Chris Mannix, senior writer with Sports Illustrated tweeted: ""Rios being totally outclassed. Pacquiao is too fast, too quick. Combinations coming in bunches. Rios has to do something different here."" He didn't, leading to a final result of 120-108, 119-109, 118-110.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Severe floods in northern Indonesia have left at least 13 people dead and driven tens of thousands of others from their homes in recent days, authorities said Thursday. Landslides and rising waters have cut off several villages in one district of the province of North Sulawesi province, leaving about 1,000 residents stranded, the Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency (NDMA) said. Heavy rains started drenching the region Tuesday and have resulted in about 40,000 people leaving their homes to seek temporary shelter, according to the NDMA. Most of the deaths in North Sulawesi were reported Wednesday, authorities said, and two people are still missing. Power is down in most parts of the region and communication lines are disrupted. There are four main rivers in Manado, the provincial capital, that are overflowing, the NDMA said. This year's floods are far worse than previous ones, NDMA spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said. The agency is working with the military, police, the search and rescue agency, Indonesian Red Cross and other groups as well as volunteers to help the tens of thousands of people affected by the flooding. Heavy rains have also caused deadly landslides and flooding this week on the southern Philippines island of Mindanao -- roughly 500 kilometers (320 miles) north of North Sulawesi. A low pressure area has battered parts of Mindanao with wind and rain since the weekend, leaving 26 people dead and displacing more than 200,000, according to Philippine authorities. That weather system, along with another over northern Australia, helped generate the heavy rains over North Sulawesi, Indonesian authorities said. CNN's Kathy Quiano reported from Jakarta, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","About 1,000 residents are stranded in villages isolated by the flooding .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, the world's leading technology companies, including Google and Microsoft, published an open letter to President Obama and Congress demanding reform of U.S. privacy laws to restore the public's ""trust in the Internet."" This comes after what seems like an endless series of revelations about government surveillance from the secret documents leaked by Edward Snowden. Let's start with the latest: American and British spies have gone into online fantasy games to snoop on players, and to see if any militants are communicating with each other dressed as elves or gnomes. Last week, the Washington Post reported that the National Security Agency is ""collecting billions of records a day to track the location of mobile phone users around the world."" And we learned recently that the NSA hacked fiber-optic cables and infected 50,000 networks with malware. Big Brother spying is happening at a scale we could never have imagined. This new awareness has prompted people -- even those with nothing to hide and who support broad surveillance for national security reasons -- to try to regain some control over their online privacy. According to a fall Pew report, 86% of people ""have taken steps online to remove or mask their digital footprints."" Another study concluded that 64% of Internet users concerned about privacy have taken action to protect themselves in direct response to the NSA PRISM program. Revelations of NSA spying even contributed to President Obama's approval rating sinking to a new low. Americans are very worried that they've lost control of their personal data. In this atmosphere of anxiety and mistrust, people are adopting privacy solutions in unprecedented numbers. For example, Silent Circle, a global encrypted communications company that provides secure phone and text solutions, has experienced explosive 400% growth. My company, Disconnect, anonymized more than three million search queries in the first 30 days after launch. And sites like Prism Break are becoming popular destinations to learn about ways to protect your online privacy. It's hard not to feel that we've lost too much control when secret laws and new technologies empower governments and a handful of giant companies to secretly track, analyze and record virtually every detail about any of our lives (even leaders of world superpowers). Without suspicion, it appears that untold millions of us have or will be subject to unconstitutional searches and seizures of our most personal information. No wonder many people believe that the NSA's actions violate our privacy. What's even scarier is that government spy programs are rapidly expanding. For example, significant progress is being made to improve the use and capabilities of video surveillance. Law enforcement agencies are partnering with technology firms to create video surveillance systems capable of facial recognition, scanning license plates and detecting radiation levels emitted by cars. In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg cited a joint NYPD-Microsoft project and suggested that within five years there will be 24/7 video surveillance of the entire city. On Big Brother, Bloomberg said, ""Get used to it!"" The government is also upgrading its ability to process and store the enormous amount of data it is acquiring. During the summer when Snowden's disclosures were sending shock waves around the world, U.S. taxpayers paid for a brand new $1.2 billion data farm that will serve as the NSA's external hard drive, designed specifically to improve ""data acquisition, storage and processing effort."" Meanwhile, consumer trust that companies can or will protect their personal information has been dealt a major blow as evidence emerged that the NSA collects information ""at will"" from Google's and Yahoo's data hubs without those companies' knowledge and that nine leading Internet companies provided the government access directly to user information as part of the PRISM program. So it comes as no surprise that 58% of people don't trust Internet companies to protect privacy. Tech leaders have even publicly acknowledged that news about PRISM has hurt their brand trust to a far greater extent than any previous uproar over privacy violations. We can't assume any company can protect us from government snooping. So until existing laws change, we have to focus on controlling what we can. It's possible that over time, consumers will increasingly avoid or limit sharing personal information. Companies that collect huge silos of personal data may be viewed as unattractive -- as sources of intel the government can easily and secretly tap into. Ironically, the companies known as the biggest online privacy offenders who've created business models that rely on monetizing user data are now calling for limits on surveillance. Though, really, what these companies seek has nothing to do with making their collection and use of our data more transparent. Still, their point is well taken. The government must change surveillance laws to avoid destroying our trust and the current Internet economy. Those familiar with the entire cache of Snowden's leaked documents insist that the most shocking and significant revelations are yet to come. And there's a lot we'll never know. According to the U.S. government, Snowden, a low-level contract engineer, had very limited access and no knowledge about the ""crown jewels"" of the NSA's surveillance program. What could those ""crown jewels"" be? Aren't you terrified to find out? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Casey Oppenheim.","The world's leading tech companies asked President Obama to reform privacy laws .

"(CNN) -- Chris Aire is known as ""the King of Bling,"" the jeweler to the stars whose dazzling creations are worn by the likes of Angelina Jolie, 50 Cent and Shaquille O'Neal. But although he might be regularly rubbing shoulders with Hollywood superstars, famous musicians and elite athletes today, there was a time when the Nigerian-born designer could only dream about approaching a celebrity. More than two decades ago, Aire used to hang outside five star hotels and trendy bars in Los Angeles in the hope of showing his designs to a potential star client. ""I had my little coach bag,"" remembers Aire. ""I had everything in it 'cause seriously I didn't know any of these guys. So walking up to them you really have just a minute -- if even that -- to say 'yo, this is what I've got,'"" he adds. ""I had instances where people thought I was selling hot items -- 'this dude out here man, he's got some stolen stuff.'"" Read this: Africa's first design museum . But after a year of frequenting celeb hotspots, exhausting his savings in the process, Aire's big break finally came following an L.A.-based encounter with Gary Payton, the NBA star playing for the Seattle Supersonics at the time. ""I was just hanging out at a hotel waiting for him because I knew he was going to be there,"" remembers Aire. ""And when he came down, the press rush that he had, he would have been justified in saying, 'hey man get out of my way."" Instead, Payton invited Aire to go later that year to a charity event in Miami and show him his creations. There was only one problem: Aire had no money. Undeterred, Aire decided to max out his credit card and buy an airline ticket to Miami, even though he couldn't afford a return flight to L.A. But when he got to Florida, Payton was so impressed with his designs that he immediately placed a $50,000 order, buying a platinum basketball pendant for himself and other jewelry for his friends. ""That sale transformed my life,"" says Aire. ""Not only did I pay for the flight ticket, I had enough to start building and doing a bunch of my own collection."" 'Leap of faith' The son of a successful Nigerian businessman, Aire grew up in the West African country's Ivue Uromi region. His father wanted him to go into the family oil business, but instead Aire left Nigeria aged 18 to go to college in the United States. But while working on getting his education, Aire had also to find a way of supporting himself. His first job was flipping burgers in a fast-food restaurant overnight. Read this: Tribal beauty of vanishing life . ""I would work from 10 pm to 6 am in the morning and then I'll go home, get a couple of hours nap and then go to school at nine,"" recalls Aire. ""I was at school from 9 until about 4 pm -- and then I went home, got ready and repeated that again, five days a week."" After graduating from college, Aire tried his luck briefly as an actor and singer, before making his foray into jewelry with the help of a friend whose father was a jeweler. Starting from the bottom, Aire worked his way up, learning the craft and understanding everything about gold, diamonds and other colored gem stones. After six years of apprenticing under his friend's father, Aire had managed to save $5,000. He then decided it was time to strike out on his own and form his own company. ""It was a leap of faith and I took that leap of faith,"" says Aire. ""I was very confident in my faith because I believe whatever it is that puts the inspiration in your mind has within it its own fulfillment."" 'Massive wealth' Since then, Aire has managed to build a thriving company whose A-list clientele is a roll call of cinema and music superstars. In 2004, Aire made fashion history when he became the first jeweler to stage a runway show at New York Fashion Week. His sparkling creations include a diamond encrusted cuff -- priced at $1.7 million -- and a $500,000 diamond-coated guitar for hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean. But even though he mixes with the rich and famous, Aire has not forgotten where he came from. He frequently visits Nigeria and is optimistic about the future of both his country and his continent. ""I think there is going to be a time when Africa, starting with Nigeria, becomes the envy of luxury market,"" he says. ""There's massive wealth here but the Western impression of Africa has always been a country of people in need of charity, in need of aid, but Africa really is the last frontier."" Aire also believes that people in the continent should support local designers and luxury brands, which in turn can speed up the growth of African businesses. ""We have to embrace our own so that the next Louis Vuitton or Chanel comes out of Africa. So we are positioning ourselves to be that breakout brand from Africa.""","Chris Aire is a famous jeweler whose A-list clients include movie and music stars .

"(CNN) -- Footballers can often crumble under the weight of a hefty price tag. Just ask Fernando Torres, the once-prolific Spain striker who has scored a miserly five goals since joining Chelsea from Liverpool for a British record $80 million in January 2011. But not all of soccer's high-priced stars struggle with their lofty valuations. Javier Pastore has adapted quickly to life as the poster boy of Qatar Sports Investment's spending spree at French club Paris Saint-Germain. The Argentina playmaker has found the net 10 times in 25 games since moving to the French capital from Italian club Palermo for a French record transfer fee of â‚¬42 million ($56 million) in August 2011. Pastore's form has been a key factor in PSG's rise to second in the French First Division, with the team currently sat in the final qualifying spot for the European Champions League and on track to return to the competition for the first time since 2004. ""There was only pressure at the beginning,"" the 22-year-old told CNN when asked about the pressure of his transfer fee. ""Then the pressure goes away and I didn't feel it anymore. Ancelotti: PSG can rival Europe's best . ""The first few games, yeah, because people talked about it a lot. And if you don't score a goal, you think, 'Oh, they made the wrong decision and should have bought another player,' but it happens. That's football."" Pastore is one part of a trio with Italian connections who have become the face of PSG under new Qatari chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi . Carlo Ancelotti, who won the Champions League as a player and a coach with AC Milan, replaced sacked manager Antoine Kombouare in December. PSG's director of football Leonardo also has ties to the San Siro. Like former Italy international Ancelotti, the Brazilian World Cup winner has been a player and coach at Milan. Cash for cups? Qatar's influence spreads . Pastore said the influence of Leonardo, also a midfielder in his playing days, was key to his decision to head to the Parc des Princes, despite reported interest from more prestigious clubs. ""The person who convinced me the most was Leonardo,"" he said. ""He always showed interest in me and was always in touch. ""When the club's project emerged, he was the one who told me about it and encouraged me to come over. ""There were a lot of good reasons to come in PSG's project and I was a part of them. Luckily, I can tell you that I made the right choice."" Can Qatari cash make PSG a football force? Pastore has been impressed with the impact former Chelsea manager Ancelotti has had during his first few months with the club. ""Carlo is a big-name manager with lots of experience and was a big change from the previous manager. Tactically, he does things differently since he has been in other countries,"" said Pastore, who played for Atletico Huracan in his homeland. ""He knows a lot about how they play in each league and that definitely gives us something we didn't have before."" PSG have made no secret of their attempts to attract football's biggest stars, with ambitious bids for Manchester City's Carlos Tevez and Los Angeles Galaxy's David Beckham falling through in January. AC Milan's Alexandre Pato and Real Madrid's Kaka have also been linked with PSG, and Pastore admitted he would love his fellow Argentina international Gonzalo Higuain to join him too. ""I'd like to bring over a player like Higuain,"" he said of the Real Madrid striker. ""He would be a very important part of our team and could make a big difference in France. ""I have a good relationship with him, but we haven't talked. He's on Real Madrid... it's not like he's on a club that's smaller than Paris Saint-Germain."" The two-time French champions are six points ahead ahead of third-placed Lille and one point behind surprise leaders Montpellier following last weekend's dramatic 4-4 draw with Lyon. Like everyone else involved with the 1996 Cup Winners' Cup holders, Pastore knows that the ultimate aim is for PSG to compete at the top of European football. ""We wanted to be in the qualifying spots and go to the Champions League, so the team could grow and play another competition. ""We obviously want to be French champions because it's within our grasp. But our main goal was always to get to the Champions League.""","PSG's Javier Pastore says he no longer feels the pressure of his record price tag .

"(CNN) -- The case of three women held as slaves in south London has shocked not just the British public, but people across the world. What makes this particular case stand out is the length of time these women are said to have been held captive - over 30 years. Although this is an extreme example, this type of slavery is not uncommon in London. Figures from the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre and Serious Organised Crime Agency for this year show that there were 389 potential victims of trafficking in the capital. Although the women in this case are not believed to have been trafficked, the case shows that hidden slavery is taking place around us, within our everyday environments, whether it be on construction sites, mobile soup runs for the homeless, at cheap takeaways, in nail bars and in domestic homes in our neighborhoods. Read more: How to recover after decades of slavery? It's not necessarily organized by criminal gangs - it can involve informal arrangements, carried out by so-called ordinary and even respected people in the community. I recently published a report called ""Shadow City -- Exposing human trafficking in everyday London"" that uncovered just how diverse that trafficking is, and that no matter where you live you are probably not that far from someone who is being exploited. Sadly, authorities are still blind to this. Things need to change, urgently. An overstretched anti-trafficking unit in London's Metropolitan Police, and a figure-driven culture, means police are focusing on large-scale organized cases, and neglecting the informal cases that take longer to find, but are sometimes more serious. In this case the three victims were lucky. They are said to have contacted a charity that was able to successfully rescue them. Many are not so fortunate. Read more: Slavery's last stronghold . But if we continue to lose the expertise of dedicated trafficking officers within the Met police, the cultural subtleties behind cases will be missed and traffickers and perpetrators of slavery will continue to largely evade conviction. Of course budgets are tight, but if the money made in trafficking exploits is recuperated through the use of specialist teams, then these investigations could pay for themselves. In my report, I made some recommendations that could help tackle the lack of action on informal types of slavery. These included the Met's anti-trafficking unit being urgently protected from further integration into other units, additional human trafficking units to be established in other police forces across the UK, human trafficking to become part of the core syllabus for training new police recruits, and special points of contact to be established in every borough's police force. The police are not the only agency that needs better systems put in place. It is also vitally important that social workers, teachers, health professionals and benefit agency staff receive training on how to spot signs of trafficking and slavery, and who to consult if they have concerns. For too long many Londoners have assumed that trafficking happens elsewhere, and statutory agencies have concentrated too much resource into trafficking that happens through organized crime with a concentration on drugs and sex workers. The case in south London shows that slaves could be living next door. Read more: The CNN Freedom Project . Watch more: 12,000 girls rescued from slavery .

"(CNN) -- A ""smart village"" aimed at tackling rural poverty while promoting community and sustainability has been unveiled in Malaysia. Built to the northeast of capital Kuala Lumpur, Rimbunan Kaseh is the result of a public/private partnership and could be used as a model for providing relief from poverty around the world, according to its creators. In addition to 100 homes, residents have access to educational, training and recreational facilities on site as well as a sustainable agricultural system which provides a reliable food source and a supplementary income for residents. A four-level aquaculture system plays host to guppies and algae which provide food for larger fish like protein-rich tilapia. Filtered water from the fish tanks is also used to irrigate trees, flowers and crops. ""It is a complete loop; a modern farm -- one that could even exist on the rooftop of a building,"" Tan Say Jim, managing director of Malaysia's IRIS Corporation Berhad, who are spearheading efforts, said in a statement. ""With this project we stimulate rural growth with modern agriculture activities, we balance development and economic activities between the urban and rural areas, we provide income and we improve living standards,"" Tan added. All the homes on the 12-hectare site are energy efficient, sourcing power from solar panels complimented by biomass and hydro. Further villages are planned at as many as 12 locations in the country which will form a network of ""smart communities"" laying the foundations for future jobs and prosperity, developers predict. Progress in poverty reduction has been ""uneven"" in Malaysia, according to the United Nations Development Program, with ""pockets of hard-core rural poverty remaining."" But the situation is an improving one, with the national poverty rates falling sharply over the last two decades. Speaking at the Institute for Diplomacy and Foreign Relations in Kuala Lumpur earlier this year, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised the country's efforts to tackle poverty as part of the wider Millennium Development Goals. ""Your experiences can help countries throughout the global South, and I urge Malaysia to look at how it can increase South-South cooperation,"" Mr. Ban said. ""Malaysia is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural country. Promoting unity among diversity, promoting one Malaysia among Malaysians is a great vision, not only for the Malaysian people, but also for the region ..."" Ellis Rubenstein, president and chief executive of the New York Academy of Sciences and co-chair of Global Science and Innovation Advisory Council (GSIAC) says the Malaysian model is a ""great opportunity"" to improve the lives of poverty-stricken people in the country and around the world. ""Integrated smart communities could transform services available to Malaysia's citizenry while creating thousands of jobs ..."" Rubenstein said in a statement. Set up in 2011, GSIAC is a joint initiative between the New York Academy of Sciences and the Malaysia Industry-Government for High Technology (MIGHT). At a meeting earlier this month, Zakri Abdul Hamid, scientific adviser to the Prime Minister of Malaysia, praised the alliance. ""It opens the door to major foreign investment. And it gives us the chance that no other government -- either regional or national -- has anywhere in the world to develop a staged, integrated solution to our citizens needs ..."" Zakri said.","U.S./Malaysian initiative aims to promote growth and sustainability in rural Malaysia with ""smart villages""

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova once labeled the conditions as ""inhuman"" and three-time defending men's champion Novak Djokovic suffered a dramatic meltdown in a quarterfinal match in 2009 so it's with a degree of trepidation that the world's elite go into the Australian Open with a heatwave forecast for Melbourne. Temperatures are predicted to reach a blistering 42 degrees Celsius Tuesday (107 Fahrenheit) and remain at that level until the weekend. While the opening grand slam of the season has an Extreme Heat Policy -- in place since 1998 -- it is rarely invoked and players simply have to make do. Djokovic, who had to retire with heat exhaustion against Andy Roddick when defending his 2008 crown, has become renowned for his supreme fitness levels and claims to be ready for any challenge. ""I am expecting to play in big heat. You always have to expect it because you can't really predict Melbourne's weather, it's changing a lot,"" Djokovic told gathered reporters on the eve of his title defense. ""I remember the 2008, 2009 and 2010 tournaments, there were several days I played in extreme heat. So I know how tough it is. ""But it's the same for myself and my opponent so you have to adjust to it,"" he said. Given a favorable draw, avoiding the likes of world number one Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Roger Federer until at least the final, Djokovic is unlikely to be troubled by the weather or his first round opponent Lukas Lacko of Slovakia on Monday. After that the level of the opposition and the heat is expected to rise with Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka looming large as his main threat. Wawrinka extended Djokovic in a five-set fourth round clash last year which many considered the outstanding match of 2013. This time around they cannot meet until the semifinals by which time forecasters are predicting a return to more manageable conditions. Sharapova, playing her first grand slam since Wimbledon last year, remains wary of conditions after being reminded of her 2007 three-setter against France's Camille Pin, after which she made her outburst. ""I don't think anyone can prepare themselves for that type of heat,"" she told reporters. ""When you try to put in that effort, that maximum effort to give as an athlete, it's pretty difficult for a longer period of time."" Murray, himself back in action after a layoff for surgery, is also not relishing extreme temperatures despite preparing for the championships in Florida. ""The difference between 32 degrees or whatever in Florida and 40, it's a huge difference. ""It feels very different on the court. The court gets so hot, the air is extremely hot as well,"" said the Scot. If he can get the better of conditions, it is likely that both Roger Federer then Nadal would stand in his path if he wants to repeat last year's men's final showdown with Djokovic. Defending champion Victoria Azarenka and top seed Serena Williams are strongly favored to meet in the women's final and both claim to be unperturbed about the rising temperature gauge. ""I've been here playing for, what, last eight years. It's not a new thing to play in the heat. I actually enjoy that,"" said Azarenka. ""I mean, not all the time probably, but it's nice to get some sun."" Williams tweeted earlier this week to complain about then cold conditions in the Victorian State capital, but claims to be ready for whatever awaits. ""I've been training my whole life in the heat. I think I'm pretty used to it. But obviously the heat in Melbourne is just completely different than any other heat,"" said the American. ""But it's okay. I've just got to be ready to play under any circumstances."" For the record, the hottest Australian Open was in 2009 when the average daily temperature was 34.7 Celsius, with Djokovic the most high-profile victim.","High temperatures expected for Australian Open tennis championships .

"(CNN) -- Nobody would have predicted this. A team coming off the back of a mediocre season with a newly-appointed, unheralded coach, sitting at the top of the Italian Serie A table after a run of nine successive victories. No team in European football has made a better start to the 2013-14 season than Roma; no team in Italian football history has ever made a better start to a Serie A season. A handful of vibrant new recruits and a wily old-timer have all combined to lift the club to the top of the table, with Roma's form attracting admiring glances from around the world. ""What I really like about this Roma team is that they play with a strong mentality,"" Italian football expert Tor-Kristian Karlsen told CNN. ""They play with such intensity and have a winning mentality,"" added the former Monaco chief executive. With many scratching their heads as to how this incredible run has been put together, CNN gives you five reasons why Rudi Garcia's team are the toast of the continent. Rudi Garcia . Garcia's arrival at Roma in June went largely unnoticed, the Frenchman replacing Aurelio Andrezzoli after an unspectacular sixth-place finish in the 2012-13 campaign. The Frenchman won the Ligue 1 title with Lille in 2011, a team which featured players like Gervinho (more on him later) and Chelsea star Eden Hazard, but arguably Garcia had flown under the radar of all but the most-discerning European football fans. ""He has a very strong personality, he is very articulate and commands huge respect,"" French football expert Philippe Auclair told CNN. ""I recently talked to Hazard and he was speaking about Chelsea manger Jose Mourinho's insistence on taking care of defensive duties. He said that approach is similar to Garcia and that speaks volumes about the thoroughness of his preparations."" Garcia is one of a small band of French coaches to have worked in Italy's top division and the 49-year-old has faced his fair share of doubters during his first six months in Rome. ""His success has been a huge surprise,"" added Auclair. ""France has exported a lot of players to Italy, but when he went to Roma there was a negative reaction that this guy was a 'no-hoper'."" Garcia's success is made all the more remarkable given the pressures which weigh on the shoulders of any Roma coach. Despite having left Monaco earlier this year, Karlsen remains in touch with former Roma player and coach Claudio Ranieri, who is currently in charge at the Ligue 1 club. The Norwegian said: ""Ranieri told me that Roma is probably the toughest job in the world given the pressure and focus from outside the club."" Garcia has also done well to utilize the considerable talents of club captain Francesco Totti, a player who is idolized by the Romanisti and whose exclusion from the side can result in uproar. ""Totti is a talisman for Roma, but that also creates problems for any incoming coach,"" explained Karlsen. ""He is a God to the club's fans and you wouldn't want to be the coach that ends his career. You'd imagine that the other players look up to him and he is strong influence in the dressing room. ""He is a leader, who is deeply attached to Roma and wants the best for his team and city."" Market trading . Roma's smart preseason trading has been another factor in their record-breaking start. Argentine winger Erik Lamela and Argentine-born Italy striker Pablo Daniel Osvaldo were both sold to English clubs, Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton respectively, in big-money deals, giving Roma scope to recruit some exciting talents. Gervinho arrived from Arsenal, while sturdy Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman --""made for Italian football"" according to Karlsen -- was signed from PSV Eindhoven despite reported interest from Manchester United. Morgan De Sanctis and Medhi Benatia are two new recruits who have helped make up a formidable defence, along with veteran Brazilian right-back Maicon. Lamela has been replaced by Adem Llajic, a Serb who joined Roma from Fiorentina and who has already scored three times in six appearances. ""You have to praise the technical director Walter Sabatini -- and he deserves a lot of credit,"" added Karlsen. ""The first part of the transfer window they were just a selling club, but Sabatini kept a cool head, bought the right players at the right price at the right moment having made a profit of 40 million euros."" A water tight defence . Nine games played, nine games won and one goal conceded. Parma are the only team to have breached Europe's meanest defence, taking the lead in a match Roma went on to win 3-1. Goalkeeper De Sanctis arrived from Napoli for a modest $690,000 in July and he has enjoyed a near faultless start to his career in the Italian capital, stationed behind the center back pairing of Italian international Federico Balzaretti and Morocco's Benatia. Roma's latest win, a 1-0 success at Udinese, was proof of their defensive steel. Down to 10 men, without the services of attacking talisman Totti and in-form winger Gervinho, Roma ground out a 1-0 win to become the first visiting team to take three points from Udine since September 2012. ""Congratulations to my team-mates,"" said Totti on his website after the match. ""Each one showed courage, strength and, as we say around here, two massive balls!"" Francesco Totti . Like the Coliseum and the Circus Maximus, Totti is an immovable monument on the landscape of the Eternal City. The flamboyant attacker is Roma's captain and the definition of a one-club man. Since making his debut in 1992, Totti has made 542 appearances for the Giallorossi, scoring 230 goals. As Roma's official website says, ""the number 10 is without question the best player in the club's history."" Totti's form this season has been imperious, with the veteran scoring three goals and contributing six assists. His standout performance of Roma's winning run came away at Inter Milan, where he found the net twice in a convincing 3-0 triumph. His performances have led to calls for him to return to the Italy team for the first time since 2006. His last match for the Azzuri was the penalty shootout triumph over France in the 2006 World Cup final, with current national coach Cesare Prandelli suggesting a fit and in-form Totti would be a shoo-in for a place at Brazil 2014. Gervinho . Another attacking star of Roma's renaissance has been Gervinho, the Ivorian forward who has thus far proved to be a shrewd acquisition from English Premier League team Arsenal. Gervinho's two-year stay in England was largely unremarkable as he developed a reputation for missing chances. His preseason move to Roma saw him reunited with Rudi Garcia, who was his coach during a successful stay in France with Lille, and it has paid dividends. Three goals and one assist from a player who managed just six Premier League goals in his final season with Arsenal is an impressive return, hinting that Gervinho could be ready to fulfill the promise he showed during he and Garcia's first spell together.","Roma top Serie A after winning opening nine league matches .

"(CNN) -- Players and ball boys fainting and accusations of ""inhumane"" treatment. If it's hot on court -- temperatures of 42.2 Celsius (108 Fahrenheit) were recorded Tuesday -- at the Australia Open, the mercury is also rising for tournament officials at Melbourne Park. Canadian Frank Dancevic fainted during his match with Frenchman Benoit Paire, before he got really hot under the collar over the conditions players had to contend with at the first tennis grand slam of 2014. ""I think it's inhumane, I don't think it's fair to anybody, to the players, to the fans, to the sport, when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out,"" the world No. 122 told reporters. ""I've played five set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat-stroke, it's not normal. ""Having players with so many problems and complaining to the tournament that it's too hot to play, until somebody dies, they're just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat. ""I personally don't think it's fair and I know a lot of players don't think it's fair."" It wasn't just players who succumbed to the elements. One of the ball boys fainted during 11th seed Milos Raonic's four-set defeat of Spain's Daniel Gimeno-Traver. ""Of course there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match,"" chief medical officer Tim Wood told reporters, as organizers defended the decision to play in the heat. Caution urged . But with temperatures above 40 Celsius expected for most of the week, Briton Andy Murray urged caution. ""Whether it's safe or not, I don't know. You've just got to be very careful these days,"" he said. ""There's been some issues in other sports with, you know, players having heart attacks."" In the women's draw, Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki claimed the weather caused her drinks bottle to melt on court while second seed Victoria Azarenka described playing at the Rod Laver Arena as like ""dancing in a frying pan."" The tournament's ""extreme heat"" contingency was introduced for matches in the women's draw, allowing for an extended break between the second and third sets. Rather than solely using a temperature reading, organizers use a measurement which also considers humidity and wind to decide whether or not conditions have become unplayable. ""We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time,"" tournament referee Wayne McKewen said in a statement. ""That didn't happen. While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue."" While some players wilted, Roger Federer was typically unflappable in the stifling heat. ""Just deal with it, because it's the same for both (players),"" said the 17-time grand slam winner, seeded sixth, after defeating spirited Australian James Duckworth 6-4 6-4 6-2. When asked if he thought organizers should close the retractable roof over the Rod Laver Arena to help lower the temperature on court, the 32-year-old Federer, who last won one of tennis' four majors at Wimbledon in 2012, replied: ""No. I think it should always stay open, honestly."" World No. 1 Rafael Nadal played in the last match to get under way in the Rod Laver Arena against Australian Bernard Tomic. Thirteen-time grand slam winner Nadal took the first set 6-4 before the 57th-ranked Tomic retired with a leg injury. Nadal will play Tomic's compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis in the second round. Murray made a strong start in his bid to finally capture Melbourne glory, beating Japan's Go Soeda 6-1 6-1 6-3. The world No. 4 has been runner-up at the season's first grand slam in three of the last four years, but enters this tournament short of match practice after undergoing back surgery. However the Scot looked sharp, taking just 87 minutes to dispatch his 112th-ranked opponent in punishing heat and set up a second round meeting with Frenchman Vincent Millot. U.S. No. 1 John Isner's tournament is over after he was forced to withdraw from his match with Slovakia's Martin Klizan due to a foot injury. Isner, the only American male seeded in the draw, has been battling ankle and shin problems during the offseason. The 28-year-old missed last year's tournament with a knee injury. Another American to fall at the first hurdle was Rhyne Williams who, despite winning the opening set, suffered a battling 6-7 (1-7) 6-3 6-4 6-4 loss against fifth seed Juan Martin del Potro. Argentina's Del Potro is looking to build on an encouraging 2013 season which saw him reach the last four of a grand slam, at Wimbledon, for the first time since 2009. But Del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, struggled with intense heat. ""You are thinking about a lot more things than the tennis match,"" said the 25-year-old, who plays Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut next. ""You are trying to drink a lot and always thinking about your body, your physic, and not about the game. ""I know tomorrow and after tomorrow it's going to be worst, so I will try to be ready for the weather conditions, too."" Empty seats were prevalent as many fans stayed away in heat, but those that did go to Melbourne Park were treated to a gutsy performance from Australian stalwart Lleyton Hewitt in his five-set battle with 24th seed Andrea Seppi. The Italian took a two-set lead before former world No. 1 Hewitt rallied to draw level. To the disappointment most of those in the Rod Laver Arena, though, Hewitt's comeback was thwarted and Italy's Seppi eventually triumphed 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 5-7 5-7 7-5. Tenth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, beaten in the quarterfinals in 2013, beat Seppi's compatriot Filippo Volandri in straight sets.","Canada's Frank Dancevic faints during his opening match at the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's defense of the English Premier League title was dealt another hammer blow Saturday as David Moyes' slumping side were beaten 1-0 by Newcastle United at Old Trafford. It was the second home defeat for United in three days and their fifth of a sorry campaign, as many as they suffered all last season in winning their record 20th English championship. Trailing leaders Arsenal by 12 points before the lunchtime kick off, United remained in ninth place while Newcastle, winning at Old Trafford for the first time in 41 years, moved up to sixth place ahead of the afternoon program. Yohan Cabaye's goal just after the hour mark sealed three points for the visitors, the highly-rated Frenchman scoring after a cut back from Moussa Sissoko. Missing the suspended Wayne Rooney, the home side created few opportunities although Patrice Evra hit the post with a header before the Newcastle breakthrough. Dutch striker Robin van Persie, back after injury, had a late effort ruled out for offside and substitute Wilfried Zaha shot narrowly wide, but Alan Pardew's battlers held out comfortably enough. Moyes, who took over from Alex Ferguson in the summer, refused to accept that their title challenge was over at this stage of the season, but admitted his team were in a ""transitional period."" ""I stand firm that we'll be very close to it and I hope we're in and around it when it comes to the end of the season,"" he told BT Sport. He also asked for patience from the United fans, so used to continuous success under the legendary Ferguson. ""I think they understand it's the same players which were here last year as well. Obviously the manager's changed, so we'll work, we'll try and improve and try and get better."" United did look to be turning the corner with a 12-match unbeaten run ahead of Wednesday's 1-0 defeat to Moyes' former club Everton. Rooney, so missed Saturday, starred in a 5-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen which took them into the last 16 of the Champions League, but their EPL form has been inconsistent. Arsenal can open a 15-point gap over United if they beat Everton Sunday and could take heart from the results of their nearest challengers later Saturday. Chelsea slipped to a shock 3-2 defeat at struggling Stoke City with on-loan Liverpool winger Oussama Assaidi grabbing the odd goal in five winner in the final minute. Jose Mourinho's side looked set for a point after Andre Schurrle completed a double either side of goals from Peter Crouch and Stephen Ireland, but Assaidi hit the winner with a sublime strike at the death. Manchester City also missed the chance to close up, held 1-1 at Southampton after taking a 10th-minute lead through Sergio Aguero. But Dani Osvaldo grabbed the equalizer for the Saints before halftime. Liverpool took advantage of the slip ups to go above Chelsea into second place on goal difference with a 4-1 home win over West Ham. The struggling Hammers did not help their cause by scoring two own goals and having captain Kevin Nolan sent off in the second half. The outstanding Luis Suarez scored his 14th goal of the season in the impressive win. Tottenham Hotspur secured their second away win in a week in the late game at Sunderland, emerging 2-1 winners to take close order in sixth.","Manchester United beaten 1-0 by Newcastle at Old Trafford .

"Paris (CNN) -- Jean-Claude Mas, the founder of a French company that made defective breast implants, has been sentenced in France to four years in prison for fraud. Mas, who founded Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, also must pay a 75,000 euro ($103,000) fine, according to Philippe Courtois, a lawyer representing women who had the company's implants. Four other PIP executives tried alongside Mas at the Marseille court received lesser sentences, Courtois said. They are Claude Couty, managing director and chief executive of the company; Hannelore Font, in charge of quality; LoÃ¯c Gossart, in charge of production; and the head of research and development, Thierry Brinon. Mas, who denied wrongdoing in the case, was arrested in January 2012 in connection with an investigation after the 2010 cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants. He still faces a separate trial on a charge of causing involuntary injury. An investigation found that the company's implants contained silicone that had not been certified for that use. An estimated 300,000 women in 65 countries received breast implants from PIP. The implants were banned in 2010, and the company went bankrupt later that year. The implants were not approved for use in the United States. The French government said last year that it would pay for the removal of PIP implants for women in France. According to the national agency for the safety of drugs and health products, more than 17,000 women in France had had their PIP implants removed between 2001 and the end of September this year. Of the implants removed, a little more than a quarter were found to be faulty, it said. A report published by a European Commission panel in September found ""no convincing medical, toxicological or other data to justify removal of intact PIP implants as a precautionary approach."" It also found there was no reliable evidence that ruptured PIP implants create a greater health risk than a ruptured silicone breast implant from another manufacturer. However, scientific research shows that ""PIP implants produced in the period 2001-2010 have a higher probability of rupture and also of earlier rupture than other breast implants,"" it said. Given this, the panel suggests it may be advisable for women with PIP implants to be offered regular assessments. CNN's Sandrine Amiel reported from Paris and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London.","NEW: Four other PIP executives receive lesser sentences at the court in Marseille .

"(CNN) -- On April 28, 2003, Apple threw open the virtual doors to its iTunes Store, and music -- all digital media, really -- hasn't been the same since. Suddenly, an industry terrified of online piracy had a legitimate place to earn money from the sale of digital music. Listeners no longer had to drive to their neighborhood record store (remember those?) to buy that new album by Norah Jones or 50 Cent. A song cost only 99 cents, a bargain next to an $18 CD. And iTunes-powered iPods, with their signature white earbuds, became a must-have mobile accessory. Not everyone was thrilled. Record labels grumbled at being strong-armed over song prices by Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Some musicians complained that they didn't earn enough royalties from digital-music sales. But by 2010, iTunes was the largest music retailer on the planet. Today, it has 435 million registered users in 119 countries and recently served up its 25 billionth song, downloaded by a man in Germany. iTunes also now sells much more than music: Customers can download movies, TV shows, games, books, podcasts and more. In recent months, Apple's retail juggernaut has shown signs of weakness. Recent figures show that its growth may finally be slowing down. And services such as Pandora, Spotify, Rdio and others, which allow users to stream songs for free or a modest monthly fee, are supplanting iTunes among many young listeners. But its arrival 10 years ago this week was a sea change for anyone who makes, distributes or enjoys listening to music. CNNMoney: The Evolution of iTunes . Here's a look at some ways iTunes changed music, and us: . It celebrated the song, not the album . Thanks to iTunes, all of a sudden, you didn't have to buy that Chumbawamba record to get ""Tubthumping"" (the ""I get knocked down"" song). You could cherry-pick whatever songs you wanted instead of paying extra for the filler on an album or -- heaven forbid -- for a CD single. And sure enough, sales of songs far outpace sales of whole albums on iTunes. One downside of this is that artists have less incentive to make thematic concept albums. It's hard to envision what the impact of ""Sgt. Pepper"" or ""OK Computer"" might have been in the iTunes era. It rewarded impatience . Here's the way it used to work: You'd hear a song on the radio. You'd have to figure out what it was (a challenge in the days before Shazam). You'd drive to a mall. You'd search for the record. You'd buy the record -- if it was in stock. You'd put it in your CD player or on your turntable. Finally, you'd get to listen. Now: Hear song, download song. Instant gratification. If the Internet has made the world's knowledge accessible to almost anybody with a computer, iTunes has done the same with music. According to Apple, the iTunes store now stocks more than 26 million songs, many of which aren't about Taylor Swift's ex-boyfriends. Now, whether it's Javanese gamelan music or 13th-century Christmas tunes, it's all at our fingertips -- and we can sample it immediately. Kids, you've got no excuse. It killed the mixtape . Ahh, those lovingly made aural valentines, filled with oh-so-cool jams sure to impress your romantic interest or hipster friend. So fun to make, not always so fun to receive. Sound quality? Eh, it's good enough . Throughout the history of recorded music, the idea was usually to improve sound quality. As music went from scratchy cylinders to 78s to LPs to CDs, there was usually a corresponding leap in audio excellence. But the digital formats available from iTunes, which compress audio files to make them easier to download, are a step down from CD quality. And you know what? Outside of audiophiles, nobody cares. The iTunes Store and its digital brethren have helped clear the way for the ""good enough"" society. Those smartphone photos? Not as good as a digital camera's but good enough. That netbook? Not as powerful as a laptop but good enough. Convenience almost always wins. As Wired's Robert Capps wrote, ""Having it here and now is more important than having it perfect."" It killed album art . This week, Storm Thorgerson died. You probably don't know his name, but you know his work: Thorgerson was a graphic artist who designed album covers for Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and 10cc, among many others. You may also have seen Thorgerson's shrunken covers on iTunes, where they have no more heft than an app icon. The song is the thing in the iTunes world, and that means there's less importance for the kind of artwork Thorgerson did -- which, in its 12-by-12-inch LP album cover form, was sometimes more impressive than the music it housed. Yes, iTunes offers booklets, images, videos and movies, but you can't frame those and hang them on a dorm room wall ... or use them to spread out, uh, study accessories. It made apps mainstream . Until July 2008, apps were just something you ate before the main course. Then came the App Store, a specialty shop inside the larger iTunes department store, and Apple's iconic ""There's an app for that"" campaign. Soon, every early adopter was waving around their iPhone, boasting about all the apps they'd loaded onto it and slinging virtual birds at virtual pigs. The iPad only accelerated this trend. In January, Apple announced that more than 40 billion apps had been downloaded from its online store. 'All Together Now' A small minority of artists have refused to sell their music on iTunes. But one group in particular was unmoved by the move to digital downloads: the Beatles. Thanks to legal disputes and sonic concerns, for more than seven years, the Fab Four (and their many representatives) resisted calls to transfer their prized catalog to iTunes, leaving music fans stuck with their old-fashioned CDs, LPs and reel-to-reel tapes. That finally changed in 2010, when the Beatles' Apple Corps joined with Apple's core music distribution product. (Yes, the use of the name ""Apple"" was another part of the dispute.) Since then, the two have ""Come Together"" to the benefit of both. In the first week of availability, iTunes sold 450,000 Beatles albums and more than 2 million Beatles songs. 'Curse you, iTunes!!!!!!!!' Despite its hundreds of millions of users, iTunes has its critics. It's become one of the most unpopular programs Apple offers. It's slow to load, it's a memory hog, and it likes to update seemingly every day. ""Won't someone take iTunes out back and shoot it?"" Slate's Farhad Manjoo asked in an article as iTunes 11 was released. ""Each new upgrade brings more suckage into your computer."" Apple fanboys wait excitedly for most new Apple products. But for iTunes? Not so much. And then there's this: Legally, you don't own the songs you download on iTunes; you simply own the right to play them on your devices. So it might be a good idea to hang on to those old LPs and CDs -- and leave your passwords in your will.","Apple's iTunes Store launched April 28, 2003 .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer called it the team's final objective, now the all-conquering German side are within touching distance of their fifth trophy of a remarkable year. With the European Champions League, German Bundesliga, German Cup and European Super Cup titles all secured they now have their sights on the FIFA Club World Cup. The tournament, hosted this year by Morocco, pits the champions of each continent against each other to see who can lay claim to being billed as the best club side in the world. And a comfortable 3-0 victory over Chinese team Guangzhou Evergrande in their semifinal on Tuesday means only Moroccan champions Raja Casablanca, or Brazil's Atletico Mineiro, can derail the Bayern juggernaut. Bayern's three goals came in the space of seven minutes. They also hit the woodwork five times during the match. Guangzhou are coached by veteran Italian Marcello Lippi, who led his country to the World Cup in 2006, and became the first Chinese side to win the Asian Champions League title this year. It meant Lippi, who won Italy's Serie A five times as a coach, became the first person to win both the European and Asian Champions League titles. But though his side battled hard in the early stages of their glamor tie against Bayern, led by former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, they couldn't stem the tide for long. Guardiola, who won 14 trophies in four years at Barca, has continued where his predecessor Jupp Heynckes left off, and once won all six competitions the Catalan giants contested in a single season. It was Franck Ribery who got Bayern off and running, capitalizing on a poor clearance to drive the ball home with 40 minutes gone. The Frenchman is in the running to be crowned the world's best player, nominated for the Ballon d'Or alongside Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona's Lionel Messi, and he finished clinically. Just four minutes later Spanish midfielder Thiago Alcantara pinched the ball and crossed for Croatian striker Mario Mandzukic to head home. And three minutes after the break, just as Guangzhou looked to get a foothold in the match, Germany international Mario GÃ¶tze's deflected shot put the result beyond doubt. Bayern will learn who they will face in Sunday's final when Raja Casablanca take on Atletico Mineiro on Wednesday.","Bayern Munich beat Guangzhou Evergrande 3-0 at the FIFA Club World Cup .

"(CNN) -- One of the problems with American politics is that it is falling prey to sideshows. Issues that really don't matter -- from the war on Christmas to anything Sarah Palin said recently -- are given headline space above things that really do. And too often the things that don't matter are about semantics; someone says something innocent and the entire media explodes in horror. Step forward Megyn Kelly, one of those hyper-glamorous Fox anchors who deliver the news dressed for dinner. Kelly hosted a segment in reaction to an article by Aisha Harris on Slate, in which Harris complained that a white Santa is stigmatizing and suggested he be replaced by a race-neutral penguin (at the risk of excluding polar bears). In the course of the Fox segment, Kelly addressed the audience directly and said, ""Santa just is white."" She went on to assert, ""Jesus was a white man, too. It's like we have, he's a historical figure that's a verifiable fact, as is Santa, I just want kids to know that. How do you revise it in the middle of the legacy in the story and change Santa from white to black?"" The world went mad. Accusations of Fox starting a race war flew around. MSNBC commentators pointed out that Jesus was certainly not white; one of them even wrote an emotional letter to Santa pleading for more tolerance. Saturday Night Live came up with the inevitable skit of an African-American Santa saying he is ""as black as Hell."" Opinion: Santa's color isn't the important thing . All of which needn't have happened if Kelly's critics had watched the video and cut her some slack. The segment is jokey and she opened it by speaking to the kids at home, which is why she repeatedly reassured the audience that Santa is ""real"" (no one over 10 years old is that naive). At first she dismissed Harris' argument as unnecessary and odd, but then actually came around to endorsing its sentiments, noting that it must indeed be painful to grow up in a culture surrounded by white idols. As for her assertion that Santa is white, her point was that he is universally depicted that way in popular culture. So, too, is Jesus, although it was ignorant of Kelly to imply that this is historically verifiable. Likewise, I suspect the entire segment would not have drawn such controversy if Fox had bothered to invite a single person of color to appear on the panel. There was a gross lack of sensitivity on display. All in all, Megyn Kelly is guilty of using lazy language. The debate surrounding her remarks is a classic example of the U.S. media talking to itself, of point scoring against competitors dressed up as serious political debate. Both the left and the right do it. Teacher to student: You can't be Santa -- you're black . For example, Al Sharpton and Bill O'Reilly have a long-running grudge that erupted again last week when Sharpton accused O'Reilly of trying to ""disparage"" Nelson Mandela. On the right, of course, Fox is no angel -- just take a look at the almost comical imbalance of its coverage of Typhoon Haiyan versus the problems facing Obamacare. Fox regularly obsesses about MSNBC's ratings, what its anchors say, as well as standard ""liberals are trying to destroy the world"" fare like killing Christmas. Often, there is an unwillingness to show charity toward opponents. When Michelle Obama suggested that sometimes it might be best if kids skip dessert, Sarah Palin parodied this as an authoritarian crackdown on liberty and openly fed her children s'mores on TV to make her point. Palin misinterpreted Obama's advice as an order; and much of the media misinterpreted Palin's joke as a serious statement. The original meaning and intent of the words that people used were largely forgotten in pursuit of a frivolous debate. The reality is that for millions of Americans these issues don't matter one bit. They're too busy worrying about debt, taxes and the war on terror. The most common reaction to the ""controversy"" over Santa's skin color would probably be, ""I don't care."" After all, he is NOT REAL. But unemployment, lack of health care, and terrorism, sadly, are real life issues. Can we discuss something real, please? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Fox anchor Megyn Kelly causes an uproar when she says Santa is just white .
Timothy Stanley: Can we discuss something real, please?

"(CNN) -- Nelson Mandela ached to come home, his family says, and he did so Sunday -- his burial the last part of a long journey that had lasted nearly a century. The prisoner turned president's funeral in his childhood village of Qunu marked the end of 10 days mourning, during which tribal elders guided Mandela's transition to the afterlife. The funeral was a final chance for those who knew him best to say goodbye. Mandela's daughter Maki told me her father had always been a country boy at heart, and wanted to return to his remote farm in the Eastern Cape, one of South Africa's most rural areas. ""Even when my father was in jail, he had the fondest memories of Qunu,"" she said. ""And he really wanted to die here."" Pointing to a chair in the living room she said: ""This is Tata's special chair... he would sit like this, with a cushion here, because he enjoyed looking out into the hills."" Mandela's casket lay in his bedroom overlooking those hills overnight ahead of his funeral. Tribal elders held a vigil and a family prayer service took place Sunday morning. The state funeral service was held in a huge domed tent, surrounded by cows grazing in the neighboring fields. Inside, 95 candles burned, each representing one year of his life. Inside that tent -- filled with the sweet scent of white roses and lilies -- the Mandela family shared their grief with some 4,000 guests and television cameras broadcasting the service to the world. Friends and family mourned alongside heads of state, royalty and celebrities who had made their way along South Africa's back roads to Mandela's burial place. As well as being about family and loss, the state funeral was a mixture of power and politics, of belonging and belief. Mandela had a canny knack of building relationships and among those at his funeral were those who represented the old apartheid order. The great reconciliator continued to bring people together in death, just as he had in life. Mandela's burial, however, was private. A few hundred mourners walked up the hills where he had played as a child to say goodbye. Mandela's eldest daughter carried a reed mat that was laid on the floor of the grave, evoking the sense Mandela was going to rest on a traditional sleeping mat. The television coverage turned skyward to catch a flypast of planes and helicopters as Mandela was finally laid to rest, in a grave surrounded by local plants designed to evoke the journey of his life. Mandela's granddaughter Tukwini said it had been a challenge to organize the funeral in the remote location ""but my grandfather was born here."" ""This is where my grandfather told us who we were as Mandelas,"" she explained. Mandela's family says his spirit is now in Qunu. Finally, after a life journey that was long, proud and honored, Nelson Mandela is home. Hamba Kahle Tata. Lala Kahle Tata. Goodbye father. Sleep well.

"Washington (CNN) -- Democratic and Republican leaders don't see eye to eye on much these days. But political veterans on both sides of the aisle do agree on one point -- the stakes are high in the rapidly approaching 2014 midterm races. For Democrats, the midterms are all about holding their slim Senate majority and, if possible, defying historical odds by retaking the House of Representatives. They want to give President Barack Obama a working congressional majority for his last two years in office to help secure his legacy and lay the best possible groundwork for the party's standard bearer in 2016. For Republicans, it's the polar opposite. 2014 is all about finally realizing their maddeningly elusive goal of recapturing the Senate while also boosting their House majority, ensuring Obama's a powerless lame duck, and pounding away at presidential accomplishments like the Affordable Care Act in the run-up to 2016. Poll: Voters split over Republicans, Democrats in 2014 . Which party will come out on top next year? It's too early to know. But here are seven key factors to keep in mind: . 1. Obamacare . Republicans have promised to keep this issue front and center throughout 2014. And the botched rollout of the HealthCare.gov website -- combined with news of canceled insurance policies and problems with the new exchanges -- has given the GOP plenty of ammunition. The number of Americans citing health care as the country's biggest problem recently jumped seven percentage points -- from 12% in October to 19% in November -- according to Gallup. Meanwhile, the public's opinion of Obamacare has soured. Net disapproval of Obamacare jumped from three points (44% approval versus 47% disapproval) in October to 15 points (40% approval versus 55% disapproval) in November, according to Gallup. Pelosi defends Obamacare claims, can't predict effect on 2014 . This month, Democrats came close to losing a gubernatorial race in Virginia that most analysts believed they'd win easily. Why? Part of the reason appeared to be Obamacare's sinking numbers. More than a quarter of Virginia voters said health care -- a traditional Democratic strength -- was their most important issue. They narrowly broke for the Republican nominee. Congressional Democrats are spooked. Thirty-nine of them voted last week for a GOP bill that would let insurers continue to offer policies not in compliance with the minimum standards outlined in the Affordable Care Act. Obamacare rattles Democrats with midterms looming . ""Even if the Obama administration fixes Obamacare in the near term or before November 2014, this ineptitude ... has shaken voter confidence in government to its core,"" said Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller. ""Democrats have relied on government solutions to a wide range of problems to win campaigns. I believe that strategy is now threatened and the Democrats will have to work on their policy messaging for November 2014 if they want to hang onto the Senate."" GOP taints 2014 Democrats with Obama health care pledge . 2. Shutdown fatigue . How badly did the Republican party hurt itself during the recent government shutdown? For the first time since the GOP won back the House in 2010, a majority of Americans said in mid-October they believe GOP control of the House is bad for the country. A majority of Americans -- 54% -- had a negative view of Republican control of the House, up 11 points since last year, according to a CNN/ORC poll. The question now is whether voters' collective memory of the shutdown has been eclipsed by Obamacare's problems. ""The GOP has to avoid the kinds of disastrous politics that surrounded the recent government shutdown and debt ceiling fights,"" Schiller said. ""They have to appear more rational, reasoned and caring as a national party."" ""Ironically,"" she added, ""the GOP leadership looks more justified (now) in calling for a delay in Obamacare but their tactics were so extreme that voters are still wary of them."" Top GOP congressional leaders are promising there won't be another shutdown, but will they be able to control their rank and file? And if they can't, will that play into Democratic charges that the GOP is now a party under the control of its extreme fringe? 3. The economy . It seems like common sense. If your bank account's hurting, the president's party is hurting. If you're doing well, the president's party does well. Except that this isn't always the case. Real Clear Politics' Sean Trende said it best four years ago: . ""Is the President pursuing an unpopular war and controversial policies at home (Lyndon Johnson in 1966, George W. Bush in 2006)? Then it probably doesn't matter that the economy is blazing ahead. Is the President waging a successful war and getting ready to take out a longtime nemesis (George W. Bush in 2002)? The public is going to be more forgiving of the sluggish growth in real disposable income and rising unemployment. ""The bottom line is that every election becomes something of an explainable, unique event."" That said, some of the worst midterm losses for the president's party -- 1930, 1938, 1946, 1958, 1974, 1982, 2010 -- occurred during or shortly after a downturn. ""A bad recession occurring close to a midterm election isn't a necessary condition for a disastrous midterm election, but it seems to be sufficient,"" Trende notes. There are special factors at play in every election cycle, but all things being equal the Democrats should be in better shape if the economy's in better shape. Republicans should be in better shape if the economy's in worse shape. No. 2 Democrat says GOP could easily lose House . 4. Six-year itch . One of the biggest factors working in the GOP's favor next year could be the simple fact that Americans are ready for a change six years into a Democratic presidency. The president's party almost always loses congressional seats in the sixth year of his term. Almost. The one recent exception to this rule came in 1998, in the midst of an apparent voter backlash against the Clinton impeachment. Could GOP overreach on Obamacare or other issues create the perfect storm for another exception in 2014? 5. Gerrymandering in the House . While all 435 House seats are up in 2014, the reality is that the overwhelming majority of those seats will not be seriously contested. The art of gerrymandering has evolved into a virtual science over the last couple of decades, leading to greater incumbent protection and a much smaller political playing field. CNN has tentatively identified 45 House races to watch in 2014 -- 25 Democratic seats and 20 Republican seats. Given the fact that the Democrats now hold 200 seats (201 assuming they hold Ed Markey's open Massachusetts seat), virtually everything would have to break the Democrats' way for them to recapture the House. 6. Who turns out? Midterm turnout is typically lower, which translates to whiter, older, and more Republican. Core GOP constituencies are more likely to turn out at the midterm polls. Take a look, for example, at the most recent two election cycles. The electorate in 2012 was 72% white, 16% age 65 or older and 53% Protestant. Forty-two percent of voters attended religious services weekly. In 2010, the electorate was 77% white, 21% age 65 or older and 55% Protestant. Forty-eight percent of voters attended religious services weekly. All four of these groups vote solidly Republican. If 2014 turns out to be a ""typical"" midterm in this respect, it will be a critical advantage for the Republicans. 7. Electability versus purity . Republicans have been burned over the last couple of election cycles by primaries that led to the nomination of sub-par general election candidates. In 2010, the GOP blew great opportunities to win Democratic Senate seats in Colorado, Delaware, and Nevada when they nominated three tea party favorites -- Ken Buck, Christine O'Donnell and Sharron Angle -- who subsequently stumbled and proved unacceptable to larger general election electorates. In 2012, the Republicans tossed away a safe GOP seat when six-term moderate Sen. Richard Lugar lost his primary fight to more conservative state Treasurer Richard Mourdock. Democrats pounced on remarks Mourdock made during the general election suggesting that pregnancies resulting from rape are ""something God intended."" The seat was ultimately won by Democratic nominee Joe Donnelly. In Missouri, Republicans lost a golden opportunity to oust vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill last year when GOP nominee Rep. Todd Akin declared that in instances of ""legitimate rape"" a woman's body ""has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."" McCaskill trounced Akin by roughly 15 points. In 2014, GOP primary voters will help decide more Senate and House where conservative tea party candidates have been pitted against Republican establishment types. One of the most notable of these contests is happening in Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is facing off against tea party favorite Matt Bevin. This is not to say that the establishment choice is always the best one for Republicans. It's not. And the grassroots energy provided by tea party activists is critical to GOP chances. But the lesson of recent cycles shouldn't be ignored in 2014. Primaries matter.

"(CNN) -- In many ways, the Middle East makes a strange -- and at times perilous -- hotbed for caricature. Many of the region's leaders have a poor reputation for humor, and often, the list of banned topics makes for a long read. For those that dare to satirize a taboo, the punishments can be harsh: arrest, torture, exile, even death. ""The one thing a tyrant can't stand is to be laughed at,"" says Robert Russell, the executive director of the Cartoonists Rights Network International, a group that monitors the threats facing editorial cartoonists globally. ""If there's rebellion in the streets, they can bring out the tanks, but if everyone is laughing at you, what defense do you have? It undermines the authority of a tyrant to be laughed at."" Despite the dangers that await many Arab cartoonists, some of the region's more contentious countries are actually experiencing a political satire renaissance. According to Jonathan Guyer, a Cairo-based Fullbright Scholar who is translating Egypt's cartoons into English for his blog, Oum Cartoon, the country is experiencing ""a golden age of caricature."" ""On any given day, a newspaper could have ten comics. You'll see dozens of Morsys above the A1 fold being mocked,"" he says, referring to the ousted Egyptian president. ""You just wouldn't see that in American papers."" Video: The artist that sculpted Saddam . Still, he notes, the country's media is more reticent about publishing images critical of the military. ""A couple of artists told me they got warning calls from the military, but more as a kind of gentle, backroom nudge,"" he explains. In other countries, the nudges are less gentle. The assault of Syrian cartoonist Ali Ferzat in 2011 brought international attention to the dangers awaiting those that -- pen and ink in hand -- poke fun at the Arab world's more tyrannical leaders. For much of his career, Ferzat satirized the political and military order in Syria without singling out any individual. In the months leading up to the Syrian revolution, he broke what he called ""the barrier of fear"" and started drawing President Bashar al-Assad. In one daring image, the Syrian ruler was depicted standing on the side of the road, thumbing for a lift from deposed (and, at the time, living) Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Read more: Iran's cartoonists find new lines of expression . Less than a week after the cartoon was published, Ferzat was accosted outside of his office by masked gunmen. ""The president's boot is better than you,"" they told him, before breaking every finger in his hands and leaving him for dead. ""At that moment, I thought that I was going to say good-bye to life. But I also thought I had to accept the outcome of what I'd done. I had to stand behind what I believed in,"" admits Ferzat, who was recently in London for an exhibition of Syrian art organized by the charity Mosaic Syria, who is using proceeds from the sales to fund their relief work. Hands healed, Ferzat continues to draw politically charged cartoons, but now lives outside Syria. If he was ever reticent about caricaturing the atrocities taking place in his home country, he isn't now. ""I was really happy to start drawing again. It was like a second chance. After what happened to me, I had more resolve to tell the whole world. I went to the front line. It's been even more important for me to speak out against the regime,"" he says. Video: Egypt's first comedy factory . Though exile is not an easy life, those cartoonists that haven't managed to escape face a potentially worse fate. Last year, another Syrian artist, Akram Raslan, was arrested and hasn't been heard from since. Russell, who has been lobbying for Raslan's release, fears he may be dead. ""We sent a letter to Syrian ambassador in Washington, D.C, and a few days later heard his trial had been delayed. We thought, 'Oh, how wonderful.' Two weeks later, we heard he'd been killed,"" he says. Recognizing the dangers that many cartoonists face, Iranian Nikahang Kowsar who fled Iran in 2003, is working on an online platform that allows cartoonists to use templates to create their own satires anonymously. ""That way, people can use those characters to question the authorities, without having it traced back to, say, the Syrian or Iranian cyber army,"" he says. ""It's our way of giving a voice to the voiceless.""","Some countries in the Middle East, like Egypt, are experiencing a 'golden age' of caricature.

"New York (CNN) -- Preliminary tests indicate ricin was found in letters sent this past weekend to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, New York deputy police commissioner Paul Browne said Wednesday. Browne said the letters to Bloomberg contained a threat to the mayor and mentioned the debate on gun laws. ""The letter obviously, referred to our anti-gun efforts but there's 12,000 people (who) are going to get killed this year with guns and 19,000 that are going to commit suicide with guns, and we're not going to walk away from those efforts,"" Bloomberg said. One letter addressed to the mayor's office was opened at the city government's mail facility, Browne said. The suspicious material found in the two letters was a ""pink-orange oily substance,"" he said, adding that it was the second of two tests that showed what appeared to be trace amounts of ricin. What is ricin? The substance is being tested at the National Bioforensic Analysis Center in Maryland, with conclusive results expected by Friday. Some of the emergency services workers who touched the letter Friday were examined after they showed minor intestinal symptoms of ricin exposure on Saturday, Browne said. The symptoms have since subsided. Civilian workers showed no symptoms, Browne said in a statement. ""We take a lot of security measures as you know,"" Bloomberg said. ""The men and women that open the mail for example ... they are well trained."" The second letter to the mayor was opened by Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns -- founded and co-chaired by Bloomberg -- in Washington on Sunday. Browne's statement appeared to indicate Glaze showed no symptoms. A spokeswoman for the organization declined to comment Wednesday. Opinion: Ricin - almost never deadly . Both letters were postmarked in Shreveport, Louisiana, on May 20, the American Postal Workers Union said on its website. Bloomberg is an outspoken critic of current gun laws. In March, he said nationwide background checks on all gun sales would save lives. ""We know that's true, because in states that already require background checks on private sales, the rate of women murdered by an intimate partner armed with a gun is 38% lower than in states that don't have such background checks,"" he said. FBI spokesman Jim Margolin told CNN the agency is working to determine from where the letters were sent and who sent them. If inhaled, injected or ingested, less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours because of the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems. There is no known antidote for the toxin, which is derived from castor beans. It has been included in letters in the past few months sent to President Barack Obama and other officials. In April, letters were sent to Obama; Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi; and Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi. James Everett Dutschke of Tupelo, Mississippi, has been charged with possession and use of a biological agent in connection with the case. Last week, FBI agents arrested Matthew Ryan Buquet after a grand jury charged him with mailing threatening communication to a senior judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington state. The FBI said in a statement that tests -- conducted by that agency and the Spokane Regional Health District -- showed that a suspicious substance found with the letter was ""active ricin toxin."" There are no indications the cases are connected. Man, 37, arrested in probe of Washington state ricin-laced letters .

"Editor's note: Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey are actors and parents actively involved in autism-related causes. McCarthy is the author of the book ""Louder Than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism."" Actress Jenny McCarthy believes that vaccines could have contributed to her son's autism. (CNN) -- In light of the recent Hannah Poling decision, in which the federal court conceded that vaccines could have contributed to her autism, we think the tide is finally turning in the direction of parents like us who have been shouting concerns from our rooftops for years. Autism is a debilitating disorder, which according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is suffered by 1 in 150 kids, making it more common than childhood cancer, diabetes and AIDS combined. Recently, England and Ireland reported that autism is affecting one in 58 individuals. Is it any wonder that autism has become many new parents' No. 1 fear? We've met some of the most amazing moms and dads who are forging their own path to prevention and recovery. When our son, Evan, was diagnosed with autism we were lucky enough to benefit from their knowledge and experience. Evan has been healed to a great extent by many breakthroughs that, while perhaps not scientifically proven, have definitely helped Evan and many other children who are recovering from autism.  Parents vs. scientists: Watch the latest test case » . There are some who wonder what we mean when we say ""recovering"" from autism. They confuse the word recover with cure. While you may not be able to cure an injury caused in a terrible car accident, you can recover; you can regain many skills that you once lost. In the case of autism, we think there are treatments that often bring about such healing, so that the observable symptoms of the condition no longer exist. Even though we may no longer see any symptoms of autism, we can't say a child is ""cured"" because we do not know what they would have been like had they never been injured. We believe what helped Evan recover was starting a gluten-free, casein-free diet, vitamin supplementation, detox of metals, and anti-fungals for yeast overgrowth that plagued his intestines. Once Evan's neurological function was recovered through these medical treatments, speech therapy and applied behavior analysis helped him quickly learn the skills he could not learn while he was frozen in autism. After we implemented these therapies for one year, the state re-evaluated Evan for further services. They spent five minutes with Evan and said, ""What happened? We've never seen a recovery like this.""  Watch Jenny McCarthy talk about her son's autism » . Evan is now 5 years old and what might surprise a lot of you is that we've never been contacted by a single member of the CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics, or any other health authority to evaluate and understand how Evan recovered from autism. When Evan meets doctors and neurologists, to this day they tell us he was misdiagnosed -- that he never had autism to begin with. It's as if they are wired to believe that children can't recover from autism.  Watch CDC chief on vaccines, autism » . So where's the cavalry? Where are all the doctors beating down our door to take a closer look at Evan? We think we know why they haven't arrived. Most of the parents we've met who have recovered their child from autism as we did (and we have met many) blame vaccines for their child's autism. We think our health authorities don't want to open this can of worms, so they don't even look or listen. While there is strong debate on this topic, many parents of recovered children will tell you they didn't treat their child for autism; they treated them for vaccine injury. Read about latest fight over vaccines and autism . Many people aren't aware that in the 1980s our children received only 10 vaccines by age 5, whereas today they are given 36 immunizations, most of them by age 2. With billions of pharmaceutical dollars, could it be possible that the vaccine program is becoming more of a profit engine then a means of prevention? We believe autism is an environmental illness. Vaccines are not the only environmental trigger, but we do think they play a major role. If we are going to solve this problem and finally start to reverse the rate of autism, we need to consider changing the vaccine schedule, reducing the number of shots given and removing certain ingredients that could be toxic to some children. We take into account that some children have reactions to medicines like penicillin, for example, yet when it comes to vaccines we are operating as if our kids have a universal tolerance for them. We are acting like ONE SIZE FITS ALL. That is, at the very least, a huge improbability. Even if the CDC is not convinced of a link between vaccines and autism, changing the vaccine schedule should be seriously considered as a precautionary measure. (If you would like to see some ideas for alternative schedules, check out http://generationrescue.org.) We wish to state, very clearly, that we are not against all vaccines, but we do believe there is strong evidence to suggest that some of the ingredients may be hazardous and that our children are being given too many, too soon!

"(CNN) -- To resolve America's ongoing, bruising battle over the debt and deficit, House Republican Paul Ryan and Senate Democrat Patty Murray announced a deal on December 10 to halt spending cuts -- mostly in defense -- and lock in a two-year budget agreement to avoid another government shutdown on January 15. But in eagerly seeking agreement with the Republicans who shut the government down in October, Democrats risk hurting the economy's fragile recovery by accepting too much budget austerity embedded in the newly adopted budget. President Obama and the Democrats won big over the Republicans in October's budget fight. Instead of pressing their advantage, Democrats took tax increases for the rich off the table, agreed to cut federal pensions and did not get unemployment benefits extended. The Democrats basically threw away their political gains. The deal repeals less than half of the sequestration cuts planned for 2014. If Obama and Congress continue their shortsighted obsession with austerity and budget cuts, they ignore the big economic lesson from the past several years: Austerity hurts prosperity. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that repealing the entire 2013-2014 spending cuts would increase Gross Domestic Product by $113 billion and create 900,000 additional jobs next year. The October 2013 government shutdown took another $24 billion out of the GDP. Unemployment remains stuck around 7%. Though the deal reduces a bit of fiscal uncertainty, it hardly affected the U.S. growth forecasts for big banks, despite bank economists citing some pessimism because of ""austerity shock"" from spending cuts and ""uncertainty shock"" from Washington's continued fiscal battles. Republicans bargain for more cuts and fewer taxes, but cutting military spending makes them nervous, so they attack Social Security and Medicare. The Wall Street-affiliated Democratic group Third Way is helping. It launched an attack on Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, and others who rightly refuse to cut Social Security as part of a long-term budget solution. We all know that Republicans like to defend the wealthy and slash government. But why does austerity, especially cuts to old-age programs, have credibility with Obama and other Democrats? Advocates of ""grand bargains,"" cutting programs to balance the budget, wrongly presume the budget is a fixed quantity. They imagine it like a fixed pie. Programs for the young, like education, must be paid for by cutting other programs, like Social Security. But their belief that a dollar taken from the old will be spent on the young is not only divisive, mean and fierce -- it is wrong. In his December 6 speech on inequality, Obama talked about the sky-high and stubborn child poverty rate: more than 24%. But cutting Social Security and Medicare will only destabilize the economy and increase the elderly poverty rate. In many countries, programs for elderly people are not traded off against help for the young. When support for old-age programs increases, so does spending on children. Advanced democratic countries' spending on the elderly is positively correlated with education spending. One analysis shows that a 10% increase in spending on education is correlated with a 7.3% increase in spending on pensions. The Congressional Budget Office warns that long-term deficits can hurt the economy. Want to reduce the debt and deficit? Tax the wealthy, which won't hurt the economy. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty estimate that raising the tax rate for the top 1% as high as 80% would generate far more revenue. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, propose a transactions tax -- a three-penny charge on every $100 traded in the stock market, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates would raise $352 billion over 10 years. This small tax would also reduce stock churning by speculators, creating a nice secondary benefit. Want to find even more savings? Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, wisely put tax loopholes that cost the Treasury almost a trillion dollars per year on the table. For example, Reid called for eliminating the small, but noxious, tax break for buying yachts and the $17 billion break that comes from taxing private equity, real estate and hedge fund profits as ""carried interest"" rather than at the ordinary income rate of 39.6% instead of the capital gains rate of 20%. There is one piece of good news: The deficit is coming down, from 9.2% when Obama took office to 4.1% of GDP in 2017. Faster economic growth would shrink the deficit more rapidly. In contrast, further spending cuts will slow the economy and deficit reduction along with it. So, this is no time for Obama to accept a lower budget path, or to consider cuts in Social Security and Medicare. The small budget deficit reductions in this deal -- less than one-half of 1% of the total debt or $23 billion -- would almost pay for extended unemployment benefits for one year at $25 billion. Democrats are flinching under continued pressure from Republicans playing out their long game as they ready for another bitter fight when the debt limit is reached next spring. But the President and the Democrats have a winning economic and political strategy: Raise revenues and keep Social Security and Medicare strong. Don't throw October's hard-won victory away; it won't help the elderly, it won't help children, and it won't help the economy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rick McGahey and Teresa Ghilarducci.","Democrats and Republicans reach a deal on the budget .

"Maryville, Missouri (CNN) -- A Missouri prosecutor who dropped charges in a controversial rape case will ask a court to appoint a special prosecutor to review the facts and look at possibly refiling charges. Nodaway County Prosecuting Attorney Robert L. Rice said Wednesday that he was making the request after CNN aired interviews this week with the alleged victim, Daisy Coleman, who says she was raped when she was 14, and her mother. At a news conference, Rice also cited a recent article in The Kansas City Star that questioned the integrity of the investigation. ""The public trust in our criminal justice system must be upheld at all times,"" he said. The case dates to January 8, 2012. But after The Kansas City Star featured the story over the weekend, it gained traction on social media and spread to a wider audience. Rice spoke one day after Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder made a public appeal for a grand jury investigation into the case. Why Anonymous wants justice in the Missouri rape case . The prosecuting attorney said that witnesses in the case invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to cooperate. Rice added that he couldn't provide reporters with court documents showing the witnesses' refusal to cooperate because those records are closed. He said he was upset that his decision was called into question in media accounts. ""My name was dragged through the mud in that article, and I don't appreciate that,"" Rice said. Referring specifically to The Kansas City Star story, he added: ""The way the article was written inflamed passions."" City of Maryville officials held a separate news conference after Rice's event and asserted that they had nothing to do with the county prosecutor's earlier decision to drop charges. The city, however, has been targeted with cyberthreats in the wake of publicity about the case, and public safety patrols have since been increased, City Manager Greg McDanel told reporters. ""We've been stunned by the nature of cyberthreats"" against the city in general, he said. ""In recent weeks, the city has received a great deal of negative attention. ""It's detrimental to the lives and livelihood of the residents of Maryville,"" McDanel added. There's been a public ""misconception"" that the city was involved in the investigation, he said. ""The city of Maryville was not involved ... in any way."" 'Insufficient evidence' Rice has said he dropped a sexual assault charge against the boy because the alleged victim and her relatives refused to cooperate. A charge against the boy's friend who was accused of recording part of the incident on an iPhone was also discontinued. The iPhone video was deleted the night of the alleged assault and wasn't retrievable, Rice said Wednesday. The alleged victim told CNN that she believes the charges were dropped against Matthew Barnett, then 17, because his grandfather is a former state legislator. That relative, Rex Barnett, told CNN Wednesday he had ""absolutely"" no role in the prosecutor's decision. CNN does not typically identify alleged victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because Daisy and her mother, Melinda Coleman, have chosen to go public. Both mother and daughter have denied refusing to cooperate with prosecutors. Rex Barnett, a former Republican state representative who is a retired 32-year veteran officer of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, said he made a deliberate decision to avoid local police and prosecutors during the investigation because of his political standing. ""As long as I've been in politics and law enforcement, I knew that if this thing drug on long, I would be pulled into it somewhere, I think, just for political reasons,"" Barnett told CNN. ""So I made it a point not to talk to the prosecuting attorney, to the sheriff, to any of the witnesses directly or indirectly, and I stuck to that. And I'm glad I did."" He said the case was dropped ""because of a lack of testimony from the complainants. And without that, the prosecuting attorney has no case."" The ongoing controversy has been hard on his family, he said. ""It's been tough,"" he said. ""I mean, we thought it was over a year and a half ago, and to my knowledge, there has been no change, nothing more evidentiary has come up that I know of. ""But (the case has) resurfaced, and I'm not sure why,"" he added. Barnett, also a deacon in the First Baptist Church, was first elected to the Missouri General Assembly in 1994. He served four terms until 2002, The Kansas City Star said. In a recent statement, Rice said that ""there was insufficient evidence to prove a criminal charge beyond a reasonable doubt. ""The State's witnesses refused to cooperate and invoked their Fifth Amendment privilege to not testify,"" he added. Nodaway County Sheriff Darren White told CNN that his office and the prosecuting attorney had been ready to prosecute but did not move forward because the victim and her family refused to cooperate. ""The only people's stories that have been inconsistent throughout this whole thing are the Colemans' -- are the victims in this case -- and I don't know why that is,"" White said. Protest planned . Reacting to the lieutenant governor's call for a grand jury review, the sheriff said that his office handled the case ""flawlessly."" In an interview with CNN, White described the elder Barnett as someone he had known for more than 30 years. ""He's a man that I do consider to be a friend,"" the sheriff said. But he described as ""absolutely shameful"" any suggestion that Barnett would have tried to influence the investigation into his grandson. Melinda Coleman said White had initially told her that other girls had come forward to accuse the same group of boys of similar conduct but changed his story. ""He said that they were all liars. I digitally recorded him saying they were all liars and that they just wanted to crucify those poor, innocent boys. ""So my concern is what is it going to take for them to do something here? Is one of these girls going to have to die?"" the mother said. In the weeks that followed her daughter's alleged assault, Coleman said her children received threats. She was also fired from her job as a veterinarian at a clinic. Daughter Daisy is now 16. The Colemans have since moved from the 12,000-resident town in northwest Missouri, about 100 miles north of Kansas City. In April, their house in Maryville -- which had been vacant and for sale -- burned. The state fire marshal said that ""due to the unsafe nature of the structure, a detailed examination could not be conducted and this fire loss is being listed as undetermined."" A Facebook page campaign called ""Justice for Daisy"" says a public rally is scheduled for Tuesday at the Nodaway County Courthouse. Protesters will carry daisies in their hands. ""We will increase patrols and do everything in our power to protect our citizens,"" McDanel said of the protest. ""We will remain on high alert."" CNN's Michael Martinez wrote this story from Los Angeles. CNN's Ana Cabrera and Sara Weisfeldt contributed from Missouri.","Cyberthreats prompt police patrols but city says it had no role in dropped case .

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- The center of Newtown couldn't be more decked out for the holidays. It seems like there are ribbons and wreaths for every lamppost and door. Lights sparkle from trees, and a big wood sign calls residents to the local firehouse to pick up even more holiday sprigs. That same firehouse is where parents ran in panic after receiving robocalls and texts about a shooting Friday at Sandy Hook Elementary School up the street. Now, the high spirits of the holidays have been darkened. Signs in storefronts have stopped declaring holiday cheer and are calling instead for prayer and mourning. The firehouse is ringed by first responders greeting members of the community coming to drop flowers and notes. A sign pointing to the entrance of the local grade school now marks the scene of a massacre of young children. A day that started like any other . Since the shooting, tears fall easily in this town, especially after police released the sober list of names of the dead. It was striking as much for the birth dates as for the length. The column ""DOB"" listed 20 born in the years 2005 and 2006. Then six names of female educators young and middle-aged. The 7th birthday of a little girl named Josephine Gay happened last week. Another named Charlotte Bacon would have turned 7 in February. Remembering the victims . ""I don't think there are words,"" said a woman as she broke down in tears when she came to leave flowers for the dead. Her daughter also went to the elementary school. She had listened to the robocall about the shooter, feeling anything but calm. Like a lot of mothers in the area, she had been swept by panic wondering which school had an unfolding crime and whether her child might be among those injured or killed. Another woman, Miriam Espinoza, fell to the grass and wept when she saw the flowers around the elementary school sign post. She clutched her third-grader, recounting her later relief as she discovered her child was not among the victims. ""But those other mamas,"" she said in Spanish, ""how did they go forward?"" It was as if an entire town suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. No one was left unmarked since those harrowing minutes Friday of sorting out who had and had not survived, and the many hours since of figuring out how close danger had touched their lives. Was their child OK? What about their neighbor's child or the teacher who once taught their teen? Laura Phelps and husband Nick have a first and third-grader at the school. They rushed to Sandy Hook Elementary to see if their children were among the injured or dead. ""When we got our children and I saw my son's teacher, they were like ghosts, but they were incredibly composed; they were calm; they had their sheets with them checking off, making sure each child went with their parent,"" she said. ""They did everything possible to keep our kids safe, and I wish I had known when I looked at their faces just to say thank you because I have my children."" Teacher: 'I wanted to be the last thing they heard, not the gunfire' As mourners placed flowers for the dead, their friends could barely put together words. Alexander Galinsky walked with his head dipped as he thought of a friend who lost a son. ""Last night we felt something unusual because they didn't respond on the phone calls, messages,"" he said of his friend. ""Last night they basically called us and (there were) just a few words. (Their son is) not with us anymore."" This family had come from England two years ago but quickly fit into a tightly knit community. Galinsky said he began considering them close friends almost overnight. ""We cannot comprehend with our minds and our hearts,"" he said. Some parents' voices still rattled as they uttered that awful word ""lockdown,"" something children practice with their teachers. It is a modern addition to a fall season of fire drills and other safety lessons for the littlest of schoolchildren. But the word shocked adults when it took on real-life meaning. Library clerk Mary Ann Jacob fell into the arms of her husband as she recounted hearing crackling over the school's public address system. ""I thought they'd left it on so I just called the office to tell them we could hear them,"" she said. A member of the office staff told her about the shooter so she and some other staff hustled the kids into a storage closet. ""We practice these lockdowns; we have to have several by a certain date,"" she said. She handed out pieces of paper and crayons to the cluster of 6-year-olds to keep them quiet. Latest developments . Jacob said the door was kept locked while the principal and other staff were in the halls fighting off an attack. They were so scared of what was unfolding that they didn't even open the door for police when they finally came knocking. ""I made him show his badge,"" she said. The town's initial trauma has turned to mourning as churches opened their doors for counseling and services, and a vigil for one teacher drew hundreds. On Sunday, there were even more services as well as a planned visit by President Barack Obama, all as the investigation unfolds into how a day that began with promises of some first-graders building gingerbread houses after school had ended this way. One woman who came with flowers said she was there because she didn't know what else to do. Her friend could only offer this response: ""I think it's coming to these memorials, I think it's being close from one family to another. And just being there. You know just hugs; I don't think there are any words."" How you can help .","Signs of holiday cheer replaced with calls for prayer and mourning .

If the game was not difficult enough already, it has a well-deserved reputation of being the most litigious of all sports, bar none. The cases that come to court cover the full spectrum of grievances and bizarre incidents, from the elderly Irish pensioner suing his former golf club for cutting -- yes cutting -- his handicap, to two-time major winner Rory McIlroy going legal in a high-stakes wrangle over his multimillion-dollar deal with Nike. From players tripping over rabbit holes, to a pair of New York doctors involved in a landmark legal action after one of them was blinded by the other's errant shot. It all backs up the main thrust of a publication from 2007 by Craig Brown, a law professor at the University of Western Ontario in Canada. ""Golf and the law seem to have been made for each other,"" he wrote in ""Why Lawyers Love Golf."" ""On every fairway, in every stretch of rough, in every clubhouse, in every golf bag, at every swing at the ball, in every set of plans for a new course, in every application for club membership, there lurks a potential lawsuit."" Dalton Floyd Jr. of South Carolina's Floyd Law Firm has made a 40-year-plus career of handling such cases. He gives an example where neither the claimant nor the appellant were left with a good leg to stand on: . ""A lady and her husband were walking from the tee to her golf cart. In a freak accident she stood on a piece of unmade ground and contrived to rupture her Achilles tendon,"" he told CNN. ""Both her and husband were keen line dancers, couldn't take part in the activity for months and brought a claim on that basis. The club had to settle."" Golfing mousetraps . It highlighted the fact that golf clubs have to think very carefully about every area of their activity because there are mousetraps everywhere, in the legal sense. Most golf holes have yardage markers dotted on the fairway to let golfers know how far they are from the green, the most common at 150 yards out. But they had better make sure they are accurate. ""A golfer hit the ball onto a green and hit a player who was waiting to putt,"" recalls Floyd. ""The golfer hitting the shot claimed the yardage markers put out by the course were inaccurate and he thought the green was further away and out of his reach. ""The club had to settle the claim because they were liable."" And beware the hasty and ill-thought-out redesign of a golf course, says Floyd. ""A club in Hilton Head cut down trees on the left of a dogleg hole, which meant a lot of balls ended up in a big condominium. The owners were not happy and the club was held liable and had to settle."" Serious injury . While it is easy to poke fun at some of the claims, others are for serious injury sustained in the course of playing the sport. As CNN reported in 2010, being hit by a poor shot while playing is a risk golfers assume and this was backed up by New York's highest court in a key ruling. Playing at a course in Long Island, Anoop Kapoor hit a shot which struck his fellow doctor Azad Anand in the left eye. Anand was blinded after the incident and launched a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Kapoor for damages, alleging his friend was negligent for failing to warn of the shot. Kapoor testified he thought Anand was behind him and that he didn't see anyone between him and the hole when he took his shot. Kapoor unintentionally sliced it, striking Anand with terrible consequences. Floyd says most claims of this nature are dismissed: ""Thank goodness the courts have an understanding that you can't hit the ball straight all the time, particularly the amateur golfer. ""I think generally we get good decisions from judges because they understand golf is a sport and there is a certain amount of risk when you play."" But that did not stop 15-year-old Alex Good of Hillsboro, Oregon from suing a local golf course for negligence after he hit himself in the eye with his own ball while on its driving range. According to court documents, Good and his high school teammates were using the practice range. It was raining and the staff at Pumpkin Ridge put up an awning. When Good teed off, his ball hit a metal post that was holding up the awning just inches in front of his driving mat. The ball ricocheted off and hit him in the left eye. Good's lawyer claimed Pumpkin Ridge should have known that the metal pole was a danger. Pumpkin Ridge did not respond to CNN's enquiries about the current status of the suit. Costly repair . During the economic downturn, even well-to-do golfers have felt the pinch, says Floyd, but he warns against what one did to save a few dollars: repairing your own clubs. He cites the case of a player who took his tee shot -- then the head of the repaired club flew off and got stuck in his playing partner's knee. Painful for the claimant -- and costly for the do-it-yourself golfer, who was forced to settle the claim. It's not a position in which former world No. 1 McIlroy should ever find himself, but he is embroiled in a very public legal dispute with his former management agency over its role in his contracts with Nike and other key sponsors. The 24-year-old from Northern Ireland claims he was misled over the terms of the deals and is seeking compensation. The agent, Conor Ridge, and the management company Horizon Sports deny the claim and are counter suing in a case which is slated for the courts in October 2014. McIlroy, whose form has slumped since signing the big-money deals, admitted that it had taken a toll. ""I've seen more lawyers' offices and more lawyers this year than I care to see in my entire life,"" he told reporters at the World Tour Championship in Dubai last month. Angry Tiger . He also said he was taking advice from Nike stablemate Tiger Woods on how to deal with these pressures, although the world No. 1 himself is at the center of a controversy which threatens to end in a lawsuit. In a published article grading the tour performance of top players, former PGA pro and now analyst Brandel Chamblee flunked Woods, questioning his integrity and saying that he had been ""a little cavalier with the rules."" As evidence, he cited three instances where Woods had been penalized for rules infractions and a fourth where an NBC analyst questioned the drop that Woods made after his ball landed in a water hazard. Woods' agent Mark Steinberg responded angrily over a ""shameful, baseless"" report and said he was considering a legal action for damages. McIlroy will doubtless take his own counsel but might look no further than the fate that befell a 75-year-old amateur golfer from across the border in the Republic of Ireland. Handicap blues . Thomas Talbot, a retired insurance official, was left with a massive legal bill in excess of $500,000 after launching an action against his former club because it had cut his handicap. This would normally be a cause for celebration, but Talbot took it as a slight, particularly as a court in Dublin heard he was accused of ""handicap building"" -- or allegedly playing below his ability to get his handicap raised and thereby be able to win more competitions. Talbot sued the Hermitage Golf Club and its former handicap secretary in the Irish High Court for defamation, but a judge found against him last year and he has been left with heavy costs. Golf for a long time was a male-dominated sport but as more women started taking part, clubs which restricted membership came under the legal spotlight for alleged discriminatory practices. Federal law in the United States now requires clubs open to the public to admit women, but Augusta National, home of the U.S. Masters tournament, was a private club and adopted a strict male-only membership policy for 80 years. That suddenly changed in August 2012, when it announced it would admit its first two female members, former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and business leader Darla Moore. The volte face came without ever reaching a court of law, but rather thanks to the tireless efforts of women's rights activist Martha Burk and reported pressure from key sponsors. Discrimination suits also extended to the top level of men's professional golf when Casey Martin, a former Stanford University teammate of Woods, took out a case against the PGA Tour. Martin suffers from a debilitating leg deformity that obstructs blood flow back to his heart. Having qualified for the full PGA Tour in 2000, Martin wanted to use a golf cart in tournaments, but was refused permission by tour officials. Martin took a lawsuit on grounds of disability discrimination and finally won his battle in the Supreme Court. But he was unable to capitalize on his early promise and dropped off the tour, although he was a surprise qualifier for the 2012 U.S. Open. Trump challenge . No article about lawsuits in golf would be complete without mention of U.S. tycoon Donald Trump and his battles to complete a $1 billion development in northern Scotland. He faced down opposition from locals and environmental groups, including a lawsuit from an 86-year-old pensioner, to get permission to build his championship course on protected sand dunes in Aberdeenshire. But having built the course, now Trump himself has gone legal after the Scottish government gave planning permission to a massive offshore wind farm just off the coast -- and within sight of his new resort. Trump has called the 11 turbine scheme a ""useless and grotesque blot on our heritage"" and has launched a lawsuit to attempt to stop it. The Scottish government, led by First Minister Alex Salmond, wants all the country's electricity demands to be met from renewable sources by 2020 and is vigorously defending its decision in the court case, which started November 12 in Edinburgh.","Golf has a reputation for being one of the most litigious sports .

"London (CNN) -- Their crime was one of shocking brutality. Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale first ran down soldier Lee Rigby in a car, then hacked him to death in a frenzied machete and knife attack. Confronted with gory closed-circuit TV footage, grueling witness testimony and Adebolajo's own defense that he had ""no choice"" in Rigby's killing, as he was ""a soldier of Allah,"" the jury took only 90 minutes to convict both defendants of his murder. They were cleared of the attempted murder of a police officer. But what led Adebolajo, 29, and Adebowale, 22, both born and raised in Britain by families of Christian Nigerian origin, to kill on London's streets in the name of Islam? There seems to be no simple answer to that question. Adebolajo was the only one to give evidence in court. He denied the charges of murder and attempted murder of a police officer, on the grounds that he had acted from religious conviction. He converted to Islam in 2002 to 2003, while at a university, and adopted an Islamic name, Mujahid Abu Hamza. ""I am a soldier of Allah,"" he told the jury. ""It is a war between Islam and those militaries that intervene in Muslim lands."" Adebowale, who did not take the stand, converted to Islam more recently, in 2008 to 2009. A closer look at their backgrounds reveals that both were already known to police and that both showed earlier signs of radicalization. In a news briefing, Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick said police had had contact with the two men, as both victims and offenders, over a number of years -- in Adebowale's case for drug offenses, and in Adebolajo's case for a handful of incidents involving violent crime. Both were at a demonstration in 2006 outside the Old Bailey in London. Adebolajo was subsequently convicted on two counts of assaulting a police officer and spent 51 days in prison, but Adebowale was not arrested. Adebolajo still pleads innocence in that case, denying he punched a female officer in the face and a male officer in the groin. Both men also participated in a protest in 2012. On the witness stand, Adebolajo said he attended demonstrations but was not specific, describing them as a way ""to let off steam."" Extremism trigger 'difficult to pinpoint' He said he had listened to speeches by Anjem Choudary, a controversial British Muslim cleric, but did not agree with him. ""I think he is a good man, however he encourages his followers that jihad in this country is not allowed at this moment,"" he said. Adebolajo said that he had tried to travel to Somalia in 2010 because he wanted to live under Sharia law but that he was stopped by Kenyan authorities and returned to the UK. After that, he reportedly had frequent contact with MI5, the UK domestic security agency. Despite these incidents, what might have pushed them over the edge into violent extremism is ""very difficult to pinpoint,"" Dick said. While Adebolajo ""talks about grievances in foreign policy,"" Dick said, authorities don't know where he got his radical views. Little extremist material was presented to the court as evidence, although materials on ""martyrdom"" were found in Adebowale's home in Greenwich, southeast London. Dick, who watched tapes of police interviews with Adebowale, described a ""troubled young man"" who ""was very changeable, emotional and many times very aggressive. He did spit at officers and several times this required restraint."" There were some indications that Adebowale was associated with a street gang in 2008, she said. Adebolajo: 'I was disgusted' Asked in court what he thought of al Qaeda, Adebolajo said: ""I love them and I consider them my brothers in Islam."" Adebolajo also told jurors he was against British foreign policy but did not believe his Islamic views led him onto the path he had taken. ""Even before I became Muslim, I did not agree with foreign policy,"" he said, then describing an early memory of watching the Iraq war on television. ""'Operation Shock and Awe' -- I saw it unfold on BBC and CNN what not, and I was disgusted, you know. It was reported as if it was praiseworthy,"" he said. ""I knew that every one of those bombs was killing someone. I was disgusted."" Adebolajo, who is married with six children, said in his police interview, shown in court, that he didn't like blood. He maintained that he posed no threat to civilians, only to the British military because of its actions overseas. He tried to cut Rigby's head off because it was the proper method under Allah, he said. ""It brings me little joy to approach anybody and slay them. Can you believe me? I am not a man who gains enjoyment from watching horror films,"" he said. His defense lawyer, David Gottlieb, sought to define Adebolajo in his closing argument as a man who was ""motivated by a noble idea"" rather than being a psychopathic murderer. His client was intelligent and totally sincere in his beliefs, and had shown ""absolute honesty and moral conviction,"" Gottlieb said. ""He did what he did because it was divinely ordained,"" he said, adding that he considered Adebolajo should have been charged with treason or terrorism rather than murder. The defense lawyer for Adebowale, Abbas Lakha, echoed the argument that the men intended to kill a British soldier because they were soldiers of Allah, and that this was not the same as intent to murder. The testimony heard in court suggested neither man expected to live after the attack. Both defendants intended to make police feel threatened because they wanted to be shot, Lakha said. He said a note that Adebolajo handed to a bystander at the time of the attack was a joint missive, and it could be regarded as a suicide note, since part of it read ""If I live beyond this day. ..."" Paramedics who treated Adebolajo after he was shot in the arm by police said that he told them: ""Your government is all wrong. I did it for my God. I wish the bullets had killed me so I can join my friends and family. ""This arm belongs to Allah, and you can do what you want with it."" Police: 'It's a complicated story' Critics may ask why these two men, given that they were known to the police, were not monitored more closely -- and so perhaps prevented from committing Rigby's murder. Many in Britain will also want to know whether Adebolajo and Adebowale were operating alone, and whether a continued threat exists. With those questions in mind, the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee is reviewing what was known about them before the attack. The two men attended mosques across the capital but, Dick said, police ""are not aware of anyone else being aware of what was going to take place. We are not aware of anyone else engaged in the planning of this attack."" She said the two men ""were in different parts of London, with different people, exposed to a variety of extremists."" She suggested those hoping for all the answers are likely to be disappointed. ""We may never know the full picture,"" she said. ""I don't mean to trivialize this, but becoming radicalized is not like becoming pregnant. Having contact with extremists is a theme. But it's a complicated story."" Asked about the risk of other ""lone wolf"" attacks, Dick said the Metropolitan Police ""have a very good record at stopping attacks,"" citing other terror trials held this year. ""But, sadly,"" she said, ""our ability to reduce the risk to zero is not there."" CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","Police briefing reveals Adebolajo and Adebowale were previously known to police .

"(CNN) -- Here's a brief history lesson for you. Three years ago, Google was where you turned to look up a recipe. To check your e-mail. To chat with your friends when you were supposed to be working. But in the tech equivalent of a blink of the eye, things today are much different. Throughout the last year, Google has released a string of incredible hardware products, not just a bunch of virtual services you use through another company's device. Google really kicked it into gear in July 2012 with the Nexus 7, its first-ever tablet, that was priced at just $199. Reviewers went nuts. It wasn't just a great tablet because it was so cheap, it was simply a great tablet. Even the iPad mini, which came out a few months later and sold for $130 more, wasn't as good. Then came another string of winners: The Nexus 4 smartphone, which you can buy unlocked and without a contract for just $299. The Chromebook Pixel, a beautiful laptop with a stunning high-resolution touchscreen. And more recently, the Chromecast, a dongle that plugs directly into your TV and lets you beam video from your Android device, iPhone or iPad. There's also the Moto X, a new smartphone from Google-owned Motorola that's one of the most accessible and easy to use Android phones I've ever tested. And don't forget Google Glass, the promising, Internet-connected eyewear that should hit the market next year. As Apple keeps its head down and works on iterative (but great) updates to its iPhone and iPad line, and as Microsoft struggles to find a way to make Windows 8 devices like its Surface tablet resonate with the public, Google is releasing some of the most interesting and innovative hardware we've seen recently. As a high-level executive at a very large tech company recently told me, no company can hope to be successful these days unless it can offer an ecosystem of software, services, and great devices to run them all on. Yes, that's the Apple model, but it's a model that's been proven to be a hit with consumers in the new mobile computing era. And Google, a company that most people still associate with Gmail and Web searches, has been crushing it in both respects. It's always done well with the data, apps, and services part of things, but stringing all that together with affordable, high-quality hardware is a new and exciting trend for the company. In some ways, Google has done a better job at this than Apple. For example, unlike the Apple TV, which requires you to have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to beam video, the new Chromecast will work with any major laptop, smartphone, or tablet no matter who makes it. And it does it all for a very reasonable $35, or $64 less than Apple's product. There's massive potential here for Google to build TV-watching ecosystem built around the device. Apple may make great hardware, but it's biggest challenge is still making reliable software and services. (Remember the Apple Maps debacle from last year?) Meanwhile, Google is already a pro at such services, and it's packaging them along with great devices that are affordable and appeal to average users, not just the tech elite. To endure in the cutthroat tech world, a company can't just rely on doing one thing well. It has to push forward, experiment, and get messy. In the last year, Google has proved it can do all that -- and make some quality gadgets at the same time. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Kovach.

"(CNN) -- Doctors taking the modern Hippocratic oath swear to ""abstain from whatever is harmful or mischievous,"" but the investigation into plots to bomb targets in Britain suggests a group of medics may have ignored that vow. Dr. Mohammed Asha is suspected of being involved in the weekend's alleged terror plot in Britain. None has been charged -- only detained, questioned or sought -- but British and Australian media are reporting it is no coincidence that all of those detained or questioned so far in the probe share the same profession. ""Investigators believe a network of up to a dozen medics from the Middle East were sent to infiltrate [Britain's National] Health Service as a cover for terrorist operations,"" reported The Daily Telegraph in Australia, where two doctors were being questioned about the plot. Meanwhile, British tabloids have splashed the face of Jordanian physician Mohammed Asha across their Web sites, along with headlines such as ""Doctor Evil"" and ""Doctor, father, husband ... bomb suspect.""  Watch how the probe led police to Australia » . Reports that those being questioned or detained by authorities are in the medical profession -- and even employees of the National Health Service -- prompted Britain's Daily Mirror tabloid to publish the headline ""Docs of War."" Asha, 26, and his 27-year-old wife, reported to be a laboratory technician, were arrested Saturday in what police called a dramatic highway raid in northern England, hours after two men drove a Jeep Cherokee full of explosives and gas canisters into Scotland's Glasgow Airport. Asha's neighbors in Newcastle-under-Lyme in North Staffordshire said another doctor of South Asian descent was part of the probe. Forensic teams were searching that unnamed doctor's home, about two miles from Asha's house, but it is unclear if this physician or his wife is in police custody.  Police search for evidence » . Police have identified one of the men suspected in the Glasgow attack as a 27-year-old Iraqi doctor, Bilal Abdulla, who worked at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Glasgow. The other man in the car is in critical condition with severe burns at Royal Alexandra. British media have identified him as Dr. Khalid Ahmed. Police reportedly were tracking both men since Friday, when they were linked to two car bombs parked in central London. Two other suspects, described only as 25- and 28-year-old men, were detained Monday at Royal Alexandra after police searched doctors' quarters there. Police have not indicated whether the men are doctors, but sources close to the investigation said they were Saudi medical students. In Australia, police were questioning two doctors Monday, one of whom, Mohammed Haneef, 27, was an Indian national working at a Brisbane hospital, Australian officials said. Haneef formerly worked at a hospital in Liverpool, England, where hospital and police officials say another doctor was detained Sunday. Haneef was detained at Brisbane Airport before he boarded a flight to India, police said. The other doctor in Brisbane was being questioned by Australian authorities but was not officially in police custody, said Queensland Premier Peter Beattie. Paul Wilkinson, chairman of the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said Tuesday it should come as no surprise if the men are determined to be terror conspirators -- regardless of their profession. (Osama bin Laden's top lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is an Egyptian doctor.) ""Their oaths as doctors are overridden by their need to conduct a global jihad,"" he said, conceding that the public is likely to be shocked ""to find that people who are trained in saving lives are assisting in causing deaths on a large scale."" Added Richard Barnes, who chaired the homeland and border security conference in London where Wilkinson made his remarks: ""It is important to understand how someone who can take an oath to save lives can then plan to take life in the most hideous way possible."" But even if terrorism experts are coming to grips with the notion that would-be bombers can come from the medical profession, Britain's medical professionals are still incredulous. ""We are a healing profession,"" Prasad Rao, chairman of the British International Doctors Association, told The Guardian newspaper. ""It shocked me to hear that a doctor could remotely be connected to the people who are trying to kill and maim people for no reason."" Rao further told the newspaper that, if convicted, the men being questioned or detained in the plot violated more than the law. ""A doctor's duty, even if he finds an injured terrorist, is to give medical help,"" Rao said. ""You never knowingly help or assist an individual to kill and maim others. You take the Hippocratic oath, and you do not discriminate on the basis of color or gender or religion.""

"(CNN) -- A recent study on global wellbeing showed the Danes to be the happiest people on the planet and with about a fifth of them living in their capital it stands to reason that Copenhagen must be a little bit special. The Amalienborg palaces are the royal family's winter residence. So what are they so happy about? Well, lifestyle magazine Monocle recently named Copenhagen as being the world's most livable city, highlighting the quality of its infrastructure, transport system and contemporary buildings. It's true that the city is well planned and well managed; it boasts a new metro system, the main arteries in the centre are pedestrianized and the other streets are filled with cyclists rather than exhaust fumes. But Copenhagen is not some soulless exercise in sterile urban planning. There are the winding medieval streets of Indre By and the Latin Quarter, the picture-postcard houses of Nyhavn, the canals of Christanshavn, and the palaces and parks of Fredericksstaden and Rosenborg. The city is, simply, charming. If you spend some time in Copenhagen you'll quickly come to understand the Danish concept of ""hygge"", a word with multiple meanings that is best translated as something between ""cozy"" and ""relaxed"". But if that suggests a city of bygone cuteness it doesn't take into account the sleek modernism of Danish design. Arne Jacobsen's legacy can be seen throughout the city (check out the Radisson SAS Royal and Café Stelling) but no less visionary are recent structures such as Henning Larsen's futuristic Opera House or the dramatic new Royal Library, known as the ""Black Diamond"". The clean lines and minimalism that characterize Danish design are evident in the interiors of the city's stylish bars, restaurants and hotels and perhaps their influence can even be detected in the trend away from bland, stodgy cooking to a cleaner, healthier style that is earning the city's restaurants acclaim and Michelin stars. The alternative side of Copenhagen can be seen in places like Christiania, the 'free city' founded in 1971 by a collection of dropouts, hippies and social visionaries. The fact that this semi-autonomous experiment in communal living has survived for so long is testament to the open-mindedness of the Danish; but the very existence of Christiania has always been controversial and government plans to 'normalize' the area suggest it may not be 'free' much longer. Like any city of its size, Copenhagen has its share of social problems. Nørrebro has been the scene of a riots in recent years, with some commentators blaming social deprivation and others blaming boredom among young people. But it is working class areas like Nørrebro and Vesterbro, away from the tourist trail, that are the beating heart of the city. They are home to many of Copenhagen's trendiest bars and clubs and they have a sense of community that is difficult to convey; it is something Danes might describe as ""hygge"". So why are the Danish so happy? Go to Copenhagen and you'll understand.","Copenhagen has been described as the world's most livable city .
The city is charming, with medieval streets, canals and royal palaces .
Sleek Danish design is evident everywhere and gives the city a modern edge .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- A judge has ordered the children of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to meet in their capacity as the sole shareholders of the corporation that manages their iconic father's estate. Dexter King has denied taking ""substantial funds"" from his parents' estates. King's children were in Fulton County, Georgia, Superior Court Monday in a dispute over their parents' estates. Two children of the civil rights icon are suing their brother, accusing him of wrongfully taking money from their parents' estates. The Rev. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III allege Dexter King took ""substantial funds"" out of Coretta Scott King's estate and ""wrongfully appropriated"" money from their father's estate. Dexter King has publicly denied the accusations. It was unclear what outcome having a shareholder meeting for the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr., Inc. would have on the dispute. The three siblings have not held such a meeting since 2004, corporation attorney Luke Lantta said. The removal of Dexter King as the estate's administrator is unlikely because that would require a meeting of the board of directors. Judge Ural Glanville on Monday also ruled in favor of dismissing some of the allegations against Dexter King, but left the question of whether he failed to act in the best interest of his father's incorporated estate to a jury. A trial on the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty could happen as early as next month. The lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King were in the courtroom Monday, but Dexter King was not. He had been injured in an accident in California and did not make the trip to Georgia. Dexter King had filed a counter claim against his sister, asking the court to force her to hand over to the corporation some items that belonged to Martin Luther King Jr. In a special hearing Monday, the court ruled that the items, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s Nobel Peace Prize and his love letters to Coretta Scott King will be turned over to the court to hold until a resolution is reached. The courtroom was packed with supporters of the King family. Among those in attendance were the Rev. Joseph Lowery and former Ambassador Andrew Young, friends of Martin Luther King Jr. who worked with him during the civil rights movement.

"New York (CNN) -- Incidents of lasers targeting aircraft and pilots are increasing in frequency in the New York area, the FBI said Friday. Reports of lasers being pointed at aircraft are up 17% percent from last year, the bureau said. Injuries involving the laser occurrences are also on the rise, the FBI said; lasers can temporarily or permanently blind a pilot and crew. The most recent incidents happened Tuesday, the FBI said. The first involved a Shuttle America flight that was on final approach to LaGuardia Airport when a green laser illuminated the cockpit. The second was later that evening when a private aircraft reported a green laser two miles south of LaGuardia. No injuries were reported in either instance, but earlier this year several commercial pilots suffered significant injuries, including a burnt retina, because of lasers, the FBI said. ""The FBI is asking anyone with information about any of these dangerous laser incidents to pick up the phone and call us,"" Assistant Director in Charge George Venizelos said. ""Our paramount concern is the safety of aircraft passengers and crew."" The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force is leading the investigation. The FBI is offering a reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of anyone involved in lasers targeting aircraft. A law signed last year makes it a federal crime to aim a laser pointer at an aircraft. In 2005, there were fewer than 300 incidents where planes were targeted, but that number grew more than 12 times to nearly 3,600 in 2011, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA attributes the massive increase to laser pointers being more widely available online, stronger power levels, an increase in green lasers which are easier to see, and better reporting of the incidents by pilots.

"(CNN) -- Golfer Rory McIlroy and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki ushered in 2014 by announcing their engagement on social media. In a sign of the times, they used their respective Twitter accounts to spread the news to their millions of followers, posting pictures of themselves with a ring. Northern Ireland's McIlroy, who ended 2013 as the sixth-ranked golfer in the world, tweeted: ""Happy New Year everyone! I have a feeling it's going to be a great year!! My first victory of 2014 .shesaidyes!!"" Former world number one Wozniacki, from Denmark, reported: ""Happy New Year everyone! Rory and I started 2014 with a bang! ... I said YES!!!!"" The pair have been dating since September 2011, but if media rumors were to be believed their romance has endured some difficult moments, particularly as both slipped down the rankings in their respective sports in 2013.

"Shanghai (CNN) -- Like many companies in China, Fu Shou Yuan uses celebrities to attract clients. Except, in this case, they're dead. That's because they're in the funeral business. ""We have 700 celebrities here -- military martyrs, politicians, opera stars, and actors,"" explains Jason Wu, the manager of the company's flagship cemetery -- an immaculately manicured parkland setting on the outskirts of Shanghai -- as he shows me around in a stretch golf cart. He says this star-power is attracting ordinary clients and their families looking for an extra special resting place for their loved ones. Hot offering . After 20 years in the business, Fu Shou Yuan, which operates six cemeteries across China, went public in Hong Kong in December. It was one of the hottest offerings of the quarter, with respected institutional U.S. investors like The Carlyle Group buying in early. Why the hype? Put plainly, China isn't getting any younger. That's bad news for most of the world's economy. The lasting effects of the one child policy and natural demographic trends as China gets richer have shaved as much as 3% off of China's growth rates, according to a recent study by Citigroup economists. But with more than 180 million people over the age of 60, Fu Shou Yuan gains were others' losses. ""We can't refer to it as a death boom,"" says managing director Wang Jisheng. ""The fact is, at the end of this trend, elderly people will die. But when they leave the world, they have a wish to be remembered, and that leaves us to provide them a good service."" Bespoke service . To deliver that service, Fu Shou Yuan appears to be employing a classic strategy of vertical integration. If you can't make it over to pay your respects, no problem. A grave attendant will put flowers out for you -- for a fee. You need a statue of grandpa? They have in-house sculptors kneading away at clay busts for casting. ""One client wanted changes made for three years until it was perfect,"" Wang says. There is even a restaurant on site if you want a banquet while paying your respects -- specializing in Shanghai's famed lion's head meatballs. ""When you buy a plot, it is just the first step,"" says Wu, walking among the perfectly manicured lawns and polished headstones. ""People even come here to get wedding pictures taken."" Taboo . Chinese couples cavorting around a cemetery in their wedding duds was unthinkable a few years ago, but times are changing. While death is still taboo among older generations, Wang says it's becoming less of an issue as China opens up and more people migrate to urban areas. So they focus on clients from top-tier cities. ""The cities are transforming and during the process of urbanization, there is a great demand for a quality burial service to serve the needs of city dwellers,"" he explains. But to target city clients, Fu Shou Yuan faces severe cost challenges. Land costs near Shanghai alone have risen to such eye-watering levels that even a tiny patch of land for a grave can cost tens of thousands of dollars. The space issue has also gotten so bad that the Shanghai government has increased subsidy rates to try persuade people to bury relatives at sea. So, from traditional south-facing tombs in neat rows, Fu Shou Yuan now puts grave-stones in semi-circles to maximize space. There is also a multistorey mausoleum in the grounds housing a variety of themed rooms where families can place their urn alongside items such as chocolate, photos and even cell phones -- items their relatives may need in the afterlife. These rooms are accessed via a hotel-style key card. We drive up to a grassy hill with a white statue of iconic pop star Teresa Teng. The late singer's most famous songs play in a loop from the memorial. It's one of their major draws. ""They secured clothing from her family and shipped it from Taiwan to bury here,"" a worker tells us. ""To change people's traditions is very, very difficult,"" says Wu. ""But it's not impossible.""","Fu Shou Yuan operates six cemeteries across China .

"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Mourners will gather Friday to say goodbye to a Ugandan gay rights activist who was beaten to death with a hammer in his home near the capital. Weeping family and friends gathered at the scene as questions lingered over whether David Kato was a victim of homophobia. Late last year, his name and photo were printed on the cover of a tabloid newspaper that called for gays to be executed. The story, which included a banner that said ""Hang Them,"" reignited anti-gay sentiments and sparked an outcry from gay rights groups worldwide. Police said initial investigations are focusing on robbery in his rough Mukono neighborhood. Kato's money and some clothes were missing after the attack, authorities said. But some human rights activists said his death was tied to his campaign. ""I'm very angry ... because everybody who knew David knew he was dynamic. He did not have any trouble. He was just a an activist,"" said Julius Kaggwa, a human rights advocate in the east African nation. ""This to me is a hate crime. Really, to put it bluntly, it is a hate crime."" Arrest warrants have been issued for two suspects, authorities said. Kato told CNN last year that he feared for his life after the list was released. His lawyer said authorities in his neighborhood near Kampala were aware of his concerns. ""The villagers want to set my house ablaze,"" he said at the time. ""They want to burn my house. ... (They say,) 'Can you go away before my house is burned?'"" Activists urged authorities in the east African nation to investigate the killing. They called on the government to protect homosexuals from violence, and act on threats and hostility toward them. ""David Kato's death is a tragic loss to the human rights community. David had faced the increased threats to Ugandan lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people bravely and will be sorely missed,"" said Maria Burnett, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. U.S. President Barack Obama said he was saddened by the death of Kato, whom he called a ""powerful advocate for fairness and freedom."" He urged the nation's authorities to investigate and hold those responsible accountable. Earlier this year, Kato and two activists won a case against the magazine that published the list. The court ruled that media in Uganda are barred from releasing details of known or potential homosexuals in the country. The editor of the Rolling Stone, the tabloid that published the list, denounced the attacks and said he sympathized with the victim's family. ""When we called for hanging of gay people, we meant ... after they have gone through the legal process,"" said Giles Muhame. ""I did not call for them to be killed in cold blood like he was."" The Rolling Stone tabloid is not affiliated with the U.S. music magazine by the same name. Homosexuality is illegal in most countries in Africa, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. Ugandan lawmakers shelved a controversial ""anti-gay"" proposal introduced in 2009 that would impose stiff penalties against homosexuality -- including life imprisonment and the death penalty. CNN's Tom Walsh, Faith Karimi and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Weeping family and friends gathered at the scene as questions lingered .

"Washington (CNN) -- The top NSA official tasked with assessing the damage from Edward Snowden's leaks says he would consider amnesty for the former contractor in exchange for a halt to the flow of top secret information about U.S. spying. Snowden, currently in Moscow evading a U.S. warrant for his arrest on espionage charges, leaked information on widespread data collection that's spurred outcry and forced President Barack Obama to review the spy agency's powers. ""My personal view is, yes, it's worth having a conversation about. I would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high. It would be more than just an assertion on his part,"" Rick Ledgett said on ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday. He said the agency's assessment of Snowden's leaks has cost millions of dollars. Gen. Keith Alexander, the NSA's director, said on the same program that he didn't support allowing Snowden to go unpunished, and the White House said Monday it hadn't changed its stance. Obama's 2013: A very tough year . ""Mr. Snowden is charged with a felony, and he should return home to face those charges, where he will be afforded all due process,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. On Friday, a review panel of outside officials delivered dozens of recommendations to Obama on ways the U.S. can balance necessary intelligence gathering with expectations of privacy among both Americans and foreign governments. Convened amid a series of leaks from Snowden, the review board operated in private, and its recommendations won't be made public until next month. ""We expect our overall internal review to be completed in January and the President thereafter to deliver remarks to outline the outcomes of our work,"" Hayden said Friday. The review came as newspapers published story after story detailing the spying powers of the NSA and other federal agencies, including reports that the U.S. government tracked the cell phones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders. The revelations prompted outcry from Americans and foreign governments, concerned the U.S. was overreaching in its efforts to thwart terrorist attacks. Reports published in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times last week indicated the recommendations from the review group included transferring the command of the NSA from military to civilian leadership and handing over control of cell phone records to a third party. Opinion: Big Brother spying is reaching scary levels . Some opponents of the NSA programs have called for the agency's spying and military cybercommand to be split into two; however, on Friday the White House said the dual NSA missions would remain under one chief to avoid duplicated work and foster cooperation. Michael Hayden, a former NSA director, said on Sunday the agency's boss doesn't necessarily have to be a military commander. ""My view would be take the best American out there and put them in the job, don't make it a requirement that they'd be in (or) out of uniform,"" he said. Obama has come under pressure from his liberal base to find ways of curbing the federal government's spying powers, including demands from lawmakers that more oversight be enacted to prevent abuses during the secretive legal process allowing spying to take place. ""Nothing short of stopping the mass, suspicionless surveillance of Americans is acceptable,"" Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said last week, as reports of the review panel's recommendation leaked. ""We look forward to evaluating the report's details and whether the reported 'stricter rules' for obtaining U.S. records are a meaningful and substantive improvement. In the end, however, Congress must pass legislation to end bulk collection of Americans' sensitive call records. Requiring third parties to store Americans' records for the government is not a solution."" Obama vowed at the beginning of December to find ways of reforming the NSA, though in making the pledge he also defended the agency's work. ""I'll be proposing some self-restraint on the NSA, and you know, to initiate some reforms that can give people more confidence,"" he told MSNBC on December 5. ""But I want everybody to be clear: The people of the NSA generally are looking out for the safety of the American people."" Leak: Government spies snooped in 'Warcraft,' other games . CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta contributed to this report .","NEW: Official who's assessing damage says he's willing to talk if it cuts off flow of secrets .

"(EW.com ) -- Thor: The Dark World debuted mightily atop the domestic box office this weekend, hammering up $86.1 million from 3,841 theaters, which gave Disney's $170 million 3-D sequel a blazing $22,418 per theater average. Thanks to the Norse superhero's increased exposure in last year's mega-smash The Avengers, The Dark World debuted 31 percent higher than 2011â€²s Thor, which earned $65.7 million over its first three days in theaters. The film didn't enjoy as big of a boost as Iron Man 3, which opened with $174.1 million, a 34 percent improvement over Iron Man 2's debut â€” and still the best debut of 2013. Thor: The Dark World earned an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade from audiences, which Disney reports were 62 percent male and 61 percent over the age of 25. The film earned an unusually low $5.3 million of its gross from IMAX screens, though IMAX engagements were only announced on Monday, three days before the The Dark World's release. Grosses on the international front are much more impressive: The film pulled in another $94 million in its second weekend, bringing its international total to $240.9 million after 12 days. The original Thor earned $268 million overseas, a figure The Dark World will have passed by this time next week. Disney successfully played up the dynamic between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Loki (Avengers breakout Tom Hiddleston) in marketing, and as a result, the movie gave the studio its best ever November opening ahead of The Incredibles, which grossed $70.5 million on opening weekend. It had the ninth-best November start overall behind three Twilight films, four Harry Potter films, and Skyfall, which grossed $88.4 million on this weekend last year. It's too early to tell where The Dark World will finish domestically, though it should be able to reach $200 million if it plays like Thor, which ultimately earned $181 million. EW: Box office update - 'Thor: The Dark World' tops Friday with $31.6 million . According to studio estimates, the rest of the movies in the Top 5 all finished within $1.1 million of each other. Don't be surprised if the rankings get swapped around when final studio figures arrive on Monday afternoon. Paramount's $15 million prank film Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa laughed up $11.3 million this weekend. The film has now earned $78.7 million total and it will make close to $100 million before its run is over. After its lukewarm debut, Relativity's Free Birds rose an encouraging 29 percent to $11.2 million, giving it a $30.2 million after ten days. While that bodes well for the film, Free Birds needs to fly much higher to make back its $55 million budget. Last Vegas fell 32 percent to $11.1 million for the frame. The CBS Films comedy, which stars Robert DeNiro, Michael Douglas, and Morgan Freeman, has now grossed $33.5 million against a slim $28 million budget. EW: 'Thor: The Dark World' comedy exclusive - Loki argues with kids . If only Ender's Game had a slim budget. The $110 million sci-fi adventure continued to underperform this weekend. After topping the chart in its debut, the Asa Butterfield vehicle fell to fifth place, plummeting 62 percent to $10.3 million for a disappointing $44 million total. 1. Thor: The Dark World -- $86.1 million . 2. Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa -- $11.3 million . 3. Free Birds -- $11.2 million . 4. Last Vegas -- $11.1 million . 5. Ender's Game -- $10.3 million . Outside the Top 5, 12 Years a Slave successfully expanded into wide release. After moving into 1,144 theaters, the harrowing drama pulled in $6.6 million total, giving it a fantastic $17.3 million total after four weekends and keeping it one of the most buzzed-about Oscar contenders of the season. Richard Curtis' latest rom-com About Time fared pretty well in its expansion too. Out in 1,200 theaters, the film, which stars Rachel McAdams, grossed $5.2 million, and it now has an early $6.7 million total after ten days. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Sixteen people have been killed and five others injured in a fire early Wednesday at a market in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, the local government said.

The blaze started around 1 a.m. Wednesday, the state news agency Xinhua reported. Later in the morning, firefighters were still clearing away the embers and searching for survivors in the debris, the agency said. There was no immediate mention of the cause of the fire.

"(CNN) -- Andriy Shevchenko has returned to pro sports. But not in football -- and not to the standard of success he has been used to. The former European player of the year is competing in his first professional golf tournament as part of the Kharkov Superior Cup in his native Ukraine, but struggled to a 12-over-par 84 in Thursday's opening round. ""It's a completely different game when you are under pressure, but I really enjoyed it still and so happy to be at this tournament, even if my scoring didn't go so good. It's a great experience for me,"" Shevchenko told the European Tour website. His playing partner, Frenchman Victor Riu, was the first-round leader in the second-tier Challenge Tour event after a sharply contrasting course-record 64. ""I am not a big fan of football so I didn't really know much about Andriy but it was great to play with him. There were a lot of people watching,"" the 28-year-old said. ""He was great. Every time I holed a putt he shook my hand or gave me a high five. He was really pushing me on to play better and cheering me when I made birdies so that was a really big help for me. ""I did put it up on Facebook that I was playing with him and it got a lot of responses, so I knew it was a big deal! Shevchenko, who enjoyed most of his success with Italian club AC Milan, retired from football a year ago after Ukraine co-hosted the European Championships and has since dabbled in politics. He entered this tournament as one of several amateurs in the 130-strong field, having initially taken up golf to help ease the pressure of playing elite football. ""I come on to a golf course and turn off my phone and just walk the course and hit some balls. It's one of the reasons why I started to play,"" he said Wednesday. ""I just found this great game where you have to be focused and balanced and that's why I like it. I like that mental balance."" Shevchenko did manage one birdie, but he carded a double bogey and dropped shots at 11 other holes at the Superior Golf and Spa Resort course, which is part of a luxury seven-star facility. ""To play with Victor and see him shoot a course record and play fantastic golf, I learned so much about the game from the two guys,"" he said. Shevchenko isn't the only athlete to try his hand at pro golf following a successful career in another sport. Former tennis No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov became Russia's national champion in 2011 -- he is also in the field this weekend in Ukraine -- and eight-time grand slam tennis winner Ivan Lendl contested the Czech Open back in 1996. After Lendl struck an 11-over-par 82 in the first round, he was quoted as saying by the Chicago Tribune that it was ""five times worse than playing in a Wimbledon final."" Although similarly unlikely to make the halfway cut, and therefore miss out on the weekend action, Shevchenko is nonetheless proud to be participating in his country's first major golf tournament. ""It's the first event for me and also in Ukraine so it's big for golf here,"" he said. ""I love golf and I'm so happy that golf is starting to pick up in Ukraine and the people are starting to invest money long term.""","Andriy Shevchenko makes his professional golf debut in his native Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- A California wildfire grew modestly to 769 acres and destroyed 22 structures, including the fire chief's home, in the pristine coastal mountain region known as Big Sur, authorities said Wednesday. The 879 personnel fighting the fire reported ""good progress"" in bringing the blaze under 20% control, up from 5% the day before, authorities said. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Fire Chief Martha Karstens of the Big Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade lost her home in the fire, which began Monday. ""The irony doesn't escape me,"" she told CNN. ""I try to set an example for fire clearance. And we do the best we can. But it's -- the situation was just -- it was too much, too hot, too fast, too soon. ""If I had had other resources, perhaps my home would still be there,"" she added. The loss marked a turnabout in her job, in which she deals with fire damage to other people's homes. ""Until it happens to you, you feel sorry for them. But literally, I went out to fight a fire. I had my purse. I had my cell phone and my glasses. And I didn't know I was going to be trying to save my own home,"" she said.

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Three African presidents met with their defiant counterpart in Ivory Coast Tuesday in an effort to defuse the country's political crisis. No details of the meeting in Abidjan, the administrative center of the conflict-torn country, were immediately available. But incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo's ministers had already signaled that the man who believed he had won Ivory Coast's presidential election had no intention of stepping down. Presidents Yayi Boni of Benin, Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone and Pedro Pires of Cape Verde were next meeting with Gbagbo's challenger, Alassane Ouattara, who also claimed victory at the polls and who has the international community's support as Ivory Coast's legitimate leader. The three heads of state represent the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which held an emergency meeting last Friday in Nigeria and delivered an ultimatum to Gbagbo: Step down or face the threat of military force. Gbagbo's Minister of Interior Emile Guirieoulou said Sunday the three leaders would be ""received as brothers, friends."" ""We will listen to them, listen to the message they are carrying,"" he said. ""If they abide to our constitution, we're going to talk ... our constitution is not negotiable."" However, Foreign Affairs Minister Alcide Djedje said Gbagbo would not step down. The ECOWAS delegation met earlier Tuesday with Young-Jin Choi, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's special envoy; and a representative of the African Union. It's unclear if ECOWAS intends to make good on its threat or what kind of force would be used. It has intervened before in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ivory Coast's Independent Electoral Commission, backed by the United Nations, declared opposition leader Ouattara the winner of a November runoff. But its Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared incumbent Gbagbo the winner. The international community, including the United States, the United Nations and the African Union, has recognized Ouattara as the winner and urged Gbagbo to cede power. The incumbent government on Tuesday threatened to expel ambassadors of countries that recognize Ouattara's ambassadors, according to Ahoua Don Melo, the government spokesman. Speaking on national television, he said the move would be a measure of reciprocity. The threat seems to take aim at France and Belgium. France has said it would review the credentials of an ambassador appointed by Ouattara, while Belgium has said it would recognize the Ouattara appointee. The political stalemate has thrown Ivory Coast into crisis and scores of people have died in related violence. A convoy of Bangladeshi peacekeepers came under attack Tuesday in Abidjan, the United Nations said. The U.N. peacekeeping mission said one soldier was slashed in the arm by a machete and a U.N. vehicle was burned. The African Union has suspended Ivory Coast from the organization ""until such a time the democratically elected president effectively assumes state power."" And the World Bank has halted lending and disbursing funds to Ivory Coast and has closed its office in the country. The U.S. Department of Defense currently has a group in Abidjan looking into the possible evacuation of U.S. citizens. State Department spokesman Mark Toner confirmed it was a ""small DoD assessment team on the ground at the embassy in Abidjan to help with contingency planning."" More than 15,000 refugees have fled for neighboring Liberia, according to the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees, a large number of them women and children.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Rebel forces have declared a cease-fire after four days of fighting in the North Kivu province of eastern Congo, the French ambassador to the United Nations said after Security Council talks on the unfolding humanitarian crisis. Congolese soldiers and displaced civilians move into Goma on Wednesday, fleeing advancing rebels. Laurent Nkunda, the Congolese Tutsi general who leads troops of the National Congress for the Defense of the People, ordered the cease-fire, Ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert told reporters. ""We hope that it will stand, and we hope that tomorrow Mr. Nkunda will announce that he stops his offensive,"" Ripert said, adding that he expected the the council would condemn the military operation. He called the humanitarian situation ""very alarming,"" said more than 50,000 people ""are on the road,"" and expressed hope that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon would send a high-level envoy to the region for talks ""as soon as possible."" Representatives of European countries ""are talking together"" about how best to ease the situation, Ripert said. ""We are looking into the most effective and fastest way of helping MONUC,"" he said, using the French acronym for the U.N. mission in Congo. Nkunda has accused the Congolese government of failing to protect the Tutsi tribe from Rwandan Hutu militia in Congo. Ripert cited reports of fighting at the DRC's border with Rwanda and called on neighboring countries ""to use restraint and not to interfere."" News of the cease-fire was embraced by Samuel Nagbe, a representative of the relief agency Oxfam, in the eastern Congolese city of Goma. ""We are very happy that, at least, the fighting is going to stop,"" he told CNN. He called for the factions to meet ""to find a lasting situation to the crisis."" Nkuda's troops were advancing after fighting between the rebels and government forces led thousands of people to flee south toward Goma, capital of North Kivu province in eastern Congo. Conditions in the region were ""continuing to deteriorate rapidly,"" the medical charity Doctors Without Borders said in a statement posted on its Web site. Madnodje Mounoubai, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, said government troops were leaving the city, which wasn't on the front lines. He said he didn't know where the soldiers were going, but suspected they were headed to areas of heavy fighting. Ban said at midday he was ""alarmed at the escalation of violence"" over the prior 24 hours and warned of a ""humanitarian crisis."" In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters the agency was sending Assistant Secretary Jendayi Frazer to the region as an envoy. ""We're working as best we can to minimize or defuse the situation, get more troops in there,"" McCormack said. Attacks by CNDP rebels have uprooted hundreds of thousands of displaced people from camps run by the United Nations and other organizations. ""The humanitarian situation is quite dire,"" Mounoubai told CNN by phone from Kinshasa, Congo's capital. ""We have internally displaced people streaming out of camps. Both parties are blocking the U.N. from reaching desperately needy people to evacuate,"" he added. ""I cannot emphasize how desperate the situation on the ground is."" The region's instability endangers aid workers, some of whom have joined the exodus. Michael Arunga, a spokesman for World Vision, told CNN the organization's workers had fled to the Rwandan border, where they were assessing the situation and caring for civilians crossing into the area. Arunga said he himself had fled from Goma, where he could hear shootings at night. ""For agencies to operate on the ground, we need a peaceful environment,"" he said. Doctors Without Borders said that on Sunday, medical teams in Rutshuru treated 70 wounded, and had been working round the clock since. Some of the people who sought help had been on the run for weeks, said the group, which described the situation as ""extremely volatile."" Doctors have been working mostly in towns and camps in and around Kitchanga, Masisi, Mweso, Nyanzale and Kayna.

"(CNN) -- Fortunes forever rise and fall, but perhaps none so fast as those of drug lords. On Monday, Forbes magazine released its annual list of the world's richest people, and for the first time since 2009, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman did not make the cut. Guzman is the boss of the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful drug trafficking operations. His nickname, which means ""shorty,"" matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug business. Forbes had previously estimated his net worth at $1 billion. ""As the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, he is one of the most powerful people in the world, but no longer someone we are confident enough to call a billionaire,"" the magazine said on its website. READ: Forbes rankings finds 210 new billionaires . Forbes believes an increasing part of his fortune is going to protect him and his family and said that it had been unable to reach Guzman to ""verify figures."" It also said it was unclear how he spends the money he makes. Authorities have been looking for Guzman ever since he escaped from a Mexican prison in a laundry cart in 2001.

"(CNN) -- It's a cliche of American presidential politics -- the president we elect is always a reaction to what came before. As in: Nixonian shenanigans eventually gave rise to Jimmy Carter's self-righteousness. Clintonesque parsing gave way to George W. Bush's plain speaking. Bush's plain speaking begat Barack Obama's lofty speechifying. Oversimplified? Yes. But true nonetheless. And so we head into 2016 (yes, already) and Chris Christie's ready-made narrative: If Obama is lofty, Christie is down to earth. If Obama wasn't tough enough, he's hard-hitting. If Obama couldn't run his complex health care rollout, he's a strong manager. If Obama was partisan, he's worked across party lines. In sum: Christie can lead in the precise ways that Obama disappointed. Until a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge. Then came another stark contrast: the vindictive -- and more important, petty -- Christie culture as opposed to the stature the presidency demands. So far, the New Jersey melodrama looks like the worst side of the Christie ethos. The apparent reprisals against Democratic mayors. The vanity of featuring the Christie family in taxpayer-funded commercials. The environment in which retribution reigned when Christie did not get what he wanted. The arrogance of believing he was deserving of it all, and to hell with the rest of 'em. The grand storyline behind all of this, of course, is the design on the presidency: Christie wanted to be re-elected by such an overwhelming margin that it would launch his national aspirations into the stratosphere. The plan was to get bipartisan support to show his viability as a national candidate. All who stood in the way were official enemies. This is not to say that presidents don't have enemies. Of course they do. You don't get elected to any office in this country, much less president of the United States, without accumulating political enemies. But the real question is WHY you consider someone an enemy, and then, how you deal with it. As president, LBJ had always had a bunch, but the enmity -- and payback -- generally came over issues, not self-aggrandizement. It's Politics 101: If you want to pass a civil rights bill and you don't get a ""yes"" vote from an opponent who wants a bridge in his state, no bridge. That's very different from saying if you don't endorse my candidacy I will shut down your bridge. That's not politics; it's puny payback. And, worse, the impact is felt not only by the opponent, but by his -- and your -- constituents. A bridge way too far. Then consider Bill Clinton, who had plenty of enemies. A former senior Clinton adviser reminds me that ""it became a joke that the best thing to be was Clinton's enemy. If 99 people in a room were for him, and one was against him, he would spend all his time trying to persuade that one guy he was wrong. And he was always willing to argue the substance. Always. In fact, he enjoyed it."" This is not to turn Clinton and LBJ into saintly role models and Christie into the devil. But it is to say that Christie's staff shenanigans -- which he says he did not know about -- have raised enormous questions about his temperament and how he would run a White House. In fact, a Monmouth University poll released this week shows that only 44% of New Jersey voters believe that their governor has the right temperament for the Oval Office. The characterization of Christie and Obama as opposite numbers is accurate in many ways. There's this: When then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democrat-turned-independent, endorsed Republican Sen. John McCain for the presidency in 2008 -- and became his outspoken travel buddy -- there were calls for retribution after Obama won. So what did Obama do? He kept Lieberman on as chairman of an important committee. It kept an enemy close, not a bad strategy. Obama is cool and Christie is all drama. And now a line of argument against him as petty and vindictive has been opened up that will become the default narrative. But Christie will be defined as much by how he deals with this episode as the episode itself. No one expects -- or really wants -- Chris Christie to morph into a false version of himself. But how about some elevation -- and some perspective -- that flies way above the traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: On paper, Christie seemed a strong candidate for 2016 .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps Sandra Bullock was just overwhelmed. The ""Gravity"" star had a busy Thursday thanks to her Oscar nod, and by the time she took the stage at that night's Critics' Choice Movie Awards, she let an F-bomb slip during her acceptance speech for best actress in an action movie. Bullock was trying to get out her ""thank you's"" when a technical glitch interrupted. ""What the f***?"" a surprised Bullock said before joking that she's an action star. The 49-year-old wasn't the only to go off-script that night: Bradley Cooper sneaked in the expletive during the best comedy acceptance speech, calling his co-stars ""these f***ing actors."" So the two played it a little loose, but on the other hand, they were probably still riding a high from that morning's celebration.

"(CNN) -- American higher education is in the cross hairs of a heated national debate over the value and cost of a college degree. Yet in China, our fiercest global economic competitor, the popularity of American colleges and universities might be at an all-time high. I just returned from a trip to Beijing, where I spoke with Chinese parents about the value of American education, where we excel and where we fall short. Not surprising was the extent to which the Chinese value education, especially primary and secondary education, and yearn for their children to attend American universities, and if possible, stay in America. When I engaged Chinese parents about their children, they would often say, ""My son (or daughter) is going to Princeton (or fill in the elite American university)."" I would respond, ""Great! What year is your son or daughter right now?"" And they would say, ""Three years old."" This passion for education starting at such an early age is powerful. After meeting with Chinese teachers, parents and children, three differences were immediately clear. First, their children are better educated than American children in the STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering and math. High standards and high expectations are the norm in China, not the exception, as is often the case in the United States. Second, Chinese parents will sacrifice almost anything for their child's education. They realize firsthand, ""History is a race between education and catastrophe,"" as H.G. Wells put it. In China, the disposable income of middle-class families is more likely to be spent on education than leisure or entertainment. Third, to the Chinese people, American universities, for all their shortcomings and blemishes, are still beacons of freedom, individualism and self-improvement. To them, our universities are emblems of the highest achievement. In Asia, they have a saying: ""The protruding nail gets hammered down."" In America, we give awards for protruding nails. Our standards should be higher and our achievement better, but we still remain a land of unlimited opportunity. Each of my speeches in China began by reminding the Chinese people of the three, quintessential American values engraved, on our currency: Liberty, In God We Trust and E. Pluribus Unum. Politically, we may be at odds with the Chinese regime, but its people desperately long for a taste of American autonomy. RISE China, the private international education company that invited me to China and for which I am a compensated senior adviser, focuses on teaching idiomatic English to Chinese students to help them get into American universities. It also helps Chinese students develop confidence, initiative, commitment and active learning -- all qualities that are cherished by our higher institutions. As a result, the number of Chinese undergraduate students in the U.S. has doubled in the past two years. In the 2006-07 academic year, 9,955 Chinese undergraduates enrolled in U.S. schools. The next year, that figure jumped to 16,450, and by 2010-11, 56,976 undergraduates enrolled in the U.S. China exports more of its students to the U.S. than to any other country. They are already reaping the benefits educationally and economically. In February 2011, in a meeting with Silicon Valley's biggest entrepreneurs, President Barack Obama asked Steve Jobs of Apple what it would take to make iPhones in the U.S. rather than China. Jobs replied that those jobs aren't coming back. The New York Times reported it this way: ""Apple executives believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that ""Made in the U.S.A."" is no longer a viable option for most Apple products."" The Chinese realize the potential of American universities when engaged properly. When a student approaches the university with a specific degree focus, applies it with diligence and finances it soundly, understanding the commitment he or she is making, the American university system is still the best in the world. American students must begin approaching their higher education just as smartly and seriously, or our academies will be filled with aspiring and inquiring minds from elsewhere. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","William Bennett: Many Chinese yearn to send their children to U.S. universities .
Bennett: Chinese students better prepared in science, math; parental expectations higher .

"(CNN) -- A Good Samaritan died Saturday while trying a save two people who had been swept into the Pacific Ocean in San Pedro, California, authorities said. The 36-year-old victim, whose name was not released, was one of several people who jumped into the waters near the Cabrillo Beach breakwater after the teen and a 49-year-old man were swept into the ocean, Los Angeles Port Police Lt. Michael Capodanno said in a statement. Authorities responded to a 6:35 a.m. call that three people had been swept into the water at the breakwater, a popular gathering spot for fishing and taking pictures, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. San Pedro is about 25 miles south of Los Angeles. The 49-year-old man made his way out of the water on his own. The 14-year-old was pulled from the water by divers and transported to a hospital. Humphrey said it appears the two had been fishing on the breakwater. The 36-year-old victim had no pulse and was not breathing when fire department divers pulled him from the water, Humphrey said. Rescuers performed CPR as they transported him to Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead. Capodanno said both the 49-year-old and the teen were in ""good health"" and released from the hospital.

"Washington (CNN) -- Embattled Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker, an anti-union darling of the tea party and other fiscal conservatives, faces off Tuesday against Democratic Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett in a high-stakes recall election that politicos say could foreshadow the contentious November general contest. Recall vote is judgment day for Wisconsin governor . The fight to recall Walker after only an 18-month tenure in office speaks to some in the blue-leaning state's frustration over Republican-led efforts to keep unions in check. Walker and his GOP colleagues in the state legislature voted last January to restrict public employee unions' collective bargaining rights and keep their raises -- except those of police and firefighters -- at inflation rates. Protests and a union backlash ensued along with efforts to recall Walker from office. Meet Scott Walker: From the archives, watch Gov. Walker in 2011 make his case: ""we don't have any more money.' Walker and his supporters argue that unions are making it difficult to take the steps needed to shrink the state's mushrooming debt. Unions and their supporters counter that collective bargaining has helped ensure safe working conditions, fair treatment and wages and adequate health care. The deeply polarized Wisconsin recall race also pits Democrats and their Big Labor allies against Republicans and impassioned tea party supporters in a multi-million dollar showdown that's drawn such political stars as former President Bill Clinton and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, into the fray. A loss for either party in the close race could start a domino effect in swing states. As CNN's Candy Crowley pointed out Monday in an analysis: If Walker sidesteps a recall, it would speak to conservative's grassroots power, the waning power of unions -- which typically ally with Democrats -- and could further Romney's efforts in the state. A Walker recall would mean conservatives were roundly chastised, the tea party suffered a blow and Obama has strong footing in Wisconsin.","Wisconsin votes on Tuesday to recall Gov. Scott Walker .

"(CNN) -- An autopsy will be conducted Tuesday on the body of R&B singer-songwriter Teena Marie, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office. It was not immediately clear when the results would be available, but the coroner's office said it hopes to have the autopsy completed on Tuesday. The artist was found dead Sunday at her California home. Born Mary Christine Brockert in Santa Monica, California, the 54-year-old artist was nominated four times for a Grammy Award, according to her official website. Marie was found dead by her daughter after apparently dying in her sleep, manager Mike Gardner said. The publicist said she talked on Saturday with Marie, who told her that she was excited about heading to Atlanta to perform this week -- in what would have been her first performance since the seizure. While no cause of death has been released, the singer's publicist Lynn Jeter said that Marie suffered a grand mal seizure a month ago. ""Luckily, someone was there,"" Jeter said of that seizure. ""The ambulance took her to the hospital, and on the way she had another seizure."" Among her songs were ""Lovergirl,"" ""Portuguese Love,"" ""Ooo La La La,"" and ""I'm a Sucker for Your Love."" Marie recorded for various record labels, including Motown, Epic, Stax Records and Cash Money Classics, after bursting onto the national music scene as a 19-year-old, according to her website. Her last studio album was ""Congo Square."" ""I am horrified by the sudden death of my darling Teena Marie,"" Motown founder Berry Gordy said in a statement sent by his publicist. ""She was my 'baby,' always true to herself, always true to her heart."" Berry called her a ""powerhouse performer, writer, producer and arranger."" ""When I first auditioned her she was so awesome she blew me away,"" Gordy said. ""She had so much soul -- the only thing white about her was her skin."" CNN's Roland S.

"New York (CNN) -- Keep your kids away from these Santas! Bar-goers dressed in Christmas-themed costumes descended upon hundreds of cities worldwide Saturday for the annual bar crawl known as Santacon. In New York, thousands took to the streets dressed as elves, Santas and holiday-themed characters, as they have since 1997. In recent years, the debauchery of some of its participants has become too much -- even for some who take part in it. ""It was just terrible, they were throwing up in the streets. It was really just disgusting. I just put a red suit on and have a good time,"" Sandy Bachom, who participated in the event last year, told CNN afilliate WABC. ""I think New Yorkers generally are extremely tolerant of visitors, but when they come in such droves, and then combine that with public intoxication, it has a negative impact in our neighborhoods,"" state Sen. Brad Hoylman said to WABC. Despite the controversy, city officials are supporting the event. ""It's what makes New York New York,"" Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said at a press conference Friday. ""There has been some rowdy activity by a small handful of people."" However, NYPD officers were handing out fliers stressing that they would stop revelers who publicly consume alcohol.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Before it's signed, the freshly minted security agreement between the United States and Afghanistan must face the scrutiny of the Afghan people in Kabul, starting Thursday. Thousands of tribal elders, who have made their way to the capital, have kicked off the loya jirga, a grand assembly, to confer in the coming days on a key issue: . Whether or not to support the presence in their country of a limited number of U.S. troops beyond next year, when Washington plans to end their combat mission. ""They have to pass it,"" said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who announced Wednesday that he and Afghan President Hamid Karzai had arrived at the agreement. ""It's up to the people of Afghanistan."" But is the jirga's decision binding? And what happens next? What is the loya jirga? A loya jirga is a uniquely Afghan way of debating and resolving issues of national importance. For centuries leaders of the rugged, tribal-based Central Asian nation have called the assembly to choose new kings, debate political matters and factional disputes, or adopt new laws and constitutions. The meetings are intended to bridge divides between the country's divergent ethnic groups and create consensus among them. Is the loya jirga's decision binding? Not really. The loya jirga is by no means fully democratic, but the opinions of its 2,000-plus members are an important indicator of how the Afghan people feel. In the past, Karzai has said he respects the body and would acquiesce to its decision. The elders have come to this loya jirga at Karzai's invitation, but that does not guarantee that they will support him in approving the security agreement. He has been heckled at least once at a past gathering. How does the assembly work? After the opening session Thursday, the jirga will break up into smaller working groups for the next three days. The members will discuss the agreement among themselves and then present their recommendations to the full gathering. If the loya jirga passes the security agreement, what's next? Once the elders have weighed in, Afghanistan's parliament will vote on the proposed bilateral agreement. Then it will wait for signature by the president. That may not be Karzai. On Thursday, he told the tribal elders that the arrangement won't be signed until after elections scheduled for April 2014, and Karzai has reached the term limit set by his country's constitution. He told CNN's Christiane Amanpour it's ""absolutely time to go."" If all goes well, when does the agreement go into effect? The agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last ""until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated"" by mutual agreement, according to a copy of the deal posted online Wednesday by the Afghan government. A U.S. official confirms the copy is authentic. The agreement says that either side will have to give two years' notice if they want to terminate it. What are the key takeaways in the tentative agreement? The final language of the security agreement -- which Kerry and Karzai reached a deal on -- guides the role of American troops in Afghanistan. According to the tentative deal: . -- U.S. forces will play a support role in Afghanistan. -- But it also says that U.S. military operations ""may be appropriate"" to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates. -- It says the Afghan military will take the lead in counterterrorism operations and the U.S. will complement that ""with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people, including in their homes."" -- It mentions U.S. government funding for Afghan security forces. -- It gives the U.S. military strict jurisdiction if a U.S. soldier is alleged to commit unlawful acts on Afghan soil. -- On the other hand, Afghan authorities may request that anyone be removed from the country. So, what are the sticking points? Military raids and strikes have long been a sore point between the two countries, given a number of incidents in which civilian men, women and children were killed. The proposed deal contains references to respecting ""Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and adds that U.S. forces ""shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes."" But the agreement does not address past transgressions. Why not? Because Kerry says that during his back-and-forth with Karzai, a demand for a U.S. apology was ""not even on the table."" Some published reports have suggested otherwise. ""I don't know where the idea of an apology started,"" Kerry said. ""President Karzai didn't ask for an apology. ... There has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever."" But the U.S. has made a promise, Karzai told the loya jirga Thursday. President Obama has vowed that U.S. troops won't raid Afghan homes barring exceptional cases involving direct threat to American citizens. In a letter from Obama to Karzai, made public by Afghan officials, the U.S. President reiterates that U.S. forces in Afghanistan will ""continue to make every effort to respect the sanctity and dignity of Afghans in their homes and in their daily lives, just as we do for our own citizens."" ""As this new agreement states, U.S. forces shall not enter Afghan homes for the purposes of military operations, except under extraordinary circumstances involving urgent risk to life and limb of U.S. nationals,"" Obama wrote. ""The U.S. commitment to Afghanistan's independence, territorial integrity, and national unity, as enshrined in our Strategic Partnership Agreement, is enduring, as is our respect for Afghan sovereignty."" What's another stumbling block? Another stumbling block is whether American soldiers accused of a crime can stand trial in an Afghan court. The agreement gives the U.S. strict military jurisdiction. But many Afghans feel that that compromises the country's sovereignty. Is the issue of immunity a deal-breaker? The U.S. has said that unless American troops get immunity from Afghan prosecution, it will pull out all its troops by the end of 2014 -- like it did from Iraq at the end of 2011. That could have significant consequences for Afghanistan. It needs some troop presence for training its forces and for stability. Can this obstacle be resolved? Karzai says he can convince the loya jirga to allow that. ""I can go to the Afghan people and tell them that, well, if we are to ask for a U.S. presence in Afghanistan for that broader security and stability, there are things that they want in return,"" he told Amanpour in January. ""And immunity is the principle thing that they want. So I will argue for it. And I can tell you with relatively good confidence that they will say, all right, let's do it."" What's the takeaway: Will all U.S. troops be home by the end of 2014? No. President Barack Obama has promised to end U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014. The key word here is ""combat."" Speaking on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that same point: ""The war in Afghanistan will end next year, as the president has promised. The combat mission will be over."" But the approval of a security agreement would pave the way for American troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that. Kerry said the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan would be ""very limited,"" adding ""it is entirely (to) train, equip and assist"" Afghan forces. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Afghan elders meet at the loya jirga to weigh in on important issues .

"Beijing (CNN) -- College student Wang Zixu was among the 1.1 million hopefuls who packed out school and universities across China on Sunday to sit the country's civil service exams. It's a tradition that dates back more than 1,300 years when exams were first held to select the best applicants for ancient imperial bureaucracy. Today's young job seekers are vying for government posts in record numbers. Like many of the candidates, Wang, who will graduate next year, says the prospect of a stable salary and good benefits make it more appealing than the private sector that attracts many of the most ambitious minds in the U.S. and Europe. ""I think the exam wasn't too hard. I answered all the questions,"" Wang told CNN after taking the three-hour exam outside the China Institute of Political Science and Law. ""The pay is not very high but it has good bonus and social security,"" he added. Central government jobs are often described as a ""golden rice bowl"" for their stable income and generous benefits. Officialdom can also lead to membership of the Chinese Communist Party -- a status symbol in China. But with only 19,000 jobs available, Wang's chances of a civil service career are slim. The exam attracted record numbers of applicants, with 1.52 million completing the online registration process up from 30,000 in 2001. About 7,200 people competed for the most popular position as a researcher with the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, according to The China Daily. The annual exam includes an aptitude test and a policy essay, and those who pass make it to an interview round. When China's economy first opened up 30 years ago, going into private business or commerce was seen as the best way to get ahead. But the civil service first began attracting huge numbers of applicants a decade ago, said Zhang Juwei, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Institute of Population and Labor Economics. ""The private sector in China is not very well structured or developed like the U.S.,"" he said. ""Most of the people in private companies in China, unless their positions are high, they usually don't pay well or have a clear career ladder to move up."" Many of the candidates are university graduates and the increase in the numbers applying for government jobs reflects a surge in the number of university graduates entering a fiercely competitive job market. This year a record seven million graduated, up from around two million a decade ago, according to Chinese magazine Caijing. Xu Ru and her friend Liu Jiashuang were among the class of 2013 trying their luck. While some prepare by taking crash courses offered by cram schools, Xu said she had not studied for the exam. ""Everyone is taking it today, so I just feel like I should give it a try, and if I got it, it would be simply great,"" she said. None of the half a dozen candidates CNN spoke to said they were concerned by the government's anti-corruption drive that has targeted both high and low-ranking officials. ""I think I would not do that -- I have my own principles,"" said a man called Wang, who said he didn't do well in the exam this time around and would consider taking it again next year. The exam is also seen as being relatively transparent and fair in a society where connections can often count for more than ability. Parents also think it's a suitable career in today's uncertain economy. ""I mean for a girl, being a civil servant can be ideal. I know people who worked in the private sector here, they jump from place to place, it's a lot of pressure,"" said Fu Wenxia, the mother of an exam taker. Feng Ke reported from Beijing, Katie Hunt wrote from Hong Kong .","More than one million took China's national civil service exam on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The image of the Shinkansen bullet train streaking past Mount Fuji is a powerful part of the iconography of the resurgent post-war Japan. Introduced in 1964, just months ahead of the the Tokyo Olympics, the bullet train represented everything that Japan wanted for itself: a sleek, cutting-edge and reliable mode of transportation. The average annual delay of a Shinkansen train is 36 seconds -- even accounting for earthquakes and typhoons. The Shinkansen network transports around 930,000 passengers every day. During rush hour, bullet trains leave urban stations around Japan as often as every six minutes. But nearly 50 years on, Japan's hi-tech wonder desperately needs an update. With the fastest speed of Shinkansen trains at a ""mere"" 320 km/h (200 mph) -- and some of its technology decades old -- Japan is now facing intense rivalry not only from European train giants France and Germany, but also China, whose 10,000-km (6,200 miles) ""gaotie"" track currently in operation is the world's longest high-speed rail network. It has become crucial for Japan to search for a new technology so as not to lose its title as a pioneer and leader of high-speed rail, and to drive billions of dollars in contracts. For Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the answer lies in maglev, or magnetic levitation, trains that can reach speeds of 506 km/h (315 mph). ""It is truly a dream technology,"" Abe said in a speech at the New York Stock Exchange in September. Maglevs use powerful electromagnets to float and propel a swiftly moving train above its tracks, eliminating metal friction. Japan currently holds the world speed record for a manned maglev train, hitting 581 km/h (361 mph) in 2003. High speeds, high costs . The costs for these next-generation trains are eye-watering. Japan expects to spend more than $100 billion on the recently announced proposal to build a maglev rail to run the 286-km distance between Tokyo and Nagoya. With 246 km, or 86% of the route, running through tunnels in the mountainous region -- a massively expensive undertaking -- there are concerns that the service, which is not due to operate until 2027, could become a high-speed white elephant. See more: 11 things to know before you go to Tokyo . Unlike previous bullet train projects, the private rail operator JR Tokai, which operates the Tokaido Shinkansen line, intends to shoulder the entire 9 trillion yen ($88.1 billion) cost of building the maglev line. It also has plans to extend the run from Tokyo to Osaka in 2045. Despite the dream of slashing the 100-minute journey between Tokyo and Nagoya down to 40 minutes and the 145-minute journey from Tokyo to Osaka to 67 minutes, the project is facing considerable skepticism. According to Japan's National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, by the time the first Tokyo-Osaka maglev glides down the track in 2045, Japan's population will have declined to 105 million from the current 127 million. Critics say there will simply not be enough demand for the high-speed service. ""Basically, JR Tokai is the most profitable train operator in Japan, but looking forward, a lot of their earnings will be used up for the capital expenditure in this project,"" says Paul Wan, transport analyst at CLSA in Hong Kong. ""That's the reason you're seeing some investors being pushed away by that -- especially by the very long time frame for this project to become operational."" See more: Japan's Kumano Kodo, world's best unknown hike . Even apart from the problem of demographics, Wan says that the Japan of 1964 -- when its economy was booming and its population was young and expanding -- was very different from the Japan of today. ""I can see why some people are quite negative on the project,"" he says. ""If you look at the Japan of the past 20 years, the economy has not really been growing -- it's been in a deflationary environment. At the same time the population is declining -- there just aren't enough babies there. ""Whether they will need such a service as the maglev in 30 years time is a big question mark."" Maglev between New York and Washington D.C.? Meanwhile, JR Tokai is also seeking to export maglev technology overseas. Last month, it held a maglev road show for U.S. politicians, taking them on a test ride in central Japan. With the offer of bankrolling billions of the operating costs for a maglev link between New York and Washington -- cutting the current three-hour journey down to one hour -- the company reasons that if the United States invests in its technology, then others will follow. See more: Japan's trains as safe as they are fast . For Abe, it might be a hard sell, but one that has received his full backing. ""Making use of this technology would connect New York and Washington, D.C., in less than an hour. It would free people from the congested roads that frazzle their nerves while saving not only 443,000 gallons of gasoline but also 682,000 hours of time that are now wasted annually,"" the Japanese leader told the New York Stock Exchange . ""In Japan, preparations are already well under way even now towards opening the Tokyo to Nagoya section. But before that, let's first connect Baltimore and Washington, D.C. I have already presented President Obama with a proposal to do exactly that."" Even with the sweetener -- which would involve Japan providing the maglev guideway and propulsion system free for the first portion of the New York to D.C. line, linking the U.S. capital and Baltimore -- doubts remain. ""For the U.S. it's all about jobs,"" says Wan. ""If the project provides enough work then it may invest."" ""The real test of whether Japan can export this technology will come (when) they actually have the maglev up and running rather than just talking about it.""

"(CNN) -- Last week, I had the honor to visit the Fast for Families tent on the national mall. The fasters welcomed me with open arms and a smile despite their struggle. The tent was full of messages of encouragement, expressions of admiration and symbols that remind every visitor of the reason for the fasters' sacrifice: the rights of immigrants and a House vote on the Senate immigration bill. Volunteers explained the meaning behind each symbol: a shoe they found abandoned in the desert represents the immigrants who lost their lives in search of a better life in the United States; the bottle of cough syrup that has a $75 price tag attached to it represents the many abuses -- physical and economic -- that immigrants suffer trying to come to this country. Several courageous fasters recalled their stories. Their strength, passion and commitment was clear. One story in particular hit close to home. Rosemarie Soto, an undocumented mother from Arizona who fasted for several days, explained that she constantly worries about being separated from her young children and not being able to see them again. As a mother, I can't imagine not being with my kids and not seeing them grow. Seeing Soto's pain and the fear in her eyes, and the love and sadness in her voice as she asked me in tears: ""Tell Speaker Boehner to give us a vote,"" overcame me with emotion. Fighting injustice is not a hobby. It's a way of life that requires commitment and unrelenting focus. The fasters embody this way of life and they represent millions of people who are struggling to keep their families together and be treated with dignity. The struggle of the immigrant community is our collective struggle. This is a humanitarian crisis that must be solved. Some have ended their fasts, some recently started. I intend to fight side by side with the fasters, every step of the way until the end, and encourage my Republican colleagues to consider the incredible sacrifice that these men and women have made for the immigrant community, and talk to the many families who are most affected by the GOP obstructionism. House Speaker John Boehner should make it a priority to do what's right for the 11 million undocumented people living in the United States, instead of caving into the GOP's extreme party politics. My Republican colleagues must simply allow a vote and stop standing in the way of immigration reform. So, as a mother and a lawmaker, I stand with the fasters calling on Boehner to lead, and help pass immigration reform. I challenge him to live up to the American people's expectations and to honor their wishes -- to stop listening to those in the Republican Party who oppose immigration reform and to do what is right. This is not a political issue, it's a human issue and delaying a vote is immoral. The fasters' silent sacrifice is sending a very loud and clear message, and their actions are inspiring thousands across the country -- including members of Congress -- to join them in fast. Their efforts won't be in vain. We will get this done. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Debbie Wasserman Schultz.","Debbie Wasserman Schultz visited tent where people are fasting for immigrants' rights .

"(CNN) -- On shaky, grainy video recordings, a group of men show off a stash of pills, pop open Budweiser tall boys and shoot dice for stacks of cash. One injects what appears to be heroin; another displays a large-caliber pistol, ejecting four bullets from the chamber to show that it's loaded. Here's the punchline: These guys are already in jail. The scenes were captured in 2009 on a camera smuggled into the House of Detention in New Orleans, a decrepit lockup pressed back into service after Hurricane Katrina. The video's release during a federal court hearing this week sparked a new demand by the city's mayor for the federal government to take over the Orleans Parish prison system and a round of I-told-you-sos by advocates for the inmates held there. In addition to the displays of contraband, the inmates in the now-shuttered facility show themselves dishing out soup from bins in grungy, overcrowded cells and sleeping on mattresses laid on floors. One holds up glue traps he says are used to catch nutria, a rat-like pest that has infested much of southern Louisiana and notes that the jail was supposed to have been closed. ""Why're we in here, then?"" he asks. ""ACLU investigated, and they told them it's closed down ... why're we in here?"" This week's hearings in U.S. District Court are part of a lawsuit filed against Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman. Attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center say Gusman's neglect led to ""brutal and inhumane conditions"" for inmates, many of whom are jailed for non-violent misdemeanor offenses. ""Hearing some of the testimony and looking at some of the video of the jail itself, I cannot imagine the conditions of any human being living in those conditions,"" James Hitzman, the father of an inmate who killed himself in the prison two years ago, told CNN affilliate WVUE. In a statement issued Tuesday, Gusman said he closed the House of Detention in 2012 because of its ""state of disrepair and abhorrent lack of proper security measures."" ""Following Hurricane Katrina, we were forced to reopen the House of Detention to house inmates, because other inmate facilities were destroyed by the floods. It was never meant to be a long-term solution,"" Gusman said. ""In addition, we have been using eight temporary tents to house inmates. These facilities were never meant to be used this long for these purposes."" U.S. District Judge Lance Africk is weighing whether to approve a settlement with the sheriff's office that would require the parish to provide appropriate housing, protection and medical care for inmates. But New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu called for a federal receiver to be put in control of the jail after the release of the video, which he said was turned up by the city's lawyers. ""It is now clearer than ever that the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office is not keeping the prison secure and our city safe,"" Landrieu said in a statement. ""The people of the city are investing over $226 million to build new prison facilities and over $30 million each year in the taxpayer money to operate the jail. I cannot in good conscience cut vital services or raise taxes to put even more money into an office where waste, fraud, and abuse run rampant."" CNN's Karan Olson and Jake Carpenter contributed to this report.","A 2009 video shows Orleans Parish inmates using drugs in squalid cells .

"(CNN) -- On Friday, AOL chief Tim Armstrong apparently fired AOL Patch.com Creative Director Abel Lenz during a conference call with some 1,000 employees listening. The CEO was explaining changes at Patch that would reduce the number of sites in its local news network from 900 to 600. During the call, according to a number of sources, Armstrong told Lenz to put his camera down and then, in the same breath, told him he was fired. Then Armstrong resumed his conference call. It's hard to know from the audio of his remarks -- which rocketed around online after the incident, drawing mainly derision and shock -- the complete circumstances of the exchange. On the face of it, though, it didn't sound so good. Was it good leadership? One of the top capabilities for adults in leadership roles is the ability to manage emotions even under the most trying circumstances. This self-awareness and self-management is part of being emotionally intelligent. Leaders' behavior has tremendous impact on others. Not only does it affect morale and productivity, it also provides the behavioral model for others who look up to the person in power. CEOs more than most have to manage the elegant balance of communicating tough messages in a straightforward manner but with a respectful style. They are representing themselves and the culture of their organizations to the world. There was a better way for Armstrong to have expressed his frustration at Lenz. Armstrong was conducting a conference call to a huge number of employees, and he was trying to deliver a tough message to them. No doubt Lenz's taking photos of him during this call irritated and might have distracted Armstrong from his focused message. As humans, we all get stressed, have rough days and get triggered emotionally by the behavior of others. In fact, those of us with the highest standards of performance tend to have the strongest reactions. But that doesn't give license for us to react impulsively. Would we say to a colleague who is talking nonsense: ""You are stupid?"" Likely not. If we needed to convey dissatisfaction with an employee's conduct, we do it privately so as not to humiliate the colleague and make ourselves appear heartless to others. At the same time, Armstrong had the right to feel annoyed. He was trying to give a difficult talk. What should he have done? Remembering his role as a leader, he should have sternly told Lenz his behavior was distracting and that if he didn't stop, there would be consequences. If Lenz became insubordinate, Armstrong should not have lost his temper but should have made a decision to deal with the behavior at a later time. And that's after he did his due diligence with his human resources department. And he would advise Lenz that a confrontation was not productive while he was conducting a conference call, but that there would be discussions in private. The outcome might have been the same but would have seemed to follow from reasonable judgment and not a knee-jerk emotional reaction. I don't know the CEO in question and his relationship with the employee. There may be much more going on than we know at this point. But given Armstrong's leadership role, I would coach him to be accountable for what may have appeared to the listeners to be impulsive behavior and to do some damage control. Most people are forgiving when they know their leaders are human. But they respect and are inspired by the leader who demonstrates humility, accountability and willingness to admit and learn from mistakes.

"(CNN) -- There is a man in South Carolina who has been keeping a big secret for the past five days. Well, he did tell his dog. And, we assume, his wife. He's probably hoping his recent good fortune stays a secret, but this will be one mighty hard life-changing event to keep under wraps. South Carolina lottery officials said a man showed up at their office Monday with the winning ticket to last Wednesday's $399.4 million Powerball jackpot. In a news release, lottery officials said the man was from the Columbia area. And that's it. They didn't say how old he was or give his name. South Carolina doesn't divulge the identities of lottery winners to the public if they don't want it to be known. Officials did say he told them he was driving home when his wife called and told him they needed hot dog buns. So he pulled into a Murphy USA convenience store but there were no buns. There was a sign for the lottery, so -- for only the second time -- he played, putting down a $20. On Thursday, he was at home with just his dog when he checked the numbers. And he had the ticket with the winning numbers: 7, 10, 22, 32, 35 and Powerball 19. One that flies in the face of the formidable 1-in-175,223,510 odds. Powerball trio strikes it rich with $448 million jackpot . The Murphy store will receive a cool $50,000 for selling the ticket. The release didn't say whether the man chose a 29-year annuity plan or took a cash prize of $223 million. Wednesday's haul was the fourth largest lottery price in U.S. history, the biggest prize ever in South Carolina. The biggest payload in American history was $665 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. The greatest Powerball jackpot was the $590.5 million won with a single ticket in Florida this past May. So now people in Columbia might be a whole lot nicer to each other. After all, you never know if that guy you just served dinner to is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Why you keep playing the lottery .","Lottery officials say it is a man from the Columbia area of South Carolina .

"Washington (CNN) -- Millions of phone calls have been made. Thousands of yard signs are posted on Badger State lawns. Television ads blanket the Wisconsin airwaves. All of this frenetic activity in Tuesday's gubernatorial recall in Wisconsin comes at an unprecedented price tag: Upward of $63 million, and that doesn't take into account money raised the last three weeks that hasn't been registered yet. ""When we come up with a final tally for this race, it's going to be in the $70 (million) to $80 million range,"" predicted Mike McCabe, who runs Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan campaign watchdog group. Walker's fate comes down to ground game . The money raised in the recall already shatters Wisconsin's record of $37 million, set just 18 months ago when Republican Gov. Scott Walker was first elected. It's a mind-blowing amount of money, especially for a state as small and inexpensive politically as Wisconsin. Recall vote is judgment day for Wisconsin governor . ""This is way out of proportion to a state this size,"" said McCabe, sitting in his Madison office surrounded by workers entering a continuous stream of fund-raising data onto his group's website. What's also out of proportion: Walker has raised 7Â½ times that of his Democratic challenger, Tom Barrett. To date, Barrett has raised just under $4 million. Walker has pulled in $30.5 million. That wide disparity can be attributed in part to a quirk in the election law. Public officials in Wisconsin who are targeted for a recall are allowed to raised unlimited sums of money until the recall is formally set. In Walker's case, that was March. So a lot of rich Republicans, seeing the Wisconsin recall battle as a preview of the presidential race, wrote Walker huge checks. What's at stake in Wisconsin? Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks gave Walker more than $500,000. Texan Bob Perry, who bankrolled the infamous 2004 ""Swift Boat"" attacks against John Kerry, also contributed half of $1 million directly to Walker. Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and Michigan millionaire Dick DeVos each donated $250,000. In fact, 70% of Walker's donations in the last month came from outside Wisconsin -- hundreds of thousands of contributors large and small from all over the country. Phil Prange has raised money for Wisconsin Republicans for 25 years. He said when former GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson was on the ballot in 2000, he had 50,000 people on his donor list. ""It was actually controversial,"" Prange said. Walker's list of at least 250,000 dwarfs that one. Prange remembers potential donors laughing at him when he tried to raise money from out of state for a Wisconsin political campaign. ""Anything over $100 was a hard ask. Now apparently you can ask for a million dollars and get it in the same moment, which is amazing,"" Prange said. He said he knew things were different with the recall when he went to a party in Chicago several months ago and met people from Arizona, Florida, Texas and Massachusetts who had already contributed to help Walker beat back the recall. ""I was shocked,"" Prange recalled. Individual contributions only tell part of the story of big bucks in Wisconsin's recall. Outside groups supporting both candidates flooded the state with some $25 million. They look like a who's who of Washington special interests --- from Planned Parenthood to the National Rifle Association. When the dollars are tallied up in this category, Democratic outside groups supporting Barrett will have outspent those backing Walker. Labor unions, which have an enormous stake in the recall since the backlash against Walker began when he all but did away with collective bargaining rights for public employees, have given $8 million in traceable donations to help Barrett. It's likely unions have given much more to Democratic groups not required to disclose their donors. Opinion: Fix, don't destroy, public worker unions . The Republican Governors Association is another big contributor -- at least $9 million, including $1 million from GOP high roller David Koch. These groups register and advertise with names that appear to be homegrown. We are Wisconsin is organized and funded mostly by national unions in Washington. Right Direction Wisconsin is really an arm of the Republican Governors Association. Then there are the stealth super PACS whose donors are anonymous. They have given $8.5 million. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign lists eight such groups on its website. Most, such as Americans for Prosperity and the Club for Growth, are groups on the right trying to help Walker. One, Greater Wisconsin Committee, is trying to help push Walker out. Again, the donors are anonymous. ""Elections are being poisoned here, but the people of Wisconsin can't know who is paying for most of the poison,"" McCabe said. The irony is that despite the tens of millions raised and spent on the recall election, it is an open question whether it will make a real difference. Wisconsin's electorate is so polarized, that public and party polls suggest most people's minds are already made up. What both parties agree on, however, is that the extra campaign cash does help where it matters most: identifying voters and making sure they get to the polls on Election Day.","To date, Gov.

"Toronto (CNN) -- Jenna Talackova, the 23-year-old woman who forced Donald Trump and his Miss Universe Canada pageant to end its ban on transgender contestants, fell short of the national title Saturday night at the pageant in Toronto. The crown went to Sahar Biniaz, an Indian-born, Iranian-raised actress from Vancouver. Biniaz, 26, will represent Canada at the Miss Universe pageant in December, according to the Miss Universe Canada website. Talackova refused to speak to the media after the competition, but Biniaz said Talackova had congratulated her on her win backstage. Biniaz added that she admired Talackova for having the courage to compete in the pageant. In a CNN interview hours before showtime, the 6-foot-1 Talackova seemed a bit weary, as the spotlight was still squarely on her gender transformation. From beauty pageants to college sports, transgender people break barriers . ""Like I always say, my family didn't understand, so why would I expect anybody else to understand? And then they got to know me and they loved me,"" Talackova said. But on Sunday, she told CNN the pageant was ""an amazing experience."" Asked if she thought her transgender status affected the judges' decision, she said, ""Who's to say? I think I worked very hard. All of us ladies worked so hard and we gave it our best shot. The judges see something in those top five, and that's fine. I wouldn't have changed anything."" She didn't walk away from the pageant empty-handed. In addition to finishing among the top 12 semi-finalists, Talackova tied with three other contestants for the title of Miss Congeniality. ""I'm a little tired, but I'm not down,"" she said Sunday. ""For a couple of seconds, I was a little bummed out, but after, like, a couple of minutes I was just extremely happy. I was so proud of myself. I made sure I did my best performance."" How much should gender matter? Talackova was born a boy with the name Walter, but she said she felt more like a girl by age 4. By 14, Talackova convinced her family that she should start taking steps to physically become a woman, she said. She began hormone therapy as a teenager and had gender reassignment surgery four years ago, when she was 19. It was then she pursued her dream of competing in a pageant. But her gender history meant she was disqualified from the Miss Universe Canada competition for not being a ""natural born woman."" Talackova then hired women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred, and the pageant's co-owner, Donald Trump, was left with no choice but to change the rules and let Talackova compete. Donald Trump vs. Gloria Allred: Transgender beauty battle . ""I'm not interested in having arguments with Donald Trump. I'm here to focus on Jenna and what she has won,"" Allred told CNN after Thursday's preliminary competition. ""And it's been extremely important, and it really is a civil rights victory. And she has earned the right to claim that victory."" Talackova said Sunday she's never told her story fully on her own terms, ""but I let (people) know a lot about myself thus far. I did come out with my statement, and that's that people should embrace their individuality and follow their dreams, like I did."" Talackova said earlier her entry in the competition is about equality, even if some believe pageants are demeaning. ""The power that you get for having the crown -- you can inspire so many people,"" she said. ""So if I have to walk in a bikini for that, I will.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The director of the Puerto Rico office for the federal housing agency has been indicted on 40 counts of corruption, federal prosecutors announced Thursday. He is accused of spending his time shopping and running errands for his family restaurant instead of working, they said. Michael Colón, director of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development office based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was supposed to have been supervising 79 employees in the Caribbean, including the Virgin Islands, according to the U.S. attorney's office for Puerto Rico. However, according to the federal indictment returned by a San Juan grand jury, Colón was not doing his job. ""The defendant claimed to have been working, when in truth and in fact he was doing non-work-related errands, including, among other things, shopping at Sam's Club, Costco, and Ralph's Food Warehouse to purchase groceries,"" said a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez Velez. She said the indictment alleges that for more than a year Colón routinely shopped and unloaded the groceries at a restaurant he owned until he recently sold it to his daughter. If convicted, Colón could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 .","Michael Colón indicted on 40 counts of corruption, federal prosecutors announced .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul announced last week that he is taking legal action against President Barack Obama for ""snooping on the American people."" Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Bernard Saunders has asked new questions in recent days to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) about whether it has spied on elected U.S. officials, including in Congress. These related developments underline that the controversies over the NSA have become perhaps the biggest issue in the President's in-tray following months of damaging revelations, from Edward Snowden, about U.S. surveillance programs -- both domestically and internationally. With the disclosures doing considerable damage to the reputation of the United States in general, and particular harm to the NSA, and individual U.S. technology firms, the President is keen to try to try to draw a line in the sand in the new year. Over Christmas, Obama spent much time during his Hawaii vacation reviewing reform options, including the 46 recommended in December by the independent White House Panel. And, he has promised a ""definitive statement"" in coming days on reforms to the NSA. The President has already talked positively about some of the independent panel's recommendations, including halting the NSA's collection and storage of millions of U.S. phone records and instead requiring phone firms to hold this data. However, it remains unclear how sweeping the entire package of changes will be, nor how well received they will by U.S. and international publics. While the White House is determined to move off the defensive on this issue, this will not be helped by the continuing flood of publicity that surrounds the NSA. Moreover, barring an amnesty for Snowden from Obama, it is also probable that there will be further damaging revelations from the former government contractor that help keep the issue in the spotlight. The likelihood of further disclosures is underlined by the estimate that Snowden has leaked only a small fraction so far of the material about the NSA that he has in his possession. This highlights one of the fundamental issues underlying the Snowden affair: what it reveals about the changing map of influence and power in a world that continues to be transformed by economic globalization and the information revolution, including the rise of ""big data"" enabled by digital technology. To date, these forces have generally reinforced U.S. international pre-eminence for several reasons, including the country's relative technological edge over much of the rest of the world (which will decrease over time); the fact that its dominant culture and ideas are very close to prevailing global norms; and that its multiple channels of communication help to frame global issues. However, this emerging environment has simultaneously raised new challenges, and not just for the United States. For instance, the potential for sensitive leaks, and technological advances that have led to vast increases in open source information for publics, has fueled skepticism of government information and actions. Indeed, governments increasingly compete for international credibility not just with their foreign counterparts, but also ""new"" actors such as media outlets like Al-Jazeera, and other organizations like WikiLeaks. Sensitive disclosures, and/ or information that is perceived to be manipulated or propaganda, can undermine the credibility of a country and/or its government. In the context of the Snowden allegations, key dangers for Washington are not just potential backlash from international publics. But also foreign elites (even strong allies like those in Germany) proving more cautious in sharing information and cooperation. Looking specifically at the campaign against terrorism, the Snowden affair thus intensifies the global diplomacy challenge that Barack Obama faces five years into his presidency. While the President is still quite popular personally in many countries, international favourability towards the country and U.S. policies is now generally in reverse. For instance, among the 22 countries surveyed by Pew Global in both 2009 (the first year of Obama's presidency) and 2013 approval of US international policies has dropped by about 20% or more in six states, including China, Indonesia, Argentina, and Egypt. In many other countries (including Canada, Russia, Britain, Poland, France, Turkey, Jordan, and Japan), the fall-off is over 10% over the same period. U.S. use of drone strikes on suspected terrorists, in particular, is widely unpopular internationally. More than half of the populations, in almost all countries surveyed by Pew Global in 2013, were opposed to continued use of these unmanned combat aerial vehicles. The public diplomacy challenge facing the United States is particularly grave, right now, in the Middle East where support for the campaign on terrorism is especially important. However, only an alarming 11% of the population in Pakistan, 14% in Jordan, 16% in Egypt and the Palestinian territories, and 21% in Turkey, currently have favorable views toward the United States according to Pew Global. It is important that the Obama team begins to turn this climate of opinion around. This is because, in common with the Cold War, the challenges posed by the campaign against terrorism simply cannot be overcome by military might alone. Thus, Washington must redouble its efforts to win the battle for international ""hearts and minds."" This will help create an enabling (rather than disabling) environment facilitating both covert and overt cooperation and information sharing with U.S. officials. To be sure, some countries will continue to assist Washington because of factors such as self interest and/or fundamental agreement with U.S. strategy and policy. However, the degree to which other states do so, especially in crucial theaters like the Middle East and Asia, will often depend heavily upon a mixture of the attractiveness amongst foreign publics, and the degree of trust and support within national elites, of the United States in general and the Obama administration in particular. It would be a tragedy if these relationships become critically damaged by the Snowden affair.

"(CNN) -- The Pakistan Taliban has vowed to carry out revenge attacks on the national government after appointing a new leader following the death of their former chief in a U.S. drone strike. The terrorist group's new leader, Maulana Fazlullah, is a longtime militia commander possibly linked to the assassination attempt on teenage activist Malala Yousafzai. His elevation to the head of the extremist organization was announced Thursday. The grim warning to the Pakistani government came the same day from Asmatullah Shaheen, who served as interim leader before Fazlullah's appointment. Shaheen said the group would seek revenge against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his government for the death of former leader Hakimullah Mehsud, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in northwestern Pakistan last week. The initial focus of the attacks,he said, would be Punjab, Sharif's home province and political stronghold. ""All areas will come under attack but Punjab will come first,"" Shaheen said. Punjab is Pakistan's most populous province. He blamed Sharif for turning Pakistan into a ""colony"" of the United States and for Mehsud's death. Shaheen said that proposed peace talks with the government are now off the table. There were never truly talks between the two sides, he said, and there never will be. The Pakistani government didn't respond to requests from CNN for comment on the matter. Afghan President criticizes U.S. drone strike that killed Pakistani Taliban leader . Fazlullah, the new leader, is yet to make his own public statement following his elevation. He once led a Pakistan Taliban militia in the country's Swat region. The Pakistani military drove Fazlullah's group out of Pakistan in 2009, forcing it to operate from Afghanistan. Pakistani military sources said Fazlullah is believed to be in Afghanistan and is also believed to have been ordering attacks in Pakistan from there. Swat, in northwestern Pakistan, was where militants shot and wounded teen activist Malala in October 2012 as she was riding home from school in a van. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, and the Pakistani Interior Minister at the time, Rehman Malik, linked Fazlullah to the attack on Malala. Fazlullah is known as a hard-liner who broadcast fiery sermons and hard-line ideology via an extremist radio station, earning him the nickname ""Mullah Radio."" The station was shut down when he was pushed out of Pakistan. The group's Central Shura Council picked Fazlullah, along with a new deputy leader, Sheikh Khalid Haqqani.

"(CNN) -- From around the world, condolences and offers of support have washed tragedy-ravaged Newtown, Connecticut, with wave after wave of sympathy from people trying somehow, some way, to reach out, to help, to comfort. On Christmas Day, thanks to a grassroots effort by their fellow law enforcement brethren in nearby communities, Newtown's police officers will be the recipients of a rare gift in their profession -- a holiday off, for the entire force. ""Patrol officers and sworn personnel will be given the day off to be home on Christmas. Officers from surrounding towns will be patrolling Newtown,"" police Sgt. Steve Santucci of Newtown told CNN. Newtown police have been working nonstop since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14. The school shooting claimed the lives of 20 children and six faculty members, leaving a close-knit community -- and its police force -- still reeling 10 days later. ""When something like this happens ... it's a police thing. We'll always try to help out neighboring towns. Any time there's a tragedy, we'll try our best to lend a helping hand,"" said Lt. Bob Kozlowsky of the Shelton, Connecticut, police department. Kozlowsky's department is among those that have helped in the Newtown force in the days since the shooting -- days with a seemingly endless procession of funerals, with families trying to bear up under unbearable mountains of grief. Days with police work still to be done. ""We've sent officers, dispatchers, and even our chief of police has gone to Newtown to help out. We've helped with dispatching, traffic, miscellaneous calls. Our chief of police has gone to assist their chief of police with administrative duties."" Amid a world elsewhere of holiday festivities but with one community in Connecticut lost in shock and mourning, officers from towns with names such as Monroe, Brookfield, Danbury, Bethel and Milford have given Newtown the gift of their time and their work. On Christmas Day, those neighborly officers will take to the streets of Newtown again. For a time, for a day, it can be Christmas for the officers of Newtown and their families. ""It's important to help out,"" said Officer Jeffrey Nielsen of the Milford police department. ""We'll continue to provide help as long as they need it."" CNN's Laura Ly in New York contributed to this report.","Newtown police have worked nonstop since the Sandy Hook school shooting .

"(CNN) -- Prince William went back to school this week. To Cambridge University, to be precise, where he will undertake a tailor-made, 10-week course in agricultural management. When he completes the course, new father William won't have earned a degree; he won't walk out with a doctorate or a masters; in fact he won't receive any formal qualifications at all, but he will have gained a beginner's knowledge of how to manage the Duchy of Cornwall Estate -- a vast Â£760 million (about $1.25 billion) entity established in 1337 to provide a private income for use by the reigning monarch's eldest son, which William will inherit when Prince Charles becomes King. As with most matters relating to the monarchy his enrollment has had a polarizing effect: the news was met with staunch criticism amid a smattering of praise, with some university students declaring he'd been given a ""free pass"" because of his royal status. Others went so far as to describe his admittance as an ""insult"" to those already studying at Cambridge. Not surprisingly, people have been quick to jump on the critical band wagon without taking a moment to actually understand exactly what it is he's doing at the university. But since when has receiving further education of any description been something negative? The type of course William is undertaking is open to pretty much anyone who has the money to pay for it -- land owners, company executives, the posh set. Is it an elitist course? Perhaps. But who could argue that William does not hold an elite position? Entry for this particular program is not reliant on past grades or previous academic records. Professor Ross Anderson of Cambridge University's Computer Laboratory told the Cambridge News: ""Whether they have any A-levels at all is no more relevant than the price of tea in China."" William's course was organized by the Cambridge Program for Sustainability Leadership (CPSL), whose patron is the Prince of Wales, himself a former Cambridge graduate. Charles has been clear regarding his concerns for the welfare of Britain's countryside, and it would appear William is keen to educate himself and continue his father's mission. Surely it is better that he learn how to do it properly of his own initiative than screw it up down the line because his A-level results didn't live up to the Cambridge ideal. It's no secret that William would like to delay leading a full royal life for as long as possible. That may be hard to comprehend for those slogging away to make ends meet on the minimum wage, but perhaps understandable given that there is no retirement age in a job that calls for a lifetime of service to crown and country. Rather than attending lectures and seminars and writing essays on economics and land economy, I expect William would rather bolt to Mustique with the Middleton family in the coming weeks for what has become something of a traditional winter break -- as would many of the hoi polloi, no doubt. But having completed service in all three branches of the British military, performed his first investiture on behalf of the Queen, and represented the Queen for the first time at a State visit, William is now preparing more extensively for the role he will one day fulfill. His royal engagements have been stepped up, and he and the Duchess of Cambridge will undertake a tour to Australia and New Zealand in April. Furthering his education is the natural next step. Personally I would rather see William fork over private funds in preparation for his future role than squander said funds on Treasure Chest cocktails at Mahiki, the royals' perennial favorite nightclub. Wherever there are fortunes and family firms, there are heirs to fortunes and family firms. The children of both Richard Branson and Donald Trump have joined their respective family businesses and done exceptionally well. Why? Because they learned their trade beforehand. Others have enjoyed all the benefits of wealth and a globally-recognized family name only to stumble out of nightclubs and make sex tapes. Surely it can only be a good thing that William has gone back to school. His course is being paid for privately, not through the public purse. He's putting in the work, and ultimately the British countryside stands to benefit from what he learns. I imagine Oxford would have been mighty chuffed to have a second heir to the throne walking its hallowed halls. The city of Cambridge is certain to enjoy a rise in tourism due to its famous pupil. Interest in the university itself will increase, and perhaps inquiries about higher education in general will spike. To me, it seems perfectly fitting that the Duke of Cambridge actually attend Cambridge. He could have hightailed it to Cambridge, Massachusetts, of course -- but then people really would be up in arms. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Victoria Arbiter.","Prince William began an agricultural management course at Cambridge University .

"(CNN) -- We hear that a lot of young people don't care or worry about the economy and finances. But take it from a 23-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter: They do and should care. Kelly Evans, 23, is an economics reporter for The Wall Street Journal. Kelly Evans started as an economics reporter at the paper as the economy started getting bad a year and a half ago. She has since seen the resilience of the people in her generation as they adapt to a changing job market. CNN's Nicole Lapin talked to Evans about what young people should be doing to deal with the tough times. The following is an edited transcript of the interview: . Nicole Lapin: What do you tell young people to make economic news relevant to them?  Watch the entire interview with Kelly Evans » . Kelly Evans: We really, really do try to explain to people, past some of the language and the jargon, to say that economics is really about what's happening: your job, your income, demographics, poverty rates, and what it looks like across the country. There are some terms that may seem unfamiliar, but I think if you sit down and read through our coverage, you'll see that a lot of it makes sense. I feel very proud of the fact that over the last year, year and a half, a lot of the articles that I've written and a lot of the articles that we've written as an economics team have done a lot to point out the risks out there so that this didn't just come out of nowhere. Lapin: So what are some of the things that young people should really focus on? Is it a 401(k)? Is it savings? Is it a combination of the two, perhaps? Evans: Well, I think for most young people, the big thing right now is a career or a job path. Whether you're in high school or you're in college, you're thinking, ""What am I going to do when I get out? Do I want to be a doctor, or a lawyer?"" I think less people want to be in banking than did a few years ago, and so I'm curious as a reporter what is perceived to be the golden ticket nowadays. Certainly health care, education are some of the more reliable places to go right now. So what I would say mostly is make sure you're in a good financial position. Do whatever you can for yourself. But really make sure you're investing in your education or skills, maybe the language skills in particular, that will be really important down the road. I think that ends up paying off in human capital. It's really important. Lapin: What kind of tips do you give to youngsters who are about to get out of school? Evans: I would encourage people who are looking at colleges to ignore the brand name and really go with what is going to be the best value to you.","Kelly Evans is an economics reporter for The Wall Street Journal .

"(CNN) -- A Florida woman allegedly shot her daughter to death Monday night because she thought the person knocking on her door was the boyfriend she had just fought, police said Tuesday. Witnesses told police they heard a gunshot and saw Adele Bing cradling Ruby Bing, 25, in her arms crying ""Baby girl, don't die."" ""How could I look my grandkids in their face and say I killed their mother?"" Bing, 52, told the officers who arrested her. ""Y'all can lock me away for good."" Bing is jailed on a charge of second degree murder in the death of her only daughter, according to Winter Haven, Florida, police. The mother also faces a charge of child abuse without great bodily harm because her daughter was holding her 4-month-old baby -- the shooting suspect's granddaughter -- in her arms when the shot was fired. The elder Bing, who was ""still upset"" about a ""heated argument"" with boyfriend James Lane earlier in the day, had ""a baseball bat in her left hand and a .22-caliber pistol in her right hand"" when she opened her door at 8:47 p.m. Monday, police said. She told police it was ""a f--ked up accident"" because she thought it was Lane, 39, who was ""banging and kicking on her front door,"" according to the police report obtained by CNN. ""As she opened the door, a shot was fired, hitting her daughter in the upper chest,"" the police release said. ""The 4 month-old was not injured. Ruby Bing died at the scene.""

"(CNN) -- The recent discoveries of a stunning trove of new vertebrate species from the Cape Melville area of northeast Queensland, Australia, show that we still have a lot to learn about life on this planet. Even though no place on Earth can be described as ""pristine"" any longer, these creatures live in habitats that have been relatively little disturbed. They include a spectacular gecko and a frog whose eggs develop without a tadpole stage. New frogs from heavily explored Australia are somewhat surprising (there are now 239 species, with 25 added in the last 10 years). New species are more likely to turn up in less-explored and more humid lands such as New Guinea. Papua New Guinea, 6% the size of Australia, has 349 species of amphibians, 123 described in the last 10 years. But even with these discoveries, amphibians as a group are widely recognized to be in deep trouble. In a 2004 assessment, scientists sought to evaluate as many of the 5,743 known amphibian species as possible. (About 23% of them, likely to be among the most threatened, were not evaluated because of lack of accurate information.) Of those evaluated, 43% were declining and 33% were globally threatened with extinction. The situation has only worsened since. Habitat destruction, new infectious diseases, introduced species (such as the cane toad in Australia), and climate change, among many other factors, all have been implicated. Even so, more than 1,600 new species of amphibians have been discovered and described since 2005, including 125 in 2013 so far. How can this paradox be explained? The reports of amphibian declines, starting about 1990, stimulated many young biologists to pursue careers in biodiversity research. A new wave of field biologists spread out over the globe to many of the last wild places on Earth. At the same time, increased sophistication in species detection developed in laboratories -- involving analysis of DNA, tadpole and larvae anatomy and mating calls recorded in the field -- have enabled scientists to determine that superficially similar creatures should be named as new species. New journals and online publications, like Zootaxa and ZooKeys, enable rapid publication of results and formal descriptions of new species, once a long and tedious process. The latest discoveries should not make us complacent. In no way do they replace or make up for those lost. Among the recently extinct species are such unusual species as the stomach-brooding frogs of eastern Australia and the golden toad of Costa Rica, with their unique life histories. And most, but not all, of the new discoveries are members of taxa with large numbers of similar species, and few novel lineages are being found. Most of the newly discovered species are also known from single places or from small geographic ranges and often in habitats that are at great risk of being changed or destroyed. These ""lost worlds"" are still in danger of being lost. The biodiversity crisis is very real, and many of the new species of all taxa are themselves at risk. Nevertheless, the discoveries remind us of the richness of biodiversity on this planet and just how far we have to go in our race to catalog life on Earth before it is too late. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Wake.","David Wake: Discovery of trove of new species in Australia exciting, unexpected, instructive .

"(CNN) -- Ukraine's FC Dnipro earned a 1-0 victory over English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur as the knockout stages of the Europa League got underway on Thursday. Yevhen Konoplyanka scored from the penalty spot nine minutes from the end to hand the Ukrainian Premier League side a priceless lead ahead of next week's return leg at White Hart Lane. The first leg at the Dnipro Arena was played in front of a sparse crowd following the terrible violence that has taken place in recent days on the streets of the capital Kiev, 280 miles (450 km) northwest. A national day of mourning was declared on Thursday following the loss of dozens of lives in anti-government protests.

"(CNN) -- Mitt Romney's strong debate performance and his apology for his callous remarks deriding 47% of the American public appear to be moving his poll numbers up in some states. But Romney's reinvigorated campaign is unlikely to move black voters. Black support is at 0%, according to a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll (PDF) reported in late summer. The reasons for this may have powerful implications for the future of black political strength in presidential elections. It's worth recognizing that the unwillingness of black voters to offer any measurable support for the Republican presidential candidate is unprecedented. It's not enough to say that blacks are voting for President Obama because he's black and that racial solidarity trumps politics. Or to note that black voters are overwhelmingly affiliated with the Democratic Party. Sen. John McCain and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin ran against a considerably more charismatic and untarnished Obama -- who was still black in 2008. McCain received 4% of the black vote. Black voters offered measurable levels of support to George W. Bush, 8% in 2000 and 11% in 2004; Ronald Reagan, 11%; and even Richard Nixon, 18%. Opinion: Romney's foreign policy twilight zone . One of the reasons African-American voters do not support Romney is that they see the Republican Party's treatment of Obama, from the first weeks of his presidency, as an assault on a kind of racial collective dignity. This includes remarks such as GOP trash-talker John Sununu's description of the first black president of the United States as ""lazy"" after his poor debate performance. It may seem like a long time ago to most Americans that Obama gave his first post-State of the Union speech before a joint session of Congress. But for many African-Americans, it seems like yesterday that the shaky credibility of the Republican Party began its final downward slide. What we now know as the ""you lie"" moment, when Republican Rep. Joe Wilson actually heckled the president of the United States, will one day be remembered as a watershed moment in racial politics. Only the immediate, fierce and united Republican condemnation of Wilson could have possibly mitigated the effect of that moment on millions of African-Americans. That kind of condemnation did not happen. Interactive: Racial voting bloc . At its very core, racism has always been experienced as an attack on dignity. Whether it was referring to a black man as ""boy"" or to black women by their first names, exiled to the back of the bus or to a separate water fountain, racism was a daily indignity for many early 20th-century blacks. Segregation itself was an attack on dignity. The idea that the very presence of blacks would sully white schools, lunch counters or hotels struck at the dignity of blacks as human beings and fellow Americans. The civil rights movement worked to bring about economic and political power, to be sure. But at the core of those rights was that people be treated with dignity and respect. So when the Harvard-educated, eloquent, high-minded first black president of the United States is heckled in front of his wife by a member of Congress during a nationally televised speech, it is a game-changing moment for millions of blacks. Rather than an isolated event, the Wilson affair was followed by other affronts, both big and small. Republican leadership's priority of ensuring Obama's failure in office. The refusal of formerly moderate Republicans to stand by positions they had advocated in the past in order to isolate the president. Parental protests against Obama's desire to send a message about studying and working hard to schoolchildren before the first day of school in 2009. Arizona State University refusing to give the Columbia and Harvard-educated president of the United States an honorary degree. The rise of the tea party and the Republicans' cowardly refusal to call out racist elements in the movement. The video image of a tea party advocate apparently spitting on a black congressman. Tea partiers and others who bring weapons to events marked by vitriolic anti-Obama rhetoric. The entire ""birther"" movement and the ongoing attacks on Obama's legitimacy and nationality. The bumper sticker that reads ""Don't Re-Nig."" Opinion: Romney's sorta-kinda call to arms . Each of these affronts was directed at Obama -- but was experienced viscerally and personally by millions of black voters. The phenomenon is not easily reversible, at least not in the short term. It could even get worse: National Republican Party strategists might ramp up racial appeals to increase white voter turnout, efforts such as Romney's ""welfare president"" TV campaign and the party's crude efforts to suppress the black vote with voter I.D. laws. In effect, having fully alienated black voters, the Republican Party may now see its only option as doubling down in an effort to increase the voting strength of white voters. It's a cynical ploy, to be sure, but it explains Karl Rove's recent assessment of the vote in Indiana. And it may explain why the chairman of the Republican Party insists on invoking the image of Obama as a stick-up kid who ""stole"" millions of dollars from Medicare ""to fund Obamacare"" and whom Republicans should ""prosecute."" The ironic result is that the election of the first black president may well have moved us further back in removing race from politics than forward. What will this mean? For the immediate future, we should expect Republican partisan politics to be fronted by an increasingly no-holds-barred use of racial appeals, particularly in places where Rove and like-minded strategists believe that working-class whites can still be manipulated by race. This will also mean stirring up hostility to policies that have been successfully racially identified in the minds of many working class white, male voters. These include welfare, criminal justice reform, support for cities and for public schools. Until Election Day, we won't know whether the Republican Party assault on the president's dignity will translate into passionate black voter turnout for Obama. But what is certain is that black voters have collectively cut ties with the ""Party of Lincoln."" Instead, for blacks, the 21st-century Republican Party may one day be remembered as the party of Joe Wilson. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sherrilyn Ifill.","NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found black support at 0% for Mitt Romney .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Twelve ordinary people, some too young to remember when Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal were Hollywood's golden couple, will now decide who owns an Andy Warhol portrait of the iconic blond beauty. Warhol painted two portraits of Fawcett in 1980, after her breakout role on the TV hit series ""Charlie's Angels"" made her America's ""It Girl."" The question before the jury of six men and six women: Did Warhol give one portrait to O'Neal -- the Oscar-nominated star of ""Love Story"" -- or did he give them both to Fawcett? The actress, who was 62 when she died of cancer in 2009, left all her artwork to the University of Texas, where she studied before being discovered by Hollywood. The university, which already has one of the portraits, is suing O'Neal for the other. He is countersuing for a tablecloth covered with hearts and signed by Warhol. A portrait of the final days of Farrah Fawcett . Jurors received the case at 2:40 p.m. PT Monday after hearing closing arguments from attorneys for both sides. The disputed portrait hangs over O'Neal's bed in his Malibu beach house. He removed it from Fawcett's Los Angeles condo a few days after she died, with permission from her estate's trustee. David Beck, a lawyer for the university, asked jurors to honor Fawcett's wishes as expressed in a will leaving the university ""all artwork and objects of art."" He alleged that O'Neal helped himself to the Warhol after learning she had left him nothing. ""Farrah Fawcett decided to leave all of her artwork to the University of Texas. We didn't even know about it. They're trying to get you to make Ryan O'Neal a beneficiary of her trust. ""Please, please speak for Farrah because she can't speak for herself,"" Beck urged. But O'Neal's lawyer, Marty Singer, countered that the university was being greedy. He told jurors that Fawcett's original artwork still sits unseen in storage ""in some basement catacomb."" The Warhol the university received after her death wasn't shown publicly until earlier this year, he added. ""This is an important case for Ryan O'Neal. This is not just a lawsuit about a painting. This is his life. This painting has been in his life for more than 30 years. Farrah Fawcett was the love of his life,"" Singer said. ""I hope that everyone here that is entrusted with this decision will not allow the University of Texas to take this portrait away from him."" Singer pointed out that half a dozen witnesses corroborated O'Neal's story that Warhol made two portraits -- one for each of them. ""Use your common sense,"" he said. ""Why would Farrah want two?"" O'Neal received support on Monday from a surprise courtroom visitor, Fawcett's ""Charlie's Angels"" co-star Jaclyn Smith. ""I think the most important thing is to imagine how Farrah would feel right now,"" Smith told reporters outside court. ""As her good friend who's known her way before 'Charlie's Angels,' I really feel Farrah would want that portrait with Ryan and then on to (their son) Redmond. ""It's her soul, it's her eyes, it's her hair, it's everything she is. I always described Farrah as this 8x10 glossy -- you know, the combination of this beautiful girl and the girl next door. And that portrait captures that."" Dramatic testimony . Warhol, who died in 1987, was a pop artist who rubbed elbows with -- and churned out portraits of -- the famous and fabulous. All together, his artwork has fetched $1.7 billion at auction, second only to Pablo Picasso. The average price for an original Warhol is now $7.8 million, according to testimony. An appraiser for the university compared the Fawcett portrait to those Warhol painted of Debbie Harry and Brigitte Bardot and estimated its worth at $12 million. But an appraiser for O'Neal set its worth far lower, comparing it to Warhols of Pia Zadora and Dolly Parton and suggesting it would fetch $1 million at auction at most. O'Neal, 72, provided the dramatic highlight of the three-week trial when he was asked what the portrait meant to him. ""I talk to it. I talk to her,"" he said, his voice quaking with emotion. ""It's her presence in my life and her son's life. We lost her. It would seem a crime to lose it."" O'Neal: I talk to Farrah's portrait . Redmond O'Neal testified about seeing both portraits in his parents' homes over the years, but he was not permitted to tell jurors what it meant to him and his father. Later, outside the courthouse, he reluctantly told reporters what he'd hoped to say on the witness stand. ""This portrait is a family heirloom,"" the younger O'Neal said. ""It has no money value to me. It's sentimental. It's to stay in the family. It's a beautiful remembrance of my mom, and it belongs where it is."" Fawcett studied art at the University of Texas in the late 1960s before a summer job led to roles in commercials. She posed in a red tank swimsuit for a poster that sold 12 million copies and was cast in 1976 in ""Charlie's Angels."" She met O'Neal in 1979 and embarked on a tumultuous 30-year romance with a bad-boy heartthrob known equally for his charm and volatile temper. O'Neal, who starred with Mia Farrow in the steamy 1960s prime-time soap ""Peyton Place"" and with Ali MacGraw in the 1970 tearjerker ""Love Story,"" testified that he persuaded Fawcett to pose for Warhol in 1980 soon after the actors began seeing each other. A producer for the TV news magazine ""20/20"" testified for the university that she introduced Warhol and Fawcett at a book party in Houston. She said she saw no sign of O'Neal at the party or at Warhol's New York studio, known as The Factory, when Fawcett sat for the portrait. The show was doing a segment on Warhol at the time. O'Neal said he was at both the party and the studio, and that Warhol painted the hearts on the tablecloth at the party. Indeed, the tablecloth is dedicated to Fawcett and ""Ryan O'N,"" and the words ""Houston Texas"" are written in a semicircle. Breakup and reconciliation . The portrait in dispute wound up in Fawcett's possession after she walked in on O'Neal in bed with another, much younger, woman in 1997 at the Malibu beach house. O'Neal said he gave the portrait to Fawcett for safekeeping after his ""young friend"" complained she felt ""uncomfortable"" with ""Farrah staring down at her."" Other witnesses said Fawcett took anything bearing her likeness from the beach house in the wake of the breakup. After 1998, according to testimony, the portrait was seen in the guesthouse of Fawcett's Brentwood home and at a Los Angeles storage facility. During the final years of her life, it hung outside her bedroom in her Wilshire Boulevard condominium. The other portrait -- the one now hanging at the university's Blanton Museum of Art -- hung in her living room. Ryan O'Neal: Andy Warhol portrait of Farrah Fawcett 'is mine' O'Neal said Fawcett forgave him and they reconciled in 2001 after he was diagnosed with leukemia. Although they never married, he and other defense witnesses said they were a couple and shared quarters at her condo and his beach house, and that he cared for her until she died. Fawcett set up a living trust before her death, leaving all her artwork to her alma mater. She left more than $4 million to the couple's son, Redmond, but nothing to O'Neal, according to testimony. Superior Court Judge William MacLaughlin ruled that the case had nothing to do with Fawcett's intentions. Instead, he instructed jurors to focus on who owned the disputed Warhol. It is not an easy question to answer since the artist gave the portrait as a gift, both Fawcett and O'Neal have insured it, and it has never been sold -- a point underscored by the correspondence between lawyers for the university and Fawcett's trustee: . ""In light of the unusual relationship and living arrangement between Ms. Fawcett and Mr. O'Neal and in light of the fact the Warhol works were not purchased, it may be impossible to 'prove' the ownership of the works in question by the kind of documentary evidence we lawyers like,"" said one letter to the university from the trustee's attorney. The Warhol story . Both Warhols of Fawcett are 40-inch by 40-inch silkscreens of enlarged Polaroid photographs on canvas. Nearly identical, they show Fawcett in three-quarter profile, with her eyes painted a vibrant greenish blue and her lips a shiny red. O'Neal testified that Warhol agreed to make one portrait for him and one for Fawcett, and that the artist handed one to each of them after they were completed. Over the years, the couple repeated the story to friends, several of whom testified in O'Neal's defense. O'Neal and those friends told the story in court, and they said Fawcett never disputed O'Neal's account. The University of Texas' witnesses included a reality show producer who worked with Fawcett on the TV Land series ""Chasing Farrah"" and a documentary about her fight with cancer. Craig Nevius testified that Fawcett never forgave O'Neal and never intended for him to have the portrait. Greg Lott, a former college boyfriend, and Mike Pingel, a former personal assistant, also supplied information to the university and testified on its behalf. O'Neal's lawyers, Singer and Todd Eagan, portrayed the three men as hangers-on with axes to grind against O'Neal. They presented testimony from O'Neal, as well as Fawcett's inner circle of friends, including hairstylist Mela Murphy and Alana Stewart, the former wife of actor George Hamilton and rocker Rod Stewart. Stewart, who said Fawcett was her best friend, said she always considered the second Warhol to be O'Neal's. At one point, according to testimony, Fawcett told another friend that there were just five people in the world she could really trust. She did not name any of the university's witnesses, but Murphy, Stewart and O'Neal made the list.","Jury to decide if school or actor should have one of two Warhol portraits of Farrah Fawcett .

"(CNN) -- She's the youngest winner in LPGA Tour history and now teen sensation Lydia Ko looks set for a long and lucrative career after teaming up with a major sports management firm. The South-Korean born New Zealander has signed with IMG, the company which once had world No. 1 Tiger Woods on its books. ""Now officially an IMG family member :),"" the 16-year-old announced on Twitter. Ko has enjoyed five professional wins since January 2012 and is ranked No. 4 in the world. In August 2012, two days after her 15th birthday, Ko won the Canadian Women's Open but was unable to collect the $300,000 winner's check due to her status as an amateur. It was the same story when she defended the title 12 months on, with Ko neglecting to turn pro to focus on her education. She also benefited from the backing of wealthy benefactor David Levene, who donated some of his fortune to Ko so she could remain an amateur and continue with her studies. Ko will have no such problems in the future as she joins the LPGA Tour in 2014. ""I am excited to work with my new team at IMG as I embark on my professional career,"" Ko said in a statement. ""My family and I spoke with many candidates and IMG emerged as the clear choice to represent me, in large part because of their global reach.

"London (CNN) -- Defense lawyers for two sisters accused of embezzling money from celebrity chef Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi argued Wednesday that they were caught in the middle of a personal battle. Prosecution claims that Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo embezzled money have not been proved, their respective defense lawyers said in their closing arguments in a west London court. Both defense lawyers questioned Nigella Lawson's credibility as a witness and said their clients' claims that she repeatedly used drugs were relevant to that issue. The case has gripped UK media, thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and intimate insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi, a millionaire art collector. Both sisters deny embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the couple, saying their personal spending on Saatchi's company credit cards was authorized by Lawson. Lawson and Saatchi divorced this year after a very public argument at a London restaurant. Elisabetta Grillo's defense lawyer, Anthony Metzer, told the jury that Elisabetta was the ""soft underbelly"" by which Saatchi was attacking Lawson, adding that his client had been very close to the chef and her family. ""My client has been caught in a collateral crossfire like a child in an acrimonious divorce,"" he told the court. The jury must be sure that Lawson had not authorized her spending ""explicitly or implicitly"" over the four years in question if they were to convict Elisabetta, the lawyer said. Karina Arden, representing Francesca Grillo, said she had made no attempt to hide her spending, so it was impossible for Lawson to say she was ignorant of it. She also stressed that Lawson was not on trial. ""This is not a day for you to say 'ooh, I like Miss Lawson, I like her cooking programs,' "" she told the jury. ""This is a trial of my client."" Arden added that the prosecution had failed even to pin down the amount Francesca Grillo is alleged to have embezzled. 'Bolder and greedier' However, Jane Carpenter, giving the prosecution's closing argument in the case, said that the sisters had abused their position ""time and time again"" and that they ""grew bolder and greedier"" as time went by. ""Just because Saatchi is a wealthy man, obviously it doesn't mean he should be defrauded by the staff,"" Carpenter said. ""That seems to be what the defense are putting forward."" Carpenter said both sisters admitted they had used the company cards, given to them for household expenses, for personal expenditure. When they were first asked about that spending by Saatchi's accountant, they at no point argued then that it had been authorized, she said. They had sent a letter to Lawson and Saatchi apologizing for the personal expenditure and had offered to pay it back, she said. The sisters knew Lawson had used cocaine after the cancer diagnosis of her late first husband and used the revelation to cause a sensation at the trial, Carpenter said. She told the jury the only possible verdict in the case was guilty. 'A case with no winners' Allegations of repeated drug use by Lawson have played a central part in the evidence presented to the court. The Grillo sisters, while acknowledging that they had never seen Lawson taking drugs, both said they had seen indications of frequent cocaine and cannabis use. Metzer said the allegations about Lawson's drug use were relevant because the issue had an impact on the chef's credibility. The only real evidence about Elisabetta's spending was from Lawson, he said. ""This is a case with no winners,"" Metzer said. ""Not Mr. Saatchi, not Ms. Lawson and certainly not my client."" Arden suggested the court could not trust Lawson's evidence because it was not in her interest for the truth about her drug use -- which was hidden from her then-husband -- to emerge. She said that if Lawson had admitted authorizing the Grillo sisters' expenditure, Saatchi ""would have been on her back."" Lawson had to think of a way ""to stop the dark secret coming out,"" Arden said. ""There was a massive attempt to limit the damage."" She added, ""My client is somewhat piggy in the middle."" 'A life problem' In her own testimony, Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times, during two periods of her life, and used cannabis in the past. But she denied being a habitual user, saying, ""I did not have a drug problem; I had a life problem."" Saatchi had said in an e-mail that Lawson had used drugs regularly, but in his testimony before the court last month, he backed off that claim. In the e-mail, which the defense shared with the court at a pretrial hearing, Saatchi wrote that the two assistants would probably ""get off"" because Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" Recounting Saatchi's testimony, Carpenter said he had never intended for that e-mail to be made public. He was being particularly nasty at a time he was upset after their separation and divorce, she said. Like the Grillo sisters, Saatchi told the court he had never seen Lawson taking drugs, Carpenter said.","NEW: Francesca Grillo's defense says Nigella Lawson was trying to hide a ""dark secret""

"New York (CNN) -- The Indian diplomat whose arrest and strip search in New York City ignited a diplomatic spat between nations has filed a motion seeking the dismissal of the charges, her attorney said Wednesday. The diplomat, Devyani Khobragade, left the U.S. last week amid federal charges that she lied on a visa application for her housekeeper. A dismissal of the charges against her would allow her to reenter the United States, where her husband and two daughters reside, said her attorney, Daniel Arshack. A hearing is set for January 31. A motion filed in federal court Tuesday asked that the case be thrown out, saying the court ""does not have jurisdiction over the Defendant due to the Defendant's diplomatic status which provides her absolute immunity from criminal prosecution in the United States. ""Because Dr. Khobragade was cloaked in diplomatic immunity at the time of her arrest on December 12, 2013, as well as the time of the filing of the subsequent indictment on January 9, 2014 (on which she was not re-arrested or arraigned), she cannot be prosecuted thus necessitating a dismissal of the indictment and proceeding,"" the motion said. U.S. prosecutors accused Khobragade of lying in a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper. She was indicted last week by a federal grand jury on one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements. The Indian government denied a request by the State Department to waive Khobragade's diplomatic immunity so she can answer the charges, U.S. and Indian officials said. The immunity was granted after her controversial arrest. Khobragade arrived at the New Delhi airport Friday, according to an Indian official who was not authorized to speak to the media. Khobragade told CNN, through an intermediary, that the charges against her ""are false and baseless."" ""I look forward to demonstrating that to all of you,"" she said through the intermediary. Khobragade ""affirmed her determination to ensure that the episode would not leave a lasting impact on her family, in particular, her children, who are still in the United States,"" the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said. New Delhi is demanding that Washington apologize and have the charges dropped. Amid the tensions over the case, the United States announced that it will withdraw one official from its embassy in New Delhi. Federal prosecutors allege Khobragade promised in the visa application, under which her housekeeper moved from India to the United States, to pay her at least the minimum wage in New York, and to require she work no more than 40 hours per week. They allege that Khobragade then had the housekeeper, Sangeeta Richard, sign a second contract, which set her pay far below the minimum wage and required that she work much longer hours. ""I would like to tell other domestic workers who are suffering as I did -- you have rights and do not let anyone exploit you,"" Richard said in a statement released Thursday. Mix of Cold War legacy and politics? Diplomatic status . Khobragade's lawyers have repeatedly said the diplomat is not guilty and is entitled to diplomatic immunity. Khobragade ""did not make any false statements and she paid her domestic worker what she was entitled to be paid,"" her attorney said. Richard fled the diplomat's home last summer, and Khobragade started legal proceedings against her and her husband in the Indian courts. Richard has been granted permission to remain in the United States. Arshack, Khobragade's attorney, said the diplomat and her legal team were pleased that the State Department had done ""the right thing"" Thursday by recognizing her diplomatic status. U.S. officials had previously said Khobragade was entitled to consular immunity, which is less broad than diplomatic immunity and covers only actions carried out under official duties. Khobragade was India's deputy consul general for political, economic, commercial and women's affairs. But after her arrest, Indian officials appointed her as counselor at the country's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York. Through that post, she was accorded ""the privileges and immunities of a diplomatic envoy,"" the ministry said. Two senior U.S. officials said that the State Department had no choice but to grant Khobragade full diplomatic immunity once she was accredited to the United Nations because she did not pose a national security threat, which is the only reason for which, in very rare cases, immunity is denied. When India refused the U.S. request to waive the immunity so that she could face the charges against her, she had to leave the country, the officials said. Debate: Arrest, strip-search of Indian diplomat 'barbaric?' Arrest and search . India has expressed outrage about the arrest of Khobragade, who was handcuffed and strip-searched by federal agents on December 12 after a complaint filed by Richard. Some observers have suggested that Indian officials' protests and repeated demands for an apology are driven by political concerns. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed ""regret"" about the situation last month, but stopped short of saying authorities had done anything wrong. U.S. law enforcement officials have said that Khobragade's strip search was standard procedure and that she received a number of privileges not usually accorded to defendants. During the spat, Indian authorities removed concrete barriers from outside the U.S. Embassy and took away American diplomats' identification cards. That was followed recently by an order that the United States shut down ""commercial activities"" at a recreational facility at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The U.S. Embassy should halt the activities at the property by Thursday, an Indian external affairs official said last week. The property houses a bowling alley, swimming pool and gym.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Did Real Madrid, FC Barcelona and five other Spanish football clubs get unfair advantage over their rivals through various government support measures potentially worth millions of dollars? That's what the European Commission wants to know, and it announced in Brussels, Belgium, on Wednesday an ""in-depth investigation into public funding of certain"" clubs. ""Professional football clubs should finance their running costs and investments with sound financial management rather than at the expense of the taxpayer,"" European Commission Vice President Joaquin Almunia said in a prepared statement. ""Member States and public authorities must comply with EU rules on state aid in this sector as in all economic sectors,"" said Almunia, a Spaniard who is reportedly an avid fan of Spanish football. The seven clubs under investigation are Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Athletic de Bilbao, Osasuna (of Pamplona), Valencia, Hercules (of Alicante) and Elche. Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said Monday that all the operations analyzed were in accord with Spanish law and that he expects the investigation to end once European officials get more information. Garcia-Margallo on Monday made public the inquiry, two days before Brussels officially announced it. Spanish media reported that the seven clubs either professed innocence or had no immediate comment. The EC will first investigate ""possible tax privileges for Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Athletic de Bilbao and Osasuna,"" Almunia's statement said. These four clubs are not private companies but instead have key decisions, such as the election of club president, done by their thousands of season-ticket holders. They were ""exempted from the general obligation for professional football clubs to convert into sport limited companies"" and currently have a lower tax rate than other clubs, the statement said. In a separate inquiry, the EC ""will assess whether a widely reported land transfer between the City of Madrid and the club Real Madrid involved any state aid in favor of the club,"" the statement said. The land swap involved Real Madrid's old training grounds, near its home Bernabeu stadium, which became the site of four office and hotel skyscrapers, while the training ground was moved farther from downtown, near the airport. ""This swap was based on a re-evaluation of a plot of land at a value of 22.7 million euros, instead of its earlier supposed value, in 1998, of 595,000 euros,"" the EC statement said. The investigation will also look into state-backed loans of about 110 million euros to three clubs operating in the Valencia region -- Valencia, Hercules and Elche, the statement said. It will look into whether the alleged activities provided ""advantages to specific clubs that carry out economic activities in the EU internal market,"" the statement said.","EC seeks to know if government support gave the clubs an unfair advantage over rivals .

"(CNN) -- Kevin Conboy was backing out of his driveway for a midday burrito run with a friend when he heard the sirens. He was driving down the street when he saw the flashing lights at Arapahoe High School. That's when what Conboy calls ""initial parent paranoia"" set in. ""Are you ok"" Conboy texted his high-schooler son, Ian, at 12:48 p.m. Friday, at first fearing not a shooting but something awry with his diabetic son's health. ""I'm fine,"" Ian texted back. But the school's on lockdown, he added. Something happened. ""Whoa,"" Conboy texted back. What followed was a remarkable string of 70 more texts, displaying remarkable calm and the bond between a father and son amid a crisis that made national headlines. Conboy, a Web developer and self-avowed ""data sharer,"" said Monday he posted the texts to his website to revisit later, to write about more, to remind him on some distant day that ""my relationship with my son is absolutely where I want it to be."" Shooting victim described as sweet, smart . ""We're in lockdown"" Friday's shooting began at 12:33 p.m., when, according to police accounts, 18-year-old student Karl Pierson walked into the Centennial, Colorado, school armed with a pump-action shotgun, a machete and a backpack containing three Molotov cocktails, a bandolier of ammunition across his chest. According to police, Pierson shot 17-year-old Claire Esther Davis once in the head amid shots fired randomly into school hallways. He also ignited one of the firebombs in the school library before killing himself in the back corner of the school library. Conboy didn't know any of that when he heard the sirens and saw the lights at the high school he once attended and where Ian now goes to school. But he knew something was wrong. He steered the car not toward the Qdoba restaurant where he and a friend had planned to have lunch, but toward his son's school. ""Are you ok"" he texted. ""There are ambulances going to Arapahoe."" ""I'm fine,"" the boy wrote back. ""And yeah. We're in lockdown."" Lessons of Columbine and other school shootings helped in Arapahoe . A constant dread . A school shooting has long been one of the characters in the cast of fears that dances through Conboy's mind when it comes to his three children. He remembers being a young, young father -- barely out of high school -- cradling 1-year-old Ian and watching the horror of Columbine play out down the road from him in 1999. The slaughter at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, a year ago only intensified the dread. He vowed back in 1999 he'd never have a gun in his home. And the plague of school shootings since then has only strengthened his belief that U.S. gun laws are, in his words, ""severely underpowered."" But, on Friday, he wasn't thinking about gun laws. He had only one thing on his mind: his son. ""I am here and will be here"" Four minutes had passed since Conboy first texted his son. ""What's going on,"" he asked. ""Dunno,"" Ian wrote back. ""We heard something like a gunshot and then an administrator came by to make sure the door was locked. Now we're all huddled in a corner."" ""Please keep telling me you're ok,"" Conboy texted his son. I'm good, the son replied, promising to text every five minutes. ""Ok I am here and will be here,"" Conboy texted. ""Until I have you."" ""Thanks dad. That Means a lot."" School gunman liked debate, acted 'weird' at times . ""He's here"" Dozens of texts followed. Can you get to the Burger King? No, Ian says. Go to Euclid Middle School. Actually, don't. Change of plans. Go to the Shepherd of the Hills Church instead. I'm there, Dad says. You have to check me out, the son says. Standing in line, Dad answers. ""Okay thanks,"" Ian texts. And then nothing for more than four hours. The last entry is a photo -- Conboy and his son on the basement couch, alone, after Conboy had broken down in tears. After the rest of the family had gone from crying to celebrating. After everyone else had headed upstairs to decorate the Christmas tree. ""Oh my God,"" Conboy told CNN on Monday of the moment. ""He's here, and what have we been through together."" A message on a hand . Another Arapahoe student, Matt Bowers, had his own message. It was written on his hand, in case he didn't get out alive. ""Family, I love you all so much,"" Bowers scrawled, the last two words underlined. Then he added, ""I'm up here now,"" above a picture of a cross. Bowers told CNN's The Lead that he was in a literature class when he and his classmates heard a loud bang from down the hall. He didn't think anything of it until they heard two more. His teacher's face ""just became completely pale,"" he said, and everyone rushed to a corner of classroom away from doors and windows. He's kept the ball-point pen he used to write that farewell ever since. ""I've never had such a frightening experience in my life before that,"" Bowers said. ""It really changed how I looked at my life, and just my whole perspective on what life is.""","NEW: Another student wrote a farewell on his hand, fearing the worst .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Suspended NFL player Richie Incognito said his alleged bullying of Miami Dolphin teammate Jonathan Martin is misunderstood because ""people don't know how Jon and I communicate to one another."" Incognito acknowledged in an interview aired on ""Fox NFL Sunday"" that he used racist and vulgar language in voice mails and text messages to Martin but said it was ""coming from a place of love."" ""No matter how bad and how vulgar it sounds, that's how we communicate,"" he told Fox Sports reporter Jay Glazer. ""That's how our friendship was."" ""For instance, a week before this went down, Jonathan Martin text me on my phone 'I will murder your whole F-ing family,'"" Incognito told Glazer. ""Now, do I think Jonathan Martin was going to murder my family? Not one bit."" Lawyer: Martin left because of persistent bullying, not lack of toughness . Martin, 24, left the team last month because of ""harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing,"" Martin's lawyer said. Days later, the Dolphins suspended Incognito, 30, for conduct detrimental to the team. After the interview, which was recorded in Los Angeles on Saturday, Incognito let Glazer review his phone text messages with Martin. He counted 1,142 messages exchanged between the two men over the last year, Glazer reported. ""To say that it's offensive, absolutely,"" Glazer said. Martin sent Incognito text messages three days after he left the team, Glazer said. One said, ""Wassup man? The world's gone crazy lol I'm good tho congrats on the win"" and another read, ""Yeah I'm good man. It's insane bro but just know I don't blame you guys at all it's just the culture around football and the locker room got to me a little,"" Glazer reported. Glazer acknowledged at the beginning of Sunday's broadcast that he has been a close friend of Incognito for five years, including training him in mixed martial arts in the off season. He said the only issue that Incognito ""sidestepped and wouldn't answer"" concerned the allegation that Miami coaches had ordered a ""code red"" instructing the veteran to ""toughen up"" the younger Martin. Incognito cited ""legal issues"" preventing him from answering, Glazer said. Lawyer: Martin made ""a difficult choice"" While Martin has not spoken publicly since the controversy erupted, his attorney David Cornwell broke the silence on his behalf with a prepared statement last week. Martin tried ""to befriend ... teammates who subjected him to the abuse with the hope that doing so would end the harassment"" -- something that Cornwell called ""a textbook reaction of victims of bullying."" The taunting did not stop, however, the lawyer said. He cited ""a malicious physical attack on him by a teammate and daily vulgar comments,"" and a threat of a group sexual assault against Martin's sister. ""Eventually, Jonathan made a difficult choice,"" Cornwell said of Martin leaving the Dolphins. ""... Jonathan looks forward to getting back to playing football. In the meantime, he will cooperate fully with the NFL investigation."" Although Incognito was the Dolphin player suspended, Cornwell's statement alleged others mistreated Martin. ""Right, wrong or indifferent, because of all this, you've become the face of bullying in America,"" Glazer told Incognito. ""Someone thinks of a bully, they think of Richie Incognito."" ""This isn't an issue about bullying,"" Incognito said. ""This is an issue of my and Jon's relationship, where I've taken stuff too far and I didn't know it was hurting him."" A profanity-filled voice mail from Incognito to Martin that has been made public was intended to shock him so ""his buddy"" would call him back, he said. ""When the words are put in the context, I understand why a lot of eye brows get raised,"" Incognito said. ""When people don't know how Jon and I communicate to one another."" Incognito: ""I'm not a racist"" ""When it's on the screen it sounds like I'm a racist pig, it sounds like I'm a meat head,"" he said. ""It sounds like a lot of things it is not. And I wanted to clear the air just being saying that I'm a good person."" He acknowledged using the n-word in his communications with Martin, who is African-American. ""I'm not a racist and to judge me by that one word is wrong,"" Incognito said. ""It, in no way, shape or form, is ever acceptable for me to use that word, even if it's friend to friend in a voice mail."" He said ""it was a joke.""

"(CNN) -- With more than half a billion eggs recalled and at least 1,300 salmonellosis illnesses linked to eggs in an ongoing investigation this summer, consumers are worried and wondering, ""What went wrong, and what can I do to protect myself and my family?"" We study food safety for a living, so our own family members have been quizzing us about which eggs are safest to buy. Our immediate response to them, and everyone else who has called us at the university for advice, is to recommend they check the recall list and discard implicated eggs or return them to the store for a refund. (Specific brands and other information about the recall can be found at http://www.foodsafety.gov/. ) But, beyond the recall, they also wanted to discuss the broader issue of food safety differences between eggs sold conventionally versus free-range or cage-free eggs. For example, they wanted to know is it really true, as some food activists suggest, that eggs from cage-free chickens are safer? The answer? Not necessarily. However, there are things consumers can do to protect their food. They can learn more about salmonella and related egg-production issues. They can also support legislation, now stalled in the U.S. Senate, that would help the Food and Drug Administration safeguard the nation's food supply. It is important to note that in the current outbreak, the eggs recalled were traced to large, conventional farms in Iowa where hens were likely housed in indoor cages. In recent years, the marketing of free-range eggs has become a popular alternative to conventional eggs. Read more about the debate over industrial vs. free-range farming . The term free-range is often used interchangeably with cage-free. The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that producers labeling eggs as free-range have demonstrated that the birds were allowed continuous, free access to the outside for more than 51 percent of their lives. Free-range or cage-free eggs are sometimes, but not always, organically produced and/or raised on pasture. But are they safer? We revisited the scientific literature. We found that studies directly comparing the relative safety of free-range, cage-free and conventional eggs are limited, and some of the data are contradictory. For example, a 1994 study in Southern California of a specific salmonella type found only 1 percent  prevalence in caged hens compared with 50 percent prevalence in free-range hens. European researchers have concluded the opposite in their studies, but comparisons between countries are difficult because of factors such as feed and climate. A study of broilers in the U.S. found no difference in salmonella incidents in caged and free-range chickens. These findings suggest to us that more research is needed and that the risk factors for finding salmonella in eggs are far more complex than simply how the chickens were housed. To better understand the problem of salmonella in eggs, it is important to consider where the bacteria comes from in the environment. There are some 2,000 subtypes of salmonella, but the one most commonly found in eggs is called salmonella enteritidis (SE). This bacteria lives in the gut of healthy animals, especially chickens, turkeys, ducks, wild birds and rodents. It can also be carried by flies. The outside of an egg can get contaminated with SE by contact with feces and dirt. The bacteria can spread to the hens through contaminated feed or water, from chicken-to-chicken and via wildlife vectors such as wild birds and rodents. Workers and visitors can also spread the bacteria from one farm to another by carrying it on dirty clothing or their shoes. For more on the egg safety issue, see CNN.com's ""Eatocracy"" blog . Neither conventional, free-range nor cage-free farms are immune to these possible modes of spread. Furthermore, an intriguing and dangerous characteristic of the SE strain is that it can also travel to the chicken's reproductive tract and infect the inside of the egg. This is extremely rare. Only one in every 10,000 to 30,000 supermarket eggs is typically infected with salmonella enteritidis. And only a very small fraction of those results from an inner-egg infection, which can happen regardless of how the chickens are housed or whether the chickens were raised organically. Given the biology of salmonella and its multiple potential modes of spread, we can only conclude that both conventional and free-range/cage-free egg producers must be diligent to protect their eggs from contamination. Neither method of egg farming appears to offer the silver bullet for egg food safety. All types of egg farms should follow best practices during production and handling of the eggs. On July 9, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published the Egg Safety Final Rule, which is expected to ""prevent each year approximately 79,000 cases of food-borne illness and 30 deaths caused by consumption of eggs contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella Enteritidis."" Similar but voluntary programs in California and Pennsylvania have already dramatically improved the safety of eggs in those states. Furthermore, SB 510, the Food Safety Modernization Act  that's awaiting Senate action would increase the likelihood of success in controlling SE in eggs by providing the FDA with the authority necessary to enforce the food safety standards and recalls. Finally, it is important to remember that no matter how carefully eggs are produced and handled, or regulated, it is impossible to guarantee that a raw egg is free of salmonella or other harmful bacteria. Prevention should be from the farm to the fork. Consumers can protect themselves by: . -- Always buying eggs from a refrigerated case and choosing eggs with clean, uncracked shells. -- Keeping eggs refrigerated at 45° F (7° C) or colder at all times. -- Washing hands, cooking utensils and food-preparation surfaces with soap and water after contact with raw eggs. -- Cooking eggs until the whites and yolks are firm and eating them promptly. -- Not keeping eggs warm or at room temperature for more than two hours. -- Refrigerating unused or leftover egg-containing foods promptly. -- Avoiding eating raw eggs. -- Using pasteurized shell eggs or pasteurized egg mixtures when home recipes call for uncooked eggs. -- Avoiding restaurant dishes made with raw or undercooked, unpasteurized eggs. Restaurants should use pasteurized eggs in any recipe (such as Hollandaise sauce or Caesar salad dressing) that calls for raw eggs. Do not hesitate to ask your server how the eggs were prepared.

"(CNN) -- If the figures for childhood obesity in the United States were not shocking enough -- prompting First Lady Michelle Obama to set up a nationwide program to tackle the epidemic -- the statistics among the Native American community are yet more sobering. Nearly 50% of indigenous children are classed as obese, and on current projections they could be the first generation not to outlive their parents. Urgent action is clearly needed and Obama has started her ""Let's Move"" initiative -- but help is also at hand from a former golfer who was once talked of in the same breath as his ""dear friend"" Tiger Woods and remains a hero in his Native American community. Notah Begay III is bringing the same competitive fervor which made him one of the sport's hottest young prospects to a charitable foundation which focuses on tackling these health problems. ""One in two Native American children expect to develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime, so it is vital that effective strategies are available for all our communities,"" Begay told CNN. Begay, a roommate of Woods at Stanford University, won four PGA Tour events before the age of 28 and achieved the ""holy grail"" of golf -- a round of 59 in a professional event. But a debilitating back injury put paid to his hopes of building on that early promise and he now devotes his time to his NB3 foundation as well as working as a golf analyst for an American network. 'Generational trauma' A Navajo on his father's side, while his mother is from the Pueblo Nation, Begay is fiercely loyal to his upbringing and cultural identity. He is not afraid to speak out on equality issues -- he has gone on public record to criticize the NFL franchise Washington Redskins for its ""offensive"" name. Begay was alarmed by the team's custom of having non-Native Americans dressed up in traditional clothing and regalia performing at games. It all touches a raw nerve for the 41-year-old, who believes that what happened in the past -- and our society's attitude to it -- is having a direct impact on today's generation of Native Americans, with shocking consequences. ""Historically speaking, communities that have endured genocide suffer from generational trauma which leads to social issues, poor education, poor health outcomes, high crime and lots of addiction,"" he said. ""These are problems in the Native American community and we are at the very beginning of the fight."" His foundation was established in 2005 with the initial goal of introducing Native American youngsters from the greater Albuquerque area to golf, in a program headed by his father, Notah Begay Jr. Other sports such as soccer were also introduced. But as the program expanded, the emphasis became those endemic health problems which blight his community. ""Something which started as simply golf and then soccer for kids is now an evidence based health and wellness program,"" he said. Funding the fight . Begay's skills acquired as an economics major at Stanford have been put to good use with the foundation. ""I have tried to assign business principles to every aspect of our work,"" he revealed. ""We keep score and, if we are not hitting our targets, we change. I don't see why non-profits should not be accountable for ever dollar invested. ""To use a golf adage, we shoot for a 59 with some programs which carry a very high risk, but mix those with others where we know we are guaranteed a return on our investment. It's a good mix."" Begay has used his contacts in golf, Woods included, to promote a yearly charity tournament, the NB3 Challenge, which has raised over $4 million for the foundation. Woods had to skip this year's tournament at the Turning Stone Resort in New York State with a back injury, but spectators were treated to his replacement Gary Woodland, Begay, Rickie Fowler and Bo Van Pelt beating an internationals team which included former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel and former world No. 1 Lee Westwood. For the flamboyant and crowd-pleasing Fowler, the event and the cause has added significance as he is one-quarter Navajo. ""His grandmother has become friends with my father because they are both of Navajo descent,"" Begay said. ""I became aware of what Rickie was doing from his high school days and he has brought a lot of flair to the game. ""He is a very good-looking young man, with the colorful clothes, his unique swing, and he has created a lot of interest."" Learning lessons . For all his promise, Fowler still has some way to match Begay's achievements, which as well as his PGA Tour wins and the storied 59 in a Challenge Tour event, also included a place on the 2000 U.S. Presidents Cup team. But like his friend Woods, Begay has also made the headlines for the wrong reasons. In January 2000, he was arrested for driving under the influence in Albuquerque, his second offense of its type and sentenced to a year in jail, but with all but seven days suspended. Begay makes no attempt to duck his responsibilities -- raising the issue before being asked a direct question by CNN. ""I was aware there were certain expectations as a role model, and when you get arrested for drunk driving, I felt like I let down a lot of people,"" he said. ""But I learned from those mistakes and a lot of times failure is what drives you to success down the road. ""I made a mistake, I served my time in jail and didn't try to sidestep it."" It is a measure of his determination that Begay went on to achieve two PGA Tour wins later that year and make that Presidents Cup appearance, pairing with Woods as the U.S. won against the International team. But sadly, it was to prove the peak of his career, which began as a three-time All American at Stanford with Woods, but petered out due to problems emanating from a herniated disc in his back. A number of comebacks and attempts to regain his full Tour card were ultimately frustrated and, having turned his talents to broadcasting, Begay gained a full-time position with NBC and the Golf Channel earlier this year. ""I play fine and take part in a couple of smaller events throughout the year, but playing 25 tournaments at the highest level each year is not possible,"" he said. Loyalty to his community and to his friends is a constant theme in Begay's life -- he stood by Woods when the 14-time major champion was in self-imposed exile, with sponsors deserting him and supporters hard to find. Begay was there for Woods -- embracing him warmly -- when he made his February 2010 televised confession of extra marital affairs, and behind the microphone he has celebrated his return to the top of the world rankings three years later. Woods has returned that favor with his support for NB3, drawing the crowds in the 2012 tournament, which helped to place added focus on the foundation's crucial work. It is now working with the Indian Health Service (IHS), which provides for more than two million Native Americans, and the collaboration was developed in support of the initiative started by Michelle Obama. Her ""Let's Move in Indian Country"" program seeks to improve the health of Native youth through exercise. ""This unprecedented partnership between the Obama administration, the IHS, and the NB3F demonstrates the critical importance of leveraging partnerships and resources to tackle the health crisis facing Native American children,"" Begay told his foundation's website. So exciting times ahead for his program, but he is aware of the immense challenges it faces. ""A lot of the tribal leaders are starting to support or work and acknowledge the dangers are young people are in,"" Begay said. ""It's all about taking personal responsibility for your own life and to make something of yourself."" Cracking the code . Begay has lived up to those ideals with a strong work ethic in his family -- drilled into him by his father -- and backed up by no little flair through the generations. His grandfather, who died before he was born, was one of a select band of ""Code Talkers"" recruited by the U.S military during World War Two to use the Navajo language as a basis for a secret communications code, which was never cracked by the Japanese or the Germans. Thanks to his own hard work and talent, Begay was set firmly on the course to stardom from his college days. But if he does harbor any regrets about not being able to follow through on his early promise to win majors like Woods, Begay does not show it as he talks with passion about his foundation's goals and hopes for the future. ""I love this work, just as I loved trying to hit a ball onto the fairway,"" he said.","Notah Begay is a golfer with a Native American background .
Has four PGA Tour wins and was a Presidents Cup teammate of Tiger Woods .

"(CNN) -- Thousands took to the streets of Madrid Saturday to protest against a proposed law that would, among other things, impose stiff fines on illegal demonstrations, according to state-run broadcaster TVE. Much of the protest was peaceful, but a small group clashed with riot police and seven people were arrested. Officials said at least 23 people were injured, including 14 police officers. ""The voice of the people is not illegal,"" protesters shouted as they were met by 1,250 riot police, TVE reported. Under the proposed law, unauthorized demonstrations in front of the Parliament building carry a fine of up to 30,000 euros (about $41,000), but the measure is likely to pass as conservatives hold the majority in the government. Spain has seen its share of protests since the government imposed austerity measures to comply with European Union demands.

"Washington (CNN) -- Private health insurance exchanges still are not able to directly enroll consumers in subsidized health plans offered through Obamacare even though the government has said problems doing so should have been cleared up weeks ago. Executives from three online health exchanges that contract with both insurance companies and government agencies to enroll consumers eligible for federal subsidies in marketplace plans say the process still isn't ready to go and that more work remains. This despite several promises from government officials that technical fixes have been made to allow for business to be conducted on those sites, which are alternatives to the troubled HealthCare.gov website and health exchanges sites run by states. The direct enrollment process designed by the Department of Health and Human Services would allow private marketplaces to direct consumers to a federal data hub to confirm their eligibility for government assistance, and then allow them to return to the third-party sites to enroll. ""We're not going to launch anything that doesn't work, but we can't even start testing for a while yet,"" said eHealth.com CEO Gary Lauer, weeks after the first round of fixes were announced in mid-November. ""We're still going through all of this. The stuff we've had up to this point has been junk, and that's why I'm so concerned about this. It may not work,"" he said. Officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency overseeing HealthCare.gov, announced in November several fixes that were supposed to allow for direct enrollment through private issuers within a matter of days. After the announcement, consumers should have been able to compare plans on a private exchange, visit HealthCare.gov to receive their subsidy eligibility, and then be directed back to the private site to complete enrollment. ""We believe more improvements need to be made before it's stable enough and consumer-friendly enough,"" said Michael Mahoney, senior vice president of consumer marketing at GoHealth.com, another private online health insurance exchange. Launched in 2010, GoHealth has been participating in an alternate form of direct enrollment since late November, but visitors to the site still cannot complete the entire process online as CMS officials promised. Shoppers can compare plans and get an estimate of what kind of subsidy they may qualify for through the GoHealth system, but in order to officially determine their eligibility and enroll in a plan consumers must call a GoHealth call center. ""We're still working with CMS on a solution where you don't have to interact over the phone,"" Mahoney said. Other private exchanges are also using their call centers as a workaround, but one official said companies are still working towards the ""holy grail,"" when customers can enroll online from start to finish. In November, officials at GetInsured.com told CNN they believed they were days away from launching such a process on their site. But weeks later, company spokeswoman Andrea Riggs said the direct enrollment process is still not ready for public use even though her company has been in near-daily contact with CMS. ""We're not going to put it in front of the consumer and make noise about it until it's a great experience,"" Riggs said. During congressional testimony on December 11, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius pointed to direct enrollment as a viable option for those who have had trouble enrolling on HealthCare.gov, which experienced enormous problems upon its October 1 launch and was only recently brought up to speed. In response to a question from Georgia Republican Rep. John Barrow about ways consumers can enroll in insurance outside of the troubled federal website, Sebelius said that private online options were available. ""I know that the e-surance, e-health brokers have a variety of plans available,"" Sebelius said. ""I can't tell you how broad-based that is, but I know a number of companies, you can either sign up in person with an agent or broker or sign up online."" The secretary quickly clarified that in order to check whether a consumer is eligible for a premium subsidy, private issuers had to first check in with the federal data hub. But when pushed, she assured Barrow that online exchanges were participating in the process. ""The e-health insurance folks are now engaged and involved, the brokers involved in that,"" Sebelius said. ""The companies are directly involved, as well as individuals navigating on their own."" While some individual insurance companies are currently using direct enrollment to sign up new customers on their company websites, CMS officials could not point to any private exchanges successfully using the process the way it was intended. Through private exchanges, consumers can compare plans offered by multiple providers, filter them by coverage features, and even get free advice as to what kind of coverage they may need. Insurance company sites only allow consumers to choose from plans offered by that specific company. Lauer said the government is making a mistake by not making it easier for private exchanges like his company to enroll customers, calling the redirect system designed by CMS ""byzantine."" Describing himself as a supporter-turned-critic of the ACA, Lauer said at the current pace, he doesn't see how the government can reach its projection of 7 million enrollees using just HealthCare.gov and 14 state-run exchanges. ""There's absolutely no reason why we shouldn't be connected directly to the federal data hub, we've got all kinds of security and requirements built into the regulation,"" Lauer said, referring to the contract his company signed with CMS. ""If they want more regulations, more requirements, bring 'em on. If they want to audit us every day, come on in."" Officials from all three companies CNN spoke with acknowledged that they stand to make money from a surge in online enrollment, but they all emphasized that the advice and assistance provided by their sites is free to consumers. Private exchanges get paid by insurance companies for the customers they sign up. Meaning their service is not only free to consumers, but also to taxpayers.","Three online companies that enroll Obamacare consumers say problems persist .

"(CNN) -- A stampede killed at least 18 people in a large crowd gathered to pay last respects to a religious leader on Saturday in India, official news agency Press Trust of India reported. The pandemonium, which injured 60 more people, started after the gates were closed to the residence of Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, who had died the day before at age 102, CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported. Burhanuddin was the head of a denomination of Islam known as Dawoodi Bohra. His funeral will continue as scheduled, CNN-IBN reported. India has seen deadly stampedes at religious events before. In October at least 115 died, when Hindu pilgrims crossing a bridge to a temple broke into a panic, as a rumor spread that the bridge was about to give way. About 25,000 people were on the bridge at the time, and many jumped off it into the Sindh River. In February, at least 36 died at a stampede at a train station, as millions of people clamored to get to the Ganges River for a Hindu religious festival.","The pandemonium injured at least 60 more people, CNN-IBN reported .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's Presidential Election Commission has delayed, from Thursday until a date to be announced, the release of the results of Egypt's presidential election, state-run Nile TV reported Wednesday. ""The committee has not completed the verification of a total of 400 electoral violation reports submitted by the two presidential candidates,"" said Tarek Shibl, a senior member of electoral committee. ""Most probably the announcement of the election results will be delayed a day or two but nothing is final yet."" Earlier Wednesday, the former ruler, ousted Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak, was removed from life-support equipment, his health improved a day after a state-run news agency reported that he was ""clinically dead,"" his attorney said. ""The hospital will issue a statement shortly about his official medical status to curb the rumors and confusion from last night about his death reported by irresponsible media that has driven the country into a state of madness,"" Farid El Deeb, Mubarak's attorney, said Wednesday. The official Middle East News Agency reported late Tuesday that Mubarak was clinically dead; the nation's military rulers denied it. ""He is not clinically dead as reported, but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition,"" said Gen. Mamdouh Shahin, a member of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Nile TV issued a similar report Wednesday. Mubarak, 84, was reported to have been taken Tuesday to a military hospital in Cairo after suffering a stroke in prison. But reports of Mubarak's failing health have taken a back seat to the political and constitutional turmoil in the country. The results of last weekend's runoff between Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak, and Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, remain uncertain. ""It's all in the hands"" of election officials and not the military council,"" said SCAF spokesman Lt. Col. Mohamed Askar. Shafik and Mosri each proclaimed himself winner in the race to succeed Mubarak 16 months after a popular uprising ended his three-decade rule. Thousands of Egyptians gathered Tuesday night in Cairo's Tahrir Square -- the birthplace of the anti-Mubarak ferment -- to show their support for their preferred candidate. Each side in the election has accused the other of voting irregularities and called for an investigation. Both presidential candidates claim victory in Egypt . Judges for Egypt, an independent group citing unofficial projections, told reporters Wednesday that Morsi had won. Mahmoud Ghozlan, a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman, said that if Shafik is ""proclaimed a winner tomorrow, then it's sheer forgery."" Observers have been questioning how much authority the president -- whoever he turns out to be -- will have given that SCAF last week stripped the position of much of its power. ""I'm uncertain where we are going,"" Salma Othman, a 32-year-old Cairo real estate agent, told CNN. ""Why are we electing a president if SCAF is issuing a constitutional decree limiting the powers of the president?"" ""Nothing's changed, everyone's negative,"" said Massa el Gamal, an 18-year-old Cairo student. ""I would hope that the new president would bring the people together, but what's happening now is that they are driving people against each other. Don't they know that they will be president of all Egyptians? By the way, I didn't vote because I'm not convinced with either candidate,"" she said. Hani Abou Gabal, a 42-year-old public relations manager, said the military rulers were doing all they could to ""not give up the country to the Muslim Brotherhood."" What is the Muslim Brotherhood? ""I hope it will be the liberal who wins -- I mean Shafik -- and I think there will be some blood before it calms down,"" he said. ""Egypt will stabilize -- only by force. Force is the only way to deal with Egyptian mentality."" Shafik is also the favorite for Magda Abdel-Fattah, a 57-year-old human resources manager, because she doesn't want her ""civilization"" and ""culture erased."" ""In all cases, it will be chaotic,"" she said. ""In my view, the mob are the ones in the street today (protesting). The cultured revolutionaries are home are in their homes."" Military rulers dissolved the lower house of parliament last week, extending their power and sparking accusations of a coup. The military council announced it had full legislative authority. The Muslim Brotherhood, the country's largest Islamist group, was the dominant party in the parliament. Under an interim constitutional declaration released Monday, the military council retains the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new constitution is written and a new parliament elected. The declaration says Supreme Council members ""shall decide all matters related to military affairs, including the appointment of its leaders."" The president has the power to declare war, it says, but only ""after the approval"" of the Supreme Council. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, whose Carter Center observed the elections, which issued preliminary findings about the runoff -- said Tuesday that he was ""deeply troubled by the undemocratic turn"" in Egypt's transition. How Egypt's generals cut the revolution down to size . ""The dissolution of the democratically elected parliament and the return of elements of martial law generated uncertainty about the constitutional process before the election,"" he said in a written statement. ""The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces' new Constitutional Declaration, in which they carve out special privileges for the military and inject themselves into the constitution drafting process, violates their prior commitment to the Egyptian people to make a full transfer of power to an elected civilian government."" More than 800 people died and 6,000 were wounded during the uprising that ended Mubarak's 29-year rule in February 2011. The ex-president and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were convicted of ordering security forces to kill anti-government protesters and this month were given life terms. But other top aides -- as well as Mubarak's two sons, who had been tried on corruption charges -- were acquitted. Mubarak became president after the in October 1981 assassination of his predecessor, Anwar Sadat. Mubarak ruled Egypt with an iron hand and as a staunch ally of the United States, which gives the nation $1.3 billion a year in military aid. Prior to his sentencing, Mubarak was already suffering from health problems; he attended court on a gurney. Citizens were cynical or fatalistic about the Mubarak health scare Tuesday. Othman, the Cairo real estate agent, referred to the health scare as a ""dishonest staged play."" She said she thinks rumors have been spread ""to divert attention from election results."" El Gamal, the Cairo student, said she believes the latest accounts about Mubarak's health were staged to evoke ""sympathy from the street."" Whatever happens to Mubarak in the short term, he is ""finished,"" Abdel-Fattah said. ""Mubarak died a year and half ago as far as I'm concerned,"" the human resources manager said.

"London (CNN) -- Raising their family in London, Nigerians Chris and Ada Ngoforo were keen for their children to stay in touch with their West African heritage. But the couple became concerned that their three young daughters didn't speak any Igbo, one of Nigeria's ethnic languages. ""We thought amongst ourselves what we can do to actually help them to learn Igbo more,"" says Chris Ngoforo. This desire to encourage their children to connect with their roots, coupled with an increasing frustration with the difficulty in finding black dolls that resonated with their daughters, led the entrepreneurial couple to take matters into their hands. What started as a way of helping their daughters engage with their heritage quickly became a business opportunity. Soon after, the couple launched their own range of toys, called Rooti Dolls, programmed to speak in several native African languages and promote positive self-images. ""We observed that over 90% of children born or living in the diaspora and millions in Africa do not speak or understand their mother tongues,"" says Ngoforo. ""Our research made us understand that the reason for this is not because our children don't want to learn their mother tongues, but more because there are not many essential tools that can easily be both educational and fun at the same time."" Read this: Monopoly moves to Africa with Lagos edition . So far, the couple has produced a range of 12 dolls from different African countries. Each one can speak a combination of languages, and each one has her own story. Amongst them, there's Nina, a ""vibrant girl"" with Nigerian parents, who ""loves watching Nollywood"" and can interact in the Nigerian languages of Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, and Ibibio; there's Ama, a ""bubbling dynamic girl"" whose ""dream is to be a doctor someday,"" and can speak the Ghanaian languages of Twi, Ga, Ewe and Krobo; and there's also Keza, with parents from Zimbabwe and Zambia. She ""loves adventures, reading and listening to beautiful music"" and can communicate in Shona, Ndebele, Bemba, and Nyanja. Ngoforo says the toys, which come in different shades of skin color, are designed to break down stereotypes and to provide a more accurate representation of black people. ""Over the years my wife and I have found it extremely hard finding real black dolls that can truly connect with our little daughters,"" he says. ""The dolls out there in the market are nothing close to the real image of a black child in terms of features and other attributes -- they are either too thin, too light or chiseled-faced, and even the complexions of most of the dolls are kind of whitewashed,"" says Ngoforo. ""The unfortunate effect of this stereotypical misrepresentation is a case of low self-esteem among black children who have been directly or indirectly made to believe less in themselves as a black child. They have been made to believe that you have to look like a white doll to be accepted as beautiful or even good."" Debbie Behan Garrett, author of ""The Definitive Guide to Collecting Black Dolls,"" says that black dolls have changed a lot over the years. In the early days of black dolls, she explains, many of them were negative characterizations with exaggerated facial features, including protruding eyes, broader-than-normal noses and accentuated lips that were often painted red. These dolls frequently maintained a posture of servitude as butlers or ""mammies."" Read this: African slave traditions live on in U.S. ""Today's black dolls have evolved from negative caricatures to play-scale representations of haute couture fashion models and other positive images of babies, toddlers and adult black people,"" says Garrett. She adds, however, that while today's dolls are more positive representations, ""a lack of black dolls is a constant, as black-doll manufacture is often a second thought for those in the business of producing dolls in their image."" But for Garrett, access to dolls can only achieve so much in terms of promoting a positive self image. ""In addition to a black child owning dolls and other playthings that positively reflect their image, exposure to literature, art and other positive images will aid in the development of a healthy cultural awareness and appreciation,"" she says. That was the inspiration behind the Queens of Africa project, an educational initiative developed by Nigerian entrepreneur Taofick Okoya. Using a mix of dolls, books, comics and music, Queens of Africa is aiming to help children in Nigeria and beyond to identify and appreciate their culture. ""The crucial part of the formative years of children is between four-nine years,"" says Okoya."" This is the time to load them with valuable information that they can draw on as adults."" Similarly to the Ngoforos, Okoya's foray into the business was inspired by his family. Some five years ago, he went into an upmarket Lagos store to buy a doll as a birthday present for his young niece, but left disappointed. ""I wanted to buy her something that would be quite encouraging or instrumental in her development,"" he says. ""I realized that they had an array of different dolls but none of them were black and they were rather pricey."" Read this: Boy scares off lions with flashy invention . That gave Okoya food for thought and after some initial research, he decided to launch the Queens of Africa black dolls, each one representing different tribes in the continent. Later on, he decided to expand the project by launching a series of fun and educational books, songs and cartoons based on the dolls' characters. ""The dolls will help the Nigerian/African [children] be better people because they would be proud and confident in who they are as a race,"" says Okoya. ""The comics, books and animation stories is the medium we use to enlighten and educate children on our history and culture."" Garett says that exposure to this kind of information can help African children learn about their roots, as well as proudly pass on their heritage to future generations. ""It is imperative for African or any non-white child to possess or have access to playthings that reflect their image positively,"" she says.","A new range of dolls has has been created to help African children connect with their roots .

"(CNN) -- The biggest technology story of 2013 is one of the biggest stories of the year, period. It has had serious implications in the United States and around the world, and half a year later its true impact is only beginning to be felt. In June, the Guardian first published leaked documents from National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. The classified documents contained information about highly confidential government programs that collect massive amounts of data about Americans' cell phone calls and Internet activities . The scope of the program has led to lawsuits and protests, a public debate about the right to privacy versus the government's need to secretly collect information for security. Another big story this year was cybersecurity, illustrated by a string of attacks by hackers against news organizations, major tech companies and retailers. The motivations behind the attacks varied: Some, like the recent Target breach, were financially motivated, while others were political statements or acts of espionage. They all highlighted the limits of online security and privacy. It was a year when established tech companies struggled to reinvent themselves. Microsoft continued to push its new Windows 8 operating system and Windows 8 smartphones, even going as far as to buy the No. 1 maker of Windows phones, Nokia's mobile division. In the end, it wasn't enough and the company decided on one more big change: a new CEO. A bright spot for Microsoft could be its new game console, the Xbox One, which is competing against Sony's new PlayStation 4. Apple didn't have to switch much up to stay popular. It announced an expected update to its iPhone and iPad lines with the usual fanfare, slimming down and speeding up the devices, throwing in some flashy features like a fingerprint scanner and new colors to keep the masses interested. A more dramatic overhaul was of the iOS 7 mobile operating system, which was flattened, simplified and updated. Twitter went public and released a new social micro-video app called Vine, Snapchat broke out of the naughty-messaging market and made ""ephemeral"" communications a hot feature, and virtual currency Bitcoin skyrocketed in price while people waited to see if it would drop back down to Earth. Some of 2013's big stories were just previews of what's to come in 2014. Wearable technology moved from the hype stage to the prototype stage, but Google Glass and the myriad of not-ready-for-prime-time smartwatches just showed the industry still has a lot more work to do (on design and social norms) before these gadgets are hot holiday items. Tune in next year and see whether face-mounted computers become a socially acceptable accessory, 3-D printed guns become something to worry about and original content from sites like Amazon and Netflix can take on TV.","Revelations about the scope of the NSA's snooping lead to the year's biggest tech stores .

"(CNN) -- The heat was off Roger Federer as he joined fellow grand slam winners Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray in the final 16 at the Australian Open. Federer zipped through a 6-2 6-2 6-3 win over unseeded Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili as the searing temperatures eased in Melbourne and distinctly grayer skies loomed over the show courts. The 32-year-old is chasing a fifth title in Australia and an 18th career grand slam but for now Federer is grateful for small mercies after a niggling back injury saw him lose form in 2013. ""I'm just happy waking up in the morning and not feeling like an old man,"" he told reporters. ""So that's very positive. Right now I feel very fresh and very good physically. ""My first goal was to get through the first week, now clearly the draw is very difficult. I've done the work, I've not lost a set so far, so we'll see how it goes."" It's a French test for Federer next as he faces Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the 10th seed, for a place in the quarterfinals. If he advances to the final eight, Federer would face Murray -- the man who beat him in an absorbing Australian semifinal last season. Murray, the Wimbledon champion, battled through a first set tiebreak to see off Spain's Feliciano Lopez for his place in the last 16, where he faces unseeded Frenchman Stephane Robert. Confident was the word Nadal ominously used to describe how he was feeling after he breezed through with a 6-1 6-2 6-3 win over Gael Monfils. ""Well today I think I have to say that I played well from everywhere, no?"" the Spanish world No. 1 teased reporters after his match in Melbourne. In the women's draw, defending champion Victoria Azarenka lost just one game as she whizzed into the fourth round in Melbourne. There she will face American Sloane Stephens in a rematch of last year's semifinal when Azarenka caused a stir by taking a medical timeout just as Stephens appeared to have the upper hand in the second set. ""We left it all here last year,"" said Azarenka, when asked if she had spoken to Stephens about the incident. ""That's what is important for me, to play another match. I'm looking forward to it."" Russian third seed Maria Sharapova hit her way through a tight second set to see off France's Alize Cornet 6-1 7-6 while fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska and Jelena Jankovic also advanced. But there was disappointment for Danish 10th seed Caroline Wozniacki as she lost 6-4 5-7 3-6 to unseeded Spaniard Garbine Muguruza. Wozniacki, who is engaged to golfer Rory McIlroy, said she now intends to zone out from the Australian Open -- although she said it politely of course. ""When I'm not in the tournament anymore, it sounds rude, but I don't really look at the games anymore,"" she explained.","Four-time Australian Open winner Roger Federer reaches last 16 .

"(CNN) -- British rocker Jackie Lomax, who recorded with legendary stars but whose own career always seemed a degree removed from fame, died at the age of 69 this week. The singer-songwriter-guitarist enjoyed a 50-year career playing with many of music's biggest stars -- notably the Beatles -- but personal commercial success eluded Lomax. ""It was always about the music,"" a statement on his website announcing his death Sunday ""after a short illness"" in Merseyside, England, said. Lomax played in several British rock groups, including The Undertakers, in the early 1960s, following and crossing the path of the Beatles performing in Liverpool and in Hamburg pubs. He was eventually signed to the Beatles' Apple Records as a songwriter and artist, with George Harrison producing and writing songs for Lomax. ""Jackie Lomax is a singer of energy and passion,"" the note on his 1969 Apple album ""Is This What You Want?"" said. ""His roots are in R&B and in the best tradition of blue-eyed soul (even if his eyes are green). There's a toughness to his vocal style and a sensitive side too; his songs speak of loss and longing, love and life. Is this what you want? What more can there be?"" His studio sessions never produced hits despite having three Beatles -- Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr -- recording with him. ""Jackie deeply appreciated the fans who followed him throughout his 50-year career and his family and friends would like to thank each and every one of you for your support and loyalty,"" his website said. ""Three generations of the Lomax family were there to mourn the passing not just of a wonderful singer, songwriter and musician but of a father, a grandfather, a friend and partner."" Lomax never gave up on music.

"New York (CNN) -- The premiere of ""Gone with the Wind"" took place in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1939, but not without a territorial struggle of its own, a war between the states of California and Georgia. Producer David O. Selznick of course wanted it in Hollywood. But William B. Hartsfield, the feisty mayor of Atlanta, with a rampant Junior League and the full force of its citizenry behind him, argued it was ""their"" story and won the day. Selznick was terrified that he and the hyper-glittery event would be ridiculed by Northerners. Margaret Mitchell, by then a Pulitzer Prize winner and long past her scapegrace flapper days, was terrified the movie would be a vulgar travesty, embarrassing her in front of her friends. It was, of course, a triumph -- for the South it was like a sweet vindication for their humiliation at the hands of Sherman's army. For Selznick, the biggest gamble of his life would go on to win 10 Oscars and become a success beyond his wildest dreams. In its day the longest and most expensive film ever made, it had cost $4,250,000 to produce. It would go on to become a global hit and, with dollars adjusted for inflation, it remains the biggest blockbuster of all time. But the tensions and ironies present at the premiere were an indication of fault lines that, without ever completely tarnishing the film as an audience favorite, would plague its 70-year history. How could it not be so in a movie that told ""our"" nation's history, the Civil War and Reconstruction, from the unreconstructed South's point of view? A hundred-thousand people turned out on a bitter cold night and there were bands on every street and old men marching in Confederate uniforms. The stars arrived in full force ... the white ones, that is. Not permitted to attend the premiere in segregated Atlanta were the black cast members, including Hattie McDaniel, who would go on to win an Academy Award for her portrayal of Mammy (and would be the first black to do so). Among the three days of festivities was an all-white Junior League ball serenaded by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir, an all-black boys choir directed by the Rev. Martin Luther King Sr. and including a 6-year-old Martin Luther King Jr. among its members. Many of the young who watch ""Gone with the Wind"" today are horrified -- not only are all blacks slaves, but they are also apparently content with their lot; Reconstruction is an unalloyed disaster. Yet calling the movie racially retrograde is a misnomer. It is very much of its time and place, it's just that we can't bear to look at that time and place -- itself a mark of how far we've progressed. Most critics today wouldn't touch ""Gone with the Wind"" with a 10-foot pole -- it's easier to dismiss it as racist or overblown or an apologia for the plantation culture than to take a fresh look at how it has fared and why it has endured for 70 years. I'm speaking from experience, as I recently published a book about ""Gone with the Wind"" -- the novel and film. While doing some National Public Radio interviews and responding to listeners' questions, I was struck by how the film continues to raise tempers and inflame feelings. An elderly gent from South Carolina ranted on about Sherman's burning of the local church, while a youngish black woman said the movie should be consigned to the dustbin of history ... after admitting she'd seen it 500 times. But no less surprising was the huge number of well-considered (and favorable) online responses -- a long, thoughtful appreciation by a black female historian, another from a black male librarian in North Carolina, and other passionate pro-""Gone with the Wind"" responses from across the spectrum, some under the guise of ""guilty pleasure."" Young-ish black women have told me of responding to the book as teenagers, much as I did, even reading it under the covers with a flashlight. For my generation, Scarlett was outspoken, a renegade, a feminist in hoop skirts, maybe the first of a long line of teenage rebels with a barely defined cause, a vendetta against grown-up hypocrisy. For my generation of '50s adolescents, it was the book's raciness that made it deliciously taboo (Margaret Mitchell said her own mother wouldn't have let her read it until she was 18). For young black teenagers in the '70s and '80s, it wasn't the raciness as much as the rebellion, the stubborn selfishness of Scarlett -- and they were defying parents who would be horrified to know their daughters could sympathize in any way with a slave-owning plantation mistress. Yes, the movie may be overblown, may be guilty of giving the South an undeserved moral victory, yet it tells a complicated story in swift, riveting brushstrokes, pulls out all the emotional stops so that even those of us not besotted with the film can hardly resist individual scenes: Just try to stop watching once engaged. Crafted by the geniuses of the studio system, ""Gone with the Wind"" is a panoramic epic that never loses sight of its main characters, and -- also startling to young viewers today -- those characters endure vast quantities of pain and suffering in a world turned upside down. There are star-crossed lovers (the fierce beauty of Vivien Leigh, the gentleness beneath the swagger of Clark Gable), the agony of war, of economic loss and devastation, the resilience of a woman who won't accept defeat. Most original of all is Scarlett herself (you hate her and you love her), a heroine of ambiguous morality who is revolutionary in Hollywood terms in that she refuses to be chastened, brought to heel, transformed by love. The movie crosses race and gender lines and shows that single-issue sympathies are out of date. We can finally take a more nuanced approach, appreciate just how majestic Hattie McDaniel's performance is. (When she was criticized at the time by the NAACP she famously retorted, ""I'd rather get paid $700 a week playing a maid than $7 a week being one."") After the controversy, Hollywood made a concerted effort to expand roles for blacks. It has been a slow and arduous process as we can see by the fact that despite a record number of African-American performers, no black director has won an Oscar. But if there'd been no ""Gone with the Wind,"" it might have started later and taken even longer. The movie is a cultural touchstone that, as one reader wrote to The Wall Street Journal, ""shows us not only where we've been, but also how far we've come.""

"(CNN) -- As captain of the Neptune tugboat, Viktor Nikolsky spends his days gently directing giant cargo vessels in and around the vast port of St. Petersburg, Russia. It's a job that requires patience, concentration and flawless planning. But life on the water wasn't always so rigidly structured -- far from it. Behind the sailor's steely visage lie memories of distant shores, daring adventures and a terrifying ordeal at the hands of pirates. A boat in the distance . Nikolsky hesitates when recalling the moment he realized armed bandits were fast approaching his ship off the coast of Somalia. As the first mate of the MV Faina, Nikolsky was in charge of 21 crewmen and cargo aboard the Ukrainian operated freight vessel transporting aging Soviet military equipment to the port of Mombasa, Kenya, via the Gulf of Aden. See also: Where are the world's piracy hotspots? ""We knew that the Somalian region was very dangerous for navigation and we planned our way to stay 250 miles from the shore,"" Nikolsky explained. On the September 25, 2008, however, the ship's second officer approached Nikolsky to inform him he had spotted two small dots in the distance moving towards the Faina at speed. Despite sailing more than five times the recommended distance from the coast as a precaution against hijacking, the fast moving dots were speedboats carrying heavily armed pirates. The assailants boarded the Faina and searched below the ship's decks, quickly realizing they had chanced upon valuable cargo. ""When they saw what kind of cargo they were surprised,"" Nikolsky said. ""They put the prize for liberation to $50 million dollars. The usual prize for liberation was approximately not more than $1 million."" Hostage at sea . The discovery of the military cargo signaled the beginning of a four month standoff between the pirates and a host of parties with an interest in reclaiming the ship, including NATO, the U.S. Navy and the Kenyan government. See also: Welcome aboard the world's biggest ship . A U.S. Navy ship kept watch of the Faina from a distance while pirates patrolled the decks. Bargaining chips in the middle of all this were Nikolsky and his crew. At the time of the attack, the ship's captain, Vladimir Kolobkov, had taken seriously ill, tragically passing away a week later. This meant Nikolsky was in command when the pirates attacked. They decided to separate him from his colleagues. Nikolsky remained under guard on the ship's bridge while the remaining crew members were held in a small cabin roughly 14 meters across. ""I spent all my highjacking life on the table like that (pointing to a small dinner table) without anything."" As the days and weeks passed, Nikolsky began to talk to the leader of the pirates, eventually gaining his trust. He negotiated better conditions for the hostages as well as permission to go above deck to get some fresh air. ""The crew was under control all the time. I insisted (they) must have a rest, must have a walk at the open air. Because if a person lies (down) all the time, he will have a problem with his stomach. During these breaks, the crew would talk to each other and even plot to take on the pirates if the opportunity arose. See also: What happens to goods lost at sea? At one stage, when it looked as though a ransom would not be achieved, the pirates intimated they would transfer the crew to Somalia in order to obtain a separate ransom for each individual. Nikolsky said his heart sank at this moment. Free at last . Finally, on the February 5, 2009, an agreement with the pirates was reached which saw them receive $3.2 million, a fraction of what they originally asked for. They left, and the ship and crew free to go. For Nikolsky, it signaled the end of four months of unrelenting pressure. ""We couldn't believe it,"" he said of their moment of liberation. ""We were afraid that the pirates when they left the vessel left some explosive."" ""I asked the commander of the navy (who boarded the Faina shortly after the pirates disembarked) to check everything. He told us that everything was clear and all the pirates left the vessel."" The Faina sailed into the port of Mombasa, Kenya, a few days later where Nikolsky was reunited with his wife and family. On their return to Russia, the family resolved that Viktor should seek a job that would be less unpredictable than life at sea. That decision has led Nikolsky to St. Petersburg where he navigates vessels 10 times the size of his own into and out of the city's harbor. But while he enjoys being close to his family, that itch for life at sea still remains. ""Sometimes when I dream I see the very clear water and my ship moving over the clear water in open sea,"" he said. ""But I spent at sea all of my life, 45 years ... (and) now I like my village, I like my job here."" Eoghan Macguire contributed to this article .","Viktor Nikolsky is the captain of the Neptune tugboat in the port of St. Petersburg .

"(CNN) -- The Nigerian senate has passed a bill banning same-sex marriages, defying a threat from Britain to withhold aid from nations violating gay rights. The bill by Africa's most populous nation calls for a 14-year sentence for anyone convicted of homosexuality. Anyone who aids or ""abets"" same-sex unions faces 10 years in prison, a provision that could target rights groups. It goes to the nation's House of Representatives for a vote before President Goodluck Jonathan can sign it into law. ""It would place a wide range of people at risk of criminal sanctions, including human rights defenders and anyone else -- including friends, families and colleagues -- who stands up for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people in Nigeria,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. The bill passed Tuesday comes nearly a month after British prime minister, David Cameron, threatened to withhold aid from nations violating gays rights, sparking outrage in Africa where leaders interpreted it as ""colonial"" display of power. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the British colonial era and perpetuated by cultural beliefs. Punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison. ""This is something we raise continually and ... we're also saying that British aid should have more strings attached in terms of 'do you persecute people for their faith or their Christianity or do you persecute people for their sexuality?"" Cameron said in a statement. ""We don't think that's acceptable. So look, this is an issue where we want movement, we're pushing for movement, we're prepared to put some money behind what we believe."" Soon after his remarks earlier this month, a flurry of African governments released defiant statements accusing him of undermining their sovereignty and culture. Last week, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, known for his anti-gay rhetoric, called the prime minister ""satanic"" for demanding gay rights. ""Do not get tempted into that (homosexuality) madness. You are young people. If you go that direction, we will punish you severely,"" state media quoted him as saying. ""It is condemned by nature. It is condemned by insects and that is why I have said they are worse than pigs and dogs."" Mugabe's comments were the latest in a series of strident remarks by African leaders. Ugandan government spokesman Fred Opolot described Cameron's remarks as ""patronizing, colonial rhetoric,"" saying the nation is busy expanding its oil sector to reduce its reliance on aid. ""We are working hard to limit our reliance on foreign governments for this reason,"" he said. ""Statements like the one Cameron is making are false. Our cultural norms and values don't accept homosexuality, but there is no policy against gay people."" In 2009, a Ugandan lawmaker introduced a proposal calling for execution of people convicted of homosexuality. The proposal sparked an international outcry and threats from some European countries to cut aid to the nation, which relies on millions of dollars from foreign nations. Opolot said the proposal was the opinion of a sole lawmaker and did not reflect the government view. The legislation was eventually shelved, but regularly pops up in parliament and remains a simmering issue. Ghanaian President John Atta Mills, a major western ally, applauded the benefits of foreign aid, but said the nation will not accept money that will undermine its interest. ""I will never initiate or support any attempt to legalize homosexuality in Ghana,"" he told journalists this month, according to state media. ""As government we will abide by the principles as contained in our Constitution, which is supreme."" Tanzanian officials decried the remarks, saying they ""can lead to broken relations"" between the two nations. Cameron's statements also sparked a fiery debate among Africans on social media, where opinions were divided. ""At first, I was upset. I thought, how dare he treats us like this?' said Nigel Mugamu, 33, who lives in Harare, Zimbabwe. ""Then I thought about it,"" the businessman said. ""The U.K. economy is struggling. They spend a lot of money on aid. Given what's happening economically. Maybe it's a nice way of saying -- we can't afford it?"" Mugamu said the threat should be an opportunity to open up a dialogue on an issue considered a taboo in African culture. ""Now is the time to talk about it ... to get our house in order. Lets use this opportunity to say, 'OK, if we didn't have aid, how would we survive?"" he said. ""Let's talk about gay rights issues. Let's turn this into a national -- African discussion."" Others said while denying aid would be extreme, the continent has a long way to go when it comes to human rights. ""It would be ridiculous if that mentality -- pride from leaders on both sides -- got in the way of millions benefiting from aid,"" said Aida Mbowa, a Stanford University doctorate student who lives in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi. However, she said, the threat thrusts the issue to the forefront. ""We need minority rights in the continent. There's a part of me that knows this threat will not have much of an impact. But in a way, it's an achievement, however small. Despite the differences in opinion ... it has brought the conversation out in the open."" The Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya said while Cameron's remarks are a positive gesture, they risk turning homosexuals into targets. It urged the prime minister to instead consider directing some aid to community programs aimed at fostering dialogue and tolerance. ""Support national and regional human rights mechanisms to ensure the inclusiveness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues in their protective and promotional mandates,"" the group said. As the prejudices rage on, gays and lesbians in the continent lead fidgety lives, including forming underground movements that change locations regularly for safety issues. Sexual violence against lesbians has become so common in South Africa, the nation has coined a new term ""corrective rape"" to describe it. South Africa -- one of the more progressive nations in the continent on the issue -- was the first African country to impose a constitutional ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation. Cameron said he does not expect a sudden change in mindsets, and admits it will take time. Journalist Columbus S.

"(CNN) -- The United States and its allies aren't ""blind"" or ""stupid"" when it comes to negotiations with Iran, Washington's top diplomat said Sunday after nuclear talks with the Islamic republic broke up without an agreement. ""We are absolutely determined that this would be a good deal, or there'll be no deal,"" Secretary of State John Kerry told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""This is a new overture, and it has to be put to the test very, very carefully,"" he added. But Israel's prime minister cheered the failure of the talks, saying the agreement reportedly on the table would have been a ""jackpot"" for Iran. Iran's president, meanwhile, tried to reassure his parliament that he won't trade away Tehran's ability to produce nuclear fuel in any agreement to lift international sanctions. After two days of foreign minister-level talks, negotiations between Iran and the five U.N. Security Council members plus Germany ended in Geneva, Switzerland, early Sunday. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, told reporters, ""A lot of concrete progress has been achieved, but some differences remain."" Negotiations are set to resume November 20, with Ashton and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif attending. ""I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that's important,"" Zarif said. ""And that gives us the impetus to go forward."" Iran insists its aims are peaceful . Iran has refused U.N. Security Council demands to halt its production of enriched uranium, which can be used to power nuclear reactors or in extremely high concentrations, to make an atomic bomb. It insists it wants to build civilian power plants, but Western powers and Israel accuse it of harboring ambitions for a nuclear weapon. U.N. inspectors reported in 2011 that they could no longer verify the Iranian program was strictly peaceful. Iran's refusal to stop enriching uranium has led to sanctions that have crippled its economy, slashing its crude oil exports and triggering widespread inflation at home. But President Hassan Rouhani, whose overtures to the West since taking office in August raised hopes of a deal, said Sunday that Tehran has its own ""red lines"" that his government won't cross. ""The rights of the Iranian nation and national interests are our red lines, and those rights include nuclear rights within the framework of international law, as well as enrichment on Iranian soil,"" Rouhani told lawmakers, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. But nonproliferation expert Joseph Cirincione told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that the outlines of a deal appear clear, and he expected one would be clinched ""very soon."" ""We've seen some remarkable developments over the last couple days, including the normalization of U.S and Iranian dialogue,"" Cirincione said. ""We now take it for granted that the secretary of state should talk to Iran's foreign minister, but that hadn't happened in 34 years until last September."" What's on the table in talks . Two senior U.S. administration officials said that in the proposal on the table, Iran would agree to stop enriching uranium to a concentration of 20% -- well above the level needed to fuel a nuclear power plant, though still far below what's needed to produce a nuclear weapon. Tehran would render most of its existing stockpile of 20% enriched uranium unusable under the proposal. In addition, it would agree not to use its advanced IR-2 centrifuges, which can operate five times faster than older models used in its enrichment plants. And it wouldn't activate a heavy-water reactor at Arak, which can be used to produce plutonium. That's a demand that France in particular insisted upon, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said. Iran's nuclear capabilities . The officials said that in return, the P5+1 powers of the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China and Germany would unfreeze some Iranian assets held in banks overseas and consider easing sanctions banning trade in gold, precious metals and petrochemicals. Other sweeteners were also under consideration, they said. One of the officials said the deal was designed to delay the point at which Iran could develop a nuclear weapon while providing temporary, reversible sanctions relief. But Fabius told radio station France Inter on Saturday that while Paris wanted a deal, it wouldn't agree to a ""fool's game"" -- and that the proposal on the table at that time was unsatisfactory. ""Thank God for France,"" U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a leading Republican who is pushing for another round of sanctions on Iran, told CNN's ""State of the Union."" The Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, told ABC's ""This Week"" that the United States ""can't want the deal more than Iranians."" Graham: New sanctions on Iran needed . And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had criticized the negotiations last week, told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that Iran should have to dismantle its existing centrifuges and the Arak reactor as part of any agreement. ""Iran gives practically nothing, and it gets a hell of a lot. That's not a good deal,"" Netanyahu said. He said other Arab states shared his opinion. ""And you know, when you have the Arabs and Israelis speaking in one voice -- it doesn't happen very often -- I think it's worth paying attention to."" Kerry: We know what we're doing . Kerry told NBC that critics are underestimating the negotiators. ""Some of the most serious and capable, expert people in our government, who have spent a lifetime dealing both with Iran as well as with nuclear weapon and nuclear armament and proliferation, are engaged in our negotiation. We are not blind, and I don't think we're stupid,"" Kerry said. ""I think we have a pretty strong sense of how to measure whether or not we are acting in the interests of our country and of the globe, and particularly of our allies like Israel and Gulf states and others in the region."" The State Department dispatched a top Kerry deputy, Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, to Jerusalem to discuss the Geneva talks with Israeli officials, a senior State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity. For years, international leaders have been fearful of the instability a nuclear-armed Iran could bring to the Middle East. Those fears, for example, include the possibility of a pre-emptive Israeli strike that could spark a broader conflict. In the past, Iran has threatened Israel with military attack. They also include concerns that an Iranian bomb could spur other countries in the region to seek nuclear weapons of their own, leading to a spiraling arms race in the region. Israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons, though it has never declared itself to be a nuclear power.

"New York (CNN) -- When William Bratton was introduced Thursday as New York City police commissioner, the 66-year-old law enforcement veteran held up a children's book with the title, ""Your Police."" ""We must always remember that whenever you see a policeman, he is your friend,"" said Bratton, reading a passage from a book he first checked out of the library 56 years ago. But Bratton, who served as police commissioner in the 1990s, will take the helm of the nation's largest department not only at a time of low crime rates, but also heightened tension with the public over his predecessor's controversial stop-and-frisk policy that critics say targeted minorities. Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio said the appointment reflected his goal of protecting New Yorkers while simultaneously respecting their civil liberties -- echoing one theme of a mayoral campaign that was heavily critical of stop-and-frisk. ""He is going to bring police and community back together,"" de Blasio said Thursday. De Blasio praised his new commissioner as ""the leading voice"" on community policing and said he had ""absolute confidence, 100% confidence"" that Bratton would complete the double goals of keeping down crime and improving strained relations with the community. ""In the last few years in this city we have seen an approach that has too often alienated communities, has too often led to a divide between police and community in some of our neighborhoods,"" said de Blasio. The stop-and-frisk policy -- in which police stop, question and frisk people they deem suspicious, even if they've committed no crime -- has been one of the most controversial policing techniques in recent time. Opponents have challenged the practice as racist and illegal. Law enforcement and other proponents say the practice helps reduce crime. In August, a federal judge in New York ordered that stop-and-frisk be altered, finding it unconstitutional in part because it unlawfully targets blacks and Latinos. The judge ordered the appointment of a monitor to develop changes in the policy as well as other reforms. A federal appeals court later blocked the ruling that deemed stop-and-frisk unconstitutional and removed the judge from the case as other appeals are heard. But de Blasio has said that his administration will drop the appeal. The Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the most vocal critics of stop-and-frisk, said he hoped the new mayor and police commissioner work with a broader cross section of the city. ""When Bill Bratton served in New York City under Rudy Giuliani, we had a very distant and adversarial relationship, but when he served in Los Angeles, he and I ... worked closely on gang violence and police misconduct matters,"" Sharpton said. ""Mr. Bratton knows of my concerns and the concerns of others about racial profiling in stop-and-frisk policing but at the same time is aware of our desire to continue the decrease of violence and crime in our community."" Thomas Reppetto, an expert who has written numerous books about the nation's police departments, said Bratton practiced an aggressive form of policing -- including stop-and-frisk -- as commissioner under former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. ""The wild card here is we don't know what's going to happen with this federal suit,"" said Reppetto, referring to the August ruling. ""Are there going to be monitors? Is the police commissioner ultimately going to be responsible to a federal judge? Traditionally, the police department works best when it has a strong commissioner running it. But if there are people over him who can veto his orders, it won't work so well."" Ray Kelly reflects . Bratton is credited with pioneering the NYPD's CompStat, a command and accountability system that employed real-time intelligence, rapid deployment of resources and accountability systems in police work. He also was in charge of the NYPD during the largest crime reduction in New York City's history, said a statement from de Blasio. de Blasio's counterterrorism plans . Under Bratton's leadership in the mid-1990s, felony crime in New York City fell by 39%, de Blasio said. In Los Angeles, Bratton helped bring about a 26% decline in violent crime in his first three years in the top job. By 2009, the crime rate was 54% lower than it had been during his predecessor's final year. He also was praised for improving the LAPD's relationships with the city's many diverse communities. Bratton also was chief of the New York City Transit Police and Boston police commissioner. ""Bill Bratton has succeeded everywhere he's been,"" Reppetto said. ""You never want to bet against Bill Bratton."" On Thursday, Bratton talked about bringing the police and the public ""together in a collaboration of mutual respect and mutual trust."" ""I will get it right again in New York City,"" Bratton said. Said Reppetto, ""On the community relations front, I wouldn't underestimate that task.""

"(CNN) -- Federal and state authorities won't say specifically why, but they think a letter purported to be from a New Hampshire teenager missing for nearly two months might in fact be the real thing. Abigail Hernandez was last seen on October 9, according to the FBI, as she headed home from her high school in the town of Conway, and officials fear she might be held against her will. ""We are concerned for her safety,"" New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Jane Young said Friday at a news conference called to discuss the search for the girl. ""She is not out there alone. She has somebody who is either helping her, whether that be a friend or what we fear is a foe."" At the news conference, authorities revealed that Abigail's mother, Zenya Hernandez, received a letter on November 6 that appeared to be from her missing daughter. That letter was kept secret until Friday, said Young, because ""law enforcement had to take every possible step to verify its authenticity. ""And at this juncture, we believe in fact that it was written by Abby and was sent to her mother,"" Young added. Neither federal nor state authorities would discuss the contents of the letter beyond Young saying the writing is in ""a tone Abby would have used,"" and that the letter underwent ""expert analysis"" before its existence was announced publicly. Officials also said revealing details about the letter could potentially trigger ""copycat"" letters that would slow down the investigation. The letter was written on October 22, and postmarked on October 23, according to Young, and it was turned over to authorities for investigation after Zenya Hernandez received it nearly two weeks after it was postmarked. ""When we received this letter I will tell you it was unprecedented. We have not seen anything like that in recent times in other investigations, but most importantly, it gave us hope,"" FBI Special Agent Kieran Ramsey said at the news conference. Neither the girl's mother nor the rest of her family has had any contact with Abigail since the letter's arrival, said Young. Authorities said Abigail had no source of income, and on the day she disappeared she did not have winter clothes with her. Police released photos of a pocketbook and a necklace that were believed to be with the teen when she went missing. Officials from several law enforcement agencies asked that members of the community be vigilant and pay attention to their surroundings, in the hopes that someone will spot Abigail and alert authorities. ""We are asking you look at your neighbor. Look at the girls next door. Look at your church. Is there somebody that you haven't seen before?"" Young said on Friday. Initially authorities believed Abigail's disappearance may have been an abduction, and continue to believe that she may be being held against her will, but nevertheless they are continuing to classify it as a missing persons case, as all possibilities have not yet been ruled out, according to Ramsey. Information and tips on Abigail's disappearance are still flowing in from members of the community and law enforcement officials asked that anyone with knowledge of Abigail's whereabouts contact authorities. ""We need to reunite this child with her family,"" concluded Young.","15-year-old Abigail Hernandez was last seen walking home from school on October 9 .

"(CNN) -- Despite objections from popular Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, it seem the much-criticized budget deal will get final congressional approval this week, sidestepping the cooked-up dramas that have come to define the 113th Congress. Good news for those of us who like it when politicians actually do their jobs. Bad news for those who thought the Republican establishment and the tea party were going to live happily ever after. Last week House Speaker John Boehner let some of his frustrations with the far-right cohort spill out on television. He called them ""ridiculous."" He said, ""They've lost all credibility,"" and accused them of ""pushing our members in places where they don't want to be."" He even tossed in a bit of theatrics with his ""Are you kidding me?"" remark, all of which made for great sound bites. Intentionally or not, the outburst also provided a good distraction from the overhaul the Republican National Committee is planning for the 2016 primary process, which was also was reported last week. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus had talked about limiting the number of debates soon after President Barack Obama was re-elected. Now it seems the RNC is prepared to punish candidates who participate in unofficial GOP debates and forums severely by stripping them of one third of their delegates. Remember the quotes from Republican candidates all trying to out-ultra-conservative each other in 2012? Don't expect to hear as many come 2016. This, more than entertaining sound bites from Boehner, is a far more tangible sign that the establishment is serious about reining in the radical right. And by radical right, I mean the tea party. So now what? Well, 60% of Americans want a third party, and it seems Republicans want their party back. Perhaps it's time that tea party standard bearer Cruz and company file the divorce papers and see if the group has the strength to stand on its own two feet. It is, after all, unlikely that he or any of the other tea party-leaning politicians are going to forgo the group's influence and get in line with moderates just because Boehner said some harsh words on TV. And with deep-pocket groups such as Americans for Prosperity behind the tea party, why should they? Indeed, many tea partiers believe the reason Republicans lost in 2012 -- despite an economy that lagged under the first Obama administration -- was because Mitt Romney wasn't conservative enough. This thinking was echoed in November after tea partiers cited a lack of conservatism as a main reason why the anti-gay, anti-abortion Ken Cuccinelli lost in the governor's race in Virginia. Couple that with The New York Times reporting that presumptive front-runner -- and establishment darling -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is as unpopular with ultra-conservatives as he is popular with moderates, and there is no reason to believe the tea party is just going to roll over after Obama signs the budget deal into law. ""(Christie's) no more conservative than Harry Reid,"" said Scott Hofstra, a tea partier from Vine Grove, Kentucky, told the Times. With statements such as that, it's clear it's time for the GOP and the tea party to call it quits. The two had a good run retaking the House in 2010, but if a guy such as Cuccinelli doesn't pass the conservative smell test and Christie's a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, then it seems this marriage is unsalvageable. Debates within a party are healthy for Washington. But civil wars are not good for anyone, as evidenced by the country's downgraded credit rating, Congress' historically low approval numbers, the unprecedented number of appointment delays for Obama's nominees and Congress' dubious distinction of being the least productive in U.S. history. The tea party supposedly started to express the views of voters frustrated with big government. But it has quickly morphed into a thorn in the side of the Republican establishment -- prodding 2012 candidates into making outlandish statements and strong-arming leadership into a series of questionable moves. It seems it now has a critical decision to make: be reined in or break out. The scenario reminds me of the day Ronald Reagan became a Republican. It was the summer of 1962. And though he still called himself a Democrat, at this point, Reagan was so in name only. His political leanings had begun shifting in the 1940s, and he had been publicly campaigning for Republicans since the 1950s. One day, while campaigning for Richard Nixon, someone in the crowd interrupted his speech with a question. Have you registered as a Republican yet? He replied no. And then a woman identifying herself as a registrar appeared. She walked down the center aisle, placed a registration card in front of Reagan, and he signed it. He then returned to his speech, later saying, ""I didn't leave the Democratic Party, the party left me."" Last week Boehner came down the center aisle and placed a registration card in front of the tea party. But given its beliefs, funding and recent events, is there still a good reason why the group and its followers should sign it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: Should tea party split now that budget deal seems headed for approval?

"London (CNN) -- Archaeologists dug up an unmarked grave in a quiet English churchyard in search of remains of King Alfred the Great, a ninth century monarch credited with fending off the Vikings. The exhumation was apparently triggered by fears that interest over the recent discovery of the skeleton of Richard III could lead grave robbers to dig the area for his bones. Alfred the Great is known to generations of schoolchildren through a popular legend that tells of his scolding by a peasant woman for letting her cakes burn while he watched over them. He was at the time preoccupied with the problem of how to repel the Danes, who had captured swaths of Anglo-Saxon England. London rail excavation unearths suspected 'plague pit' What is thought to be his grave in the churchyard of St. Bartholomew's Church, in the Hyde area of the ancient city of Winchester, was excavated Monday and Tuesday, the Winchester diocese said in an online release. ""Following the completion of work, we can confirm that skeletal remains were discovered and have been exhumed from the grave,"" said Nick Edmonds, a diocesan spokesman. ""Understandably, there is widespread interest in this situation. For now we can't say any more about the remains, their nature or whereabouts, but promise to keep people updated when there is something to tell."" The diocese said the decision to carry out the exhumation now -- following three years of research -- was ""to counter the risk of theft or vandalism to the grave. This is in light of heightened risk owing to widespread recent speculation about the significance of its contents."" The revelation last month that bones found under a parking lot in Leicester were those of Richard III, whose story was immortalized by Shakespeare, sparked enormous interest. It also prompted competition between Leicester and another English city, York, over where he should be reinterred. Remains exhumed in Winchester will be stored safely until they are buried again, the diocese said. Skeletal sleuthing team uncovered royal remains of Richard III . No scientific tests have been carried out to find out more. ""We do acknowledge that there is local interest in learning more about the remains found in this grave,"" Edmonds said. But, he said, an application would have to be made to church authorities before any scientific investigation can take place. Despite historical significance, the church is taking precautions, said the Rev. Canon Cliff Bannister, rector of St. Batholomew's Church. ""Although we know there is historical interest in this site, our chief concern this week has been to ensure that the exhumation of human remains from a consecrated Christian burial site has been fulfilled in a reverent and dignified manner,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Famed folk singer Richie Havens, the opening act at the 1969 Woodstock music festival, died Monday of a sudden heart attack, his publicist said. He was 72. Havens, who retired three years ago, toured for more than 30 years and recorded 30 albums. Havens told Billboard that his breakthrough at Woodstock came after another artist's equipment got stuck in traffic. He was supposed to be the fifth act. ""It was 5 o'clock and nothing was happening yet,"" Havens told Billboard. ""I had the least instruments (to set up on stage) and the least people (in his band)."" So Havens went on and performed for 40 minutes, as planned. Organizers asked him to do four more songs, he told Billboard. ""I went back and did that, then it was, 'Four more songs...' and that kept happening 'til two hours and 45 minutes later, I had sung every song I know,"" he said. Havens, a Brooklyn, New York, native, told CNN in 1999 that music enabled him to leave his rough neighborhood to head to Greenwich Village and the music scene there. Music was always a part of his life. ""I believe I inherited my sense of music from my father. My father was an ear piano player; he could just hear something and play it,"" he recalls. ""I came up in Brooklyn singing doo-wop music from the time I was 13 to the time I was 20. That music served a purpose of keeping a lot of people out of trouble, and also it was a passport from one neighborhood to another."" His inspiration for songs about social change and protest came when he heard artists like Fred Neil, Dino Valenti and Tom Paxton. That's when he knew what he wanted to do with his life. ""It was the songs that actually changed my life,"" he says. ""The songs that I heard were so much different than the doo-wop kind of thing. They were just so powerful. Finally I decided, 'I've got to do this.'"" Before Woodstock, his nights were filled with playing as often as possible to make a few dollars. ""We played three coffeehouses a night, 14 sets a night, 20-minute sets, pass the basket, stay alive,"" he told CNN. ""I was there seven and a half years, every day. It was the most incredibly magic, magic time."" After Havens gained attention at Woodstock, he recorded a soulful-voiced cover of the Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun,"" which rose on the pop charts in 1970. Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills and Nash said Havens was an inspiration for the natural gravel in his singing voice. He called Havens a passionate performer. ""He lit fire when he started playing within the first song and burned exactly the same way throughout his set. And it never stopped, it never changed,"" Stills said. He added that he thought Havens' style was probably a little too arcane to appeal to a mass audience. ""But he sure knew what to do when they were begging for someone to go on first, when all those people showed up at Woodstock,"" Stills said. Havens returned to Woodstock for the 40th anniversary festival in 2009. ""While his family greatly appreciates that Richie's many fans are also mourning this loss, they do ask for privacy during this difficult time,"" a statement from his publicist, Carrie Lombardi, said. Billboard reported Havens died in New Jersey, leaving behind four daughters and five grandchildren.

"(CNN) -- So that I could best understand the depth of his revulsion for the crime, the police investigator suggested that I pay a visit to the elevator where it allegedly took place. The elevator is just a few steps inside the Canal Street entrance to Chicago's Union Station. The train station, in the decades before the jet age, was the indispensable hub for America's interstate travel. It remains, in the Amtrak era, cavernous and rife with echoes. It is as if the structure was designed to make mere mortals feel small. The vast station, when it is filled with passengers heading to and from Amtrak trains and local commuter lines, can lead a person to half-believe that in the bustle no one notices him. Unless someone is making it a point to notice. ""He is 27 years old,"" said Michael MacDonald, an investigator for Amtrak's police department. ""He is able to travel by himself. He's a very likeable guy."" The man he was talking about suffers from cerebral palsy. Physically slight, he has only one leg. He has three fingers on each hand. With determination and quiet daily courage, he is able to get around independently by using a motorized chair. ""There are people who hang around the front door and look for victims,"" MacDonald said. ""Prey."" Pickpocketing is usually the crime of choice. Officers inside the train station are on alert for thieves who attempt to relieve travelers of their wallets on escalators or stairways. MacDonald has worked in law enforcement for 30 years. Some offenses still have the power to infuriate him, because they violate not only the law, but any basic definition of humanity. As pedestrians stream through that Canal Street door, rushing to make their trains on the lower level, few even glance toward the little elevator landing to the right of the entrance. On surveillance video recorded in August, MacDonald said, the young man, trying to get to a commuter train, is clearly visible entering the station. Because he is unable to use stairs, he steers his chair to his right, toward the elevator. Also on the video are two men, MacDonald said, who ""follow him right to the elevator. Both get on with him."" The elevator is small, relatively cramped, with a low ceiling. What reportedly happens next is what is so ghastly. The man in the motorized chair has his cash and a cellphone zipped into a satchel strapped to his waist. This is his custom when he leaves the house; he lives with his mother, and the cellphone is his lifeline. On the surveillance video, the men who have followed him to the elevator -- later identified by police and by the Cook County State's Attorney's office as Demetrius Thomas, 48, and Terrell Jones, 49 -- strike up a conversation with him. Then, according to investigators, one guards the elevator door to make certain no one else tries to enter, while the other reaches down and takes what he wants from the man in the chair. They allegedly take his phone and cash. They seem to be in no hurry; because of his missing fingers, he cannot grasp the items as they are taken from him. He does his best to resist, but it is as if the men are casually removing items from a store shelf. Then, leaving him in the elevator, they simply walk away and go back into the city. The young man, alone in the busy train station, told an Amtrak police officer what had been done to him. (""Nothing like this had ever happened to me before,"" the young man told me the other afternoon. ""I tried to respond to it with as much grace as I could. But after it was over, it just felt like such an indignity."") From the surveillance video, investigators made still photos and showed them around. One officer assigned to Union Station recognized Demetrius Thomas as a man who had been warned to stay out of the terminal. The next time he showed up he was arrested for criminal trespass and, according to MacDonald, said that Terrell Jones had been his accomplice in the elevator robbery. A Chicago police detective knew where to find Terrell Jones: in Cook County Jail. It seems that, one day after the Union Station robbery, he had been arrested for a crime a few miles away. At the Northwestern Memorial Hospital complex, a 75-year-old woman was visiting her ailing husband. Alone in an elevator, she was easy pickings. Police had apprehended Terrell Jones for allegedly robbing her. Both men face eight felony counts for what they allegedly did to the young man in Union Station. They have entered not guilty pleas; I asked a representative of the office of the Cook County public defender whether the lawyers assigned to the men would discuss the case or comment on it, and he declined on their behalf. What we refer to as the justice system will now kick in. Cases such as this one can come and go, news blips competing for the attention of a busy public already barraged by torrents of bad news. Strong-arm crimes against those least able to defend themselves are on occasion described as ""petty"" when the victim is not seriously injured. Judges sometimes allow offenders to plead to lesser charges, to speed up the process and unclog the overloaded courts system. The assistant state's attorney prosecuting the case -- Mary Lou Norwell -- specializes in crimes against the elderly and the disabled. It has come to this: The very people whom society as a whole should be most dedicated to helping are instead so often targets of soulless crime that a special subcategory of prosecution has been developed to deal with those who would hurt them. Once we begin to shrug at the inevitability of such crimes -- once we begin to accept that, in a cold world, this is just the way things are -- we are heading down a dark and sorry path. Because once we stop caring, we, too, have been robbed of something precious. The young man's cellphone and his money, Investigator MacDonald told me, are long gone; he will never see them. ""I count my blessings,"" the young man told me. ""I don't want to be a 'woe-is-me' type. I've never been that kind of person."" Out of a sense of duty, he rode a train back into the city so that he could attend a police lineup to identify the alleged offenders. There will be status hearings and continuances, and eventually, when and if the case goes to trial, the young man will, in his motorized chair, with considerable difficulty make his way to the courthouse to testify. When he entered the train-station elevator that day, the two men who followed him became an unwanted part of his life for years to come. He had no say. The victims never do.

"(CNN) -- Country singer Trace Adkins suffered ""a setback in his battle with alcoholism"" and has entered a rehab facility for help, his representative told CNN on Thursday. Adkins, 52, was on the ""Country Cruising"" cruise in the Caribbean this week, according to the cruise line's website. On Sunday as the ship sailed out of Miami to start the trip to Mexico, Adkins posted a tweet: ""Up here in my suite, overlooking the pools. Behave yourselves."" His shipboard shows and the voyage were scheduled to end this weekend, but his representative confirmed to CNN that the singer is no longer on the cruise. ""Trace has entered a treatment facility after a setback in his battle with alcoholism,"" his rep said. ""As he faces these issues head on, we ask that his family's privacy will be respected."" Adkins, who towers above most people at 6-foot-6, worked as a pipe-fitter on an offshore drilling rig before becoming a country music star in the mid-1990s. He is a member of the Grand Ole Opry. He's sold about 10 million albums in the past two decades. His top hits include ""Ladies Love Country Boys"" and ""You're Gonna Miss This."" His autobiography -- ""A Personal Stand: Observations and Opinions from a Freethinking Roughneck,"" published in 2007 -- details a long list of close calls with death and battles with personal demons. His tough-guy image helped when he was cast as a biker in the movie ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" with Matthew McConaughey in 2011. He is the father of five daughters, but told CNN's Piers Morgan in 2011 that he would never win a father of the year award because of the demands of his career keeping him from his family. Adkins was a finalist on NBC's ""Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2008, but lost out to Piers Morgan. He won the ""All-star Celebrity Apprentice"" last May, raising $1.7 million for his charity, the American Red Cross.

Golden started out in 1985 as a producer at CNN, where she found both career success and love. Back then, her name was Rena Shaheen Zeya. Then along came love. Rob Golden worked as a journalist in the newsroom. The two fell for each other, and in 1987, colleagues put together a mock newscast, in which he asked her to marry him. She thought she was watching a real newscast on TV. Rob Golden's appearance on the screen took her by surprise. Then came the first career boost, when she was promoted to supervisor in 1993. Four years later, she became vice president of programming at CNN International. In 2000, her career advanced to senior vice president of CNN International. She made the jump to senior vice president of CNN.com in 2007, and served as its leader for about two years. Accessible despite more responsibility . In her executive roles, Golden added more than 80 hours of programming for viewers in at least 200 countries, according to her resume, and opened production in Hong Kong and London. She hired many of the news anchors seen on CNN International. One of them was Isha Sesay. ""She took a chance on me and I owe everything I have today to her,"" Sesay wrote in Golden's memorial website. ""I will forever be grateful for her bravery, guidance and the great kindness she always showed me."" Under the load of greater responsibility, Golden still had an open ear for employee's concerns, Wadia said. She not only mentored him in his career from her advanced position, but helped him make a major life decision as well. When his heart was tugging at him to return to India to care for a family member in need, he said he looked to her to help him hash it out. He followed his heart to Mumbai. News was her passion . Golden had a deep passion for the news, and it showed. ""It was in her blood,"" said CNN producer Talia Kayali. ""She was CNN."" Golden has called passion the most important aspect of being a journalist. ""You can learn TV web integration, you can learn technology, but it's the passion for news, that's something you need,"" she told the South Asian Journalists Association in a 2007 interview. ""You need to know what you are doing is important and is making a difference."" Her management style gave other journalists the room and respect to expand their talents and encouraged them to grow. ""She built people,"" Kayali said, ""particularly women at a time when there were fewer female leaders."" Battle with lymphoma . After leaving CNN, Golden completed an MBA program at Georgia State University. Shortly after graduating, she was diagnosed with lymphoma. ""Rena approached the disease and treatment as just one more hurdle to clearâ€”just another bump in the roadâ€” upset only by the fact that it would delay or scale back her work ambitions,"" husband Rob wrote in her memorial. The treatment appeared to be successful, and she went back to work, this time for The Weather Channel. The lymphoma reappeared, but Golden kept on living life to the fullest. ""You never felt she was sick. She was a fighter,"" said Kayali, who grew closer to Golden during the time of her illness. ""She dealt with it head on, and she kept up with life."" She accepted her fate with grace, Rob Golden wrote. Not fear. People we lost in 2013: The lives they lived .","Rena Golden was born in India in 1961 .

"(CNN) -- Even by the standards of supercars, and nearly a decade after it was first introduced, the Porsche Carrera GT is something remarkable. That much is clear from the moment you climb into it, and find yourself in a cockpit trimmed with carbonfibre, the high-tech material that F1 cars are built from. The GT's chassis and bodywork are made from the same material. Parts of the cabin bear a close resemblance to other modern Porsches -- the instruments and steering wheel are almost the same as those of the 911 and Boxster -- but all similarities end once you fire up the Carrera GT's engine. The 5.7-litre V10 motor sits behind you, and bursts into life with a busy, purposeful noise, responding instantly to any pressure on the throttle pedal. It sounds like a race car engine -- indeed, it pretty much is, having originally been created for a Le Mans program that Porsche subsequently cancelled. And the best part of a decade after it went on sale, the GT's mighty 605bhp power output still makes it one of the most powerful road cars ever constructed. Moving off is the first big challenge. The Carrera GT was only produced with a manual gearbox, and the engine's instant responses and a race-specification ceramic clutch mean you have to be gentle to avoid stalling. Opinion: Why race car drivers crave speed . Yet as soon as the Carrera GT is moving, it starts to feel far more normal. It might have been hyped as a road-going racer, but I found it as easy to drive as any other Porsche. That mighty engine is happy to trundle along at low revs and, once you've got used to the clutch, the gearshift is light and accurate. The GT is wider than most cars, and its firm suspension means you have to tackle poor quality roads slowly. If I had the money to afford one, I would definitely drive it every day. Start to go faster and the Carrera GT shows a far harder edge to its personality. As a supercar, it's been designed to go fast -- and its limits are toweringly high. So high that, to get consistently close to them, you'd need both a racetrack and time to learn the car's habits properly. The engine loves to rev, and working it as hard as it encourages you to unleashes neck-straining acceleration that's pretty much outside the frame of reference. Porsche claims the GT can blast from 0-60mph in 3.5 seconds, and from 0-100mph in just 6.9 seconds. Those numbers reflect the car's ability to shrink even the longest straights. Fortunately, its carbon-ceramic brakes are as good at scrubbing off speed as the engine is at adding it. Astonishing though its straight-line pace is, it's in the corners that the GT really comes alive. Like all Porsches, it's easy to drive quickly thanks to accurate steering and a keenness to both change direction and to stick closely to a chosen line. The vast tyres offer huge grip: you can drive the GT quicker than pretty much anything else without ever finding its limits. And within just a few laps on track it's possible to be pushing the car hard, reveling in the G-forces it can develop and the feedback it offers. Like most modern cars, it has a traction control system as standard -- which works to match the power that gets sent to the rear wheels to the amount of grip available and preventing the back of the car from sliding under power. Most drivers will be able to drive the GT considerably quicker if they leave the system on, but turning it off does reveal another side to the car's character -- with what can be a sudden transition from the car gripping to sliding. For some, that's part of the GT's appeal as a supercar, of course -- but you've got to be extremely confident in your own abilities to consider switching the system off. And while some parts of the media seem determined to portray the Carrera GT as flawed or inherently dangerous, it's categorically not. While it's inevitable that questions will be asked in light of this week's tragic events, we need to wait until we have all the facts before reaching conclusions. But the truth is that any car offering this extreme level of performance has to be treated with a corresponding degree of respect. Even experienced drivers like Anthony Hamilton, father of Formula 1 racer Lewis, have crashed Carrera GTs, and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has described it as having a ""savagery that's hard to explain."" The higher the limits are, the bigger the risks when you overstep them, so if you do lose control, you're likely to be traveling at mind-blowing speeds. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Duff.","Paul Walker's death probe is focusing on speed of the Porsche Carrera GT .

"(CNN) -- This week, champions of the ""open net"" are decrying a U.S. Court of Appeals decision striking down an FCC ruling that required Internet service providers to be neutral in their restrictions on bandwidth. The idea here is that giant bandwidth users, like Netflix or YouTube, will be required to pay access providers, like Verizon or Time Warner Cable, for all that video they're streaming to the likes of us. Maybe they'd even be able to buy themselves a special faster lane on the Internet for their traffic. Of course, ""open Web"" advocates see in the court decision the beginning of the end of a free and egalitarian Internet. By striking down the provisions of what the industry calls ""net neutrality,"" the court has also struck down an Internet provider's obligation to let all content through its servers. In theory, they can now legally pick and choose whose media makes it to its subscribers. Which would stink. But this whole issue, and the instantaneous outcry associated with every move by a court or agency, is more complex than it looks on the surface. By casting this issue in such stark terms, those who would defend Internet freedom from the evil corporations may just be playing into the hands of other corporations whose designs on the Internet are no better. In fact it seems like just yesterday when nearly all the Internet's champions were telling government to stay away from the net. The Web was home to the revival of Ayn Rand and a new spirit of techno-utopian libertarianism. The idea was: The free market will cure any glitches along the way, as technology firms simply compete to bring us the best. The 1997 Wired cover story, ""The Long Boom,"" argued that the only impediment to technology-fueled economic growth would be the regulation of the marketplace. ""Open good, closed bad. Tattoo it on your forehead."" This became a credo of Silicon Valley and the net in general. People acted as if the Internet just emerged out of culture, like a technological extension of the collective human nervous system, rather than a network that was meticulously planned and built by government and, yes, Al Gore. Instead the main metaphor for the net would be the Wild West, out of the reach of government meddling. But as anyone who has studied the Wild West (or even watched ""Deadwood"") has learned, gold rushes get messy at the end. Eventually a big, corrupt gold mining company starts exploiting all that lawlessness, and all of a sudden it's the formerly independent law-haters turning to the sheriff for help. And so the defenders of the net now go running for assistance to an FCC that has been systematically excluded at every turn and diminished in its power by some of these very same parties. Slammed down as if it were burning books whenever it considers protecting kids from pornography or interfering in some affair that is being fought out in the marketplace, the FCC has become a derided and timid agency. That's why the FCC was destined to lose this case. It never even defined the Internet as a ""common carrier"" -- like a road or telegraph wire -- which would necessarily be regulated in a neutral fashion, permitting passage by all. Yet in its ruling this week, the court even made it clear that the FCC has the ability to define the net as it chooses -- opening the door for the agency to claim the Internet as its domain and enforce net neutrality. No doubt, Google (which owns YouTube), and Netflix will be encouraging all free citizens of the Internet to push the FCC in this direction. After all, they're the ones whose videos make up a majority of Internet traffic, and who would be forced to pay the tolls -- that is, until they passed them down to us, which would likely lose them some business. In such an environment, an ""open"" Web really just means open to corporations, who maintain their monopoly on bandwidth by technological superiority. None of us will have the streaming capability of a Google or Netflix off our home servers -- unless, of course, the FCC regulates things that way. I, for one, would less like to see net neutrality than net favoritism: It's the transmissions between real people, schools, artists and nonprofit organizations that need a special lane on the net if anyone's going to get such a provision. So before we start shouting about what government and corporations should do to make the Web ""open,"" we'd better remember that one person's ""open"" may as well be another person's ""closed."" If we want a better, freer net, we have to stop responding so impulsively to every action taken in one direction or another -- particularly when there are multibillion-dollar corporations paying handsomely to make us think they're on our side. We have to remember instead who we did hire to protect our interests. Yes, it's time to go get the sheriff (in this case the FCC), apologize for having stamped on his badge, and tell him he has the authority to regulate this space. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Court strikes down rule that ISPs can't favor some websites over others .

"(CNN) -- Christmas trees. Gingerbread houses. Advent calendars. Christmas as we know it is made up of traditions popularized in Germany, and anyone who's been to one of that country's legendary Christmas markets knows that a German Yule is hard to beat. Happily, over the past two decades or so many North American towns and cities have decided to import the German Christmas market tradition. The most authentic German-style markets come complete with wooden huts selling traditional crafts, sweet and savory German treats, and the all-important mulled wine (glühwein) in collectible mugs. Most also feature activities and entertainments for all ages. 10 ways to cut loose for the holidays . Here are nine glittering Weihnachtsmarkts you can enjoy without flying overseas. Denver . Nestled in the snow-capped Rockies, Denver had a strong holiday atmosphere even before introducing its Christkindl Market 12 years ago. Now it channels the Old World at Skyline Park, where glowing stalls sell crafts, gifts and goodies like schnitzel and strudel; there's also plenty of music (much of it German) and an on-site skating rink to add to the flavor. Open November 22-December 21: 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Admission free. Christmas on the estate: 6 grand houses . Tomball, Texas . Tomball's big neighbor is Houston, but its sister city is the town of Telgte in northwest Germany.

"(CNN) -- Just 24 months before the showdown in the Midwest, CNN's Peter Hamby reported this week that possible presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton may have an Iowa problem -- and may again have difficulties winning the state in the 2016 caucuses -- because of weaknesses among the state's most progressive voters. But that analysis fails to understand and appreciate the country's changing demographics and where U.S. politics is heading. Clinton hasn't announced whether she'll run for president again. But whether or not she has an Iowa problem, Iowa is largely unrepresentative of America's changing composition. It's 91% white in a country that's 64% white, and it will have a shrinking role in choosing future U.S. presidents. And, even if Clinton does have an Iowa problem, she will probably have a Georgia solution. The composition of the South and Southwest has now changed to the point where Democrats have a real chance of winning statewide elections for seats long held by Republicans. Here are the facts: Nine out 10 of Iowa's 3 million residents are white. The state has six electoral votes and 65 delegates. In contrast, 63% of Georgia's 10 million residents are white. They have 16 electoral votes and 124 delegates. In 2012, President Obama lost Georgia by 300,000 votes in a state that has 600,000 eligible, non-voting African-Americans. And the Georgia solution begins with Michelle Nunn. The 47-year-old daughter of respected of Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn -- who served for 24 years as one of the state's leading Democrats -- is running for Senate and is poised to prove that a Democrat (and a woman) can win the Georgia seat held by a Republican for the past decade. Nunn is tied in the polls and has proven to be a formidable fundraiser. Her campaign paves the way for a Clinton win in Georgia because the ground operations and campaign infrastructure she's built will probably assist Clinton's efforts in the state. As the first woman to hold a Senate seat from the state of Georgia, she readies the electorate to vote for a female president. In a similar way, Wendy Davis' gubernatorial bid in Texas helps a potential Clinton campaign. Texas is another battleground state with significant numbers of voters of color -- who could one day help turn that state from red to purple -- and Davis' statewide win may pave the way to a Clinton victory in Texas. (PAC+ has publicly endorsed the candidacies of both Nunn and Davis.) There is a new majority emerging in America, and it's not about Iowa. It's about Georgia, Texas and other states where people of color will make the difference. These are states where rapid population growth over the past 10 years has resulted in increased electoral votes. Arizona's population increased nearly 25%, and it now has 11 electoral college votes -- one more than they had last time around. Colorado's population increased 17%, and it has nine votes. Florida gained two electoral votes for a total of 29, based on a nearly 18% population increase. Nevada gained one electoral vote, bringing its total to six to reflect a whopping 35% population increase in 10 years. It's a trend that experts expect to continue, and these are all states with large and growing populations of people of color. In Georgia -- whose primary has usually been held well after Iowa's caucuses -- a changing political landscape is not the exception, it's the rule. Democrats must look forward and invest in the coalition of the future. They must meaningfully connect with communities of color and progressive whites and champion policies that address inequality and immigration and education. That way, as the Iowa caucuses continue to recede in significance, the Democrats still can win for years to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aimee Allison.","Aimee Allison: Questions about Hillary Clinton in Iowa aren't as bad as they sound .

"(CNN) -- Crossing the road can be dangerous -- even if you're the largest land animal on the planet. Thousands of elephants roam Chobe National Park in northern Botswana, a wildlife haven that's home to one of the highest elephant concentrations in Africa. Right next to the vast park lies Kasane, a small town situated on the banks of the Chobe river. Here, humans live side by side with large herds of migrating elephants that wander through the area in search of food and fresh water -- and this has created a lot of tension. ""The conflict here is about space,"" says Tempe Adams, a PhD candidate monitoring the movement of animals in Kasane as part of her work with conservation group Elephants Without Borders. ""That's what it comes down to,"" she adds. ""Allowing wildlife to have space to move through."" Adams's research is looking at the functionality of small-scale wildlife corridors within urban communities, examining whether they can be an effective way to avoid human-wildlife conflict before it happens. Using motion detection cameras, the researcher is monitoring eight different corridors in the area, some of which are as small as five meters wide. One of the key points of the human-wildlife conflict in Kasane is a two-lane highway that cuts through the corridors the elephants use as they make their way to the Chobe river to drink and bathe. ""All the corridors I'm monitoring have to go past this road,"" explains Adams. ""There are a high number of accidents each year,"" she adds, ""generally in the evening when visual acuity is poor, which coincides with the busiest time for wildlife utilization."" Read this: Rangers risk their lives to save elephants . As part of her study, Adams is looking at the frequency of car usage and whether that correlates to how the herds of elephants are moving through the area. As it turns out, the majestic mammals are adapting to human behavior -- especially on weekends. ""It's amazing,"" she says. ""There's a bar at each of the corridors they have to pass by. I was looking at the results and I could suddenly see there's this big drop in wildlife coming through on Friday and Saturday nights. I thought what's going on? It's so obvious ... animals are adapting to our habits -- and our drinking habits,"" adds Adams. ""It's amazing to think they know when it's going to be lots of people and rowdy and very busy and they just don't come at that time; or they'll come in later or come in when it's quieter."" Why corridors are important . Elephants Without Borders was recently tasked with leading what's being called the Great Elephant Census, a pan-African aerial survey aimed at securing more accurate data on the continent's elephant population. But while the group is known for its extensive, cross-border research, it believes that urban small-scale corridors, the effectiveness of which is examined now for the first time, could be just as important. ""It's such a basic concept,"" explains Adams. ""Just give wildlife the space to come in; they will use and the conflict will be reduced."" Read this: Boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts . Kelly Landen, EWB program manager, says that in a human-dominated landscape, corridors provide safe passage for wildlife to access valuable resources like food and water. ""If corridors aren't provided for or are blocked, then the wildlife will do what they must to get to those vital resources, as their survival depends on it -- even if it means having to forge through villages, homesteads and farms. And that creates human and wildlife conflict, in which both people and the wildlife suffer."" EWB says that currently if a passage is labeled a wildlife corridor it is designated on the town's land management and development plans, indicating that the area cannot be allocated for another use other than as an access route for wildlife. However, the group is pushing for more stringent terminology and adapted legal rules to be applied to these passages. The overall plan is to have designated wildlife corridors in legislation, so as towns grow there are set paths for elephants to use and ultimately lessen the impact of their growing numbers. ""Elephants are extremely intelligent and have the capability to learn how to adapt to changes within their environment,"" says Landen. ""So, as a town becomes more and more developed, they will look for new routes allowing them access to what they need -- as long as there are those access routes."" Returning to ancestral homelands . With around 130,000 African elephants, Botswana has the continent's largest elephant population. It is seen as the last stronghold of the magnificent mammals in the continent; while other countries rare facing declining populations, Botswana must deal with rising elephant numbers and their impact on local communities and the environment. Read this: Will elephants still roam earth in 20 years? ""That's the tragedy and the paradox of conservation in Botswana,"" says Mike Chase, founder of EWB. ""Elephants have become a victim of their own success. ""Can this environment sustain 130,000 elephants, eight elephants per square kilometer that are chewing up 250 kilos of vegetation per day?"" asks Chase. ""Clearly not -- so we've got to create safe passages and corridors so that these elephants can move out of Botswana, release this bottleneck and repopulate areas such as southeast Angola and southwest Zambia, where elephants occur at very low densities and can be a magnet for eco-tourism."" Research has shown that the home ranges in northern Botswana are the largest ever recorded for African elephants, which are free to roam across Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Zambia. The EWB's findings helped create the world's largest wildlife preservation known as The Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, or KAZA. This is an international conservation region in southern Africa, spanning 440,000 square kilometers across five countries. The initiative is protecting some of the wildlife corridors and habitats identified by EWB. Read this: Enter world's largest conservation zone . ""Despite all the despair and loss of hope, there's a glimmer of opportunity here in the KAZA area, where elephants are repopulating ancestral homelands where they were evicted from 30 years ago,"" says Chase. ""KAZA is really the last hope for elephants,"" he adds. ""This romance of elephants moving from the coastal plains of Cape Town, through Victoria Falls, across the Zambezi river to the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro -- I yearn for that; I see that in elephants and KAZA provides for conservation at a scale at which these species evolved.""

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Portugal beat the Netherlands 2-1 to book their passage to the quarterfinals of Euro 2012 behind Group B winners Germany who saw off Denmark by the same score. Ronaldo's goals sunk the 2010 World Cup runners-up who exited the competition without gaining a single point. Germany will play Greece in the quarterfinals with Portugal taking on Group A winners Czech Republic. Group B was labeled the ""Group of Death"" when the draw was made and lived up to its billing as the four teams provided an enthralling finale. Euro 2012: Day 10 as it happened . The Dutch, who never recovered from a shock 1-0 defeat to Denmark in their opener, were given early hope when Tottenham's Rafael van der Vaart put them ahead. But Real Madrid ace Ronaldo finally lived up to his star billing with goals in each half in Kharkiv to secure his side's passage. Germany went into their match in Lviv as heavy favorites and were given a 19th minute lead by Lukas Podolski, winning his 100th cap. But Michael Krohn-Dehlim, who scored against the Dutch in the opener, equalized five minutes later. Lars Bender scored his first goal for Germany with 10 minutes remaining to preserve their 100 per cent record. ""That was my first start (for Germany), so it was something special,"" Bender told AFP. ""We were trying to get that second goal, I just saw the goal in front of me and it was a bit lucky,"" he added. Germany 2-1 Denmark . Germany, who went into the final group match off the back of two wins, started brightly and only a fine save by Danish goalkeeper Stephan Andersen kept out an early Thomas Mueller drive. Germany came even closer when top scorer Mario Gomez fluffed a clear chance in front of goal. But the miss did appear to matter as Mueller crossed and Gomez left it for Podolski to score his 44th international goal. But the lead was shortlived as Sunderland's Niklas Bendtner headed on a corner for Krohn-Dehli to apply the finishing touch. Denmark looked the more likely side to score after the break and Jakub Poulson clipped the post after an excellent move. Bendtner, always a threat, might have won a penalty for the Danes after appearing to be pulled back by Holger Badstuber, but the appeals were waived away. With a draw looking the likely result, Mesut Ozil squared for right-back Bender to beat Andersen with a cool finish. Portugal 2-1 Netherlands . Ronaldo had gone into his side's crunch match with the Dutch without scoring a goal in the two earlier group matches and smarting at criticism of his performances. The early signs did not look promising as Arjen Robben set up Van der Vaart to steer a perfect finish into the bottom left corner of the Portugal goal on 11 minutes. But after Helder Postiga had nearly leveled, Ronaldo finally got on the Euro scoresheet as he ran on to Joao Pereira's fine pass to beat Maarten Stekelenburg. ""This is for you my son,"" the 27-year-old was seen to mouth at television cameras after his 28th minute strike. Ronaldo proved a constant menace to the Dutch defense but early in the second half Portugal survived a scare after Wesley Sneijder crossed from the left for the unmarked Ron Vlaar to waste the chance. Stekelenburg was forced into a superb point-blank save from Nani, who had been set up by Ronaldo. The pair combined again for the eventual winner as Manchester United's Nani fed his former club teammate again. The Real Madrid star checked and cut inside before easily beating Stekelenburg. Van der Vaart hit the woodwork for the Dutch, but Ronaldo himself was then denied in the same fashion as he chased a deserved hat-trick.

"(CNN) -- The small plane had crashed in an extremely remote part of Alaska, miles from the tiny village of St. Mary's. It was an especially dark and foggy Friday night, and rescuers were having a hard time figuring out the location of the Cessna wreckage and its 10 passengers. They could hear survivor Melanie Coffee on the phone but with the poor weather, it was a frustrating needle-in-a-haystack kind of task. But Coffee, 25, made her way a half-mile across the slippery, sloping tundra and managed to find the town's landfill, where she met the search party of 40 to 50 villagers and calmly guided them on foot back to the crash site. For four people, including her 5-month-old boy, it was too late. They had died from their injuries. The others had wounds that included head injuries and multiple fractures. Had it not been for her going for help, more victims might have died, said Clifford Dalton, a paramedic for LifeMed Alaska. ""The fact that she could make it out to an identifiable landmark really helped to expedite the aid that the rest of the patients were able to receive,"" Dalton said. ""What's really remarkable about it is that she was tending to her infant child that was gravely injured at the time."" The Anchorage Daily News reported that after the crash, Coffee used a cell phone to call the on-call health aide for St. Mary's, population 500. Fred Lamont Jr. told the newspaper Coffee was trying to give her infant son CPR. Dalton called Coffee a hero who put the needs of others before her own. Dalton said he and his partner, Paul Garnet, helped treat the patients at the site. Six to eight villagers helped carry each survivor to the landfill, which was as close as the ambulances could get. Concerned residents also came to help from Mountain Village, about 25 miles away, where most of the victims were from. Authorities are unsure why Hageland Aviation Flight 1453 crashed. It left Bethel at 5:40 p.m. and went down about four miles from the St. Mary's airport. ""Hageland is working to gather information to answer questions and do what we can to ease the suffering of those involved in the accident. As a family-owned business this is an unspeakable tragedy for us,"" company president Jim Hickerson said on Hageland's Facebook page. Authorities said the dead were Wyatt Coffee, 5 months; pilot Terry Hanson, 68; Richard Polty, 65; and Rose Polty, 57. Four of those injured were hospitalized in fair condition, officials said. They are: Pauline Johnson, 37; Shannon Lawrence (age not given); Tanya Lawrence, 35; and Garrette Moses, 30. Also injured was Kylan Johnson, 14, who was treated and released. A spokeswoman for the the Alaska Native Medical Center said Melanie Coffee was in fair condition and wasn't giving interviews. The National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday it was too early to determine if weather was the cause. Alaskans depend on air transportation far more than residents in other states because many villages aren't on the road system. About 35% of commuter plane and air taxi crashes in the United States between 1990 and 2009 occurred in Alaska, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Former NFL star Darren Sharper faces two rape charges in Los Angeles, police said Saturday. Sharper, 38, was arrested Friday afternoon by the Los Angeles Police Department's sexual assault section of its robbery-homicide unit, according to LAPD spokeswoman Sally Madera. The Miami Beach, Florida, resident has been ""linked to two sexual assaults in west Los Angeles"" that allegedly happened in October 2013 and this month, an LAPD news release said. Madera said the charges concern California Penal Code 261(A)(30). The code section involves a rape ""where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the accused."" Sharper was freed from jail after posting a $200,000 bond just before midnight Friday, Madera said. He must appear before a judge on February 14 for arraignment, according to county jail records. Sharper also is being investigated for a sexual assault that allegedly happened in New Orleans on September 24, New Orleans police spokeswoman Remi Braden told CNN on Saturday. ""As with every case alleging sexual assault, information gathered is extremely sensitive and the top priority of the detectives is to protect the person who filed the complaint,"" Braden said. ""Because this is an ongoing criminal investigation, we cannot provide additional information at this time."" Sharper, a defensive back, became an analyst for the NFL Network after injuries forced an end to his 14-year playing career. The network suspended Sharper without pay in the wake of the arrest, a spokesman told CNN on Saturday. Sharper did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. Sharper's pro football career began as a second-round draft choice by the Green Bay Packers in 1997. After eight seasons with the Packers, including a loss to Denver in Super Bowl XXXII, he moved to the Minnesota Vikings for four years. He signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Saints in 2009, which led to a Super Bowl ring that first season. Injuries hampered his second year with the Saints, which led to his retirement in 2011. Sharper was chosen for the Pro Bowl five times.

"(CNN) -- South Africa's Colin Nel went into the second round of the Nelson Mandela Championship facing an early exit after shooting an opening seven-over 77 and finished it by achieving one of golf's most elusive feats -- a round of 59. It catapulted Nel up the leaderboard from 138th into the top 20 but astonishingly his score was also matched Friday by Jorge Campillo of Spain. Campillo improved a mere 11 shots on his opening level-par 70 to be one behind leader Daniel Brooks when play was halted. England's Brooks shot a 62 in his opening round and was through 11 holes of his second at 12-under. The European Tour event has been reduced to 54 holes after being hit by thunderstorms and heavy rain. That also had implications for Nel and Campillo as their scores will not count for the record books because players were allowed to use preferred lies on the rain-sodden fairways at Mount Edgecombe. That ruling means golfers can pick up their ball on the fairway and place it -- but not nearer the hole -- to achieve a playable lie. Nevertheless, Nel and Campillo played superb golf, with the latter shooting seven birdies and two eagles to contend for overall victory. He held the clubhouse lead at 11-under 129 with Matthew Baldwin of England, who shot a second round 62. Campillo was delighted by his efforts ""We play other par 70s on Tour, but you still have to shoot 59 and I'm pretty happy with the way I finished."" ""I was never close to 59 before, but in the KLM Open I was eight-under with three holes to go on a par 70,"" he told the official European Tour website. Branden Grace was tied with fellow South African Oliver Bekker on 10-under 130 -- one shot back. The tournament started a day early than scheduled so as to avoid a clash with Nelson Mandela's funeral Sunday, but has been hit by lengthy delays on all three days of play. ""Mandela is one of the reasons I am here,"" Grace said. ""Coming here you're trying to get the win for Madiba, not that it will make everything better for the country, but hopefully it will put a little smile on some people's faces."" Meanwhile, Ryder Cup teammates Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose shared the lead at the halfway stage of the $1 million Thailand Championship at Amata Spring Country Club in Bangkok. Garcia, chasing his first win of 2013, shot a hole in one during his seven-under 65 for 11-under 133. U.S. Open champion Rose carded a 68 to leave the pair two clear of overnight leader Alex Cejka of Germany, France's Alexander Levy and India's Anirban Lahiri. America's Rickie Fowler shot a superb eight-under 64 to be a shot further back while in-form Henrik Stenson moved into contention with a 67 to lie joint seventh.","Two players shoot rounds of 59 at European Tour event .

"(CNN) -- The mystery barge in San Francisco Bay is indeed a Google project, and houses a fancy, floating showroom for Google Glass and other products, a CNN affiliate is reporting. According to KPIX-TV in San Francisco, the barge structure will become one of a small fleet of luxury event spaces, complete with a party deck for invitation-only visitors. The station cited ""multiple sources"" including at least one who has been aboard the barge, and said it was dreamed up at Google X, the company's secret facility where engineers have cooked up projects like Google Glass and a self-driving car. The facility is constructed from interchangeable shipping containers and is designed to be disassembled and transported via barge or train to other locations, a source said. At least two other similar barges, including one in the Portland, Maine, harbor, also have been spotted since the ""mystery barge"" -- docked at a pier on Treasure Island, just east of San Francisco -- first made headlines earlier this week. All of them are marked by the letters ""BAL"" and four numbers. An unnamed tenant that moved into a hangar on Treasure Island on August 1 goes by the handle, ""By And Large"" -- possibly a playful reference to the corporation in the Pixar movie ""Wall-E."" The fancy barges will be an effort by Google to upstage rival Apple's stylized retail stores, a source said. In a statement, the U.S. Coast Guard confirmed it is working with the barges' owners to make sure the floating structures have the proper permits and permissions to operate in the bay. But it didn't say much else. ""Regardless of the company or entity involved, the Coast Guard has an obligation to protect sensitive proprietary information, as a company's competitive posture and business interests depend on it,"" said the branch of the U.S. military in the brief statement. Google Glass, worn like regular glasses, has a high-resolution display and lets wearers use voice commands to shoot photos or videos and access features like e-mail, text messaging, Google Maps, Google search and a handful of other apps. It is currently being tested by about 10,000 ""Explorers,"" who paid $1,500 for the glasses. That program is being expanded. This week, Google announced current testers may invite up to three friends, as well as a planned rollout of a new version of Google Glass. If the reports about the barges are true, it may take some time before the project is officially confirmed. Google has declined to comment on the reports. And a shroud of secrecy has cloaked the entire proceedings. A sign outside the By And Large hangar on Treasure Island has a sign saying that all visitors must hand over their cellphones, cameras, and other recording devices. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee is also among those in the dark. ""They've kept a secret from me as well,"" he told KPIX.","San Francisco barge structure confirmed as showcase for Google Glass, sources say .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Murray-Ryan budget plan, which passed a key Senate vote Tuesday, punches way above its weight. The relatively skinny, 77-page bill would affect millions of Americans, as well as programs, fees, companies and, oh, the entire economy for years to come. Here's our scorecard: . Winners . • The Pentagon: There are smiles among the camouflage. Thanks to Murray-Ryan, the budget-cutting hatchet has been downsized to a knife. The deal reverses billions in budget cuts so that the military's discretionary budget will actually go up $2 billion next year (over the budget-cut amount this year). Also, after years of juggling unpredictable, temporary spending bills, the two-year budget deal allows generals and admirals to do something that is military 101: Plan ahead. Budget deal passes key Senate vote . • Federal employees: Two biggies -- the deal slashes the chances of a shutdown in January or any furloughs in 2014. And there's a bonus: A technical change in the bill allows federal workers who are married without kids to obtain health benefits under a new, cheaper ""self plus one"" category. They currently have no option but ""single"" or ""family"" plans. • The needy: Head Start, Meals on Wheels, just about any federally funded program that directly serves the needy could benefit from Murray-Ryan. How exactly the numbers will land is still unknown, but because the budget deal replaces budget cuts for nonmilitary programs, nonprofits are hopeful. ""This is good for us,"" Jenny Bertolette from the Meals on Wheels Association of America told CNN. Another benefit: As with the military, these programs will know their funding levels for two years and can do critical planning. • TSA: The Transportation Security Administration wins from increased security fees -- the budget gives the agency more reliable funding. • Appropriators: Imagine Muhammad Ali in his prime, with boxing gloves on but forced to sit outside the ring. That's how the members of Congress' appropriations committees have felt for years. Once considered to be some of the most powerful people in the capital, the lack of any long-term spending agreement has nearly cut them out of the process. Until now. The Murray-Ryan plan means appropriators are back on the canvas and will decide how to carve up more than $1 trillion, agency by agency. Zelizer: Obama's rough year . • America's reputation: For three years, the world has watched the U.S. government limp from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis. The budget deal sends a message that even a deeply divided Congress may be able to do its job and govern. • Santa: No fiscal cliff. No health care debate. Santa and his sleigh can lift off without any cable channels showing partisan bickering from the House or Senate floor this year. Losers . • Young, career military: This compromise deal will mean less retirement pay for military retirees younger than 62. Specifically, it cuts the annual cost-of-living adjustments to a level under inflation. CNNMoney: 5 things the budget deal won't do . • New federal workers: You've got a government job! Congratulations! But if you start that job after January 1, this budget bill would cut your pay by 1.3%. That would be an increased, mandatory contribution to the federal pension fund. • Unemployed: The clock is ticking, but the budget agreement does nothing to address unemployment benefits, which expire this month for about 1.3 million Americans. • Air travelers: You will pay more to be safe. This plan boosts the TSA security fee to $5.60 for each one-way trip. Technically, airlines pay the fee, but you know how that works. A few companies have already admitted that the increase will probably be passed on to consumers. Rep. King slams Cruz, Paul; calls for moderate GOP voice . • Scammers and con artists: The budget deal makes it harder for anyone to access and use the Social Security numbers of dead people. And prisoners? Think twice about trying to get an unemployment check. That's illegal, and this deal will make it harder for you to pull off that scam. • Gas and oil industry: Two hits: The petroleum industry is set to lose a $50 million research program and a kind of backdoor moneymaker in which oil companies purposely overpay into a federal fund and gain higher-than-market interest payments from the government as a result. That's fini. • Wealthy federal contractors: This may be hard to believe, but right now, federal law will pay up to $952,308 in salary for any single contract employee. The Murray-Ryan budget deal would cut that down to $487,000. • The years 2016-2023: While this budget deal significantly blunts forced budget cuts (the ""sequester"") set for the next two years, it would leave those cuts at full power for the following seven years. In addition, this bill adds a new set of forced budget cuts and a few extended fees (customs fees, for example) for 2022 and 2023. • The long-term future of the U.S.: Medicare. Social Security. These fiscal monsters may be silent now, but are set to rise over the next two decades to become huge financial threats to both the federal budget and the U.S. economy. This bill does not address the coming long-term problems. CNNMoney: Republicans to weigh debt ceiling demands . • Countdown clock producers: No shutdown would mean no countdown clock in January. Though, those who love them could look just a few weeks down the road in 2014 when the debt ceiling presents another fiscal deadline. Poll: Congress neck-and-neck with car salespeople .","The Pentagon will have more certainty in planning how much money it will have to work with .
Federal employees won't have to worry about a shutdown for at least two months .
But new federal workers will start their jobs with a 1.3% pay cut .

"(CNN) -- Walt Disney World is billed as the ""happiest place on Earth,"" but it's anything but in the subversive new film, ""Escape From Tomorrow."" Randy Moore's directorial debut focuses on a man who slowly descends into madness while vacationing with his wife and children: Grim reality keeps intruding onto a theme park experience designed to banish every moment of melancholy. In Moore's vision, jolly Disney characters become fearsome ghouls; an epidemic of ""cat flu"" threatens to sicken visitors; an undercurrent of sex runs through this place meant to stand for innocent family fun. It's a darkly comic and unflattering critique of Disney culture. So why would Disney ever allow Moore to shoot his movie inside Disneyland and Disney World? The answer is it never gave him permission. Moore, his actors and crew infiltrated the parks without Disney ever catching on. The cinematic subterfuge went on for weeks; Moore shot for about 10 days in Orlando, Florida and even longer at Disneyland in Anaheim, California. ""There was high anxiety the entire time while we were making this film,"" Moore admitted. He said the stress was so great, ""I lost a ton of weight. I was 215 (pounds) and slimmed down to 168 by the end of this shoot."" Pulling it off . Moore said pulling of his unlikely feat required tremendous planning. ""We weren't just running in there and improvising, 'Oh, here's a nice place to put the camera,'"" he said. ""We did a lot of scouting (in the parks). We walked through the movie at least nine times before we brought in the actors. ...The position of the sun was charted weeks ahead of time for every shot."" The movie includes several images of an eerily depopulated park -- not easy to arrange when contending with thousands of visitors. ""As soon as they opened the doors we sort of rushed in and got the shot (of the empty park),"" Moore recalled. ""We had like maybe 20 seconds before people would get into (the frame)."" Why Disney might want to 'Escape From Tomorrow' Technological breakthrough . Moore understood there was no way he could shoot his movie with anything like a traditional motion picture camera. A breakthrough came courtesy of the Canon 5D Mark II camera -- a digital SLR that can shoot high-quality video. ""The 5D's small size and low-light capabilities were what made everything possible, allowing me the freedom to set up shots and move fast without sacrificing picture quality,"" Moore explained in a ""director's statement"" that accompanies press notes for the film (Moore told CNN he hasn't been paid anything by Canon to sing the praises of its product). The innocent looking camera was key to avoiding detection by Disney security. ""The thing about those parks is everyone has a camera there,"" Moore said. ""So we were not the few people with cameras in the midst of a crowd of people. We were just normal. We probably would have looked out of place if we didn't have cameras."" But shooting video was only half the equation; just as big a challenge was figuring out how to record the actors' dialogue. Once again, technology came to the rescue. ""What we ended (up) doing was using these tiny Olympus pocket recorders that business people use mainly for dictation purposes,"" Moore explained in his director's statement. ""They're great because they run for 18 hours straight on one battery; they have an auto-leveler function; they record almost at CD quality; and they have a mic input, so I could easily run a standard lavalier mic into them."" Smartphones also helped. ""We had a shot list for every single shot. We kept those on our phones, as well as our scripts,"" Moore said. It's a Small World After All . To get the shots of Disney attractions that he needed, Moore, his crew and actors had to board the rides -- repeatedly. ""I think we rode 'It's a Small World After All' 12 times in a row,"" Moore said. ""And it was not a low park attendance day. There were a lot of people there. So, every time we were in line for probably 40 minutes. So that's all we did that day was ride 'Small World.' That was a rough day."" The team used Fast Passes whenever possible, but that only helped so much, as when they filmed a sequence at Disneyland's Autopia ride. ""It was such a busy day (at the park) the line even with a Fast Pass was 25 minutes."" Paying Disney back . Disney hasn't filed suit against Moore despite his ample use of the company's copyrighted images (no doubt concluding a lawsuit would only increase public awareness of ""Escape From Tomorrow""). Disney did get something out of it: Moore estimates he spent between $15,000 and $20,000 on season passes to the parks to accommodate his cast and crew. And then of course there was food. ""We ate all our meals in the park,"" Moore said. ""It was just easier, more convenient."" The director's favorite Disney eatery? The Royal Street Veranda in Disneyland. ""They have these bread bowls with clam chowder or gumbo and they're fantastic."" To Disney or not to Disney? The closest call . Moore said to the best of his knowledge no Disney park patrons ever caught on that a film was being made right in their midst. He and his crew also managed to escape detection by Disney security personnel, until near the end of filming in Anaheim. Then suddenly, after weeks of surreptitious shooting, the game was almost up. ""There was a moment when the actors had to enter the park through the turnstiles a few times,"" Moore recalled. ""We had to do multiple takes of them walking into the park. And at one point a security officer came to our lead actor (Roy Abramsohn) and asked if he was famous. ... He said no and then they asked, 'Why do you have paparazzi following you?'"" Abramsohn and Elena Schuber, who plays his wife, had to do a quick improv to throw the officer off the scent. ""I said (to Elena), 'Hey, honey, they think we're famous!'"" Abramsohn recalled. ""Yeah, all of a sudden now we're really acting,"" Schuber said. When the officer asked why the pair had entered and then re-entered the park twice within a matter of minutes, they explained they had left their sunscreen in the car and had to go back to apply it on their kids. The actors realized it would be tough to explain why they were wearing sound recording equipment, so they said the young actors playing their kids needed to use the restroom. They took that opportunity to stash the equipment. ""I put it in my sock, which I thought was the last place they would maybe look,"" Abramsohn said. ""There aren't that many choices when you're wearing a pair of shorts."" Abramsohn, Schuber and their movie kids profited from a passing parade to disperse into the crowd, and then hightail it out of the park. A close call, but the actors said by that point they were used to shooting on the sly. ""It was exciting,"" Abramsohn said. Said Schuber, ""Luckily that was our only close encounter. We pulled off all the other things."" All is (almost) lost . But even after they finished shooting in the parks, the filmmakers' troubles weren't over. Screening the footage he had captured in Orlando, Moore's heart sank. There was a big blotch on the video -- all of it. ""It was through every shot,"" Moore said. ""I thought, 'The whole film is ruined! We have a giant black dot near the center of the movie for everything!'"" The culprit was tree sap that had somehow slimed the camera's sensor. Moore still doesn't know how it happened, but the digital gods smiled on him and a company in South Korea was able to remove the blemishes in post-production. Another escape for ""Escape From Tomorrow."" Moore consistently beat the odds to get his movie made and into theaters: first by eluding Disney security, then earning a spot in the Sundance Film Festival (where the film premiered in January) and ultimately finding a distributor willing to risk the wrath of the Walt Disney Company. But when he returned to Anaheim for an interview with CNN just outside Disneyland property, Moore felt understandably apprehensive. ""It's strange being back here in the belly of the beast,"" he said. ""I feel like a mouse's hand is going to cover my face with chloroform at any moment and drag me away.""","""Escape From Tomorrow"" was filmed surreptitiously at Disney parks .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in New York's Nassau County are investigating the stabbing of reputed former mob boss John A. ""Junior"" Gotti, but the victim has not been cooperating with the investigation, according to police. Aside from telling authorities he was stabbed while in the parking lot of a pharmacy, Gotti didn't say what happened Sunday night, police said Monday . Gotti arrived at a Syosset hospital on Sunday evening at 10 p.m. seeking treatment for a stab wound. Per hospital protocol, the facility notified authorities, and Nassau police responded. Gotti said he had been stabbed in the parking lot of a CVS store in Syosset at around 9:45 p.m. Sunday. He refused to answer any further questions, according to Nassau police. ""We are investigating, along with the Nassau Police Department, a stabbing that occurred in Syosset, New York on Sunday evening involving John 'Junior' Gotti,"" said Shams Tarek, communications director for the Nassau County district attorney's office. The hospital had no one registered under Gotti's name Monday night, and his whereabouts and condition could not be determined. The 49-year-old Gotti is the son of the late John Joseph Gotti Jr. who was once the boss of the infamous Gambino crime family in New York. The elder Gotti died of cancer in federal prison 11 years ago while he was serving a life sentence for a murder and racketeering conviction. Junior Gotti has long insisted that he retired from organized crime after pleading guilty in 1999 to racketeering and agreeing to serve five years in prison. He was released in 2005. He was indicted four times between 2004-2009 on mob-related charges. All four of those trials ended in a mistrial. Federal authorities appeared to give up when in January 2010 they said in court papers: ""In light of all the circumstances, the government has decided not to proceed with the prosecution against John A. Gotti."" Gotti's lawyer, Charles Carnesi, did not return calls Monday seeking comment.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Superman and Batman fans will have to wait another two years before the two superheroes meet on the big screen. Warner Bros.

The incident occurred in the city of Peshawar, the minister of health in the region, Shaukat Yousafzai, told CNN. A child was among those killed, according to officials at Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital. The blast was under investigation, though police and intelligence officials said they believed it was caused by a bomb. The explosion happened at the start of what was supposed to be an overnight service in which congregants were to attend evening prayers, listen to a nighttime sermon and sleep there. Also Thursday, an undetonated bomb was found in a mosque in Nowshera, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Peshawar, police said. People found the bomb in a tin container near the mosque's entrance before evening prayers and notified authorities, police said. A bomb disposal unit defused the device, police spokesman Turk Ali Shah said. Pakistan, where militants have a strong presence, has long been beset by violence.","Child among 8 killed in Peshawar mosque blast, hospital says; dozens injured .

"(CNN) -- DMX won't sit down with Wendy Williams to talk about his legal troubles this week because of the rapper's arrest Monday, his spokesman said. ""DMX, you are loved, but if you're not here by Friday, we've got to move on with our plans,"" Williams said on her show Tuesday, hours after the rapper was arrested on charges of driving with a suspended license and having no car tag or insurance. The rapper, whose real name is Earl Simmons, has been arrested several times in his home state of South Carolina in recent months. He had been booked to appear on ""The Wendy Williams Show"" in New York on Wednesday, but he's decided to stay at home ""due to recent media scrutiny,"" representative Domenick Nati said. ""The team apologizes to his fans who were anticipating his performance, but we are holding off on interviews and focusing on making music and organizing a world tour,"" Nati said. Williams talked about his troubles on her show Tuesday. ""This is not this man's fault. This man needs help, and that's why I just wanted to have a conversation with him. I wasn't trying to fix him."" DMX was pulling up to the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport on Monday evening to catch a flight to New York when he was stopped. An airport police officer recognized him and realized he had recently been arrested for driving without a license, an airport spokeswoman said. He spent three hours in jail Monday night before posting bond, according to the Spartanburg County Detention Center website. ""Oh, DMX -- a mess"" ""The problem is that with all the people he knows, and the drivers that he has access to, he decided to drive himself to the airport,"" Williams said. ""Well, there's nothing wrong with that. We all like to drive. At least, I like to drive. The problem is I have a driver's license and plates on my car."" The plan had been for DMX to talk most of the hour with Williams before performing his 1997 hit ""Party Up (Up in Here)"" with Swizz Beatz, she said. ""Y'all gonna make me lose my mind -- that song,"" she said. ""Oh, DMX -- a mess,"" Williams said at the conclusion of her comments. The run-in with the law Monday was his third in his home state in recent months, which included a citation for marijuana possession in Greer, South Carolina, in August. He was arrested then when an officer recognized Simmons and knew there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest for failure to appear in court for a previous charge, according to the arrest report. Simmons allegedly ""became very aggressive with his words and was making multiple idle threats"" when the officer questioned him about ""a bag of green plant material I knew to be marijuana"" near where he was sitting in a pickup truck, the report said. He was also arrested in Greenville, South Carolina, on July 26 on charges of driving under the influence, driving without a license and driving without a seat belt, police said. A state trooper stopped his 1978 Plymouth station wagon after he was allegedly ""traveling erratically,"" the South Carolina Highway Patrol said. DMX was given a field sobriety test and failed, the agency said. DMX has faced various criminal charges in the past, including probation violation, illegal drug possession and animal cruelty. Maricopa County, Arizona, authorities said he was arrested five times after August 2007. That included a May 2008 arrest on drug and animal cruelty charges, when Simmons attempted to barricade himself inside his Cave Creek home, sheriff's deputies said. Simmons also ran into trouble while in prison, being placed on ""lockdown status"" and forced to eat only bread and water for ""jailhouse infractions."" In February 2009, he threw a food tray in anger at a corrections officer, according to the sheriff's office. In 2010 he was sent to prison after violating his probation. Four days later, DMX was admitted to the Flamenco Mental Health unit for an undisclosed disorder. But before the litany of arrests, DMX had a promising music and movie career. He had a huge hit with ""Party Up (Up in Here)"" more than a decade ago, and he also appeared in movies, such as ""Romeo Must Die.""","DMX cancels interviews ""due to recent media scrutiny,"" representative says .

"(CNN) -- Every morning, while I open granola bars and pass them to my children in the back seat, I feel a familiar pang of guilt reminding me that a good mother would have made them scrambled eggs and toast. A good mother would have the time and the money to structure their day in a way that fosters healthy growth and development. Maybe we would meet a friend for playtime at the museum and lunch? That's what I would do if I were a good mother. Sometimes my son wakes up in a pee-soaked bed and I just wipe him down with a wet wipe because giving him a shower will take five precious minutes I just don't have. There are other shortcuts I've taken in the interest of time: Sending my daughter to school in my socks because she doesn't have any that are clean; digging a toy out from under the seat of the car for show-and-tell because I forgot to pack one. The same script plays in my head every morning: ""It's just temporary. We just need to get through this week, this month, the summer, this school year,"" and then: ""They won't wait for you. Their childhood is now and they are not getting what they need. You aren't giving them what they need. They need you, and you're not there."" I always wanted to be a stay-at-home mom, and most of what I know about parenting and young children I learned in college, where I earned a bachelor's degree in human development. Working full-time while my kids burned the hours in a day care was on my list of things that ""I will never do."" I had worked in day care centers. I have seen the runny noses and tired eyes of a kid getting picked up from day care after a nine-hour day. ""Why have kids if you don't want to raise them?"" I often judgmentally wondered to myself about those parents. ""Can't you see how much they need you?"" I had other ""never will dos"" and ""will dos"" rigidly etched onto my brain -- a guide I'd created to build the perfect childhood for my babies. For the most part, I was able to stick to the plan for the first couple of years. Aside from being a little too broke in the very beginning to afford an SUV or a Gymboree membership, my early mommy years were just as I hoped they would be. Soon, my husband made more money and mommy life got even better. My kids went to part-time preschool for a few hours in the morning and spent the afternoons riding their trikes in the street of a nice quiet neighborhood filled with kids and other stay-at-home moms. They helped me shop for organic groceries that I would bring home to make a dinner from scratch. I taught them to swim in our pool, taught my daughter to read and my son to count. My mommy life was perfect. There were definitely tantrums and messes, but I was very happy with most of the pieces of my life. In all this perfection, I failed to notice that for my (then) husband, things weren't so perfect. When our babies were 2 and 4, he decided he'd had enough. He asked for a divorce and moved into an apartment in the city. Suddenly I found myself jobless and alone with two small children in a big, beautiful house with a ""For Sale"" sign in the front yard. Their father is still present in their lives, but this was not how things were supposed to go. The years that followed were a blur of exhaustion, anxiety and guilt. I moved those children three times in two years. Slowly, I was building a career that would give us pieces of our lives back, but it was a hard time for all of us. Tears would run down my cheeks each time I watched my daughter bravely march into a new school and again at the end of the day when my son would squeal and run to me after a nine-hour stretch at day care. Their resilience was absolutely dumbfounding. They adapted to each change with a strength that I will never fully understand. Play dates with neighborhood friends were few and far between. Our dinners now were mostly from the drive-through in the car on the way home, just in time to get in bed only to start all over again in the morning. There were days I gave a dose of Tylenol and crossed my fingers that the tail end of a fever wouldn't come back at school. It was certainly a far cry from homemade chicken noodle soup, ice cream, and a movie marathon that the same fever would have required just the year before. Our journey has not ended yet, but now that we've settled, the ride is less bumpy. We have lived in the same house for two years. We have a network of friends and we're back in our old neighborhood. My kids have a lot of people who love and care for them. I finally earn enough money to live in a nice neighborhood and send my kids to good schools. We have a routine and we all feel like we're on solid ground. My house feels like a happy home. But the guilt keeps coming because this is ground I never wanted them to stand on. I wanted them to have a daddy who comes home and wrestles with them or takes them out for doughnuts to give their mommy a break. I wanted them to walk home from school to find their mom in the house and snacks on the counter. I wanted to read to the class on Friday afternoons and volunteer to host Girl Scout meetings. I didn't want to have my face buried in my iPhone while pretending to watch ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"" with my daughter. I didn't want be a stranger to the other moms at school, and I didn't want to throw chicken nuggets at them when I just didn't have it in me to make dinner. What I don't yet know is whether I am mourning my loss or theirs. I know I have to make peace with my choices, with our fate and with the childhood that they will experience, but I'm not there yet.

"New York (CNN) -- A blind man and his black Lab service dog fell onto subway tracks and escaped injury Tuesday after an alert Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee instructed them to duck ahead of an oncoming train. The incident happened around 9:30 a.m. at the 125th Street station in Harlem, according to Marisa Baldeo, spokeswoman for the MTA. The blind man, identified by CNN affiliate NY1 as Cecil Williams, was walking on the subway platform with his service dog when witnesses describe him slipping and falling onto the tracks. ""I heard a man say 'Oh no!,' and I heard him fall into the train tracks,"" witness Danya Guiterez told CNN affiliate WPIX. ""I was in shock and everyone ran towards him, but no one went in the train tracks."" A nearby MTA employee, described by Baldeo as a construction flagger, jumped into action and tried to calm the man. The MTA employee instructed Williams to lie still between the subway rails and not try and climb out as a northbound ""A"" train quickly approached the station, according to Baldeo. Customers standing on the platform attempted to alert the conductor, according to a statement from the MTA. The conductor applied the brakes when he noticed Williams on the tracks, but the train came to a stop only after one and a half cars went over the man and his dog. Firefighters Ralph Costello, George Gerrish and Spencer Presume arrived on scene and noticed Williams was underneath the second subway car but not pinned. They jumped onto the tracks and removed him by a backboard. They said the man was just semicoherent and only managed to give his name and ask about his service dog, which was also safe and uninjured. He said little else, according to a Fire Department of New York press release. ""It's a miracle,"" Williams' girlfriend, who only wished to only give her first name, Cynthia, told CNN affiliate NY. Cynthia told NY1 that Williams fainted and fell over into the tracks but was expected to be fine. ""He's doing great,"" Cynthia said. ""He's on observation. I'm very grateful to God."" Cynthia added that Williams' dog, who she identified as 10-year-old Orlando, was OK and going home with her.","A blind man and his dog falls onto the tracks in a Harlem subway station .

"(CNN) -- SeaWorld's ""Bands, BBQ and Brew"" concert series may be down to just food and beer soon as Trisha Yearwood joins the list of artists canceling shows. Willie Nelson, Heart, Barenaked Ladies and Cheap Trick previously withdrew amid pressure from fans who signed online petitions, tweeted and posted on Facebook pages demanding they not play at the Orlando theme park. Fans became upset after watching the CNN documentary ""Blackfish,"" which first aired on CNN in October. The film tells the story of the killing in 2010 of a SeaWorld trainer by an orca. It raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity. Learn more about CNN Films 'Blackfish' ""In light of recent concerns, Trisha has decided to remove the February 22 date from her upcoming tour plans,"" the country singer's representative told CNN Thursday. The news quickly lit up Twitter. ""We expect that other artists will be targeted in this campaign,"" SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck told CNN after Cheap Trick canceled Wednesday. Joan Jett to SeaWorld: Stop rockin' the whales . The park's concert schedule -- which also previously listed REO Speedwagon, Martina McBride, 38 Special, Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery -- has disappeared from SeaWorld's website.

""We'll announce the full lineup of bands when all artists have been confirmed. We'll repost the schedule on our site then."" Filmmaker: Why I made 'Blackfish' The Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies was the first to cancel, reacting to a petition posted on Change.org. ""This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time,"" the band said on its Facebook page. Sisters Nancy and Ann Wilson of Heart did not elaborate last week when they announced their decision to cancel at SeaWorld, although they acknowledged it was ""due to the controversial documentary film."" ""While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld,"" Gollattscheck said. SeaWorld said it would like the musical artists to learn for themselves about SeaWorld. ""The bands and artists have a standing invitation to visit any of our parks to see firsthand or to speak to any of our animal experts to learn for themselves how we care for animals and how little truth there is to the allegations made by animal extremist groups opposed to the zoological display of marine mammals,"" Gollattscheck said.
