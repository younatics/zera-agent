"The trading of child pornography is an ever-increasing problem and paedophiles have been known to conceal hard drives of images in walls, ceilings and cabinets to avoid being caught. These small storage devices are typically difficult for police to find, but one force has found an alternative - sniffer dogs. Connecticut State Police is now using a golden labrador to find concealed memory cards in return for food, and the scheme has already led to arrests. Connecticut State Police has started using a golden Labrador (stock image pictured) called Thoreau to find concealed memory cards, hard drives and USB sticks. The dog identifies the scent of the metal and components used in the devices and is being used to find storage devices containing images of child porn . When training dogs to sniff our . contraband, police handlers and trainers will associate the smell of the . drug, memory card or similar with the animal's favourite toy. To . begin the training, the handler plays with the dog and the toy, which . has been carefully washed so that it has no scent of its own. Later, . the item that the handler wants to train the dog to sniff out is rolled . up inside the toy - which is often a towel, or similar. After playing for a while, the dog starts to recognise the smell of the contraband as the smell of his favourite toy. The . handler then hides the towel, with the contraband, in various places . and if he finds it, he is rewarded with either use of the toy, food, or . both. Golden labrador Thoreau, owned by handler Detective Adam Houston, can also find hard drives, USB sticks and other similar gadgets by identifying the scent of the metal and components used in the devices. The dog is being used to find storage devices containing images of child porn, hidden by paedophiles. Thoreau received 22 weeks of training in how to detect devices in exchange for food at the Connecticut State Police Training Academy. Last month, Thoreau found a flash drive containing child pornography hidden inside a tin box, within a metal cabinet. That discovery led the police to secure an arrest warrant. During tests, Thoreau has also located a hard drive inside a bag in the upper shelf of a desk, as well as a flash drive and thumb drive in a draw.

"Darren Bent scored on his Brighton debut but it was not enough to prevent the Seagulls slipping to a 2-1 defeat at home to fellow-strugglers Fulham. The former England striker was signed on loan from Aston Villa this week and made an immediate impact at the Amex Stadium with the opening goal early in the second half. However, Brighton's lead lasted just 10 minutes before Hugo Rodallega struck an equaliser and Lasse Vigan Christensen's goal then turned the match in Fulham's favour. Darren Bent opened the scoring for Brighton on his debut against Fulham on Saturday . The former England forward taunts the Fulham fans as he celebrated his second half finish . Defeat for the home side was compounded by the last-minute dismissal of Adrian Colunga as Sami Hyypia's Brighton slipped into the bottom three in the Sky Bet Championship. Brighton made a fast start by forcing four corners inside the first two minutes and Bent quickly made his presence felt, with Fulham defender Konstantinos Stafylidis making a decisive intervention. Veteran Northern Ireland defender Aaron Hughes, retaining his place in Brighton's starting line-up with Gordon Greer out injured, then put a deflected shot wide before coming to his side's rescue at the other end. Hughes kept his cool to make an important clearing header following Shaun Hutchinson's knock down at the far post. Brighton stand-in captain Lewis Dunk headed over from an Elliott Bennett corner after Fulham keeper Marcus Bettinelli superbly kept out a Bent header with his leg. The Seagulls were forced into making a change midway through the first half when Kazenga LuaLua was unable to run off an injury to his left leg and was replaced by Rohan Ince. Bent went close again for Brighton just before the break, forcing Bettinelli to save with his feet after a neat pass from Colunga. The Seagulls had a let-off shortly after the interval when Ross McCormack got the better of Dunk but Rodallega wastefully put the ball wide from a good position. Hugo Rodallega celebrates his equaliser for Fulham just after the hour mark . Lasse Vigen Christensen of Fulham (front) celebrates scoring the winner at the Amex Stadium . Bent, making his first league start for seven months, then struck to break the deadlock on 52 minutes. Spaniard Colunga supplied the perfect pass and 30-year-old Bent beat Bettinelli with a first-time shot which went through the keeper's legs. Brighton keeper David Stockdale, who spent six years at Craven Cottage, was called into action when he leapt to confidently hold a deep cross by Jack Grimmer. The Seagulls could only hold on to their lead for 10 minutes though as Rodallega levelled with a clinical finish, firing home first time into the top of the net after a pass by Christensen. Brighton were fortunate not to have gone behind shortly after when Bryan Ruiz headed a great chance wide at the far post. And Fulham, who were increasingly confident, threatened again through a free-kick from McCormack which was flicked over the bar by Dunk. However, it was Christensen who struck to give Fulham victory with a deflected shot 13 minutes from time after a pass from Ruiz. Colunga was sent off in added time, collecting his second booking for a needless foul on Fulham captain Scott Parker. Keeper Bettinelli then swooped to get in ahead of Bent by confidently claiming a low cross from Gary Gardner.","Darren Bent opens the scoring for Brighton on his debut for the club .

"Speaking out: Kirstie Trup has told for the first time of the terrifying moment she was doused in acid by two strangers . A teenager who had acid thrown at her by a stranger on a moped in Zanzibar has been told she cannot sit in the sun for at least 12 months. Kirstie Trup, 18, who had skin grafts on her face, arm and shoulder, conceded that it was a 'small price to pay' following the attack in which her friend, Katie Gee, was also injured. The pair were helping underprivileged children on the East African island at the time of the attack, which made international headlines. They were both flown back to the UK last month and have been receiving treatment for their burns. Writing for the Sunday Times, Miss Trup said: 'Thankfully, I have had not infections and no longer require any dressing for my wounds. 'However, I will be required to wear a pressure garment - which looks like a short-sleeved Lycra T-shirt - which will protect the skin graft and help prevent the build-up of scar tissue in the infected areas. 'I am also banned from sitting in the sun for at least 12 months - which is a small price to pay, even though I was once obsessed about sunbathing.' Despite the mindless brutality of what happened to her last month, she plans to return next year to continue with her charity work. She also reveals how she is haunted by questions as to why she and Miss Gee were attacked, saying: 'Since my return to Britain I have asked myself the same questions every day: why us? Why were Katie and I targeted? What motivated our attackers? Had they been following us our watching us for a while before they decided to carry out their unprovoked assault?' She admits that the clothes she took with her to Zanzibar -shorts, strappy tops and mini-skirts - were wholly inappropriate for a trip to a Muslim country during the holy month of Ramadan. But the teenager insists that this was done in ignorance and she immediately rectified it by buying lots of modest attire, including baggy trousers that both she and Miss Gee were wearing when they were attacked. In her article for the Sunday Times, she . said the friends did nothing to draw the wrong sort of attention to them . and their behaviour was entirely respectable during their month-long . stay. Victims: Kirstie Trup, pictured left, and Katie Gee, both 18, from Hampstead, north London, were walking to a restaurant in Zanzibar when two men on a moped threw a jerry can full of battery acid at them . 'We laughed, sang, and enjoyed every moment we had in Zanzibar, all within the confines of what was religiously acceptable on the island,' she added. 'There we were, two 18-year-old Jewish girls from north London hoping to make some difference in the world while enjoying the life we've been given.' Painful: This photograph released by the teenagers' families showed the injuries one of them suffered in the attack . Miss Trup, who is about to commence a history degree at Bristol University, said the first she knew something was amiss was when the moped driver stared at them intently, before nodding suggestively to the passenger sat behind. She said the man smiled and then violently threw a jerry can full of battery acid at them - dousing both girls in a clear liquid which they initially mistook for water. She said: 'Within a second of the moped speeding off, with its tail-light still in sight, we began screaming. 'Our screams were not out of . frustration that our clothes had been drenched. They were screams of . agony. We felt our flesh being seared.' As locals rushed to help, a . disinterested soldier stood nearby watching as the girls lay on the . floor writhing in agony - tearing at their skin and clothes in a futile . bid to abate the pain. 'My entire upper body was burning, especially the right shoulder and torso,' she added. 'So . were my feet, my face and my eyes. The skin on my right forearm looked . as though it had had red paint thrown on it and I immediately noticed . some discolouration on my torso and shoulder. 'The . pain, coupled with the taste of the fluid flung at us - as part of . which had spattered into my mouth - made me quickly realise that it was . not water.'

The pain was rapidly intensifying at a much faster pace than I could each burning area of my body. 'I caught a glimpse of the holes that had burnt into my clothes, which the young man was still holding. 'It became obvious to me that Katie and I . had become the victims of a chemical attack.' The girls were then taken . to woefully underequipped local hospital, before a hotel where their . 'seared' skin was treated by standing them under cold showers.' A few hours later they were airlifted to hospital in mainland Tanzania, before being flown back to the UK. Stop off: Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup were flown to the Aga Khan Hospital in Tanzania (pictured) before being flown back to the UK . Tanzania President Jakaya Kikwete visited the two women in hospital and called the attack 'shameful' She spent weeks at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital undergoing skin grafts before being released. Her friend Miss Gee, whose burns were more severe, is still an in-patient. Recalling her initial thoughts after the attack, she said: 'I thought about Katie Piper, the former model and television presenter who had had sulphuric acid thrown in her face on the orders of her ex-boyfriend and the impact that had on her life. 'I was terrified and still in pain, crying, wishing I was back home in Hampstead, north London, along with Mum and Dad, my two brothers and our two dogs.' Miss Trup also reveals that David Cameron has written to her praising her efforts in trying to make a 'real difference to the lives of children'. She writes: 'With each day that passes I reflect on my time in Zanzibar with Katie and the fun we had ... Such happy memories have convinced me to return to the island next year to do more voluntary work.'

"The grand jury deliberating over the shooting death of Michael Brown will not make a decision until at least Monday, it has emerged, as the 18-year-old's mother has begged protesters to stay peaceful. The secret panel, which is deciding whether to indict officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting the unarmed black teenager in Ferguson on August 9, had planned to reach a decision on Friday night. However, according to Downtown STL Inc, a St. Louis civic group, the decision could come late next week as the 12 civilians plan to reconvene on Monday to deliberate further. It is unclear how the firm gleaned the information from the closed-door Missouri hearing, before sharing it in an email to business partners on Saturday afternoon. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Plea: In an emotional plea via megaphone on Saturday night, Michael Brown's grief-stricken mother, Lesley McSpadden (pictured center), begged a crowd of demonstrators in Ferguson, Missouri, to remain peaceful . Support: Ms McSpadden (pictured hugging a supporter) told protesters: 'I just want y'all to be careful. Don't agitate them.

Above, Michael's death, on this stretch of road in Ferguson, Missouri, has shaken the US . Ben Crump, one of the Brown family's attorneys, said the jury had initially planned to work over the weekend if Friday's deadline fell through. He confirmed no conclusion had been reached. The delay was revealed as Michael's mother, Lesley McSpadden, urged a crowd of demonstrators gathered along Canfield Drive - just feet away from where her son was killed - to avoid violence. In an emotional plea via megaphone, she told protesters on Saturday night: 'I just want y'all to be careful. Don't agitate them, don't let them agitate y'all. I don't want nobody getting hurt. 'We all willing to do something, but I don't want nobody getting hurt, see what I'm saying? Because when it's time to walk into the courtroom, I want all y'all with me.' She also asked demonstrators to 'keep the faith', despite the majority of supporters expecting the charges against Wilson to be dropped, according to a video obtained by the Huffington Post.

Police officers armaments, often provided by the Federal government under a scheme to re-use old army equipment, have been under increased scrutiny after shocking images of heavily-armed officers emerged in the wake of Michael's death. The new list of equipment was revealed to BuzzFeed News under freedom of information laws, and details all significant equipment acquired by the police force since 2004. Worrying entries in the arsenal of the force, which is responsible for just over 300,000 people, include two PGL-65 multi-shot grenade launchers, from which one officer can fire six canisters in a matter of seconds without reloading.

The police department also has access to a 1969 Hughes MH-6C helicopter, which can have mini-guns, rockets and anti-tank missile attached. It also has two other helicopters. Dozens of pistols and rifles were also included in the load-out - as was a powerful 'acoustic device' which can fire deafening noises into crowds.

Defensive equipment for the police included dozens of thick riot shields and a BearCat armored personnel carrier which is strong enough to withstand a blast from a land mine. Proponents of the mass buy-up of lethal technology has said that a well-armed police force can help shut down potentially dangerous confrontations. However, critics say it creates an overly aggressive force which is more able - and likely - to inflict harm on the population. On August 20 in Ferguson a police officer, Ray Albers, was suspended after pointing an assault rifle at a Ferguson protester and reportedly threatening to kill. Taking aim: Officers were given heavy weapons and an armored personnel carrier .","Grand jury planned to conclude by Friday night or work through weekend .

'If I have your report and it says diagnosis No. 1 is HUS, how do you just send us home without following that? How do you send us home without pursuing that lead, your No. 1 lead,' Steven Profitt asked. HUS, an abbreviation of hemolytic uremic syndrome, is a disease that strikes most children with E. coli.

"David Silvester has blamed the recent storms on the decision to legalise gay marriage . A UK Independence Party councillor has blamed recent storms and floods on the Government's decision to legalise gay marriage. David Silvester, who defected from the Tories last year in protest at David Cameron's support for same-sex unions, claimed he had warned the Prime Minister that the legislation would result in 'disasters'. The Henley-on-Thames town councillor, 73, said the country had been 'beset by storms' since the passage of the new law on gay marriage because Mr Cameron had acted 'arrogantly against the Gospel'. In a letter to the Henley Standard he wrote: 'The scriptures make it abundantly clear that a Christian nation that abandons its faith and acts contrary to the Gospel (and in naked breach of a coronation oath) will be beset by natural disasters such as storms, disease, pestilence and war. 'I wrote to David Cameron in April 2012 to warn him that disasters would accompany the passage of his same-sex marriage bill. 'But he went ahead despite a 600,000-signature petition by concerned Christians and more than half of his own parliamentary party saying that he should not do so.' Blaming the Prime Minister for the bad weather, he added: 'It is his fault that large swathes of the nation have been afflicted by storms and floods. 'He has arrogantly acted against the . Gospel that once made Britain 'great' and the lesson surely to be . learned is that no man or men, however powerful, can mess with Almighty . God with impunity and get away with it for everything a nation does is . weighed on the scaled of divine approval or disapproval.' Mr Silvester wrote another letter to the Henley Standard in April 2012 in which he told David Cameron not to legalise gay marriage and warned of 'disasters' if he did . UKIP said the views expressed by Mr Silvester were 'not the party's belief' but defended his right to state his opinions. A party spokeswoman said: 'If the media are expecting Ukip to either condemn or condone someone's personal religious views they will get absolutely no response. Pestilence: Part of the letter in the Henley Standard, claiming recent floods were godly vengeance . 'Whether Jain or Sikh or Buddhist or Sufi or Zoroastrian or Jewish or Muslim or Baptist or Hindu or Catholic or Baha'i or Animist or any other mainstream or minor religion or movement, we are taught as a tolerant society to accept a diversity of ideologies. 'Freedom to individual thought and expression is a central tenet of any open-minded and democratic country. 'It . is quite evident that this is not the party's belief but the . councillor's own and he is more than entitled to express independent . thought despite whether or not other people may deem it standard or . correct. 'That is what makes the United Kingdom such a wonderful, proud, diverse and free country.' Henley's Tory MP John Howell, said: 'I thought Mr Silvester's letter was not the sort of thing that he should have written in today's age. He really needs to consider his position.' Twitter users have reacted angrily to the news, branding him a 'blithering idiot' and questioning his position as councillor. Sam Bergmanski, a graduate from Cardiff, said: 'What is a man like David Silvester doing in public office? Disgrace.' Another user calling himself Sisco, from Cumbria, added: 'UKIP Councillor David Silvester says the floods are due to gay marriage. Why do people take UKIP seriously? seriously, how?' The retired Shell worker, elected in 2010, was unaware of the fury his letter had provoked when contacted by MailOnline today. He . stood by the rant, saying he went to a Bible college in 2004 and . studied the work of Jeffrey Satinover, a controversial American . psychologist who describes homosexuality as a treatable . disorder, against the mainstream opinion of the medical world. Since Christmas Eve several storms have left tens of thousands without power across the UK, caused damage to homes and businesses and disrupted transport . He said: 'The Conservatives are known as the party of the Queen. The Queen in her coronation oath promised to only to pass those laws that are consistent with the Christian gospel. 'There is a command to love all men, and I hope I love all men. 'But we are also taught to love the person but hate the sin.' When told that hundreds of people had said his claim about gay marriage prompting floods was crazy, he said: 'That may be so if you are not a person of prayer. I am a person of prayer. I pray for each member of the Cabinet every day and each member of the Royal family every day.' However, he admitted he 'lost a lot of friends' when he left the Tories over gay marriage. Richard Lane, spokesman for the gay . rights charity Stonewall, told MailOnline: 'Its hardly surprising that . we've seen unusual weather patterns in Britain, considering the enormous . amount of hot air being produced by some UKIP members'.","David Silvester, 73, wrote a letter to the Henley Standard in Oxfordshire .

"The family of stricken F1 legend Michael Schumacher has issued a statement saying they are 'speechless' at the continued love and support of fans worldwide as he continues to struggle to regain normality at his mansion home in Switzerland. On his reactivated website wife Corrine, 45, and children Mick, 15, and Gina-Maria, 17, say: 'Every day wishes for his recovery arrive and the extent of sympathy for him makes us speechless. We can only say thank you for that, that you fight with him and us together. We remain confident and hope for the best for Michael. Your strength helps us continue to support him in his fight.' The message was posted on Schumacher's re-booted website - http://www.michael-schumacher.de- which was launched again today. But it contained no new information about the state of his health as he battles to recover from the catastrophic brain injuries he suffered while skiing in the French Alps on December 29 last year. Love: Corrine Schumacher (left) said her family is 'speechless' at the continued support for her husband Michael  (right) as he battles to recover from the catastrophic brain injuries he suffered while skiing last year . Schumacher, 45, was not expected to last the night after smashing his head on to rocks hidden beneath snow. But after two emergency operations following the accident he spent months in the University Clinic in Grenoble, followed by a short stay at the rehabiliation clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland, before being transferred to a purpose-built medical suite in his mansion at Gland in September where he is cared for by a team of 15 medical experts. It is understood he has still not regained the power of speech and has just limited movement of his limbs. The team caring for him includes: . 1) Kai Schnapka, 35, his long-term physiotherapist, leads three people charged with massaging his muscles which have wasted during the months of immobility, trying to coax co-ordinated movements out of him during his limited moments of awareness of his environment.

"CLICK HERE for Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone from Liverpool's win over Stoke . Steven Gerrard duly arrived, centre stage, on 75 minutes. The script had been prepared, with the match programme celebrating the fact that it was 16 years since the Liverpool captain, then a callow Scouse youth, came off the bench to take the field at Anfield for the first time. But the life of a footballer, like the seven ages of man, is cyclical. So at the age of 34, Gerrard found himself back on the bench, four games in 10 days deemed a schedule too far for the Liverpool captain nowadays. In fact his manager, Brendan Rodgers, hadn’t even realised the significance of the day until he saw the souvenir match programme. ‘I felt a bit bad then,’ he said of his decision to rest Gerrard.

But with the game locked at 0-0, with both sides sensing a victory, it seemed natural that the captain should take the field to finish the job. Of course, football doesn’t always work out quite so simply and the best scriptwriters love a good twist. Anfield had the finale it desired but it was Glen Johnson who provided the heroics on 85 minutes. There was a lovely cross from Jordan Henderson, met quite magnificently by Rickie Lambert, whose header crashed against the bar. As the rebound dropped, it was clear there was a race on between Johnson’s head, the boot of Erik Pieters and the onrushing presence of Asmir Begovic. You could not have blamed Johnson for flinching but he ensured his head was there first, shortly after followed by Pieters’s boot. And the fact that Gerrard was a mere bystander for the goal barely diminished from the drama. It was Johnson’s last contribution to the game — the cut to his head meant that treatment was required — but it was mightily significant for this game. Whether the same can be said for Liverpool’s season remains a moot point. This was undoubtedly a desperately needed victory for Liverpool, the last in the Premier League having come at QPR more than a month ago. If Wednesday night’s draw against Ludogorets was the turning point of which Rodgers spoke, this at least was another step in the right direction. However, there is still an awful lot of hard work to be done before Liverpool are truly in the ascendant again. The fact that of the £120million spent on talent last summer, only Rickie Lambert could make the starting line-up, is an indication of the deeper malaise at the club at present. ‘We need players at this time who have quality and experience,’ Rodgers explained. ‘The guys who came in (in the summer), the younger players will get their chance. Right now we need confidence and experience in the team.’ But there was precious little to commend in the first-half performance. Liverpool conceded possession cheaply, failed to read each other’s movements and created almost nothing. On 27 minutes, Lambert lifted a free-kick high into the Anfield Road stand; it was noteworthy only in that it was the first attempt either side had contrived. Stoke had been little better but at least as the visitors, there was less onus on them to attack.

Rodgers’s principal problem is that Liverpool of course are now judged by much higher standards due to the excitement they generated last season and those opening 45 minutes felt a world away from those heady days. Thankfully, the second half improved considerably, with Bojan Krkic and Raheem Sterling both demonstrating the vitality of youth and technique. Bojan, in particular, was a hub of creativity for Stoke. He fed Mame Biram Diouf with a delightful ball on 58 minutes which Simon Mignolet did well to smother; he hit the post on the hour, having skipped past Lucas; and right at the death he executed a volley from outside the box of which Marco van Basten would be proud and which Mignolet did superbly to tip over. ‘He was the outstanding player,’ said his manager Mark Hughes of the former Barcelona child star. ‘Everyone can see the quality he has. He is getting stronger in every game. He is enjoying the Premier League, enjoying playing for us. We need to give him the ball more often because he has the ability to produce .

Sterling was attempting to do something similar for Liverpool, wriggling his way through a forest of defenders on 61 minutes but pulling his shot just wide. He then fed Lucas on 65 minutes, giving the Brazilian a clear sight of goal, which he wasted by shooting straight at Begovic. Johnson then pressed forward and fed Lambert, who again shot at Begovic. But the best chance of all came when Sterling squeezed the ball back to Joe Allen, who, eight yards from goal, lifted the ball high and over and into the Kop on 69 minutes. At least there was attacking intent and creative combinations around the box. Liverpool were looking a little bit more like their old selves. True, Sterling had to save his team, chesting a Diouf shot off the line on 82 minutes with the score still 0-0. But ultimately it would be a day which Rodgers could enjoy, skipping down the touchline in celebration when the goal did come. ‘I think with the way I like to play football people think I want to win 5-3 and 6-4,’ said Rodgers. ‘But I am equally happy to win 1-0.’ For now that is enough for Liverpool.

"An imam associated with al Qaeda ‘hid in plain sight’ at London’s notorious Finsbury Park Mosque, posing as a firebrand imam and community leader while secretly engaged in a ‘global campaign to spread terror’, a New York court heard today. Prosecutors told how Abu Hamza, the 56-year-old former nightclub bouncer on trial in lower Manhattan, used the mosque as a base from which to try make hundreds of converts to his creed of violent jihad. They said in their opening statements on Thursday that Hamza would send his recruits as far afield as the western United States and Afghanistan in the cause of killing non-Muslims, prosecutor Edward Kim told a courtroom in Manhattan. Without his trademark: The court has ordered that Abu Hamza, seen here in a court sketch from Monday, could not wear his hook for security reasons but is allowed to wear a prosthetic that allows him to write and take notes . Denied: Hamza asked to give his opening statement himself but the judge ruled that he could not . ‘For Abu Hamza, his cause was war and it was all-consuming,’ said prosecutor Edward Kim on the first day of testimony. ‘His goals were clear, simple and . vicious.  All able-bodied Muslims had a duty to wage war against . non-Muslims – a duty to kill. This duty was violent, global and . mandatory.’ Dressed in a . light blue smock and alternating between scribbling notes and peering . intently through his spectacles at evidence on a computer screen in . front of him, Hamza was a far cry in court from the fiery preacher who . for years spouted hatred for the West and America in particular. His . signature hook hands had been removed for security reasons, replaced by . a pen-holding prosthetic on his right arm that allowed him to take . notes. Although Judge . Katherine Forrest denied his request to give the defense’s opening . statement himself, Hamza replied politely to her on the sole occasion he . was asked to speak yesterday in response to a technical question about . his case. Known figure: Hamza, who was arrested under the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, was arrested in the UK and served a different sentence there before being extradited to the United States (pictured in 2003) He listened quietly as the prosecution painted a damning picture of a man who did far more than simply praise terrorism. ‘Abu Hamza didn’t just talk the talk, he walked the walk,’ said Mr Kim. ‘He was a trainer of terrorists who used the cover of religion so could hide in plain sight in London.’ The . jury heard that when police searched the mosque’s attic they found a . stockpile of military equipment including gas masks, knives, flak . jackets and chemical warfare suits. They . were also told that Hamza, a former nightclub bouncer who was born in . Egypt, sent two men to establish a terrorist training base in Oregon and . another to become an al Qaeda fighter in Afghanistan. Mr . Kim also outlined how Hamza offered ‘crucial resources and guidance’ to . a ‘terrifying’ 1998 kidnapping of tourists in Yemen in which four of . them, including three British travelers, were killed. Hiding in plain sight: The prosecution alleged that Hamza used his role as an imam at the Finsbury Park mosque to recruit jihadists that then were order to carry out missions in the northwest United States and Afghanistan (pictured in 2003) Hamza . not only provided a satellite phone that was used by the hostages to . talk to negotiators but the gunmen spoke with him during the kidnapping, . ‘seeking his direction’, the court heard. Mr . Kim told jurors they will hear testimony from one of the surviving . hostages, Mary Quinn, who  visited the Finsbury Park Mosque two years . later so she could confront Hamza. In a recorded conversation the court will hear, Hamza told her that the kidnapping was ‘justified’, said the prosecutor. Hamza, who was extradited to the US in 2012, denies 11 charges. If found guilty, he faces a life sentence. Defense . attorney Joshua Dratel said Hamza had simply been a devoted imam and . community leader who had worked to rebuild Afghanistan after the Soviet . invasion, but by creating schools for girls rather than supporting the . Taliban. He even compared . him to Nelson Mandela and George Washington – both men, said Mr Dratel, . who once been regarded as terrorists or rebels but who were now . considered ‘icons’. Hamza . only espoused ‘outrageous’ views as imam at the mosque because he wanted . to reach the entire Muslim community and not be regarded as a . ‘sell-out’, the court heard. ‘He’s not a follower of Osama bin Laden, he’s not a follower of anyone but the Koran,’ Mr Dratel told jurors. ‘He said a lot of harsh things. These are views not acts.’ The . defense said MI5 and Scotland Yard had actually appealed for Hamza’s . help in providing a ‘moderating influence’ on Britain’s Muslim community . and ‘he had acted on that’. ‘They approached him repeatedly to help keep the situation under control,’ said Mr Dratel. The case continues.","Abu Hamza is on trial in New York and the prosecution gave their opening statement on Thursday morning .
Said how the former imam 'hid in plain sight' while running the Finsbury Park mosque in north London .
Charged that Hamza recruited men to travel to the United States and Afghanistan to carry out jihad missions .

"As the world lurches from one crisis to another, one thing is reassuringly certain - President Obama will be playing golf and usually with his 'Secretary of Swing', Marvin Nicholson. The two men have played golf together an astonishing 140 times over the past six years, drawing envious gazes from Washington politicos, who are desperate for any priceless 'face-time' with the leader of the free world. Indeed, so close are they, that the president was comfortable enough to step away from the Situation Room to play cards with Nicholson during the now legendary Navy SEAL's raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. Golf partner: Marvin Nicholson has played on the links with President Obama 140 times since he first joined the staff in 2008 for his successful bid for the presidency . Hiring the Ferris Bueller-loving Nicholson away from John Kerry for his 2008 campaign, Obama has become firm friends with the man the Secretary of State dubbed 'Chief of Stuff' for his tireless carrying of bags during his own failed attempt at the presidency in 2004. Well played: The president gives one of his famous fist bumps to Marvin Nicholson out on the golf course at the Minks Meadows Golf Club on Martha's Vineyard in 2009 . Profiled in a New York Times portrait over the weekend for which Obama allowed himself to be interviewed, Nicholson is portrayed as a man the president can relax with while Valdimir Putin tests the resolve again of the US again, or ISIS sets the Middle East ablaze. Having grown up in Canada, the congenial Nicholson, 42, has played golf with the president more times than anyone else. 'Every president needs a space where he can be quiet and let loose and feel normal,' said Obama to the New York Times. 'And when I’m with Marvin, we can talk the same way we would if we were just a couple of guys having a beer and whacking a ball around.' Reggie Lover, the president's former personal aide prior to Nicholson recounted the story of the bin Laden card game during a 2013 talk at the University of California in Los Angeles. He told those gathered that on the very day of the raid, while the president's top generals, spy chiefs and administration members such as Hilary Clinton were in the Situation Room, the president excused himself. The president 'was like, 'I'm not, I'm not going to be down there, I can't watch this entire thing,' said Love. Feeling the weight of the most significant decision of his presidency weighing him down, the Commander in Chief left the nerve-center of the operationto go to a private dining room where he , Nicholson and Pete Souza, the White House photographer 'must have played 15 hands, 15 games of Spades.' Well played again: Marvin Nicholson returns the favor to the president while Cyrus Walker looks on at Farm Neck Golf Club on Martha's Vineyard in 2010 . Potentially wielding great influence because of his closeness to the president, Nicholson is trusted apparently because he 'has no agenda.' The New York Times spoke to Nicholson's ex-girlfriend, Alyssa Mastromonaco for their piece, and the president's former deputy chief of staff was efusive with praise for her former partner. 'When you just need someone who is going to be nice ot you, that's Marv,' said Mastromonaco. While the president himself has admitted he shouldn't have played golf immediately after he addressed the beheading of American journalist James Foley and spoke with his family last month, he defends the frequency with which he hits the links in the piece. Which club? President Barack Obama on the Mink Meadows Golf Course  with White House trip director Marvin Nicholson in Tisbury  on Martha's Vineyard in 2009 . 'It is the only time I can get four or five hours outside, and I don’t have the option to take long walks through a city,' Obama said to the New York Times. This goes a long way to explaining why the president rarely conducts business out on the greens, as Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton were known to do. However, when the president does talk shop out on the course, Nicholson is there. When the president played with Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and vice president Joe Biden, Nicholson, who plays off a handicap ten lower than the president's 18, was in the cart behind. Asked why he seems to get on so well with Nicholson, the president pointed to the man's breadth of knowledge. 'He has lived a quirky, adventurous life,' said Obama. Influential: US President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron and White House Trip Director Marvin Nicholson  eat hot dogs while sitting in the stands at University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio in 2012 . Trusted: US President Barack Obama speaks with his trip director Marvin Nicholson before getting into his limousine after arriving in Canberra, Australia, in 2011 . 'But that means that he knows a lot about a lot of stuff.' While Nicholson himself refused to be interviewed for the New York Times piece, his friends from Canada did. 'He was always the life of the party, 100 percent,' said Jeremy Petzing, an old school friend. 'He wasn’t a position-taker. He would never really take sides. He was so easygoing, and the chicks just loved him.' Yes, the New York Times interview praises Nicholson's manliness, with his ex, Mastromonaco claiming she looked forward to speaking to him on the phone because he 'sounds like a man'. She also lifted the lid on his softer side, claiming that he paints and also his more robust skills at DIY. He is very close to Mastromonaco too, playing golf, obviously, with her husband and chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday. Nicholson's relationship with John Kerry is described as 'more father-son than brotherly' and the article reveals that he and the Secretary of State dined together recently. Key aide: Marvin Nicholson joined Obama's campaign in 2008 (left in LA electioneering) and is now one of the president's right-hand men (right, pictured in Pittsburgh in 2009) He requested Kerry's blessing to take on his role with the Obama team, after Mastromoncao recommended him to the then Illinois senator. Currently single, Nicholson is known for his love of the cult classic movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. 'Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.' wrote Nicholson in his senior yearbook in Canada . The piece comes as the president tried to explain why he played golf on the day he confirmed James Foley was beheaded by ISIS in August. 'Part of this job is also the theater of it,' he told NBC News' Chuck Todd. 'Well, it's not something that always comes naturally to me. But it matters. And I'm mindful of that.' He added: 'I should have anticipated the optics' of playing golf. Obama, who was on vacation at the time of Foley's murder, was heavily criticized for heading to the golf course at Martha's Vineyard where he was vacationing on August 21. He said he was 'heartbroken' over Foley's death and that it was hard for him to hold back tears while speaking with his family. Obama blamed the contrasting images partially on how the press follows him everywhere, even while he is 'supposed to be on vacation'. He said there's always potential for bad news to occur, and sometimes it'll happen while the president is on holiday.","Marvin Nicholson, 42, is the president's travel director and golf-buddy .

"A new study has found that drinking up to four cups of coffee a day can slash the risk of developing diabetes by 25 per cent . Drinking up to four cups of coffee a day can slash the risk of diabetes by 25 per cent, according to new research. The study has found that drinking decaffeinated filtered coffee at lunchtime is also the best time of day to have a cup to lower the chances of diabetes. The risk of developing the condition also falls by a further seven to eight per cent with each additional cup and the research also shows the drink doesn't increase the chances of developing cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension or stroke. The Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee in Switzerland marked World Diabetes Day today by publishing its annual diabetes report, which gathered together research which highlighted the health benefits of caffeine. One of the studies said that three to four cups of coffee a day may reduce the risk of developing diabetes by a quarter when compared to having less than two cups a day. The report said there are number of processes why this is the case, including the possibility coffee improves glucose, energy metabolism and burns more calories. It added: 'Alternatively, coffee could affect insulin sensitivity in the body. A 2014 study of Japanese men suggested higher coffee consumption may be protected against insulin resistance in normal weight individuals. 'Another possibility is it could simply be an effect of calorie displacement, where choosing coffee over a sugary drink leads to a reduction in calorie consumption.' In analysis the researchers found the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, the form that develops in adulthood and is associated with obesity, fell by 12 per cent for every two additional cups a day. Additionally, a large US prospective cohort study showed that increasing coffee consumption by one cup per day over a four year period resulted in an 11 per cent lower risk of Type 2 diabetes in the subsequent four years. Those who decreased coffee intake by one cup a day had a 17 per cent higher risk. Research has also suggested the time of coffee consumption could play a distinct role in glucose metabolism. A study of almost 70,000 French women found drinking coffee, especially at lunchtime, reduced the risk of developing diabetes. More than 380 million people worldwide, including more than three million in the UK, have diabetes, making it one of the most significant global health problems. Recent work also suggests the type of coffee may also affect the link, with filtered and decaffeinated exhibiting greater protection than boiled and caffeinated drinks. The report explained: 'The research outlined in this report suggests that regular moderate coffee consumption may actually decrease an individual’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. 'Furthermore, a dose-dependent, inverse association between both coffee drinking and total mortality has been demonstrated in the general population, as well as among diabetics. A 2014 study of Japanese men suggested higher coffee consumption may be protected against insulin resistance . 'Studies have also found that drinking coffee does not increase cancer risk in the diabetic population, nor does it cause cardiovascular disease, hypertension or stroke. 'Although more research is needed to make firm conclusions, the findings suggest that coffee in moderation can be safely enjoyed by the healthy as well as by the diabetic population and might even be helpful in Type 2 diabetes prevention.' The Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee (ISIC) was established in 1990 and is devoted to the study and disclosure of science related to 'coffee and health'. Its members are major European coffee companies including Lavazza and Nestlé. However some experts have warned that despite the new report, drinking coffee does not actively reduce the diabetes risk. Dr Richard Elliot from the charity Diabetes UK said: 'The studies highlighted in this report found people who drank more coffee tended to have a lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, but this does not mean drinking more coffee actively reduces your diabetes risk. 'Other factors not identified by these studies are also likely to be involved, and further research will be needed find out what causes this link. 'What we do know is the best way to reduce your risk of Type 2 diabetes is to maintain a healthy weight. 'We recommend a healthy, balanced diet that is low in fat, salt and sugar.'","Study finds four cups of coffee a day reduces risk of diabetes by a quarter .

"Dyson Allen is alleged to have started a fire that three young children and a teenager . A teenager died as he tried in vain to rescue his three younger siblings after a fire was started in a wardrobe, a court has heard. Reece Smith, 19, battled to get to his sisters, twins Holly and Ella, four, and their two-year-old brother, Jordan, who were asleep at the time of the fire. But he was overcome by fumes as he went upstairs following the fire which was allegedly started by Dyson Allen, 19, who is on trial for murder. Allen, who admitted to drinking neat vodka before the fire, was the only other person upstairs at the dormer bungalow in Freckleton, Lancashire, when the fire broke out as a birthday party was being held downstairs for the children's mother, Michelle. Prosecutor Neil Flewitt told Preston Crown Court: It is the prosecution's case that the defendant, Dyson Allen, was responsible for starting that fire and he did so deliberately.' Three family friends were also in the house along with the defendant who was a friend of another of Ms Smith's sons. Allen was a regular visitor and stayed overnight the evening before the blaze, the jury was told. According to people in the house he spent most of the night on January 7 in the second upstairs bedroom, said Mr Flewitt. He continued: 'Michelle Smith had allowed Dyson Allen to store some of his personal belongings that were in a large blue Ikea bag in bedroom one (the young children's room). 'The presence of that bag may be significant because it would provide a reason for Dyson Allen to go into that bedroom. 'Apart . from the three young children who were asleep in their beds, he was the . only person upstairs when the fire started and he was the person that . alerted the other occupants of the house to what was happening.' Mother-of-nine . Ms Smith, 37, said she said remembered the lights going off and then . the defendant jumped down the stairs and shouted 'Fire' before he ran . through the kitchen and out of the back door. Twins Holly and Ella Smith, aged four, were killed in the fire in Freckleton, Lancashire, in January this year . Mr Flewitt said: 'Michelle Smith's memory of subsequent events is understandably not clear but she recalls being taken out of the house and sitting on the little wall at the end of the driveway. 'She doesn't remember Reece going up the stairs but she remembers him being brought out and everyone gathering around him. 'Thereafter she was taken in a police car to the hospital where she discovered that four of her children had died in the fire.' Ms Smith told police that smoke alarms had been fitted at the top and bottom of the stairs but Reece had taken them down in the days before the fire because one or both of them kept making beeping noises. She said she took the twins up to bed at about 10pm to join Jordan who was already asleep. The . prosecutor said: 'She is sure that the doors to the wardrobe were . closed when she left the room because it annoys her if they are left . open so she always checks that they are closed and that the children's . dressing gowns are hanging from the handles.' Allen, from the Freckleton area, denies four counts of murder and four alternative counts of manslaughter. The . court heard the recollection of most of the witnesses who attended the . party was 'affected to some extent by drink and in some cases by drugs . in the form of cannabis.' Mr . Flewitt said: 'In particular, most of the witnesses are unable to say . with any certainty at what time various events occurred.' Reece Smith (right) died as he tried to save his twin sisters and little brother Jordan (left), two . It could be established though that the first 999 call to report a fire was made at 11.20pm by a neighbour. And that some time after 10.45pm one of the family friends, who was sober, went up to the bedroom where Allen was. He said the defendant appeared 'drunk and stoned' after Allen had earlier told him was going to make a mix for a cannabis bong. When he returned downstairs there was a loud bang shortly after and all the lights in the house went off. In a witness statement given to police . in the early hours of January 8, Allen confirmed he was a friend of . Reece and one of the victim's younger brothers. He . said he began celebrating Ms Smith's birthday at lunchtime by drinking . from a bottle of vodka. Allen said he was upstairs when the lights . suddenly went out and he thought it was a power cut. He saw the children's bedroom door was shut but he could see an 'orange glow' in a gap at the bottom. 'I . opened the door to check and all of a sudden thick black smoke just hit . me in the face,' he said. It knocked me backwards. I started shouting . ""fire, fire"" straight away.' He . said he told Reece there was a fire and to 'get those kids out'. He ran . downstairs to rouse a person who had fallen asleep on the sofa and then . ran outside. Firefighters outside the house where the three children and a teenager were killed in January this year the morning after the fatal blaze . The court heard that Reece was heard kicking at the door to the children's bedroom as others escaped from the property. When police arrived at the bungalow the defendant was outside, and an officer asked him if he was all right. Allen replied: 'No I'm not. Please, . I'm worried about my friend Reece. He went back in and upstairs for the . babies. I tried to follow Reece upstairs to get the babies but the smoke . was too thick. I've got asthma and I couldn't do it.' Reece . Smith was pronounced dead at the scene, while the three other children . all died at Royal Preston Hospital shortly after midnight, the court . heard. Post-mortem examinations concluded all four had died from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by smoke inhalation. Mr . Flewitt told the jury that several 'extremely detailed investigations' had taken place into the cause of the fire and the unanimous view of the . experts was that it was started deliberately. One . expert concluded the fire started in the hanging clothes in the . wardrobe, and the most likely source of ignition was a naked flame. Allen said he saw an 'orange glow' in a gap at the bottom of the door and that he ran down the stairs shouting 'fire, fire' The fire was detected because of an electrical fault that caused the house electrics to trip out, he continued. And anyone who caused the fire would have seen the ignition and would have had 'ample opportunity' to raise the alarm. The electrical fault occurred when the fire spread from the wardrobe to a lighting unit fitted to the ceiling of the room, the jury was told. By that time the fire would have already reached its maximum, said Mr Flewitt. Forensic evidence showed the three children in the bedroom were likely to have been 'incapacitated very quickly' but that Ella and Jordan made attempts to escape. Outside Lytham Road, the defendant told a neighbour 'the electrics all cut off' and 'we had to put candles up'. Another neighbour told police she overheard Allen say: 'It was the candle. The electric went off and we put a candle in the room. I went upstairs and there was a glow and I felt the door and it was so hot I ran downstairs and rang the Fire Brigade.' Mr Flewitt told the jury: 'You may wish to consider whether what the defendant was saying suggests that he knew rather more about the start of the fire than he later told the police when he made his witness statement. 'Moreover, you will have noticed that what the defendant said does not fit with the sequence of events described by the experts - namely that the electricity went off as a result of, and not before, the fire. So there would have been no opportunity to put a candle in the bedroom because by then the fire would have been burning for between three and five minutes.' On January 10 the defendant went to a church memorial service in Lytham for the Smith family. He later called at the Station pub in the town with several others, said the prosecutor, where he was said to have told a friend: 'I don't know what to do. I've screwed up. I'm leaving tomorrow and going to Liverpool.' Allen was arrested the next day and then bailed pending further inquiries. Police re-arrested him in December 2012 and found two 'interesting' Skype conversations recovered from his laptop, said the prosecutor. In one of the chats he told a female Skype user: 'btw (by the way) this is what I did xxxxxx. Well menna have done xxxxx.' He then sent her a website link to a newspaper article which detailed his arrest on suspicion of murder. Allen went on to maintain his innocence before police charged him with the four murders. The trial, which is scheduled to last up to eight weeks, continues tomorrow.

"If remembering your four digit PIN is confusing, things are about to get a lot worse. Researchers have unveiled a new, safer system using colours and symbols as well as numbers. They say it could cut ATM fraud dramatically. The keypad of the future? The colours and symbols  move around each time the pad is used, and are displayed on its screen . A user chooses a PIN with a combination of numbers, colours and shapes/symbols: for example - 3, square, pink, flag. Each . time that the user has to input their pin, the colours and symbols . randomly change position on the keypad, so you’re never pressing . the same sequence of keys. Called Tri-Pin, the idea came to inventor Glynn Reynolds after a friend was a victim of ATM fraud. 'Tri-pin is a very simple, but effective idea with a higher level of security than traditional PINs,' he said. The system would avoid many current practices used by fraudster to steal PIN numbers, such as 'shoulder surfing' to see which keys are being pressed. Because different keys would be pressed every time a withdrawl was made, it would be impossible to find a PIN without seeing the screen and keypad clearly. 'It looks like much like any other 10 digit . keypad, but instead of each button having just a number, they also have . a colour and a symbol/shape,' the firm says. A user chooses a PIN with a combination of numbers, colours and shapes/symbols:,for example - 3, square, pink, flag.

The first company to use TRI-PIN is Lunabee on there oneSafe app on iPhone, iPad and Mac.

The 25-year-old actress turned up at 5.30am in an apparent bid to slip in quietly and thwart the waiting media. But she was not let in until 6am, when she was pictured being ushered in via the back door. Scroll down for video... Caught on camera: Lindsay Lohan arrived early today to perform community service at Los Angeles County Morgue . Running ahead of schedule: Lindsay turned up at 5.30am - although she was not let inside until 6am . Lohan was chauffeur driven to the morgue in her black Cadillac Escalade and aerial shots capture the Mean Girls star exiting the vehicle. Dressed appropriately in mournful black, Lindsay was wearing a hooded jacket teamed with leggings, booted heels and shades. She kept her face hidden under her . hoodie as she entered the building at the back - a special privilege afforded . to her because of the huge media presence outside. Members of the general public who perform community service at the morgue have to use the front entrance. Going incognito: The actress kept hidden under a hooded jacket and was wearing black leggings and heels . Ready to muck in: The Mean Girls star is ushered into the back of the building by a worker while flanked by paparazzi and camera crews . Media frenzy: Assistant . Chief Coroner Ed Winter speaks to the waiting Press . Yesterday Lindsay was turned away from the morgue by staff after rolling up in an $80,000 Porsche Panamera - 40 minutes late. There are around ten other people . serving community service at the morgue today - but it is believed . Lindsay could be kept separate from them. Lindsay is reported to have cheered staff at the morgue today by treating them to lunch from the California favourite, In 'N' Out burger. The actress made the gesture after staff were told to bring packed lunches today because they are not able to leave the building for a break, due to the extensive media presence outside. But while Radar Online reported that the burger lunch went down well, 36 fancy cupcakes were turned away. It was initially unclear who had ordered the cupcakes, but Lohan's spokesman has now admitted it was Lindsay. The spokesman explained it was intended as a a sorry gesture to staff after she turned up late yesterday, saying: 'Lindsay ordered cupcakes for the staff . and volunteers. When they were delivered, morgue supervisors would not . let them into the building.' 'It is unfortunate that Lindsay's well-intentioned actions were not . taken in the spirit in which she intended... to say she was sorry for . yesterday's misunderstanding.' Assistant chief coroner Ed Winter told TMZ that they wouldn't be accepting food and sent the delivery man from Magnolia Bakery in Beverly Hills away. Everyone has been told to bring packed lunches today - as they will not be allowed out of the building, Good Day LA reports. The TV network spoke to a 23-year-old named only as Evan who is also performing community service at the morgue. He said duties included cleaning sinks . and bathrooms and 'going where the bodies are to cut out plastic sheets . that are used to wrap the bodies in'. Sources have since told TMZ.com that Lindsay is on sheet washing duty - and covered her mouth in shock when she first set eyes on some blood-stained sheets. While her duties do not involve handling corpses in any way, she has apparently set eyes on a dead body and seemed 'shocked', the website reports. Lohan has to complete 16 hours between now and her next court appearance on November 2. Photos from yesterday show her arriving in the morgue's car park before being turned away by staff. After . finding herself with her day unexpectedly free, Lohan decided to put . her time to good use by attending a last minute therapy session. Lindsay posted on Twitter yesterday: 'With all of . the stress and pressure from yesterday and today, I've never been so . happy to go to therapy!!!! Also, I'm sorry for the confusion that I may . of caused to those at the Coroner's office. Won't happen again, now I . know where to go! Thank you for your help.' Although the LA Coroner's spokesman . said Lohan was 40 minutes late to her 8am appointment, she claimed she . was 'approximately 20 minutes late'. Man in demand: Winter turned Lindsay away from the morgue yesterday after she arrived late . But . after her 'confusion' over what entrance to use on Thursday, her . publicist insisted the actress would report to the morgue on time later . today. Her publicist Steven Honig said: 'Lindsay arrived at the . morgue approximately 20 minutes late and will be returning for . orientation tomorrow. 'Her lateness was due to a combination . of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the . media waiting for her arrival. Too late! Yesterday Lindsay was turned away after she arrived 40 minutes late in a Porsche . 'Lindsay . spoke with the supervisors at the morgue. They showed her how to get in, . and everything is all cleared up.' Assistant . Chief Coroner Ed Winter, . however, is unconvinced by Lohan's excuse, telling reporters that she . has been to the morgue before so should have known where to go. And she . may not just be able to turn up today without the judge's permission. Winter added: 'Ms. Lohan has to have permission from the probation department and/or . the judge, that she can come back. 'I haven't heard from the probation . department or the judge about whether or not Ms. Lohan will be allowed . to come back.' Well the rest of the day is free now... Lindsay made use of her free time yesterday by going to the dentist to get her teeth whitened . Getting her Hollywood smile back: Lohan is hoping to have pearly whites when she turns up at the morgue later today . However, Lindsay still believes she is on track. 'She is going to . orientation tomorrow unless the Court tells her otherwise, which has not . happened,' Steve Honig, Lohan's spokesperson told Radar. Lohan will face the wrath of Judge Sautner on her November court appearance. Lohan is already skating on thin ice . with Sautner, who on Wednesday blasted the Machete actress for not making . an effort to complete her probation. Where's Lindsay? Camera crews wait for Lohan's arrival at the morgue yesterday when she arrived late . Clean-up duty: Lohan has been ordered to complete 16 hours at the morgue before her next court hearing on November 2 . The judge is incensed the actress has . barely scratched the surface of the 480 hours of community service she . was ordered to complete as part of her sentence for the theft of a gold . necklace earlier this year. Lohan only did around a . day-and-a-half at the Downtown Women's Centre in LA - and failed to show . up nine times, resulting in her being rejected from the programme. This week she did some volunteer work . for the Red Cross - but Sautner ruled it as void because it was not . part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier . hearing. Long arm of the law: Lindsay seen here arriving for her court hearing on Wednesday . Finding her feet: Lindsay tweet from yesterday apologising . for the confusion at the morgue and suggesting she had got lost . Sautner said only time completed at the women's centre and the morgue counted. In a further development, LA County . Sheriff Lee Baca has told Fox 11's Good Day LA that the overcrowding . issue will not keep Lohan out of jail. He told the show that if Lindsay is . sentenced to jail time he will make sure he finds room for her, adding . she needs at least 60 days inside to be rehabilitated. What a twit: She also tweeted that she was pleased to be going to therapy after a stressful day yesterday and in court on Wednesday . The news comes after Lohan's father Michael spoke out, alleging his daughter was back on drugs and needs help. He said the recent photos of her . discoloured and apparently rotting teeth was down to her smoking . methamphetamine or crack cocaine. Lohan posted $100,000 bail on Wednesday following her court hearing. Meanwhile, the beleaguered star's mother is set to blow the lid on her daughter's alleged drug and alcohol use in a memoir she's currently shopping around Hollywood. Website TMZ has obtained the draft of a prologue for Dina Lohan's memoir, which Dina's spokesperson is pitching to the literary world. An excerpt from the prologue allegedly written by Dina says: 'I blamed her friends, her career and her handlers for an (sic) newfound lifestyle of partying excessively. 'Drinking, drugging and behaving irresponsibly became Lindsay's way of daily living--and it tore me up inside.' Lead away in cuffs: Lindsay was taken into custody after being blasted by the judge. She later posted $100,000 bail . Laying the lawn down: Judge Stephanie Saunter pulled not punches during yesterday's hearing . Kicked off: Lindsay missed nine scheduled times . to work at The Downtown Women's Center and told the Probation Office it . did not 'fulfil' her .","Arrives under a cover of darkness at 5.30am .

"Paulie Malignaggi believes the time is now for Floyd Mayweather Jnr to face Manny Pacquiao – but has backed Amir Khan to pose the bigger problem for the pound-for-pound No 1. Mayweather and Pacquiao have so far failed to agree terms for the biggest fight in history but after the latter's victory over Chris Algieri last weekend, speculation has grown that it could finally happen next May. But Malignaggi, who lost to Khan in 2010, is confident the Brit is a real threat to Mayweather's unbeaten record, assuming he can overcome Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand on December 13. Manny Pacquiao waves to his fans during a victory parade after his win over Chris Algieri last weekend . Pacquiao knocked Algieri down six times before recording a points victory in the gambling mecca of . 'The Pacquiao fight is the one everyone wants and demands; that's the fight that will sell most,' he told Sportsmail. 'There's a lot of momentum with the Pacquiao fight, more than I've seen before so if it's ever to be made, now is the time. I'm hearing that they're really pushing to make it but if Amir puts in a great performance on December 13, he'll take a lot of attention away from Pacquiao and make a big statement. 'I do feel in my heart that Amir is more of a threat to Floyd and he is the greatest risk to Mayweasther's undefeated record. 'I know some people don't agree with that because of the fanfare Pacquiao has but this is not a popularity contest. Styles win fights and I believe Amir has a style that will give Mayweather a lot more trouble than Pacquiao. Floyd Mayweather has yet to commit to a fight with Pacquiao despite it being the fight everyone wants . Mayweather fought Marcos Maidana twice this year, recording comfortable points victories each time . 'If the Pacquiao fight doesn't come off and Amir comes through against Devon, he deserves a shot at Mayweather.' Malignaggi is also confident that Khan will overcome Alexander next month, a fight that sees the 2004 Olympic silver medalist return to Sky Sports. 'It's a solid fight between two top welterweights,' he added. 'Amir has gone through something of an evolution since losing to Danny Garcia. He hasn't changed his style but he's a bit more intelligent. 'At first he didn't look so impressive and even I was starting to wonder if he was finished but in the last fight he showed a brand new psychological confidence. He still has all the ability technically but now he's mentally in a good zone and it shows in his boxing. Bolton welterweight Amir Khan (left) takes on Devon Alexander (right) in Las Vegas next month . Khan made a winning debut at welterweight in Las Vegas last May to move closer to a fight with Mayweather . 'The guys who box don't have success against Amir but guys who punch wild and are not scared to punch with him do and in those cases he's been caught. People like Breidis Prescott and Danny Garcia and even Marcos Maidana at times gave Amir a ton of trouble. 'Ultimately, to box Amir is a very difficult thing to do because he knows how to win rounds. Devon is a very good boxer but I'm not sure he'll be handle Amir's style.'

"Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel found himself on the receiving end of diatribe from a Democratic lawmaker on Thursday afternoon over the Obama administration's plan to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels as part of its strategy to defeat the Islamic State. California Rep. Loretta Sanchez harangued Hagel at a House Armed Services Committee hearing for not offering Congress documentation on which Syrians it plans to give weapons to and how it will prevent Islamic extremists from confiscating those arms. 'I don't think that the plan that I have seen was detailed enough to make me believe that your plan will work,' she told Hagel. 'I'm not so sure of it, and I haven't heard the details as I'd like to hear them,' she said moments later. Scroll down for video . Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was on the receiving end of a diatribe from a Democratic congresswoman while testifying before the House Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill today. The congresswoman, California Rep. Loretta Sanchez, demanded to know detailed information about the administration's plan to arm moderate Syrian rebels . A House-passed resolution calls for the United States government to give weapons to 'appropriately vetted' members of the Syrian opposition of both ISIS and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The plan, approved yesterday in the lower chamber by a vote of 273-156 as an amendment to legislation that would fund the federal government through December, stipulates that the Obama administration can arm the rebels, but it must give Congress an outline of it's intended actions before it can commence the program. Ahead of the vote, Iraq war veteran and Hawaii Rep.Tulsi Gabbard blasted the notion of arming Syrian rebels as 'unrealistic' and warned that Obama and his advisers were on track to repeat the previous administration's mistakes in Iraq. 'We’ve heard this story before. We know how it ends. Look at Iraq. Look at Libya,' Gabbard, who is also a Democrat, said. 'Clearly, our leaders have not learned their lesson. We must focus on taking out our enemies and investing in our own country here at home,' she continued. Another Iraq veteran, California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican who also fought in Afghanistan, said he no longer had 'confidence we are arming the right people.' 'We don't know how moderate these Syrian rebels really are,' Sanchez chimed in on the House floor Wednesday. 'In fact, some of my Syrian constituents, Syrian Americans who live in Orange County, have told me that there are no moderates left or, worse, that the moderates, given the choice between losing or Assad or ISIS, want ISIS, and they say people aren't going to fight against ISIS,' she claimed. 'We don't know if somewhere down the line they will turn our guns right back on us. 'In fact, that is one of the scarier things that we have to face,' she added. 'We simply don't know who we can trust. In an uncontrolled, war-torn destabilized country, who do we trust?' Sanchez, Gabbard and Hunter were among the lawmakers who voted against the amendment. A demonstrator is removed from House Armed Services Committee hearing after interrupting Hagel as he testified about the U.S. response to the ongoing threat from the Islamic State. Hagel was in the middle of his opening statement when two protesters, one of whom is not pictured, sought to steal the spotlight . In today's Armed Services Committee hearing featuring testimony from Hagel, Sanchez restated her concerns that the arms the United States provides to the so-called moderate Syrian rebels may fall into the hands of the Islamic radicals the Obama administration has promised to 'degrade and destroy.' Contending that it's 'pretty disturbing' this afternoon's hearing with Hagel happened after the vote to authorize the weapons program, Sanchez said her Syrian constituents have informed her that 'Syrian moderates have gone over to ISIS.' 'And most of them have told me that they don't think that the Syrian moderates we arm, whoever those may be, are actually going to fight against the ISIS moderates who used to hang out with the Syrian moderates,' she said. Pointing to war in Iraq - which she also voted against - as an example, she argued that the U.S. spent $35 billion on equipment and training for the Iraqis, yet ISIS managed rise up and take over large parts of the country anyway. After indirectly referencing her Republican colleagues on the committee, Sanchez said that 'some have said wasn't a problem of equip and train, it was a lack of leadership, it was bad people commanding, it was the commander in chief, [former Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki] who was wrong and didn't help us on this or didn't make this thing work,' she said. 'Can you tell me who the commander in chief of the Syrian moderates - who are all over the place, don't even talk to each other sometimes - how we're gonna see that leadership?' she asked. 'What type of arms, exactly, what type of arms, are we going to hand over to these people? Because the last time I checked, we handed over arms to Maliki and they ended up in ISIS and the very safe arms are going after us.' Hagel had said in his opening statement that the U.S. would give the rebels small arms, vehicles, and basic communications equipment in addition to providing them with tactical training. As they prove themselves, he said, the U.S. military will provide them with more sophisticated training. Repeating testimony he gave to a Senate panel on Tuesday, Hagel promised that the Syrian rebels accepted into the program would go through a 'rigorous vetting process' and that the Department of Defense would work hand-in-hand with the State Department to 'monitor them closely' to make sure that the weapons are not transferred to ISIS. 'There will always be risk in a program like this, but we believe that risk is justified by the imperative of destroying ISIL – and the necessity of having capable partners on the ground in Syria,' he said on Tuesday and in similar testimony again today. Rep.  Loretta Sanchez, pictured here at a Homeland Security Committee hearing in June, is known for her intense questioning style in committee hearings. Today she blasted Secretary of Defense Hagel for encouraging Congress to authorize a plan she fears will have an adverse effect in the fight against ISIS . During her dressing down of Hagel, Sanchez also tore into the Obama administration over its claims that an international coalition of 40 countries are standing with the U.S. against ISIS. 'Who? What will they really do? How many troops?' she demanded to know of the Pentagon head, noting several times along the way that he could provide this information to her privately if necessary. The administration has repeatedly stated that the U.S. has the backing of dozens of other countries in the fight against ISIS but has refused to name names in most cases. 'I've been through this, you guys,' Sanchez told her colleagues today. 'I saw the coalition in Iraq, and we used to sort of, like, chuckle at each other,' she said, explaining that some countries provided just one person do things like 'training dogs.' As her time to question Hagel expired - before the Obama administration official could answer her questions - Sanchez clarified that she wants the president's strategy to take out ISIS to prove successful, though she fears it won't. 'I hope your plan works, because you know, ISIS, ISIL, they're not good,' she said. 'I hope I am wrong. I hoped the same thing when I voted against the Iraq war, that I was wrong, but I don't believe that I was wrong on that,' she added. Secretary of State John Kerry has promised to reveal the names of the international coalition frequently referred to by the administration in the immediate future. 'Later this week we will have more to say about our partners and the coalition,' he told a Senate panel on Wednesday. 'Not every country will decide that their role is to have military engagement, but every country can do something,' the former Massachusetts Senator said without going into further detail. Members of the committee, which oversees foreign affairs, were unimpressed. 'Typically you have a coalition in place before you announce it,' Republican Sen. Bob Corker told his former colleague. 'In this case we have announced one and are attempting to put it together. 'Do you realize how unserious the things you are laying out sound?' Corker asked the country's top diplomat.","Congressman Loretta Sanchez lit into the Secretary of Defense for not providing a blueprint of the weapons and training program to Congress .

Then he drew his last breath and just rested ... He was gone'. Mrs Mandela said her family would remember her former husband for his legacy and reconciliation and for being so completely unselfish in giving his whole life 'to the nation and to the world'.

"Aaron Cresswell's first goal for West Ham handed them victory over Newcastle. CLICK HERE see the stats behind the game with our Match Zone. Eventually, when it came to Newcastle conceding a goal, there was little they could do about it. Eight hours and eight minutes had lapsed on the watch, their net having been safely guarded for almost two months, when Aaron Cresswell sensed trouble as everybody else stood and watched. Cheikhou Kouyate sent a hopeless volley towards goal, Cheick Tiote failed to react and the full-back, signed from Ipswich in the summer, crept up behind him and thrashed home past goalkeeper Rob Elliot, who was deputising for the injured Tim Krul. It was a way befitting of winning this; West Ham laboured but eventually came out on top, with Alan Pardew’s side being reduced to 10 men following two bookings in a minute for Moussa Sissoko after Cresswell’s winner.

Subs not used: Alnwick, Anita, Armstrong, Riviere . Booked: Williamson, Colback, Sissoko . Red card: Sissoko (two yellows) Referee: Mike Dean 6 . Att: 34,977 . Star man: Mark Noble . This pair of swashbucklers had a week off. Sam Allardyce will shrug, point to being without a number of key players and throw a knowing nudge to the league table. The Hammers are fifth, have striker Andy Carroll fit — winning the majority of his headers — and enjoy options from the bench. They may look at these three points and wonder of the significance because, make no mistake, West Ham were second best for long spells. ‘It’s a massive victory for us,’ said Allardyce. ‘The opposition who came here had a better run of results than Chelsea — and that’s saying something. ‘To get to 21 points is huge. And you’ve got to give Cresswell a huge amount of credit for his finish.’ But it was hard work. The Magpies were impressively tenacious in hunting down possession and know that, in Ayoze Perez, they finally have a man to hit — something to have gone missing since Carroll upped sticks to Liverpool for £35million three years ago. It was Perez who dragged an early effort wide after inventive work from Yoan Gouffran and flicked just wide from Sammy Ameobi’s near-post cross. Carroll had a rather optimistic shout for handball turned down when his volley struck Mike Williamson half a yard away. But West Ham had offered little, appearing to be missing the creativity and brute force of Diafra Sakho and Alex Song, who both offer something different, something Allardyce has not been afforded throughout his time in charge at Upton Park. Without them — and the equally important Enner Valencia — they lack some intuition on the ball. Even when four on three and breaking at pace, Stewart Downing could only fire over the top. It is by no means Carroll’s fault but he is too easy a target. There is not the need to take risks in midfield and it makes for occasional sterility going forward. Tension of old crept in as Newcastle grew into the game further and there were cries of exasperation when the galavanting Cresswell had a rush of blood and ballooned a wild effort over the bar. But in a game lacking genuine quality, fittingly a mis-hit settled things. Andy Carroll tussles with Ivorian defensive midfielder Cheick Tiote during the match at Upton Park .

Kouyate’s attempt at a half-volley on the edge of the box embarrassingly bobbled goalwards but Cresswell, jumping on Tiote’s indecision, gobbled up the chance to poke beyond Elliot to chalk up his first for the club. ‘It just fell nicely for him and you sensed one goal would be enough,’ said Pardew, after seeing his side’s six-game winning streak end abruptly. One would have been enough for them and it should have come. Perez had flashed an effort straight at Adrian and the manager brought on Papiss Cisse in desperate need of an equaliser, but they ran out of ideas. And down to 10, too. Sissoko allowed frustration to get the better of him when Mike Dean correctly adjudged he had fouled Carl Jenkinson, booting the ball 60 yards away and seeing yellow. Not a minute later, he was throwing himself at Carroll and that was that. Pardew lowered his head and shook the midfielder’s hand as he trudged off. ‘He has lost his mind a little bit,’ said Pardew. ‘It’s not like Moussa, he has been outstanding for us. He will apologise to Andy.’ It was over. The glorious run since the beginning of October, to have propelled Newcastle into European contention, was done with a mis-hit and moment of madness. And it was topped off by a stoppage-time swing of Cisse’s boot to send the ball flying into the Sir Trevor Brooking Stand.

"A loving pair of otters were captured snoozing while holding hands to stop them floating apart in their slumber. The male and female, named Nellie and Abra, were cuddling up on their waterbed after a playful morning together. And despite the water's chilly temperature, the otters were in no danger of catching a cold as their fur is one of the densest in the animal kingdom - with up to a million hairs per square inch. Inseparable: A pair of northern sea otters hold hands while floating across water in Tacoma, Washington, USA . Water baby: Although otters can walk on land, they prefer to stay in the water with their thick coats - up to a million hairs per square inch - keeping them warm . Photographer John Vargas, 62, said: 'The otters' eyes were shut and they appeared to be napping. They slowly and smoothly floated across the water as if they were skating on ice.' Otters are known to hold hands in groups - called a raft - while they eat, sleep and rest, to prevent families losing each other. The furry animals, the largest member of the weasel family, are even known to wrap sea plants around them to secure the bond. These photographs were captured at Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington, but in the USA they can be found in the wild in Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, the Commander Islands, the northwestern coast of Vancouver Island and Washington. Laid back: Otters hold hands while eating and sleeping so they don't accidentally lose each other . Drifting off: Otters will also secure themselves to sea plants to make sure they aren't swept away by water currents while they sleep . Northern sea otters have historically been hunted for their dense, waterproof fur. They came close to extinction at the turn of the 20th Century but are now protected by the International Fur Seal Treaty and the US Marine Mammal Protection Act. In 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil spill is estimated to have killed about 5,000 sea otters. They are also threatened by parasites and infectious diseases, thought to reach the ocean via storm drain runoff. Heavyweight: Adult sea otters typically weigh between 14 and 45 kg making them the heaviest members of the weasel family, but among the smallest marine mammals .

"Manchester United beat Hull City 3-0 at Old Trafford in the Barclays Premier League. Chris Smalling, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie got themselves among the goals, but Juan Mata topped the lot in Sportsmail's player ratings. Scroll down for more. MANCHESTER UNITED . David de Gea - 6.5 . Had little to do but such is his current form there was no doubt he would deal with the sporadic occasion that Hull managed to get the ball in the United box. Antonio Valencia - 6.5 . Given United’s seemingly endless injury list, Valencia is turning into an important squad man for van Gaal and, against such modest opposition, looked a decent right-back. Chris Smalling - 8 . A goalscorer, thanks to some dodgy goalkeeping, but also turned in a commanding display at the back that suggests his recent nightmare at the Etihad is behind him. Chris Smalling scores the opening goal of the match for Manchester United against Hull City . Marcos Rojo - 6.5 . Back from injury, his solid showing alongside Smalling was another plus point for van Gaal although far stiffer test await. Ashley Young - 6.5 . Presumably left-back is not his favoured position but against opposition like this, it scarcely mattered. Maybe the van Gaal “philosophy” is finally being picked up by his players though because Young fitted in there seemlessly. Angel di Maria - 6 . Was looking lively in the opening quarter of an hour until a hamstring injury forced him off. Ashley Young (right) celebrates with Wayne Rooney during United's comfortable 3-0 win . Marouane Fellaini - 7 . Has grown in stature over the past few weeks and no longer looks the joke signing he did a few months ago. His physicality and size at set pieces adds an important dimension to United’s play. Michael Carrick - 7 . Really steady performance, barely wasted a pass and provided a valuable barrier in front of an inexperienced and makeshift back four. Juan Mata - 9 . For a man whose future at the club has been under much debate, he certainly looked like a match winner. In the right system, and right conditions, is still world-class. Juan Mata was a match winner for United and played world class for Louis van Gaal's United . Wayne Rooney - 7 . His goal was a textbook finish and vintage Rooney while his corner sent panic through the Hull defence and led to the opener. Robin van Persie - 7 . The finish was excellent, as was a diving header that was offside but still showed his scoring instincts are alive and well. The goal will have done his flagging confidence the world of good. Robin van Persie and Rooney celebrate together during the 3-0 win over Hull at Old Trafford . Subs . Herrera (on for Di Maria 15 - 7) Falcao (on for van Persie 70 - 6) Fletcher (on for Valencia 73) HULL . Allan McGregor - 5 . Had two opportunities to deal with the opening goal and fluffed both; after that, it was downhill for him and his team. James Chester - 6 . Did well to put off van Persie as he looked certain to score in the first half but spent the rest of the game fighting a desperate rearguard action. Michael Dawson - 6.5 . Threw his body in the way of plenty of shots - to important effect on more than one occasion and made an incredible block to thwart Falcao - but struggled to cope with the movement and strength of Rooney. Michael Dawson clashes with Van Persie at Old Trafford during a busy afternoon for the Hull defender . Curtis Davies - 5 . No lack of effort but couple of fundamental unforced errors, especially laying the ball off for van Persie to tee up Rooney for the killer second goal. Andrew Robertson - 7 . Forced de Gea into his first “save” of the game with a decent run and toe-poke at the United keeper after 53 minutes - that stat said more about Hull’s toothless attacking play than anything else. Jake Livermore - 6.5 . At least he looked as if he cared - which can’t be said of all his team mates - but had the thankless task of sitting in front of a back four that was under pressure for most of the 90 minutes. Andrew Robertson fends off Rooney during the 3-0 match that ended in United's favour . Ahmed Elmohamady - 5.5 . With United’s full-backs pushing high up the field, Hull’s wide midfielders were always doomed to spend the contest on the back foot and so it proved with Elmohamady. Mohamed Diame - 5.5 . United’s midfield ran riot and controlled the game with almost embarrassing ease. Surely Steve Bruce expects more from the likes of Diame. Hatem Ben Arfa - 4 . Brought off 10 minutes before the break as Steve Bruce looked to gain a foothold in the game. Ben Arfa had not looked like providing one. Hatem Ben Arfa was brought off 10 minutes before the break as he failed to get a foothold in the game . Robbie Brady - 5 . Hardly his fault that he made zero impact on proceedings given the fact he and Hull barely saw the ball all afternoon. Nikica Jelavic - 6 . Couple of headed half chances came his way late on in proceedings and at least he looked interested and, in the case of the second one, forced a save out of de Gea. Nikica Jelavic had a couple of headed chances late in the game but could not get on the score sheet . Subs .

"A fitness instructor who attacked a judge and knocked off his wig has been jailed for 18 months after admitting contempt of court. Paul Graham, 27, of Haverhill, raced from the public gallery and vaulted over a gate to get behind the judge’s bench before throwing punches at Judge John Devaux in court two at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday. Judge Devaux had just sentenced his brother, Philip Graham, 30, of the same address, to 30 months in prison for causing death by dangerous driving. Fitness instructor Paul Graham has been jailed for 18 months for attacking a John Devaux . Appearing in handcuffs and wearing a black vest top before Judge David Goodin this morning, Paul Graham admitted contempt. He was flanked in the dock by three security guards throughout the hearing and an extra guard stood by the exit. Judge . Goodin described how the High Sheriff of Suffolk Sir Edward Greenwell . and a local clergyman who had been sitting alongside Judge Devaux 'did . their best to bring the attack to an end'. Police officers in the case managed to restrain Paul Graham before security guards led him away. 'When . the judge had passed the inevitable sentence of imprisonment, you left . the public gallery at speed, travelled down the side of the court very . fast, vaulted over the wooden gate at the side of the bench, physically . attacked Judge Devaux by punches which actually caused no physical . injury,' he said. 'That conduct was disruptive, insulting and intimidating. It was a contempt of court. 'We . have in this country courts which are open to the public, but what you . did was an attack on justice, on the administration of justice, an . attack on the rule of law. The attack was launched as the judge jailed Philip Graham, 30, for 30 months for killing Derek Foster, pictured right, by dangerous driving . 'Any violent physical attack on the judge or any member of court staff or officer of the court must be dealt with severely.' Richard Potts, mitigating, said his . client did not accept he threw punches but accepted there had been a . struggle and that he had behaved in an intimidating manner. He added: 'He has instructed me to apologise unreservedly on his behalf. 'He is a physically fit man and had he really wished to do real physical harm, there is no doubt he could have done so. 'It was a spontaneous act borne out of high emotion. It was an outpouring of grief. 'There is going to be a substantial diminution in the family as a result of both brothers being in custody.' Court drama: Witnesses claim the male attacker pulled off Judge Devaux's wig and his robes at at Ipswich Crown Court, stock image pictured, earlier today . He added that Paul Graham had a university education and was qualified as a security guard and personal trainer. Philip Graham was convicted after a . trial earlier this year of killing father-of-two Derek Foster, 37, when . his car hit the victim’s motorcycle on the B1054 in July last year. Mr Foster’s widow and family were in court at the time of the attack. Court reporter Jane Hunt, who . witnessed the drama, wrote in the East Anglian Daily Times: 'In a matter . of seconds, and before anyone had time to react, the man raced past the . press bench where I was sitting and past lawyers involved in the case . and vaulted a wooden gate leading to the area where Judge Devaux was. 'During the melee Judge Devaux’s wig . and glasses were pulled off and after the man, who was ranting and . shouting abuse throughout the incident, was pulled away from him the . judge was led from court by staff looking shaken but apparently . uninjured.'","Judge John Devaux attacked by Paul Graham at Ipswich Crown Court .

"Brazilian-born rapper, Yuri Santos, 23, who uses the stage name, Aggro Santos, at Chichester Magistrate's court . Former I’m A Celebrity contestant Aggro Santos raped two girls, one aged just 16, when he took them back to his hotel room after performing at gigs, a court has heard. The 23-year-old Brazilian-born rapper is accused of forcing one of the victims to have sex with him after he performed at the opening of Club Soho in Yeovil, Somerset, on September 25 2010. He is then accused of raping a 16-year-old girl last year after the University of Chichester summer ball while friend and co-defendant Tyrelle Ritchie forced her to perform oral sex on him. Chichester Crown Court was told that in the Yeovil incident the victim and a friend had gone to the club opening to see Santos perform. Afterwards, as they waited in the car park, the victim asked Santos, who was in a 4x4 type car, for his photograph on behalf of her friend who was 'obsessed by him'. In a video-taped interview shown to the jury, the victim, in her 20s, said: 'I shouted ""Aggro, here let’s have a picture"". 'He said ""Do you want better? Jump on in"".' 'There were other girls but he asked us, so we did.' She described how they went back to the Yeovil Court Hotel where she had consensual sex with Santos’s manager while her friend went to another room with the rapper. She said that a few minutes later the pair returned and Santos tried to initiate sex with her. She said: 'He got up, I thought he was just being a boy, really immature. 'He got his penis out, waving it about. I thought he was just being an idiot, at first I was just laughing at him.' Having described the star as well-endowed, she added: 'I started mocking him. I said ""Does it p*** you off that your manager gets more female attention than you do?"".' Aggro Santos at Chichester Crown Court, West Sussex, on charges of raping two women . Accused: The former I'm A Celebrity contestant on his mobile phone nearby the court . She said he then swore at her before pushing her on to the bed and raping her in front of the friend and manager. She said: 'I just went crazy and managed to get him off me and wanted to get out of the room. 'He got in front of me, I said he was sick. 'He kept repeating ""I have been blessed, I have been blessed by Jesus"".' She added: 'At that point I was really scared, I realised how powerful he was.' In the second incident, which happened in Chichester, West Sussex, on May 7 last year, Santos had performed at the university’s summer ball when his crew invited the victim, her sister, who was a student at the university, and two friends to a backstage room for drinks. Isobel Ascherson, prosecuting, said the group were then invited to an after-show party at the Ship Hotel and they agreed to go. Miss Ascherson said the 16-year-old then had consensual sex with Santos in his hotel bathroom while her sister had consensual sex with 21-year-old Ritchie in another room. She said the victim then accused Santos of forcing her to have sex for a second time at the same time as Ritchie forced her to perform oral sex on him. Miss Ascherson said the girl managed to escape from the pair and she was found in 'a state of extreme distress' by her sister. She said the sister went back into the hotel and confronted the defendants, causing a commotion which led to the police being called and Santos being arrested. Kimberly Wyatt, former Pussycat Dolls singer, featured in Santos's debut single, Candy, which shot to number five in the UK charts in 2010 . Miss Ascherson said the victim of the Yeovil incident only reported the allegation there after she read reports that Santos had been arrested for rape following the Chichester incident. She said: 'She felt guilty she hadn’t reported it before and came forward.' Miss Ascherson said all of the girls involved in the two incidents had consumed 'considerable' amounts of alcohol on the nights concerned. She said Santos denied there was any sexual contact with the victim in Yeovil and said the girl in the Chichester incident initiated the sexual activity with him and Ritchie. She added that Ritchie told police that the 16-year-old had consensually performed oral sex on him. Santos, who is charged under his real name Yuri Santos, of Tooting, south west London, denies two counts of rape. Ritchie, of Lambeth, south east London, denies one count of oral rape. Santos’s debut single, Candy, featuring former Pussycat Dolls singer Kimberly Wyatt, shot to number five in the UK charts in 2010. But he became more popularly known by his appearance in the 2010 series of ITV’s reality game show I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in which he reached the final six.

"Billionaire: John McAfee arrested in Belize . The millionaire British founder of security firm McAfee has been forcefully arrested in Belize following a drugs and weapons bust at his property. John McAfee had his house in Orange Walk, Belize City, surrounded by armed guards on Monday. McAfee says they stormed his house, killed his dog and handcuffed him in the sun for 14 hours without food or water. The 67-year-old, who founded the popular McAfee antivirus computer software, moved from America to Belize in 2008 after a series of lawsuits that threatened to wipe out his fortune. The eccentric entrepreneur now runs an antibiotic drug company from the tiny central American country. He said he was arrested because he refused to donate money to a local politician. McAfee told Belize's News 5: . 'On Monday at six o’clock, I was awakened by the sound of a bullhorn, a . megaphone. I went outside and saw about thirty GSU in full uniform, . fully dressed, automatic weapons, storming through the property and . driveway. 'I went back inside, got some clothes on, I came out. I was told to put up my hands up against the wall as were eleven other people in the compound. 'It began, innocently enough, with my refusal to donate to the local political boss of the district where I lived in Orange Walk and I have given at least two million dollars in gifts to the police departments in Orange Walk, San Pedro, Belize City.' Belize: McAfee founder moved to the tropical central American country in 2008 . Belize's Gang Services Unit (GSU) said . they found a cache of weapons on McAfee's property and that he did not . have a licence to manufacture drugs. The GSU issued a statement which said: 'Present on the premises at the time were John McAfee, his girlfriend who is a 17-year-old Belizean minor and five security guards. 'During the search ten firearms - seven 12-gauge pump action shotguns, one 12-gauge single action shotgun, one Taurus nine-millimetre pistol and one nine-millimetre CZ pistol were found.' Five air rifles and 270 12-gauge cartridges were also found. McAfee was born in England and moved to America at an early age. He founded his software company in 1989 from his home in Santa Clara, California. It has since become one of the largest software companies in the world and was bought by electronics maker Intel for £5billion in 2010, although the founder no longer had any share in it. He lost much of his money in the financial crash, and his wealth reportedly declined from $100million (£62million) to less than $4million. McAfee was not given any charge and says he is seeking legal advice.","John McAfee says arrest was for refusing to donate to politician .

"These are the forgotten relics of a Christmas dream, all in dire need of Santa's help - they were created in his honour after all. Once bustling beacons of festive cheer, these 'Santa lands' now lie derelict after the elves went home and the laughter stopped. Now mould creeps up the grotto's walls and Santa's sleigh lies empty, fused to the earth by rust and moss. From Arizona to Brazil, they went out of business after failing to attract enough visitors all the year round, in a painful lesson to their once-merry owners on why it can't be Christmas every day. Goodbye Christmas: Santa appears to cry tears of mould on this swing in Park Albanoel in Brazil . Gone-under land: This is an eerie reminder of how even Christmas has its hard times . Overgrown: Park Albanoel was reportedly conceived in 2000 and was intended to be the largest tourist entertainment attractions in Brazil - the size of 460 football fields . Reindeer oh dear: But the park shut down after its owner, Albano Reis, who had previously run for mayor of Rio de Janeiro, was struck and killed on the highway near the complex in 2004 . Big plans: Also in the works were other projects including a Ruins Water Park, a western city, a rustic little farm, a ship-hotel, a concert hall and a ten-story tower . Down the pan: The water slide at Park Albanoel has dried up and is caked in dirt in the park which is surrounded by picturesque mountains . The once busy theme parks are now deserted, their happy Christmas jingles . replaced by whistling winds and rustling leaves. They include the 460-acre Park Albanoel in Brazil, which shut down after its owner was killed in a car accident in 2004, and the town of Santa Claus in Arizona built in 1937 as an attempt to attract buyers to the desert spot. North Hole: Nina Talbot founded the town of Santa Claus in Arizona, in 1937 as an attempt to attract buyers to the desert location. It featured several Christmas-themed buildings and visiting children could meet Santa Claus at any day of the year . Vandalised: But the town is now empty and its rides are covered in graffiti . All aboard: Santa Claus did become a popular tourist destination but no one ever bought land there, and the only people living there were the ones working in the town . This is it! The last gift shops and amusements at Santa Claus went out of business in 1995, leaving a few vandalized buildings, a wishing well, and the 'Old 1225,' a derailed, pink children's train covered with graffiti . Retreat! Now the elves have laft Santa Claus, mold creeps up the grotto's walls and Santa's sleigh lies empty, fused to the earth by rust and moss . No toys: This was once a toy shop in the centre of Santa Claus that was once filled with laughing children . Famous: One of the places in town that was genuinely successful was its local restaurant, the Santa Claus Inn . Desolate: In the early 1990s, the restaurant offered Dasher and Dancer omelette and Santa Claus burgers and oil portraits of John Wayne could be purchased from the shops . Big attraction: Santa's Village was a winter-themed amusement park in the Skyforest section of Lake Arrowhead, California, opened in 1955 . Popular: Santa's Village in East Dundee, Illinois is silent and overgrown. During its heyday, between 1959 and 2006, more than 20 million people passed through the front gates .

"A row has broken out in Germany over a church painting which appears to show Nazi leader Adolf Hitler standing next to Jesus. Recent cleaning of the painting - first unveiled when the Christus Church in the northern Bavarian city of Hof was consecrated in 1939 - shows the uncanncy likeness to the former Fuehrer. There is the toothbrush moustache, the hair parted on one side and the staring, maniacal eyes which made him a dark Messiah to so many Germans. Scroll down for video . The painting, which was discovered at the Christus Church in Hof, northern Bavaria, which appears to show Hitler standing next to Jesus . Evangelical pastor Martin Goelkel, who recently left after eight years at the church some call the 'Nazi Temple,' believes the likeness is just co-incidental but its discovery so long after it was painted is causing a stir among his flock. 'Some people have called this a Nazi place over the years but I don't think this is true,' he said. 'It was designed and inaugurated in a severe time for Germany, no question, but if I interpret the pictures correctly they are now about the glorification of the powerful during this time. 'On the contrary; the individual is made aware that his life belongs to Christ no matter how powerful he feels personally - there is another power over him, a stronger power. 'This is no Hitler homage, in my eyes. We find people asking something of Christ, there is someone kneeling before him. God resists the proud, but the humble he gives his grace to. 'Hitler, however, stands imperiously at the side, alone, wearing boots, his robe somehow militaristic. Haughty and arrogant. 'He looks like a rabbit before slaughter. He is a man on the edge, an outsider.' Former pastor of the church Martin Goelkel, has defended the painting and said that it is in no way an homage to the Nazi leader, pictured . Asked if he ever had a problem preaching in the vicinity of such a portrait he replied: 'Not at all. Jesus is the winner. This is the message!' He claims that in all the years that the church has been open for worship no-one has objected to the Hitler painting near the altar. But now there are rumblings of discontent with some parishioners calling for him to be erased. 'It is not right under any circumstances that the biggest mass killer in history should be featured in a painting in a house of Christian worship,' one of the flock said in a recent interview on Radio Bavaria. Pastor Goelkel added that he thought the painting should not be removed. 'This image is a central challenge to Nazism: Christ is in the middle. The powerful can stand idle as much as they want,' he said.","The painting was found in the Christus Church in Hof, northern Bavaria .

"Pirelli may yet change its thinking over the tyre choice for the forthcoming Brazilian Grand Prix, but not as a consequence of Felipe Massa's 'dangerous' comments. Pirelli, the tyre manufacturer, recently announced they would be running the hard and medium compounds for the November 9 race on Massa's home turf at Interlagos. Massa, however, slated the plan as 'dangerous, very dangerous', and 'totally unacceptable' given the track has been re-surfaced with a new layer of asphalt this year. Paul Hembery, Pirelli motorsport director, gets a talking to from Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone . The Brazilian Grand Prix on November 9 is hosted at the Interlagos circuit, which has been resurfaced . Massa added: 'Normally whatever track I go to where they put down new asphalt, it gets even easier on the tyres. I have no idea why they choose these tyres.' Massa's remarks cut little ice with Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery as he told Press Association Sport: 'That's a little bit strange as we've raced before there with the hard tyre. 'The data would suggest, as it has done for the last three years, it's one of the more aggressive circuits we have on the calendar, with a risk of blistering problems. 'We know the soft tyre, with the extreme loads, has potential to blister, so the decision was taken to go with the harder tyre.' Felipe Massa described Pirelli's first choice of tyres for his home Grand Prix as 'very dangerous' Hembery, though, at least recognised the fact the resurfacing works may have a bearing and is willing to alter the compounds if the data dictates. Hembery added: 'There is one factor, which we need to do a double verification on, which is the surface as they've now completed a full resurfacing. 'We'll do another check with that. We have a meeting with the Tyre Working Group, where we have all the tyre experts from all the teams, and we'll discuss it with them. 'If there is unanimous agreement then we can reconsider, so we are open to change. 'But it needs to done on fact, data and details than from a random comment.'","Paul Hembery, Pirelli motorsport director, claims tyre choice not finalised .

"Detectives have yet to release his name to the media . Victim was a man between the age of 40 and 60 years old . Police say they have finally identified the victim, whose severed head was found by two dogwalkers earlier this week  in the hills by the famed Hollywood sign. However, they have decided not to release his name and have yet to give a reason for that decision. The grisly discovery was made in the land close to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's Hollywood Hills mansion, and because the area is often used for filming, the couple who found the head first thought it was a film prop. The area was a location for the original 'Batcave' in the 1960s Batman series starring Adam West. 'Our assumption was that there was always people filming up there, and it was a prop,' said Lauren Kornberg. 'We walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head.' The head was found 2:30pm on Tuesday in Canyon Drive, when Mrs Kornberg and a friend were walking nine dogs and saw two of the animals playing with an object in a bag. Two women hike in Griffith Park on Wednesday near the Hollywood sign after a plastic bag containing a human head was discovered the previous day by two women walking their dogs on a nearby trail off Canyon Drive in Los Angeles . The Batmobile leaving the Batcave. The area where the head was found is where filming took place for the 1960s Batman series starring Adam West . Neighbourhood: The head and hands were found just blocks from Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's home (pictured) Investigators do not believe it had been there long calling the head 'fresh'. Then late on Wednesday night, two hand and two feet were discovered near the city's iconic Hollywood sign. There are reports today that detectives are questioning a person of interest in connection with the discovery. Investigators raided a Los Angeles apartment building last night near to where the human remains were found, KFI-AM reported. Yesterday Arizona police launched a . joint investigation with the LAPD to determine whether body parts found . near the Hollywood sign are connected to a dismembered body discovered . 500 miles away. The torso was found on the side . of a dirt road west of the Tucson Mountains on January 6, according to . the Pima County sheriff's office. The department asked Los Angeles to 'expedite a . DNA comparison as soon as possible.' According the the Arizona Daily Star, the dismembered body is that of a male, found by two men cutting grass to feed their animals. Pima County . sheriff's Bureau Chief Rick Kastigar told the newspaper the man's head, hands and feet were missing. Murders: Police launched an investigation into whether the two killings were linked . However police now believe that the two events may not be connected. The events have unfolded like a gory movie script, and police are now . trying to identity the man. Today more than 100 police . officers, some on horseback, were searching a Hollywood wilderness park . along a winding hiking trail to see if they can find yet more body . parts. Authorities said the . head came from a man believed to be 40 to 60 years old. Police think . all the body parts are from the same man but are trying to confirm that. A couple walking nine dogs found the . severed human head inside a plastic bag on Tuesday afternoon after two . of the dogs began toying with an object. 'One of the dogs ran into the brush and . came out carrying a plastic grocery bag. As the dogs shook the plastic . grocery bag the severed human head fell out of the bag and onto the . ground,' Cmdr. Andrew Smith told KCBS-TV. The first hand was . found as dozens of officers and homicide investigators combed the brush, . and a coroner's cadaver dog came upon it about 50 yards from where the . head was discovered on Tuesday afternoon, the Los Angeles Times . reported.The second hand and both feet were found nearby later Wednesday afternoon. No details were immediately available on the condition of the body parts. The man might have been killed elsewhere in recent days and his body dumped in the park, Cmdr Smith said. Los Angeles Police Commander Andrew Smith, left, talks to Los Angeles Coroner Detective Rene Grand Pre in Griffith Park on Canyon Drive near where the human head was found . LAPD mounted police officers search a hilly area below the Hollywood sign. Following the discovery of the head, two hands and then two feet were found . Wild animals in the park may have other body parts, he said. Police were looking at reports of missing persons, and coroner's investigators were to check dental records to try and determine his identity. Smith noted that the area is well traveled by both cars and hikers. A paved road winds around picnic areas and a children's playground before connecting with a trail that eventually winds up near the Hollywood sign. The Hollywood sign on Mount Lee above Los Angeles originally read 'Hollywoodland' and was created to promote a housing development in 1923. The last few letters deteriorated in the late 1940s and the part that remained was restored in 1978.","Detectives have yet to release his name to the media .

"A golf course could be forced to close after offering a promotion for nine holes for $9.11 on the 12th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Tumbledown Trails Golf Course in Verona, Wisconsin posted an ad in the Wisconsin State Journal on Monday offering '9 holes with cart for only $9.11 per person or 18 holes with cart for only $19.11!' But the company was immediately lambasted online as distasteful and was forced to apologize on its Facebook page. It said it is now considering closing on September 11, as staff fear a backlash. 'Please stay tuned to see if we will be . open on Weds 9/11,' the posting read. 'We . are now worried about what people will do/say to our staff & do not . want anything to happen or get out of control. Sorry for the . inconvenience this may have caused anyone.' Club owner and general manager Marc Watts told The Associated Press that no disrespect was intended with the advert. Watts said people are even calling the club with death threats, adding that a sheriff's deputy has now been stationed there. The course officials said that booked tee times for Wednesday will be honored and that other golfers will pay the normal rate. The difference between the rates will be donated to the 9/11 Memorial. 'We hope that everyone will now see this as a positive as we really meant it to be,' the Facebook post read. 'Again, we do sincerely apologize for offending anyone & hope that you do accept our sincere apology.' Damage control: Owners of the Tumbledown Trails Golf Course, pictured, has now apologized . Some commenters accepted the apology while others weren't so happy. '9/11 is a painful, frightening memory for those of us who were living and growing up in the Northeast,' one commenter wrote. 'For those who were there and who lost parents, relatives and friends, it is a nightmare they must face at this time every year for the rest of their lives. To exploit these horrors for profit is sickening.' But another commenter, who identified himself as a military veteran, added: 'If I lived within a couple hours drive of this course I would head on up tomorrow to play a round of golf. Why? Because I believe in my heart of hearts that they meant NO ill will in this ad. Anger: Hundreds of people flocked to the course's Facebook page and complained about the promotion . 'The intent of these owners was not to profit off a tragedy. Their intention was to give a break to the average Joe on a day when those that would have us wallowing in misery at the memory of what pure evil accomplished.' Others pointed out that the company clearly did not wish to profit as they would be making a great loss on their usual prices with the deal. Nine holes usually costs $18 at the course, while 18 holes with a cart usually costs $43. Nearly 3,000 people died in the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and in a hijacked flight that crashed in Shanksville, Pa.","The Tumbledown Trails Folf course in Verona, Wisconsin is now considering closing on September 11 because staff fear a backlash ."
"With a detailed birth plan and her mother on hand to help out, actress Vivian Gray thought she had written the perfect script for the arrival of her second child. But her baby son had other ideas. Sky was so keen to make his debut that he had to be delivered on the pavement outside the hospital...in a street fittingly called Hollywood Road and with his grandmother’s Burberry coat hurriedly laid out for him on the ground. Miss Gray with her mother, who laid out her Burberry coat, and medical staff who helped her give birth on the street . Miss Gray, 31, began having . contractions  in the early hours, a week before her due date. When her . waters broke, she presumed she had plenty of time to walk to the local . maternity unit. She set off for Chelsea and Westminster Hospital with her husband Adrian Jayasinha, 38, an investment banker, and her mother Alicia Gray, a plastic surgeon, who was staying at their home. But just 30 yards from the hospital doors, Miss Gray could walk no further and realised her baby had decided he wasn’t waiting any longer. Yesterday the Scottish-born actress, who is well-known in the US for playing villain Suzy Edwards in television drama Desire, said: ‘I started having mild contractions in the middle of the night. I was fairly confident I had some time, so I thought, “Relax, stay in bed a bit longer”. ‘After a couple of hours they started getting more frequent and a bit stronger, and I thought I’d time them on my iPhone to see if perhaps I was going into labour. ‘The problem was that I couldn’t quite focus on the timer. That’s when I realised the contractions were already very strong. So I woke up my husband, and unexpectedly my waters broke. I stood there stunned. Then I thought I should put some make-up on so I would look good in the pictures when the baby was born – I was clearly a bit delirious.’ Medical staff from the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital came out to assist Miss Gray, who was eventually taken into the building on a stretcher . Miss Gray left home just after 5am, thinking it would be quicker to walk than get a taxi as the hospital was so close. But the contractions quickly became more powerful. ‘It was as if my body was doing all the work and I had no power over this pushing sensation,’ she said. ‘Adrian was immobilised, he just froze. Thankfully, my mother was like Sir Walter Raleigh throwing his cloak over a puddle for the Queen, and took off her Burberry coat for me to crouch on, then ran to the hospital for help. ‘The porter must have thought she was some kind of crazy lady because she was a bit frantic. Miss Gray and baby Sky were allowed out of hospital to go home 12 hours later to join her husband Adrian and older son Liam . ‘But the hospital was extremely efficient. Within three minutes, two midwives, two assistant midwives and two paramedics were with me with all the equipment and held sheets round me to screen me from view while they delivered the baby.’ Sky was born a healthy 7lb 9oz at 5.51am on June 12, just half an hour after Miss Gray’s waters broke. She had spent eight hours in labour with her first child Liam, now two, so Sky’s speedy delivery came as something of a shock. After the birth, she spent 12 hours in hospital before taking her newborn son home the same day.","Vivian Gray thought she had time to walk to hospital to give birth .

"A family who bought a 'common' tortoise from a local D.I.Y shop were shocked to discover that it was actually a rare giant breed - which has grown to an incredible nine stone. The creature was bought fourteen years ago by a couple from Liverpool, who were told that it was an ordinary tortoise. But the new owners were unaware that they had bought a special sulcata tortoise - which is the third largest species in the world - and has kept growing and growing. Giant tortoise: Victor is now living at Swindon Reptile Rescue sanctuary after outgrowing his former home . Huge: Andy Browne from Swindon Reptile rescue holds Victor the nine-stone giant tortoise who is expected to grow even more and could double in size . The animal, which currently weighs nine stone is still getting bigger and could end up weighing 200 pounds (14 stone). The tortoise which has been nicknamed Victor Meldrew - after the curmudgeonly TV character from BBC show 'One Foot in the Grave' - became too large for the family home and they could no longer cope. The frantic couple were then forced to ring around zoos and rescue centres to try and find a suitable home for the giant reptile. But no one came forward. However, Andy Browne, a farmer, offered to step in to rescue Victor and brought him home to his reserve in Highworth, Wiltshire. Kind: Andy Browne, a farmer is pictured with Victor, he says that he rescues around 10 reptiles a week . He collected the tortoise for free from the family in Liverpool and added it to his collection of unusual pets - which includes 400 other reptiles. Andy runs Swindon Reptile Rescue, an animal rescue centre which he set up in 2001, but he also works a 17-hour day on his farm. Andy, 47, said: 'They got Victor from a D.I.Y shop when he was a baby and they sold him as a common tortoise so they wouldn’t have known that he would keep growing for as long as he will. 'They’d tried a lot of zoos and wildlife sanctuaries but nobody would take him in so they were relieved that I could help out. 'They were pretty distraught to give him away as Victor was a much-loved pet but they’ve been keeping in regular contact since I picked him up around two weeks ago. 'I’ve never seen one like him before and he’ll need specialist care so I imagine he’ll end up staying with me for the foreseeable future unless the right person comes forward. 'Victor seems pretty happy bulldozing my garden at the minute and thankfully even though his diet is a bit different to regular tortoises he eats dry grass and hay which I have good access to working on a farm.' The African spurred tortoise (Geochelone sulcata), also called the sulcata tortoise, is a species of tortoise which inhabits the southern edge of the Sahara desert, in northern Africa. The rare creature is expected to live until he is 150 and is and likely to continue to grow for another 35 years. However, as hatchlings, they are barely three inches in length. Sulcata tortoise can be found in countries across the continent including Ethiopia, Sudan, Nigeria, Mali, and Mauritania among many others. It is the third-largest species of tortoise in the world and the largest species of mainland tortoise not found on an island. Their natural habitats are grasslands, . savannahs and shrublands. They are known to burrow into the ground of . these dry lands so that they may find moist areas and escape high . temperatures. Sulcata tortoises are herbivores. Its diet consists of many types of grasses and plants, high in fibre and very low in protein. The consumption of too much protein can cause their shells to take on a pyramidal appearance. Fruit should be avoided. The attractive tortoise have a reputation for having a pleasant temperament, and are often brought home as pets. But these animals provide significant challenges because they have a specific diet, temperature requirements, and an unusual size. He explained that the Liverpudlian family were 'absolutely distraught' to give up their prized pet. He added: 'The family that had to give him up are absolutely gutted but it was just one of those things. 'They had bought it as a wedding anniversary present for themselves and were sold it on the basis it was a normal-sized garden tortoise. 'They were really, really, distraught because they had had him for almost 15 years. 'Their garden was quite small and they were really concerned they weren't going to be able to look after him properly. 'He measures two foot from head to tail and is about 18 inches side to side. He's about 18 inches tall too. He's only going to get bigger.' Andy said that Victor spends most of his time under a heating lamp in a specially built shed in his garden and had a 'personality of his own'. 'He will answer to his name and comes to see you if you call him,' he said. 'He has a personality of his own, and will bulldoze everything in his way, including you if you're there.' Victor, a sulcata tortoise, is expected to live until he is 150 is and likely to continue to grow for another 35 years. Andy has over 35 years of experience rescuing exotic creatures. He looks after tortoises, snakes and lizards at his farm and rescues around 10 reptiles a week. He looks after 407 reptiles at his house in Wiltshire and has around 20 volunteers who help him out. In his spare time, the farmer works with reptile charities, zoos and specialist shops to take care of all his residents and also visits schools with some of them and runs demonstrations. He said: 'I really fell into doing this but I have such a passion for it. On average, I rescue about 10 reptiles a week and unfortunately only about two of those get rehomed. 'That’s because of a lack of people coming forward and also because I have a harsh vetting process as I don’t want to rehome them and end up taking them back in a few months down the line.' Andy runs a nationwide free pick-up service and said the furthest he has ever gone to collect a reptile is Wick, in Scotland. 'That was a 15 hour drive there and a 15 hour drive back but I’d rather do that than see them left with owners who can’t look after them,' he said. 'I end up paying around £700 just in taking care of them each month, which is a financial stretch but I love doing this.'

"2014 has seen another 12 months of tantalising sporting action. From events such as the World Cup to the Commonwealth Games and Ryder Cup - there has been a plethora of moments that have captivated us all. Sportsmail have captured these historic moments step-by-step through our own brilliant photography team. Below, Sportsmail's Andy Hooper picks out his favourite taken images from 2014. VIDEO Scroll down to see the making of Sportsmail's Andy Hooper's iconic Commonwealth Games image . Sportsmail's Andy Hooper photographed some of England's stars ahead of this summer's Commonwealth Games held in Glasgow . The favourite of my images this year has to be Hadrian’s Wall, not because it’s my best image but because it’s creative, took a lot of planning, was technical to shoot and retouch. This image was used as a preview to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games in the summer. It’s supposed to be a bit of fun with participating athletes dressed up in St George’s Cross kilts and kit! I wanted the English team to look warrior-like and invading the Games by leaping over Hadrian’s Wall. Including preparation, planning and shooting this image took three months. Athletes are spread all over the country and were involved in heavy training in the lead up to the Games so I could only photograph them individually at their respective training camps. As these were all elite athletes it was impossible to get them to Hadrian’s Wall, they only get one day off a week and the last thing they want to be doing is spend it travelling to Scotland. The Invictus Games took place in September celebrating the sporting achievements of men and women who have been injured in battle . This summer's World Cup was held in Brazil, a local lad showcases his Samba skills on a beach ahead of England's match against Italy . Despite a poor World Cup, Wayne Rooney has since reached 100 England caps - here he visits his old primary school Our Lady of St Swithins, in Liverpool ahead of his century of appearances for the Three Lions . Rooney celebrates with the England fans after scoring their third goal in a 3-1 win at Scotland in a November friendly at Celtic Park . This meant that the finished picture would have to be photoshopped together. I wanted it to be as real as possible so on the drive up to Edinburgh in the spring for the Scotland v England rugby game, I stopped off at Hadrian’s Wall to shoot the background. I wanted a panoramic images of the wall so the finished background is made up of 6 individual images. All shot at dawn on a beautifully sunny morning the foreboding grey sky was added in later! The individual athletes (which included Louis Smith, Adam Gemili and Max Whitlock) were shot in hotel rooms, corridors, car park and gyms in locations from London to Leeds. All the athletes did a great job at visualising where they were in the image even though standing in a car park or bouncing on a trampoline. The real genius behind the picture is Anthony McDonald, the creative retoucher, who was able to bring all the elements together and polish them into a consistent group image. The finished image created a talking point on the first day of the Games which was exactly what we wanted!

"Malorie Blackman believes that if children would rather read Twilight over Middlemarch, then they should be encouraged . Children are falling out of love with reading because schools are forcing them to read the classics, the new Children’s Laureate has said. Malorie Blackman, who was appointed to the role last month, said it was ‘dangerous’ for schools to draw up reading lists and that children should be encouraged to seek out books they like. Her remarks set her on a collision course with Education Secretary Michael Gove, who last month lamented that teenagers were more likely to read the Twilight vampire books by Stephenie Meyer than George Eliot’s Middlemarch. He said: ‘There is a great tradition of English literature, a canon of transcendent works, and [Twilight novel] Breaking Dawn is not part of it.’ But Mrs Blackman, 51, author of the Noughts & Crosses novels, said: ‘Children find prescriptive reading lists daunting and they are a dangerous thing to have in schools. 'If a child wants to read Twilight over Middlemarch they should be encouraged – the important thing is to get them reading in the first place.’ Speaking from the London Evening Standard’s Get Reading festival in Central London – whose star guests Hugh Grant, Rupert Everett, and Lily Cole all read from their favourite books –she added that she would like teachers to read to pupils for at least ten minutes a day. ‘When I was a child, we used to look forward to the end of the day when we would hear another ten minutes of a story.’ Blackman made her statement at the London .

"Alec Baldwin is again the target a criticism from gay rights groups after he was caught on camera calling a photographer a 'c***sucker' - and possibly worse. TMZ.com claims Baldwin called a photographer a 'c***sucking f**' as he was leaving his New York City apartment Thursday following the sentencing of his stalker, Genevieve Sabourin. The '30 Rock' star claims he never used the word 'f**' - and pleaded ignorance when he was publicly taken to task for using the term 'c***sucker.' Scroll down for video . Angry: Alec Baldwin chased after a photographer after he got too close to his wife Hilaria and newborn daughter Thursday afternoon . Called out: GLAAD publicly chastised Baldwin shortly after the incident for his homophobic language - the second time the group has intervened with him this year . Pleading ignorance: Baldwin offered up an apology in the days after the altercation and this excuse after GLAAD criticized his use of language- which he Tweeted but deleted shortly after . Shortly after Baldwin's homophobic tirade was published, gay rights group GLAAD public chastised the 55-year-old actor. 'Mr. Baldwin can’t lend his support for equality on paper, while degrading gay people in practice,' the group tweeted. 'It's clearly time Mr. Baldwin listens to the calls from so many LGBT people and allies to end this pattern of anti-gay slurs.' At first Baldwin tweeted: 'If c'sucker offends, then I apologize. Anti-gay? Never.' He later delete that message and offered up a mea culpa - of sorts. '1-Rich Ferraro from @glaad informs me that c'sucker is an anti-gay epithet. In which case I apologize and will retire it from my vocabulary,' he tweeted. '2- you learn something new every day.'

Apology: Baldwin did say he was sorry for using the term 'c***sucker' - but claimed he was being smeared by TMZ and conservatives . Baldwin - who was recently tapped to host his own show on MSNBC - has become known as a champion of liberal causes, but this is not the first time he has been accused of using homophobic epithets. New York magazine . details four incidents in which he used homophobic slurs. In 1997, he allegedly called a horse carriage driver a 'f*****' for supporting carriage rides outside Central Park. In 2011, he was accused of calling a Starbucks barista and 'uptight queen.' In 2012, he called the New York Daily News editor an 'English queen.' Finally, in June, he tweeted out a homophobic rant directed at a MailOnline reporter, calling him a 'toxic queen' and said he would 'stick his foot in the reporter's a**,' except that the reporter would 'dig it too much.' For that remark, GLAAD chastised Baldwin - but let him off when he wrote the group a formal apology and promised to mend his ways. He also vowed to stay off Twitter. That didn't seem to stick, either. Conferring: Genevieve Sabourin is asked by her attorney Todd Spodek whether she would like to make a statement to the court before she was found guilty on all counts of harassing and stalking Alec Baldwin today . Disdain: Genevieve Sabourin refused to say more than two sentences to the court before the judge informed her that she was to spend the next seven months in prison for stalking Alec Baldwin and his family . Baldwin fired off a series of Tweets after TMZ published its accusations. He denied that he used to word 'f**,' as TMZ had insinuated. 'Acoustic analysis proves the word is . fathead. Fathead,' he wrote. 'Anti-gay slurs are wrong. They not only . offend, but threaten hard fought tolerance of LGBT rights.' He also said TMZ was trying to 'bury' him and he threatened to sue. He also said conservatives were using the incident to criticize him. Those tweets have all since been deleted. Baldwin becomes irate when a photographer gets too close to his wife Hilaria and newborn daughter. 'Get away from my wife and baby with that camera,' he snaps. A woman, likely Hilaria, can be heard calling to him to back off as he chases the photographer down the block.

"Many of Britain’s top code-breakers and analysts are able to crack complex problems because they suffer from dyslexia, GCHQ has revealed. A spokesman for the Government’s top-secret electronic eavesdropping station in Cheltenham said last night that some of their most talented code-breakers have difficulty in learning to read or interpreting words. But this can actually help them crack codes, as they ‘see’ things those without the disorder do not. Cracking: GCHQ, whose headquarters are pictured, revealed that many of their codebreakers can crack problems because they are dyslexic . GCHQ’s army of code-breakers and code-setters play a critical role in the battle to protect Britain from cyber attacks by other states and  criminals, including terrorists. GCHQ recently found itself at the centre of allegations by US whistleblower Edward Snowden that it had access to the online data of British citizens via US spy agencies. Last week MPs on the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee praised steps taken by spy chiefs to harness the skills of dyslexic code-breakers. The threat to the UK from cyber attacks, according to the report, is at its ‘highest level ever’ and is ‘disturbing’ in its scale  and complexity. Sufferer: Some of the world's greatest thinkers, including Albert Einstein, pictured, had dyslexia . The MPs said the Cheltenham-based agency had set up a Dyslexia and Dyspraxia Support Group, which provides ‘mentoring and practical support to individuals’. A GCHQ spokesman said some of their most talented code-breakers were affected: ‘They are very creative but may need support, including adjustments in the workplace, such as IT tools and computer software, or [reductions] in their working hours.’ In a speech last year, Sir Iain Lobban, the director of GCHQ, said: ‘Part of my job is to attract the very best people and harness their talents, and not allow preconceptions and stereotypes to stifle innovation and agility.’ Adrian Culley, a cyber expert and former Scotland Yard computer crime detective, said: ‘Dyslexic people have the ability of seeing codes with patterns, repetitions and omissions. 'Dyslexia may in other circumstances be regarded as negative – but most people only get to see the full jigsaw picture when it’s nearly finished while dyslexic cryptographists can see what the jigsaw puzzle looks like with just two pieces.’ Some of the world’s greatest thinkers suffered from dyslexia, including Albert Einstein.","GCHQ bosses say those with the disorder see things in codes others do not .

"England crashed out of the World Cup on Friday, but manager Roy  Hodgson has remarkably been assured that his job is safe until the 2016 European Championship. Despite Costa Rica’s 1-0 win over Italy sealing England’s embarrassingly early exit in Brazil, FA chairman Greg Dyke insisted that Hodgson is the right man to lead the country. When asked if Hodgson — whose earnings of £3.5million a year make him the second highest-paid manager at the World Cup — would remain in his job until the end of his contract in 2016, Dyke said: ‘That is the view of myself, of everybody else here in Brazil and of others in the FA. VIDEO Scroll down for Dyke making a throat-slitting gesture after hearing World Cup draw . Staying: Roy Hodgson will remain in charge of England until 2016 . Time to learn: Pele thinks Roy Hodgson can 'review what went wrong and come back stronger' ‘We’re supportive of Roy Hodgson, we’ve asked him to stay as manager. Roy has done a good job and it was always an approach for four years and we hope to do better in the European Championship. We do not see any value in changing.’ England have lost 2-1 to both Italy and  Uruguay in Brazil, failing to qualify from the group stage for the first time since Sweden in 1958, but Dyke said: ‘Everybody thought we played really well in the first game against Italy and narrowly lost. In the second game it could have gone either way. We were not humiliated. They were narrow defeats, but it is for the football people, not for me, to identify why we did not win.’ Dyke has targeted victory at the 2022 World Cup. When asked if that target was attainable, he said: ‘Yes, but it means lots of changes in English football. There is a real chance that we can develop and win in 2022. That is the aim.’ Hodgson himself admitted he and the team had let the nation down. He said: ‘We’ve failed. We had really big hopes we were going to make the nation proud by going far in the tournament and we haven’t done that. So any words are pretty empty at the moment. Dejected: England were knocked out of the World Cup in dismal fashion in a tough Group D . ‘I’m very low. So are the players. We had high hopes, we thought we could make an impact. But unfortunately we haven’t won the games.’ It is the first time England — who bow out of the tournament against surprise Group D leaders Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday — have lost their first two games at a World Cup finals. But Hodgson added: ‘I believe the team going forward will be a very good team. I think there are good young players. Even against Uruguay we saw some good individual performances and the young ones that came on did quite well. ‘But results colour everything. We played a very tough-tackling and strong defensive Uruguayan team. I don’t think there’s any need to have any doubts this group of players will go on to do good things in the time ahead. ‘I think the team are evolving.  I’m proud of the way they’ve approached this tournament and everything they put into it. At the moment I’m just devastated they got nothing out of it.’ Goalkeeper Joe Hart claimed Hodgson has the backing of the England dressing room. He said: ‘We are proud to play for Roy Hodgson. He’s a great manager, he’s a very passionate man and someone that I’ve got an awful lot of respect for and I hope to continue playing for.’ Asked if he thought the team had progressed in two years since Hodgson took control from Fabio Capello, Hart replied: ‘Saying yes sounds like a stupid thing to say, but I do. ‘We’ve got bags of quality, bags of people coming through, great leaders and great experienced players and we’ve just come up short in two games. I’d imagine some people will say we’re simply not good enough but we don’t feel that inside the camp. ‘It’s hard to take but we’re at a World Cup and if you don’t get results then this happens. We’ve committed our lives to this tournament and we’ll continue to do that until the end of the group stage, whatever happens.’ Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA director of football development who is retiring after the tournament, believes England can win the World Cup in Russia in 2018 or the European Championship two years later. ‘It will be an exciting time in the next four to six years in English football,’ said Brooking. ‘I think 2018, 2020 is the time when quite a few of our younger players will have lots of good experience. ‘Roy has done really well to include some of those in this tournament. Just the fact he  has had five or six weeks to  work with them will augur  well going forward. ‘There is a really good young nucleus in the squad.’","Hodgson's contract runs until the end of the European Championships in France .

Mark Serwotka, of the Public and Commercial Services union, said: ‘At a time of record public sector job cuts, civil servants who are suffering a pay freeze and facing a raid on their pensions will be angered by what appears to amount to a job-creation scheme for the Civil Service elite. ‘While Gus O’Donnell heads for the House of Lords, pocketing a pension worth around 30 times more than the average for his staff, the future looks decidedly more bleak for the ranks of public servants who provide essential services day in, day out.’ John Spellar, a former Labour minister, said: ‘It looks like one law for those at the top and another for those at the bottom.’ Sir Gus’s £2.3million pension pot after 36 years of service is the equivalent to an annual payment of £105,000 and a lump sum of £315,000. Advice: Sir Gus with Samantha and David Cameron, his fourth prime minister . David Cameron announced Jeremy Heywood, currently permanent secretary at Number 10, will become Cabinet Secretary and provide advice to him and Nick Clegg. Another mandarin will be made head of the Civil Service, responsible for providing professional and corporate leadership to civil servants. New role: Jeremy Heywood will replace Gus O'Donnell, combining his job with his role as Permanent Secretary at No 10 . And there will be a separate permanent secretary in charge of the Cabinet Office, responsible for ‘joined-up government’ and cutting costs. There has long been disquiet among the Tories that the Cabinet Secretary – nicknamed GOD from his initials – held too much sway. They fear Whitehall technocrats have become more powerful than elected ministers. Backbencher Douglas Carswell said yesterday on his blog: ‘It is these permanent officials that really decide most public policy. All too often, elected ministers end up as mere mouthpieces for the machine. ‘It is precisely because we have such a smug, insulated technocracy in charge that voters are left complaining that no matter who they vote for, things rarely seem to change.’ Asked why the job of Cabinet Secretary was being split, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘He is head of a department that has around 2,000 people. ‘You are head of the Civil Service and all the permanent secretaries report to you, and you are secretary to the Cabinet and principal adviser to the Prime Minister. It is a very big job.’ If Sir Gus wants to move to the private sector, he will have to submit his bid to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. It allows former civil servants to take up such positions within as little as three months.",Jeremy Heywood will replace Cabinet Secretary .
"She has described her comeback single as a satirical swipe at sexism in pop music. But Lily Allen yesterday found herself accused of being a racist after using scantily clad black women in the music video for the track. The single, Hard Out Here, will be released on Sunday but the video was put out this week and within hours led hundreds of fans to question the singer’s decision to use the troupe of dancers.

The video sees Miss Allen, 28, fully clothed, singing about how she does not need to exploit herself in order to be a successful musician . The video sees Miss Allen, 28, fully clothed, singing about how she does not need to exploit herself in order to be a successful musician. She has said that this is her response to recent music videos, such as those by Miley Cyrus, which can be seen to portray women as sexual objects. As Miss Allen sings, the troupe of dancers perform. The majority are black and they are seen twerking, a lewd and particularly provocative hip thrusting dance. Controversially, the black women are barely covered but the two white women in the video are wearing gold jackets over their skimpy outfits to protect their modesty. One fan wrote on Twitter: ‘Lily Allen is actually disgusting. White female pop stars can’t make a point about sexism without putting down black people, can they?’ Another said: ‘Oh, god, Lilly Allen, gross. That is racist and disgusting.

They argued that Miss Allen presents her black backing dancers as ‘nothing more than jiggling’ material. Reni . Eddo-Lodge, a blogger and black feminist, told programme host Dame . Jenni Murray she felt ‘troubled’ by the racial message of the video and . criticised the ‘denigrating images of black people’ that contribute . towards ‘structural racism’. She added: ‘I first cut my teeth when I was getting involved in feminism with this issue. 'I . was a teenager who absolutely loved this music but felt conflicted that . my favourite artists deemed me as a person with a black bum, a woman . with a black bum, as nothing more than jiggling material. ‘[Twerking] was a black thing.

'But now that it’s become . mainstreamed it’s about black women’s bodies served up for a very white . male gaze and it’s about mockery. And I just can’t see how these two . things can marry harmoniously.’ In . an online defence of her video, Miss Allen said she was attempting to . parody such singers, and added that she would be ‘deeply saddened if . anyone came away from that video feeling taken advantage of or . compromised in any way’. Commenting . on sexism in pop in an interview earlier this week, she said: ‘I think . objectification of women is fine if I feel there is a sense of ownership . from the woman. 'If it comes from somewhere else and it feels like the woman is being coerced or forced into something, then it’s gross.’ Last . night, however, a media campaigner said that while Miss Allen meant . well, she had perhaps given the wrong message with her video.

"A jury in North Carolina handed down the death penalty Thursday to Jonathan Douglas Richardson, 25, who they convicted of murdering his girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter. During the trial, it was revealed that Richardson tortured little Teghan Skiba for 10 days while his girlfriend of six months was on a trip - physically and sexually abusing the girl as well as strangling her with a power chord. Richardson brought the girl to Johnston Medical Center in July 2010, telling doctors she fell off her bed. But medics found signs of much more serious trauma, as her body was covered in bruises and bite marks. Death row: 25-year-old Jonathan Richardson (right) looks hopeless as he's sentenced to death for murdering his girlfriend's 4-year-old daughter . Victim: 4-year-old Teghan Skiba died in July 2010 after suffering days of torture at the hands of her mother's boyfriend of six months . Richardson was convicted last week of first-degree murder, felony child abuse, kidnapping and sexual offense. Skiba's mother Helen Reyes (right) is also facing charges of negligent child abuse causing serious bodily harm. She testified in Richardson's case last month . Teghan died a few days later after being transferred to the University of North Carolina medical center. Richardson was found guilty of first-degree murder, felony child abuse, kidnapping and sexual offense last week. Lawyers made their final arguments earlier in the day Thursday as the prosecution pushed for the death penalty and the defense tried to convince the jury to chose life in prison. Johnson County District Attorney Susan Doyle used details of Teghan's final days to justify the view that Richardson should be killed. Richardson was given responsibility for the little  girl while her mother, Helen Roxanne Reyes, was out-of-state on Army Reserves Training. But instead, Richard savagely beat the girl so much she lost over 70 per cent of her blood from numerous wounds. Four-year-old Teghan died in hospital of blunt force trauma after being tortured for ten days, prosecutors said . 'The defendant bit Teghan all over her body, over 60 times, and she began to slip away,' Doyle said. Prosecutor Greg Butler called Richardson a 'sadist' and a 'killer'. 'He's cold-hearted , and he's totally without remorse,' Butler said. According to wral.com, Dr Jonathan Privette, assistant . chief medical examiner in Greenville, said he observed injuries to . Teghan's neck that were consistent with markings of a power cord. The . doctor told the court: 'When she came to us, the brain has been damaged . so severely that, and swelling was so much the brain matter was . starting to come out.' DNA . from Teghan's blood was found on a wooden rod. The state expert . testified that more than 30 items had evidence of the little girl's . blood including underwear, pants, a sleeping bag and a pillow case. A . dentist told the court that bite marks on the child's body matched . Richardson's teeth. Some were so severe that the flesh was torn off, the . dentist said. But . Richardson's defense team argued that life in prison would be even more . punishment, saying his crimes would make him a target for other inmates. 'There will never come a time when he can let his guard down,' attorney Mike Kinkosum said. The little girl was in the care of her mother's boyfriend when she died in July 2010 of horrific injuries . Helen Reyes took the stand last month. She is charged with felony negligent child abuse causing serious bodily harm in connection with her daughter's death, according to ABC. She is free on bond and is yet to stand trial. She told the court: 'I am here for Teghan, for my daughter ... to get justice for her, because that man murdered my baby.' Jurors at the court in Smithfield appeared visibly upset when shown autopsy photos. The images were so graphic they caused the child's paternal grandfather to walk out of the court and her grandmother broke down in sobs. Richardson's lawyer said his client was abused as a child and has mental health problems. The attorney described the four-year-old's death as an 'unbelievable tragedy' which the accused did not mean to happen. According to wral.com, Police Deputy Matt DeSilva wept last week as he told the court that Teghan's injuries were 'the most horrifying thing I've ever seen done to a human being - especially a child'. On the witness stand on Tuesday, Helen Reyes' sister Maira said her family didn't approve of Richardson so her sister moved out with Teghan. Authorities said the little girl was living with her mom and her boyfriend in a makeshift structure with no running water and no bathroom behind Richardson's grandparents' home. Teghan pictured getting her birthday cake in 2009. She died the following year following brutal torture .

"When she was robbed of £10,000 worth of jewels, Loretta Smith was left traumatised. But in an extraordinary act of forgiveness the 75-year-old victim has sent one of the burglars £20 to help him turn his life around. The generous act came after career criminal Kevin Derbyshire wrote her a letter apologising for his crime. Loretta Smith said she hoped that by giving the burglar the money, it would help 'bring him to his senses' Apology: Kevin Derbyshire (left) wrote a letter to Mrs Smith while he was awaiting sentencing for the burglary, which took place in August last year . The pensioner wrote back to the 24-year-old, accepting his apology – and enclosed a £20 postal order. She explained: ‘He just said he was very, very sorry. ‘His writing was appalling [with] really bad spelling. He said he was really sorry for what had happened and he had been under the influence of valium.’ She continued: ‘I felt sorry for him. He obviously wasn’t very bright. I answered his letter and said thank you for your letter and that I hoped he understood the trauma he’d caused me.’ It appears Derbyshire’s partner in crime had also realised the trouble the pair had caused by their actions. During the raid on Mrs Smith’s home last August Derbyshire and Graham Llewellyn, also 24, grabbed £10,000 worth of gems including several rings and watches. But after CCTV pictures of them committing the burglary where broadcast, Llewellyn bundled some of the stolen property into a black bin bag and left it outside Mrs Smith’s home. The release of the CCTV pictures led to their arrest. Llewellyn has also written to Mrs Smith – but has so far not had a response. Speaking about her letter to Derbyshire, Mrs Smith said: ‘I made it very short and sweet, thanking him for the letter and said I was sure that he had not only upset me. He must have upset his partner or wife both financially and emotionally. ‘I thought at first I’d send him some stamps so he could send letters to loved ones – but I sent him £20.’ After he was arrested for burgling Mrs Smith’s home, a repentant Derbyshire wrote to his victim. Here is his letter (with spelling mistakes corrected) To the victims of my really horrible crime that I’ve committed, I just want to say that I’m really sorry for my stupid actions. I can assure you that I’m not a bad person, and I do not do things like this. I feel really bad, and I know I should. Things like this shouldn’t happen at all, and I didn’t even know what I was doing at the time. It was only when I went on Facebook and read all the horrible messages about me that it clicked what I had done. After the 75-year-old replied, sending him £20, he wrote back: . Dear Mr and Mrs Smith, . I just wanted to say thank you ever so much for your kindness towards me and replying to my letter. I really can’t say how much that letter meant to me in words, but I can assure you that it made me feel a lot better. Thank you so much for taking your spare time out of your way to write back to me. And if there’s anything I can do for you when I am released, I will not hesitate to do unpaid work and also, when I’m released, I will drop you a bunch of flowers and a bottle of good wine. I am so sorry for my silly actions. Her gift came despite Derbyshire and his accomplice leaving Mrs Smith with a £500 bill to repair the broken window at her home in Bolton and several stolen items not being returned. Mrs Smith added: ‘If people think I’m silly then hey ho.’ ‘I thought his letter came from the heart but maybe I’m just gullible. I’m hoping it will bring him to his senses and make him realise he has to go out and work.’ She added: ‘He did say when he comes out of prison he is going to buy me a bunch of flowers and the best bottle of wine he can afford.’ Details of Derbyshire’s written apology emerged at court, where the two men were jailed for 32 months each after admitting burglary. In Bolton Crown Court Derbyshire’s lawyer Nicholas Ross said his client was ‘remorseful’ and said of Mrs Smith’s gift: ‘It was out of remarkable sympathy, and I might say, in an almost saintly way, a token of her generosity.’ Revelation: Details of the apology emerged at Bolton Crown Court (pictured) where Derbyshire's lawyer used it to help with his plea for mitigation.

"The radio station behind the tragic prank call to the Duchess of Cambridge’s hospital broke the law, an Australian court was told. 2Day FM acted illegally by recording and broadcasting a conversation with nurse Jacintha Saldanha last December without the consent of the hospital, according to the Australian Communications and Media Authority. In the call to London’s King Edward VII hospital, hosts Mel Greig and Michael Christian posed as the Prince of Wales and the Queen and duped Mrs Saldanha into revealing details about the Duchess’s health. Scroll down for video . Controversy: The 2 Day FM radio presenters Christian and Greig were behind the prank-call which reportedly broke the law . The nurse, 46, was found hanged three days later. Jacintha Saldanha was duped by the prank call and put the DJs through to the ward . The interim findings emerged in a court hearing yesterday after the station took legal action to try to block the watchdog’s investigation. The broadcaster faces having its radio licence suspended or even revoked altogether. One of the Australian DJs behind the prank sparked outrage . again after accepting a national award for the stunt. Michael . Christian, who paired with Mel Greig during the hoax, was named the 'next top jock' of the station in June. Meanwhile Greig reportedly planned to sue the radio station for 'failing to provide a safe workplace' in wake of the incident. It was reported earlier this year while Christian returned to work Ms Greig was planning to attend the inquest into Mrs Saldanha's death in London. Christian and Greig called King . Edward VII hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated . last December pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles. Mrs . Saldanha failed to see their poor impersonations and transferred them . through to another nurse who revealed some details about her condition. The stunt drew widespread criticism with the the hospital's boss John Lofthouse saying: 'This was a foolish prank call that we . all deplore.' Only two months ago, it emerged that . in one of the three letters she left, Mrs Saldanha directly accused the . two Australian DJs of driving her to her death. Receptionist: ‘Hello, good morning, King Edward VII Hospital’ Female presenter (Mel Greig, impersonating the Queen): ‘Oh, hello there. Could I please speak to Kate please, my granddaughter?’ Receptionist:  ‘Oh yes, just hold on ma’am’ Male presenter (Michael Christian, impersonating Prince Charles): ‘Are they putting us through?’ Greig: ‘Yes’ Christian: ‘If this has worked it is the easiest prank call we have ever made. Your accent sucked by the way, I just want you to know’ [Both laughing] . Greig: ‘I’m not used to playing old an 80-year-old’ [Phone picked up] . Greig: ‘Kate, my darling.  Are you there?’ Nurse: ‘Good morning ma’am, this is the nurse speaking, how may I help you?’ Greig: ‘I’m just after my granddaughter Kate. I want to see how her little tummy bug is going?’ Nurse: ‘She’s sleeping at the moment and she has had an uneventful night. And sleep is good for her. She's been given some fluids [part removed due to patient confidentiality].  She's stable at the moment.' [Part removed due to patient confidentiality] . Greig: . ’I’ll just feed my little corgis then. When is a good time to come and . visit her, because I’m the Queen and I need a lift down there?’ [In background: Mummy, mummy] . ‘Charles! When can you take me to the hospital, Charles?’ Christian: ‘When will it be alright to come down and see her?  Maybe in the morning or something if that’s OK?’ Nurse: . ‘I would suggest that any time after nine o’clock would be suitable . because the doctor will be in in the morning and will just be getting . her freshened up. I would think any time after nine.’ Christian: ‘Is Wills still there or has he gone home? I haven’t spoken to him yet.’ Nurse:  ‘He went home probably at about nine o’clock last night, to be fair.’ Christian: ‘Lovely, but are they all ok? Everything is alright?’ Nurse: [Removed due to confidentiality] . Christian: ‘Of course, it’s hardly the palace is it?’ Greig: ‘ It’s nothing like the palace, is it Charles? When are you going to walk those bloody corgis?’ Christian: ‘Mumsy, I’ll go and take the dogs outside’ Greig:  ‘I need to go visit Kate in the morning. My dear, thank you so much’ Nurse: ‘You are very welcome’ Greig: ‘Goodbye’ Nurse: ‘Goodbye’ [Both presenters burst into laughter] .

"The head of a failing children's services that let down murdered schoolboy Daniel Pelka should stand down immediately, an MP has said. Colin Green announced he would be standing down from his job in September as a result of an appalling assessment by Ofsted that rated Coventry's primary schools as the worst in the country. However, Geoffrey Robinson MP said he should leave now. In an extraordinary outburst, the MP for Coventry North West said that Daniel had been 'badly let down' by his mother and stepfather, health professionals and social services. Calling for Mr Green to go immediately, he said: 'He takes with him the indelible stain of Daniel's cruel death, which his department had failed to prevent.' Scroll down for videos .

Guilty: Luczak, left, and Krezolek, right, who were found guilty of murder. They will be sentenced tomorrow . Daniel's mother Magdalena Luczak, 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34, were found guilty of his murder yesterday. In what was a harrowing case of . cruelty, Birmingham Crown Court heard he had been starved so badly he . looked like a 'concentration camp victim'. He was also locked in a tiny room, force-fed salt and held underwater in a bath until he was unconscious. Mr Robinson added: Mr Robinson said: . 'How can the staff at the school attended by Daniel have failed to have . recognised patterns of behaviour that should have set alarm bells . ringing, not only within the school but within the corridors of power . within the Council House? 'How could anyone believe it to be . normal for a child to climb on the top of furniture to get to food; to . scavenge around bins to access waste; and to steal food from the . lunch-boxes?

'Those who failed Daniel must examine . their own consciences, and conclude whether it is appropriate for them . to remain in their posts.' Luczak and Krezolek also hoodwinked . the authorities who then missed crucial opportunities to save the boy . who had been starved for six months. Yesterday neither Luczak nor Krezolek showed any emotion as the jury found them guilty of murdering the boy. Daniel was a ‘bag of bones’ when he died, despite the fact that teachers had seen him stealing food from bins. And social services closed the file on him even after the couple waited 12 hours to take him to hospital with a broken arm. Convicted killers: Magdelena Luczak, Daniel's mother, and his stepfather Mariusz Krezolek who were found guilty of murder by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court . Following the trial, it emerged: . During the nine-week trial, . Birmingham Crown Court heard how Daniel was systematically starved, . tortured, force-fed salt and locked in a home-made cell in Coventry for . days. 'Those with the ultimate duty of care turned Daniel from a beautiful and bright-eyed little boy into a broken bag of bones' Detective Inspector Chris Hanson . He was so frightened of Krezolek – who . forced him to perform punishment exercises such as squat thrusts – that . he would wet himself when spoken to by an adult man. By the time he died a few months short of his fifth birthday he weighed 1st 9lbs, the same as an 18-month-old child. He also stood 3ft 3inches tall, six . inches smaller than the average. His body bore 30 separate injuries, . including the fatal bleed on his brain caused by a violent assault to . the head. Police never established which of the . pair delivered the blow, but Daniel spent his final hours locked in his . cell on the mattress he was forced to use as a bed and toilet. By the time Luczak made a ‘staged’ 999 call on March 3 last year, two days after the assault, he had been dead for a few hours. Luczak and Krezolek were arrested two . days later after a post mortem examination found Daniel died from a . large subdural haematoma.

Krezolek, who was described as a . ‘monster’ in court, also admitted that he went online to check his bank . account and the price of car tyres after the assault. Birmingham Crown Court also heard . that the couple had sex just hours before they were arrested. Luczak . later accused Krezolek of raping her. But days later she was observed . holding and stroking her lover’s hand in the dock of Coventry . magistrates' court as the pair appeared charged with murder. Guilty:  Magdalena Luczak, 27, left, told police . she had been raped by her partner to try and cover up the fact they . were starving and beating four-year-old Daniel Pelka (right) In court, the couple both denied . muirder and blamed each other for his death, with Luczak claiming . Krezolek attacked Daniel after he wet the bed and Krezolek saying he was . injured in a series of falls. But prosecutor Jonas Hankin, QC, said . a series of sickening texts in Polish between the pair showed the . extent to which they acted as a ‘team’ to abuse the boy. At the time of the abuse, Krezolek and Luczak were both drinking heavily and taking drugs, including cannabis and amphetamines. The court heard how the couple . managed to trick officials into believing that Daniel was suffering from . a genetically inherited eating disorder which left him permanently . hungry. His teacher Lisa Godfrey described . seeing him scavenging in classmates’ lunchboxes for food and likened his . gaunt appearance to that of a ‘leukaemia’ sufferer. 'Doting': Daniel's stepfather Mariusz Krezolek cradles a baby in this family photo. His treatment of the child is a far cry from the abuse he meted out on Daniel . Questioning: Luczak - seen in a court artist's sketch - was accused of having lied to try and 'save her own skin' today during her trial at Birmingham Crown Court . Witnesses said he was ‘disappearing’ inside his school uniform and looked ‘desperate and lonely’. By then, he . had been reduced to looking in playground bins. The pair told the school that he . should not be fed as it would interfere with the medication for the . fictional condition, so staff locked up the other children’s lunchboxes. But despite their concerns and . suspicions – especially after teaching staff saw him with bruising to . his neck and black eyes – nothing was done. Police were also aware of both . defendants and attended the couple’s home at least three times in the . year before Daniel’s murder.

"Helen and Joe Auer have been inseparable for seven decades, and even death proved no match for their unbreakable, one-in-a-million bond. Helen Auer, from Cincinnati, Ohio, passed away peacefully at home last Wednesday at age 94. On the night of her death, Joe entered her room, gave her one final kiss goodbye and whispered to her, 'Helen, call me home.' And just 28 hours later, Helen did call him to her. Storybook romance: Joe and Helen Auer, pictured, passed away only 28 hours apart last week after 73 years of marriage . Long life: Mr Auer, a World War II hero, died at age 100, preceded by his 94-year-old wife. He celebrated his birthday in May . Picture perfect: Joe and Helen met at church in Cincinnati and got married in 1941 (left). A short time later, their first child, Barry, was born . Joe Auer died last Friday, five months after celebrating his 100th birthday. The couple's nine surviving children knew their dad could not make it without their mom for more than a night, reported the Cincinnati Enquirer. The Auers married at St. Lawrence Church in Cincinnati in 1941. On Wednesday, the couple who survived the Great Depression, lived through World War II, raised 10 children and witnessed the births of their 16 grandchildren, 29 great-grandkids and one great-great grandchild, will be back in front of the same alter where they had exchanged their vows 73 years earlier, only this time for a funeral Mass. Helen Auer, nee Fluegeman, had her first baby, Barry, soon after the wedding and was pregnant with their second child, Judy, by the time Joe shipped out to fight the Nazis in faraway Europe. Eager to have Joe see their new baby, Helen sent him a photo of herself with their two young children. Hero: Mr Auer went to war while his wife was pregnant with their second child and took part in the D-Day invasion, landing at Utah Beach in occupied France . Salt of the earth: The Auers, hardworking and devout, had 10 children together, which meant that money was always tight . Joe Auer had that precious black-and-white picture tucked in his pocket when he landed at Utah Beach on D-Day, and it did not leave his side for the remainder of the war - and for the rest of his life. Jerry Auer, the couple's 10th and final child, told the Cincinnati Enquirer that the threadbare, yellowed photograph was still in his father's wallet when he drew his last breath last week. Helen Auer was described by her children as the outgoing and spirited one in the family - a woman who loved keeping busy and spending time with loved ones. By contrast, their daughter Mary Joe Reiners described her father as a stern and serious man – the disciplinarian in the family - who was guided by his Christian faith and his profound sense of responsibility. According to Reiners, the environment was also very important to her father, and he had made sure to impart to his children the importance of taking good care of God’s Earth. All in the family: The couple witnessed the births of 16 grandchildren, 29 great-grandkids and one great-great grandchild . Bond forged in love: When Helen passed away at age 94 on October 15, her husband whispered to her, 'call me home, Helen' Crazy in love: The Auers' children knew that their father could not make it without their mom for more than one night . After serving his country in Europe for three years during the war, Auer returned home to Helen and found work as an engraver. With their family growing from one year to the next money was always tight but the Auers, frugal, humble and hardworking, always managed somehow. After sending off their youngest child to third grade, Helen joined the workforce to help Joe out, taking a job as a lunch lady at the St Lawrence Parish school. It was not until Joe retired that he, a child of the Depression, felt like he could finally afford to buy his first car. In photos of Helen and Joe shared by their family on the website of Meyer Funeral Home, the two appear deeply in love, dancing at family celebrations, posing side by side for pictures, or kissing on the couch like a pair of love-sick teens. 'They were simple, humble people. They wanted nothing and got everything in return,' Jerry Auer, 52, told the paper of his late parents.","Helen Auer, 94, passed away October 15 at home in Cincinnati, followed 28 hours later by her husband, Joe Auer .

"A shell-shocked war veteran today avoided jail after claiming memories of the battlefield triggered him to roar along a motorway at 140mph. Liam Farnworth, 24, who has served as a driver in Afghanistan and Iraq, used his army training to drive off at high speed, a court heard. He was said to have mistakenly thought a police patrol following him in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, were two masked thugs. Evidence: Liam Farnworth, 24, who has served as a driver in Afghanistan and Iraq, used his army training to drive off at high speed, a court heard . The plain clothes police officers were in an unmarked car and spotted Farnworth as he initially drove at up to 85mph in a 40mph zone. But as they began following him, Farnworth feared they were ‘men in hoodies’ and roared away as if he were ‘shaking off the enemy’ in battle. Even when the officers turned on their blue lights, Farnworth failed to stop, turning onto the M61 motorway heading towards Manchester. He weaved in and out of traffic at up to 140mph in a Nissan 350Z he borrowed from a friend before the dumping the vehicle and running off. Farnworth often used high speed skills to escape the enemy pursuing him in conflicts overseas and now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. He admitted dangerous driving and was today given a community order for 12 months after video footage of the chase was played to a judge. Location: Even when police officers turned on their blue lights, Farnworth failed to stop, turning onto the M61 heading towards Manchester (file picture) He was also sentenced to a supervision order for 12 months, banned from driving for 12 months and must take a driving re-test. Passing sentence today at Preston Crown Court, Mr Recorder Michael Murray said he could have been jailed for many years had anyone died. 'It seems to me at the time you were . suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder. Some members of the public might have sympathy but that in itself cannot be an excuse for driving like you did' Mr Recorder Michael Murray . He told the court: ‘You drove a high powered car at a rigorously high speed and you drove the car dangerously on the M61 and also on various residential roads in Bolton. ‘I saw the police footage and it speaks for itself. Fortunately no-one was injured and no property had been damaged - had there been any it would be more likely than not you would be going to prison today. ‘If you had actually killed someone, you would have expected many years imprisonment. ‘It seems to me at the time you were suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder brought about by your experiences as a serving soldier overseas. ‘Some members of the public might have sympathy but that in itself cannot be an excuse for driving like you did. There very easily could have been a catastrophic accident at those sort of speeds.’ Car: He weaved in and out of traffic at up to 140mph in a Nissan 350Z (similar to the one pictured) he borrowed from a friend before the dumping the vehicle . Earlier the court watched a recording of the pursuit, filmed from the officers’ car. It showed how Farnworth left the motorway at Junction 5 and sped on to Wigan Road before reaching Hunger Hill and turning into Bolton Road. 'He did not realise at first that the men in the car behind him were police officers. His army training kicked in, for want of a better phrase, and he panicked and did what he did' David Ryan, defending . Then he turned into Winslow Road, where he abandoned the car without putting on the handbrake. The vehicle rolled away and crashed causing £1,000 worth of damage to its bumper, and Farnworth was caught by police after they chased him on foot. At an earlier hearing, David Ryan, defending, told the court that Farnworth had left the army in June, 2010, after serving for six years. He had received extensive driver training whilst in the forces, and on occasions had used his skills to escape whilst being chased by the enemy. Post-traumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder following very stressful or frightening events. It can be seen in people after military combat, serious road accidents, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, being held hostage or witnessing serious assaults. Sufferers often relive the event through nightmares - and can feel isolated, irritably or guilty. They can also suffer from sleeping problems or have difficulty in concentrating. ‘He has, on several occasions, had to flee from incidents of conflict,’ Mr Ryan said. But he added that, due to things he had witnessed and experienced in the army, Farnworth now suffers from post-traumatic stress. Mr Ryan said: ‘He did not realise at first that the men in the car behind him were police officers. 'His army training kicked in, for want of a better phrase, and he panicked and did what he did. ‘He didn’t know who they were and he panicked and put his foot down. He believes himself that he was in full control of the vehicle at all times.’ Farnworth, of Horwich, who now works as HGV driver for a vehicle dealership, was said to be ‘deeply ashamed’ of his behaviour. The court heard he had six weeks of psychotherapy and can soon be discharged back into the care of his GP.","Liam Farnworth, 24, served in Afghanistan and Iraq .

"Britney Spears wants to send her new lingerie collection to the Duchess of Cambridge. The 32-year-old Toxic hitmaker - who unveiled her Intimate Britney Spears Lingerie collection at the Cafe Royal Hotel in London last night - is keen to see Kate Middleton wearing items from her new underwear line. She told the Daily Mirror: 'I would love to see Kate in my underwear designs. That would be splendid. Scroll down for video . Princess-worthy: Britney Spears has revealed who she would like to model her lingerie line. 'I would love to see Kate in my underwear designs. That would be splendid,' she said. (Pictured at the line's launch in London) 'I'm going to send her one of every piece. So she'll have plenty to choose from.' However, with the Duchess pregnant with her second child, she'll likely have to wait a few months to try on the racy lingerie. Britney is also keen to enlist some help from fellow pop star Gwen Stefani and hopes the Hollaback Girl hitmaker will help model the new range. She said: 'I'd love to see Gwen Stefani modelling my collection. I think she's very cool and sexy.' The blonde beauty launched the collection in the elaborately decorated hotel dressed with over 1,000 flowers, where attendees listened to classical music as they dined on macaroons and drank tea from vintage teacups. Kate's new look? At the launch, Britney told guests: 'The sexiest item is the cherry red because it stands out and it's very elaborate and it's pretty promiscuous' Get the look: The collection, which retails between $17 and $79 and stock bra sizes A-J, boasts 'detailed shoulder straps and stunning embellishments, in addition to crochet edges, satin ribbons, and lace trim' The setting mirrored the vintage style of the lingerie and Britney was happy to reveal her favorite piece. She told guests: 'The sexiest item is the cherry red because it stands out and it's very elaborate and it's pretty promiscuous.' The mother-of-two showed off her décolletage in a plunging navy jumpsuit, and a waisted bow meant her trim tummy was on full display. Unlikely: The racy designs would certainly be a departure from the Duchess's usual conservative style - and since she's pregnant with her second child, she'll have to wait a few months to try them on . She accessorized her look with a silver drop necklace, small stud earrings, stacked bracelets and pointed black heels. The pop star mingled with the stunning models who were clad in her racy designs that featured high-waisted knickerbockers, sheer babydoll nightgowns, romantic red camisoles and chic bras.","The pop star added that she plans to send Kate one of every piece from the collection, 'so she'll have plenty to choose from'"
"I scream, you scream, we all scream for… crocodile ice cream – or at least in the Philippines they do. A restaurant in Davao City has come up with the unusually flavoured frozen dessert after the owners were offered some eggs from the crocodile park next door, where the animals are raised for their meat and skin. But animal lovers need not to worry, as the ice cream is not made with crocodile meat but just with eggs that did not hatch or are surplus, the owners of the Sweet Spot eatery said. Unusual treat: The ice cream by Sweet Spot eatery in Davao City in the Philippines is made with crocodile eggs . Sweet Spot's artisan ice cream uses crocodile eggs instead of hen eggs together with the more usual ingredients of milk, cream, sugar and flavourings. The owners of Sweet Spot, Dino and Bianca Ramos, received some crocodile eggs from Dino's uncle, the owner of the nearby Davao Crocodile Park. Not knowing what to do with them, Dino decided to try to make ice cream and found themselves with a delicious treat on their hands. Crocodile ice cream inventor: Dino Ramos . Dino said: ‘Of course it is regular ice cream that doesn't taste of croc meat. It's only the eggs we use. But they do make delicious ice cream. 'Because crocs are an endangered species, we only get the eggs that do not hatch or are surplus.’ According to Sweet Spot, crocodile eggs are 80 per cent yolk and much more nutritious than chicken's eggs, making it a healthier choice for their ice cream. Unusually flavoured ice creams are not so unusual after all. Ice Cream Parlour, in Whitby, North Yorkshire, sells fish and chips ice cream, made using bits of real battered cod, deep-fried potatoes and mushy peas. And London ice cream shop The Icecreamists caused a stir when they started selling breast milk ice cream under the name of Baby Gaga. But probably Japan is king when it comes to weird ice cream flavours: raw horse meat, cow tongue and octopus are just some of the strange tastes available in the country.

"Anti-terror police in Germany have arrested a  man codenamed 'The Tailor' who they claim ran a secret textile factory supplying large amounts of clothes and boots for ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria. The Lebanese man, identified only as 31-year-old Kassem R., was woken up at his home in a suburb of Bonn by GSG-9 officers blowing off the front door of his apartment with explosives.

"Scientists have long wondered why the U.S. and Europe are so culturally different to China and other countries in Eastern Asia. Now one study claims the answer lies in an unexpected area: the different farming methods used by people living in the East and West. While Westerners are known for their individualism and analytical thinking, eastern culture tends to be interdependent and holistic, the study claims. Paddy rice in the East (right) cannot be grown without ample supplies of water, forcing neighbours to work together. It is also highly labour-intensive, requiring twice the number of hours from planting to harvest as does wheat. Western wheat farmers (left), in contrast, can rely on the rain and operate much more independently . Theories explaining the differences have included wealth and education fuelling individualism in the West, and high rates of infectious disease in the East causing people to be wary of outsiders. But the real reason may simply be the way people at both ends of the world cultivate rice and wheat, say the scientists. Paddy rice cannot be grown without ample supplies of water, forcing neighbours to work together to irrigate their crops. It is also highly labour-intensive, requiring about twice the number of hours from planting to harvest as does wheat. Scientists assessed known measures of individualism and collectivism in 1,000 people from different regions of China where rice and wheat are grown. The results, published in the journal Science, showed distinct psychological differences that mirrored those between the East and West . Wheat farmers, in contrast, can rely on the rain and operate much more independently. To test their theory, the scientists assessed known measures of individualism and collectivism in 1,000 people from different regions of China where rice and wheat are grown. The results, published in the journal Science, showed distinct psychological differences that mirrored those between the East and West. ‘It’s easy to think of China as a single culture,’ said lead researcher Thomas Talhelm, from the University of Virginia. ‘But we found that China has very distinct northern and southern psychological cultures and that southern China’s history of rice farming can explain why people in southern China are more interdependent than people in the wheat-growing north. ‘The data suggests that legacies of farming are continuing to affect people in the modern world.’ The East Coast prefers Bud Light, and . those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer, a new . study of America's drinking habits has revealed. Researchers analysed a million tweets to find out which each region prefers. They . found tweet preferences for Bud Light were found mainly in the Eastern . half of the U.S, while preferences for Coors Light originate in the . Western half, particularly near Colorado and surrounding states. Other beer spaces included Miller . Lite preferences in the Midwest and Great Plains, and brands like Corona . and Dos Equis in the Southern border regions of the U.S. Most wine-related tweets were sent from the wine-growing regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern and central California. Overall, . residents of the eastern and western US coastal regions were more . partial to wine (or at least were more likely to tweet about it), while . people from several Midwestern states and into Kansas, Oklahoma and . Texas were more apt to tweet about beer. The East Coast prefers Bud Light, and those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer, a new study of America's drinking habits has revealed.

"A young heir to the Red Bull energy drink empire has been charged with causing death by reckless driving, escaping arrest and drunk driving after a police officer was killed in Thailand.

Fears of a cover-up emerged . following the arrest of Vorayuth, accused of killing the policeman after hitting him with . his Ferrari. Comronwit . Toopgrajank, Bangkok's most senior police official said he took charge . of the investigation after a lower-ranking policeman initially tried to . cover up the crime by turning in a bogus suspect - the family's driver who allegedly claimed he had been behind the wheel. He told reporters: 'A policeman is dead. I can't let this stand. If I let this case get away, I'd rather quit. 'I don't care how powerful they are. If I can't get the actual man in this case, I will resign.' The story is headline news in Thailand where many are now speculating as to whether or not justice will be properly served. One comment on the popular Thai website Pantip.com read: 'Jail is only for the poor. The rich never get punished.' While a reader of the Bangkok Post suggested Vorayuth would  'receive a suspended sentence and never do any jail time.' The Yoovidhya family was ranked the fourth richest in Thailand this year by Forbes magazine, with a net worth of $5.4billion. Red .

"One in four Americans who have signed up for Obamacare using the glitch-prone HealthCare.gov site may not be insured in time for the beginning of new year due to errors, it was revealed Friday. The Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) announced that some 25 per cent of insurance applications filed on the Internet market exchange in October and November could contain mistakes. According to officials, many of the glitches with have since been resolved, but the current error rate still hovers around 10 per cent.

Glitch: This December 3, 2013 photo shows a message indicating that a connection cannot be established with the HealthCare.gov insurance marketplace internet site . The Obama administration has urged any applicants who used the HealthCare.gov portal to sign for health coverage to contact their insurance provider immediately, ABC News reported. If no record of their application could be found, people will have to start the enrollment process from scratch. Between October 1, when the Obamacare website was unveiled, and December 2, more than 155,000 signed up for insurance through the error-plagued federal exchange. CMS is still struggling to resolve technical snafus having to do with the so-called 834 forms that are sent to insurers. As Fox News explained, the forms provide insurance companies with essential information about clients, including their name, address, contact information and Social Security number. CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille said some applications may not be generated from the system; others are erroneously duplicated, while some forms may contain incorrect data about the applicants’ family members. Picking up the pace: Between October 1 and December 2, more than 155,000 signed up for insurance through the error-plagued federal exchange . According to Batallie, CMS has put in place a 'more rigorous monitoring system' to make sure that 834 forms reach insurance companies containing accurate information going forward. Uninsured Americans have until March 1 to sign for a health care plan to avoid paying a fine, but the coverage is supposed to be effective as of January 1. People who have successfully signed up for insurance are supposed to receive a letter from their provider requesting payment. Figures cited by the Washington Post show that close to 27,000 people signed up from October 1 through November 2. The one-in-four error rate could mean that some 6,750 applicants may not be able to use their insurance on the first day of the new year.","Obama administration said 25 per cent of applications submitted through HealthCare.gov in October and November had errors .

Cambridge graduate Mr Harding resigned . from The Times after five years in December and indicated to colleagues . on the paper that its owners News Corporation had wanted him to go. Mr Harding will head the BBC's news division, which employs more than 8,000 staff, and sit on the BBC's executive and management boards. He . said: 'The BBC's newsroom strives to be the best in the world, trusted . for its accuracy, respected for its fairness and admired for the courage . of its reporting. I am honoured to be a part of it.' Scroll down for video . Harding replaces Helen Boaden (left) and is one of new director general Tony Hall's first appointments . BBC Director-General Tony Hall said: . 'I am delighted that James will be joining as the new Director of BBC . News and Current Affairs. High quality journalism sits right at the . heart of the BBC making this is an absolutely critical role. 'James has a very impressive track . record as a journalist, editor and manager. I believe he will give BBC . News a renewed sense of purpose as it moves away from what has been an . undeniably difficult chapter. 'As an organisation, the BBC will also . benefit from his external perspective and experience which he will . share as a member of the BBC’s Executive team.' Before working at The Times, Harding held a number of international posts at the Financial Times. Boaden's time in charge was . scrutinised by the Pollard review, which said her division went into . 'virtual meltdown' during the scandal. As director of news, Miss Boaden was responsible for more than 8,000 staff and was in charge of all of the broadcaster’s news and current affairs output, including Question Time, Panorama, the Today Programme and Newsnight. Mr Harding will head the news division, which employs more than 8,000 staff, and sit on the BBC's executive and management boards . Harding - who can speak English, . French, German, Mandarin and Japanese - worked as a speechwriter in . Japan before taking up a job at the Financial Times in 1994. He opened the newspaper's Shanghai bureau before going on to become the Washington bureau chief, a job he held for three years. In 2006 he started working at the . Times as business editor before becoming overall editor - and at 38 the . youngest person ever to do so - of the paper in 2007. He was born in London and was educated at St. Paul's School before going on to study history at Trinity College, Cambridge. He is the author of Alpha Dogs, How Political Spin Became a Global Business and is married to Kate with whome he has a son, Samuel. It . is known that she told Mr Entwistle – then running BBC TV – at an . awards lunch last year that Newsnight was planning to run a report about . claims that Savile abused young girls, which could affect Mr . Entwistle’s plans for Christmas shows paying tribute to the presenter. Sources . at Newsnight also suggested that she warned the programme’s then . editor, Peter Rippon – who has also since stepped aside – that he needed . to be sure of his facts before screening any claims that Savile was a . criminal. Miss Boaden resumed her role as director of BBC News in December after further blunders - caused by a change in the chain of command in news while an inquiry was ongoing - led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly identified as being involved in a sexual abuse scandal. After Boaden stepped aside, Fran Unsworth, 54, was temporarily made head of news and will hold the position until Harding starts in August. In Ferbruary, former Labour cabinet minister James Purnell was made chief strategist at the BBC on a salary of £295,000 a year. His appointment re-ignited concerns over the corporation's links with the Left with MPs claiming it was 'unprecedented' to have someone with such a politically active past become a senior BBC executive. Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The amount of licence fee-payers' money paid to senior BBC bosses has long been excessive and it is a shame that this opportunity has not been taken reduce spending in this area. 'As families up and down the country have to tighten their belts, the Corporation needs to do the same and cutting down the executive pay bill is an obvious area for savings.'","Replaces Helen Boaden who stepped aside over the Savile investigation .

"A Virginia man who punched and strangled his two-year-old daughter to death claiming that she was possessed by a demon has been jailed for 20 years. Eder Guzman-Rodriguez told police that he punched Jocelyn 'over and over' after he claims he saw his daughter gesturing to him as if she wanted to fight. Guzman-Rodriguez, 30, told police in Floyd that his daughter was possessed and that he had tried to exorcise her. He claimed that the demon 'used' his body to kill the child. 'Possessed': Eder Guzman-Rodriguez, left, claimed that his daughter Jocelyn, right, was possessed by a demon when he punched and strangled her to death in 2011 . In a plea bargain, Guzman-Rodriguez did not contest a first-degree murder charge and was sentenced to 20 years and 11 months in prison. Originally from Mexico, Guzman-Rodriguez will be deported once he has served his sentence. Floyd County Court heard that police were called to reports of the death of a child on November 23 2011. The first deputy who arrived on the scene said that he saw 'several Hispanics holding Bibles' standing on the deck of a mobile home. Police found Guzman-Rodriguez's wife Carmen Nolazco crying with visible injuries to her head, face and chest. Jailed: Guzman-Rodriguez was sentenced to more than 20 years in prison after admitting first-degree murder . The court heard that she could not have prevented Jocelyn's death because she had been beaten unconscious before Guzman-Rodriguez attacked the two-year-old. Jocelyn was found by officers wrapped in a blanket with no pulse. Attorney Stephanie Shortt said that Guzman Rodriguez told police: 'I know I am the one who hit her, I was the only one there. 'The demon used my body to kill her.' Jocelyn suffered a catalogue of horrific injuries - which included fractured ribs, abrasions and hemorrhages. The cause of death was manual asphyxiation, Shortt said.","Eder Guzman-Rodriguez claims his daughter was possessed by a demon .

"Moviegoers at a screening of the new Batman film were left fearing for their lives when a cinema attendant burst into the theatre dressed as super-villain Bane, just hours after a gunman in the same costume opened fire on an audience in the US. The prank took place at the Vue cinema in Worcester on Friday, less than 24 hours after the massacre at the Aurora, Colorado, screening of The Dark Knight Rises. The stunt has been condemned by 'appalled and sickened' audience members who have written to Vue demanding an apology. Scene: The incident took place at the Vue cinema in Worcester on Friday . Schoolteacher Elizabeth Atkinson, 24, was at the screening with brothers James, 27, . and Leo, 19. She said: 'In light of the recent . and tragic event during the screening of the new Batman film in Aurora, . Colorado, I was shocked and appalled by the attitude displayed by the . staff at the Vue cinema here in Worcester. The prankster was dressed as Bane, Tom Hardy's character in The Dark Knight Rises . 'While the trailers were in progress, . one of the cinema attendants entered the screen room wearing a gas mask . and stood to the side looking at the audience. 'This . is exactly as the gunman in Colorado was reported to have been dressed. 'I was not the only one who found this to be extremely disconcerting and . inappropriate. 'I . raised my concerns to other staff members outside, explaining that this . attendant was causing discomfort. 'The response I received was one to . suggest that they were either unaware of the recent shooting, or they . were indifferent to it. 'I . was told simply that he was ""Dressed as the villain, Bane"". It was only . when I explained further that the Colorado gunman was also dressed in . this way, that the attendant was spoken to and the mask removed. 'One . would have expected that the management of the Vue cinema would have . been sensitive to this issue and dissuaded the staff members from . dressing up. This incident was at best in poor taste, and at worst a . sickening lack of respect.' Her brother James has written a letter of complaint to Vue. Mr Atkinson, a freelance film maker, . wrote 'Even though I knew he was meant to be dressed as the character . Bane from the film, I felt it was incredibly insensitive indeed in light . of the recent shootings in America by a man wearing a gas mask.'

A spokesman for Vue cinemas said: 'Our . staff are passionate about movies and often wear fancy dress on the . opening day of blockbuster films. 'On this occasion a staff member started his shift in fancy dress, but removed it within minutes of being on site. 'We in no way meant to cause offence and wholeheartedly apologise for this misplaced enthusiasm. 'Everyone at Vue Entertainment has been deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic incident that took place in Denver. 'Our thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of all those who have been killed and injured.'

"Around half a million homeowners in Britain are 'property millionaires' – a rise of 60 per cent in just one year. There are more than 10,000 streets across the country where the average property price is seven figures. There is even one street in London where the 'average' price of a home is nearly £43million. Although the value of many homes, particularly in the North, is far below what they were worth before the economic crisis began, the number of 'property millionaires' has ballooned. More than 10,000 streets across the country have an average property price of seven figures, a new study has found . Property website Zoopla said there were just under 200,000 'property millionaires', whose homes were worth a million or more, in 2009. Today there are 484,081, up from 300,142 last year. Unsurprisingly, London dominates the 'property millionaires' list. Of the 10,613 streets with an average price of more than £1milllion, 3,744 are in the capital. Other hotspots – all in the South of England – include Ascot in Berkshire; Guildford, Leatherhead, Woking and Esher in Surrey; and Sevenoaks in Kent. The capital is home to Kensington Palace Gardens next to Kensington Palace, which has been dubbed 'Billionaire's Row', not least because the average property price there is £42.7million. Figures show in London, the average price is at an all-time high of £499,000 . Parents who want their children to attend the country's best state schools can pay a premium of up to £500,000 to buy a home nearby. A report shows homes close to top secondary schools are often considerably more expensive than those in other areas of the same county. The most extreme example is Beaconsfield High School in Buckinghamshire, where the average price of nearby properties is £797,000, compared with £314,000 in the rest of the county. This means the 'school premium' is £483,000 – the highest in England. Homes near Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield, typically cost £299,000, while the average price in the West Midlands is £167,000. The report, from banking giant Lloyds, said the average top school premium is £21,000. Researchers looked at the best performing state secondary schools across England based on 2013's GCSE results. Many oversubscribed schools have admissions policies which favour those living closest. This is 162 times the value of the average British home, currently £263,705, according to Zoopla's estimate. Young couples and families looking to move are being forced to take on crippling mortgage debts in order to get on the property ladder or climb it, especially in London. Official figures revealed there is more mortgage debt in south-west London than there is in the whole of Wales. In London, the average price is at an all-time high of £499,000, according to figures published recently by the Office for National Statistics. Outside the capital, Zoopla's report says the highest proportion of property millionaires live in the Surrey town of Virginia Water where the average price is £1.19million. Other expensive areas include the Buckinghamshire towns of Beaconsfield and Chalfont St Giles, as well as Cobham and Weybridge in Surrey. Lawrence Hall of Zoopla said London is an area which can charge 'stratospheric price tags'. But he added: 'You don't need to be a billionaire to get a chance to own the creme de la creme of property on offer. In Wales and the North East, you can still snap up a prime property in the region's most desirable streets for little over £1million.' A separate report, from estate agents Douglas & Gordon, also published today, said property values in the capital are 'unlikely to fall dramatically'. Ed Mead, an executive director of the chain, said: 'Sellers remain in control. Our offices report that the majority of their sellers are unwilling to reduce asking prices. 'Given the equity rich environment, many can afford to wait and watch.'","Zoopla says the number of 'property millionaires' has ballooned .

"It's an age-old idiom, but a New York-based Italian artist wants to know the truth - what is it like to actually find a needle in a haystack? And is it even possible? Sven Sachsalber spent 48 hours sifting through a giant pile of hay dumped in at the  Palais de Tokyo gallery in Paris. In the pile of hay he searched for a needle hidden deep in its centre by the prestigious modern art gallery's president Jean de Loisy. Italian artist Sven Sachsalber begins in search for a needle in a haystack in the Palais de Tokyo . The meticulous and uncertain process of searching for a needle in a haystack begins . Sachsalber says the 'art installation' is something easy to understand for the general public . De Loisy says the installation isn't just a man taking on the ultimate hide-and-seek challenge as it explored the complex relationship between words and actions, juxtaposing metaphors for the immensely small and the incomprehensibly large and complex . 'I don't think there is anyone, regardless of whether they like modern art or not, who would not be intrigued by this childish question -- can it actually be done, or is ""Searching for a needle in a haystack"" simply a turn of phrase?' De Loisy said. Palais de Tokyo gallery president Jean de Loisy holds the needle he would bury in the haystack . De Loisy dives into the haystack to ensure Sachsalber's search isn't simple . De Loisy shows his commitment to the artistic statement in the modern and contemporary gallery . The two-day timeframe was set as a limit since Sachsalber could have simply taken minutes to find the needle, though that was considered unlikely. Sachsalber said that the project was a practical one that the general public would find accessible. He said: 'It's like playing the lottery, so you don't know if you're going to win or not, you hope you're going to win otherwise why play the lottery? And it's the same thing here, even if it's hard I think, because it's itchy, this hay, and I have it everywhere after a few hours, but it's fun at the same time. 'And it's very accessible, I think you don't really need to understand much about art or whatever, just everyone knows what it is,' he said. The giant pile of hay is a prominent feature in the vast Parisian gallery . Although he avoids the label 'performance artist', Sachsalber has a history of engaging in unusual, even dangerous, activities in the name of art. 'I have never considered myself as a conceptual artist, other people did,' he said. His escapades include eating a highly toxic wild mushroom, spending 24 hours in a room with a cow, cutting down a tree he was precariously perched on and climbing over gravestones pretending to be a squirrel. 'Even though it might look stupid, I just want to test out these things,' he said.","Artist Sven Sachsalber search for a needle in a haystack in Paris .

"The schools are going back, you’ve just returned from your holiday... so, naturally, we’re heading for a mini-heatwave. After a distinctly dismal end to August, the arrival of September is going to be one for the sunseekers – so don’t dig your winter coat out just yet. Forecasters confirmed yesterday that temperatures in some parts of the country could rise to the mid-20s centigrade next week, thanks to the effects of Hurricane Cristobal. Forecasters confirmed yesterday that temperatures in some parts of the country could rise to the mid-20s centigrade next week, thanks to the effects of Hurricane Cristobal . While the north-west extremes of Britain may be side-swiped by the remains of the storm that blasted the Bahamas earlier this week, the effect is that the rest of the country will benefit from Cristobal dragging in hot air from the continent. But before the barbecue weather emerges on Monday, the wind and scattered showers are expected to last the weekend. Northern and western parts will continue to be windy after gales battered the region yesterday – with some places in the highlands of Scotland seeing gusts of 59mph. However, the Met Office said it will start to feel warmer from tomorrow, with temperatures creeping above average for September. While the north-west extremes of Britain may be side-swiped by the remains of the storm that blasted the Bahamas earlier this week, the effect is that the rest of the country will benefit from Cristobal dragging in hot air from the continent . A spokesman predicted it will then get warmer still next week, with the high pressure responsible for the Indian summer potentially holding out for an entire fortnight. She said: ‘We could see temperatures hit 22C (72F) to 24C (75F) at Heathrow on Sunday with highs in the 20s across the south and late teens in the north. ‘Wednesday will be very warm in the south, we are looking at up to 25C (77F) – but there might be some thundery outbreaks on Thursday.’ But she added that the forecast remained optimistic: ‘Certainly until Friday and Saturday most places will stay dry and sunny with good temperatures, and after that it depends on what happens with the high pressure. The weather is due to change, just as children start returning to school (file pic) ‘There is an indication it could build again the week after, meaning two weeks of settled weather.’ Temperatures in the south are expected to hit the mid-20s (79F) by the end of the week and reaching 20C (68F) elsewhere. With building humidity it could feel close to 30C (86F) in some regions with even the far north getting close to 26C (79F). Veteran BBC forecaster Michael Fish said ‘there’s another helping of summer on the way next week’, while Leon Brown, a forecaster for The Weather Channel UK, predicted that Cristobal will ‘shut the door’ on any cold weather setting in at the beginning of September. He said: ‘Cristobal will track over the North Atlantic as a very deep depression this weekend, but will be well to the north of the UK and move across Iceland. ‘The system will effectively shut the door on any cooler Arctic flows for early September and initiate ridging and high pressure over the UK. ‘With a southerly flow developing later next week we may see some very warm temperatures, perhaps 25C (77F) to 26C (79F) in the south by next Thursday and Friday.’ And although this year’s summer may have felt sweltering, the Met Office said it is not likely to break any records. Early figures have shown the UK’s mean temperature for the season will be around 14.8C (59F) – just 0.5C above average. It said the cooler August offset the warmer June and July. This month has also been wetter than average, but not by much – the country has actually seen normal rainfall, with 246.7mm (9.7inches) falling across the UK.","Wind and scattered showers are expected to last for rest of the weekend .

"A high school class in Germany has apologised after teenage pupils allegedly started greeting each other with 'Heil Hitler' and communicating in Nazi slogans. The children of class 9a said sorry for their actions on Facebook after intense pressure from parents and staff at the school, in Leipzig in east Germany - but claimed that not all of them were involved. It comes after it emerged that all 29 members of the class - including a Jewish boy - subscribed to a WhatsApp chatroom where Hitler and the Nazis were routinely praised. Horrific: A photograph of one of the male students in class 9A at the Landsberg School near Leipzig, east Germany, shows him raising his right arm in a Nazi salute . The Landsberg Gymnasiums students said: 'We, as class 9a from the Landsberg Grammar School, apologise for everything that has been published which has caused our school damage, and that which is still to come. 'These were ill considered actions which we are not able to make up for. 'Furthermore, it was not the whole class which was responsible. That's why we would like to apologise, even to our uninvolved classmates.' They accused the BILD newspaper in Germany, which broke the story, of 'twisting' facts 'but want to apologise for these anyway, even if they were not meant seriously. And we promise that never again will there be such behaviour in the class of 9a again.' It was signed on behalf of 'all those responsible'. Parents and authorities were left horrified after it emerged that some of the 14 and 15-year-olds had been swapping Nazi sayings and slogans throughout the school day. Local media reports suggested students regularly made anti-Jewish slurs on the messaging app, while praising Hitler as a 'great man'. Fear: Parents are in shock after media reports that students in the class, boys and girls ages 14 and 15, appear to have been engaging in the behaviour on WhatsApp . One of the messages from a student made a Holocaust joke that read: 'Why did Hitler kill himself? The Jews sent him the gas bill.' Two youngsters - believed to be the ringleaders - are now under intense police scrutiny after they stuck on fake Hitler moustaches and were photographed giving the Nazi salute inside school classrooms. The school is currently closed for the autumn half term but police detectives, psychologists, educationalists and parents are set for stormy meetings there with the headmaster in a week's time when it reopens. The praise of, or display of, Nazism and its symbols is strictly forbidden in Germany and first offences can carry a maximum prison term of six months. Police want to determine whether the pro-Nazi sentiments expressed by the youngsters were merely a form of teen rebellion or if they went deeper. Disgusting: Screen grabs from the WhatsApp conversations see students using the 'Sieg Heil' phrase . Photos of 14 and 15-year-old students show them giving Nazi salutes and wearing Hitler moustaches . Gampel, the former head of the local Halle Jewish Community, said his son had experienced harassment at the school. 'My son told me that someone had stuck a far-right NPD [National Democratic Party] sticker on his jacket. It was well known, it seems, that he was Jewish.' 'I have made a formal complaint with police for an investigation, but on the other hand it would definitely be the wrong thing to simply accuse the entire class and tar them with the same brush.' He said: 'Even after I read about it, I found it difficult to get him to talk about what went on. It was only through a lengthy discussion that he admitted what was in the newspaper article was essentially true.' A spokesman for the state educational affairs minister in Saxony-Anhalt said: 'I am shocked. If this is true there can only be one way forward here: zero tolerance.' The WhatsApp exchanges have been handed over to police and prosecutors. In shock: The school, Landsberg Gymnasiums near Leipzig, where the teenagers all study . The school headmaster Lutz Feudel said the entire school had been shocked, and that the secret Nazi sympathisers were confined to one class. Getting to the bottom of how it happened would be difficult because the autumn break had already started, he said. He said the parents of two of the children involved had been invited to a discussion together with their children, but that a third who they wanted to speak to was on holiday in Spain. He said he did not want to instantly accuse the children, saying: 'Breaking taboos is part of young adulthood. I don't believe that they wanted to actively promote neo-Nazi ideology.' All the class students, like all children in Germany, have visited a Nazi concentration camp and regularly learn about the excesses of the Third Reich in classes. Neo-Nazi groups significantly stepped up their recruitment of children in recent years. The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern near Berlin has started carrying out background checks on would-be kindergarten employees after it was discovered several had been infiltrated by far-right females.","Year 9 class says sorry amid claims they communicated in 'Nazi slogans'

But they are monitoring Martinez's future and, amid rumours the Spaniard is unhappy at Bayern, they have enquired about his availability. Wenger tried to sign Martinez ahead of the 2012-13 season as a replacement for the outgoing Alex Song. But Arsenal were blown out of the water by Bayern who met the midfielder's £32m release clause. However, Wenger remains a huge admirer of Martinez, 25, and would jump at the chance of landing the midfielder, who can also play centre back.

"Rev David Davies, 49, was arrested on suspicion of beating the woman and then driving his Jaguar while twice the legal limit . A vicar has been charged with assaulting a woman and drink-driving. Rev David Davies, 49, was arrested on suspicion of beating the woman and then getting behind the wheel of his Jaguar while twice the legal limit. The former Army chaplain, who has been a priest for more than 30 years, was relieved of his duties as a rural parish priest several months ago. Police later pulled him over in a country park, where he allegedly failed a breathalyser test. Davies was said to have 92 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath, nearly three times the legal limit of 35 microgrammes. A Church spokesman said the vicar’s alleged crimes happened after he had stopped working in the village of Cockington, near Torquay, Devon. He was due before Torquay Magistrates’ Court this week but was excused from appearing in person after his lawyer submitted a letter to a district judge explaining his absence. The contents of the letter were not revealed to the court. Davies is yet to enter a plea to charges of driving in a public place while over the limit and assault by beating. He has been told not to contact three named women and not to go to the vicarage in Monterey Close, Torquay. Rev Davies was due before Torquay Magistrates’ Court (pictured this week but was excused from appearing in person after his lawyer submitted a letter to a district judge explaining his absence . The Exeter Diocese issued a statement through the Venerable Clive Cohen, Acting Archdeacon of Totnes, to say Davies had been relieved of his church duties two months before the incident. He said: ‘The diocese has been working to support him and his family pastorally and practically throughout this period. ‘We were very grieved when the police informed us of the charges against him. We do not condone the alleged actions in any way. ‘We are continuing to offer pastoral care to his family. My prayers are for David’s family and David himself in this immensely difficult time. I would ask that they be given privacy now. I also pray for the parishes of Torre and Cockington.’ Davies faces one charge of assaulting a woman by beating in Torquay on November 4, and one charge of driving while over the limit in a public place.

"A driver was hurt when they skidded into a pole whilst trying to avoid protesters in Ferguson, Missouri in the first civilian casualty of the latest unrest. The unidentified motorist was trying to get round the group of 125 protesters who were blocking the street when they had the accident - and was immediately surrounded. The driver managed to get clear of his vehicle and was not seriously injured. A driver was hurt when they skidded into a pole whilst trying to avoid protesters in Ferguson, Missouri in the first civilian casualty of the latest unrest . St Louis County police said that three people were arrested after the crowd shouted that they wanted to kill the white policeman who shot dead a black teenager on August 9. The killing of Michael Brown sparked more than a week of violent protests and a militarized police response that raised deep questions over America's racial divide. On Friday MailOnline witnessed racially charged incidents on the streets that suggest the mood this time around is taking an ugly turn. At one point a black woman in her 30s who seemed to be one of organisers told the other protesters only to stop white motorists. With two white women in a white car suck in front of her she shouted: ‘Don't stop these black people, you stop these white m************.’ When one of the women pointed to her child in in the car, she said: ‘I got a baby too. You killed one of mine.’ Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, is on edge as it waits for a Grand Jury to deliver its verdict on whether to indict officer Darren Wilson, 28, who shot dead Brown, 18. The unidentified motorist was trying to get round the group of 125 protesters who were blocking the street when they had the accident - and was immediately surrounded . The decision is expected any day now and on Monday Missouri governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency with 400 members of the National Guard expected to be deployed onto the streets. Tensions are beginning to boil over and on Friday night a group of around 30 protesters marched up and down the street outside the Ferguson police station and blocked traffic. St Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman said one of them had a bullhorn and was ‘yelling profanities that included that they wanted Ferguson Police Officer Wilson ‘dead’’. Reporters had heard similar calls from the protesters the night before. The group then moved off to West Florissant Avenue, the scene of the unrest in August, where they swelled to around 160. Schellman wrote in a statement: ‘During this demonstration, a motorist on West Florissant lost control of their vehicle and crashed into a light pole at the intersection. ‘Demonstrators converged on the vehicle and a disturbance was reported.’ On Friday MailOnline witnessed racially charged incidents on the streets that suggest the mood this time around is taking an ugly turn . Pictures posted on Twitter show that the front passenger side of the car hit the pole and that the passenger side airbag was deployed. The front of the vehicle was severely dented. Jermell Hasson, one of the protesters, wrote on Twitter that the accident was the driver's fault. He wrote: ‘Hit and run in west florissant. Was not cause by Ferguson protesters. Smh they kept going’. The protesters later returned to the Ferguson police station where they blocked traffic again and three were arrested for unlawful assembly. A spokesman for the Ferguson Fire Department said they were called to attend the incident with the driver but could not get the vehicle because of the protesters.

"More than one fifth of the UK's workers will be having their office Christmas party at some point this week.

"Call centre staff working for Lloyds Banking Group were told to 'play the system' and mislead customers who contacted them with complaints about being mis-sold payment protection insurance. An undercover investigation at the group's largest PPI complaint handling centre at Royal Mint Court in London discovered that staff were told to ignore fraud and assume that PPI was never mis-sold. Workers were also allegedly coached on how to forge information onto customers' loan agreements and some were advised that customers would drop their complaint after being rejected. The latest scandal to hit the bank was unveiled after an undercover reporter from the Times newspaper went through the recruitment and training system. Call centre staff working for Lloyds were found to be forging information relating to customers' PPI complaints . A spokesman for Lloyds Banking Group conceded that there were 'issues' with the way it dealt with the scandal and said that it terminated its contract with Deloitte which operated the complaint handling centre on its behalf. 'Earlier this year we became aware of . issues at a PPI complaints handling centre called Royal Mint Court in . central London, ' the spokesman said. 'This . site was operated for us by a third party supplier, Deloitte. Following . further investigations, we took immediate action, and in May concluded . our contract with Deloitte and moved to a new supplier. Lloyds said the comments of trainers to an undercover reporter 'do not reflect' the banks standards or policies . 'Some of the comments made by trainers to The Times reporter are not endorsed by Lloyds Banking Group and we believe they do not reflect our high training standards or our policies. 'We believe the comments to be isolated and they are now being addressed. 'Following the discovery of these . issues, and under the guidance of a new supplier, the employees are . currently undergoing re-training in line with our policies and . procedures.' A spokesman for Deloitte said: 'Deloitte’s role was to process PPI mis-selling complaints from Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) customers who were sold policies by the bank, in accordance with the bank’s policies and procedures. 'We cannot, however, comment upon the specifics of this matter due to reasons of client confidentiality.' City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it is aware of the issues raised by The Times and it has been working with Lloyds since earlier this year to ensure they are resolved and customers' interests are properly considered. The FCA has previously said that it was looking into PPI firms' complaint-handling procedures and it plans to publish its findings later this summer. A statement from the FCA said: 'We expect all firms to comply with our rules and treat their customers fairly. 'Firms know that PPI complaints must be thoroughly investigated and that appropriate action, where required, is taken promptly. 'Our rules are very clear that firms are expected to learn from previous complaints. So if there are significant numbers of complaints coming in about the same thing, that is a clear warning sign that something isn't right.' Former boss Eric Daniels (left) blamed bogus claimants for pushing up the compensation bill earlier this year while current chief executive Antonio Horta-Osario apologised for the scandal describing it as 'unacceptable' PPI is the most complained-about . product the Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves disputes between . consumers and financial firms, has ever seen. It has criticised banks and insurers . for subjecting customers to 'delays and inconvenience' and has had to . deal with record numbers of complaints over the last year, which have . mainly been driven by the PPI scandal. People paid . PPI on loans they received from many high street banks including Lloyds. The payment was optional but it was found that it may have been . mis-sold because customers may never have wanted it, they were . ineligible because they were self-employed or they simply could not . afford it. Customers complained to Lloyds for compensation but were dealt with by Royal Court Mint. The latest issue is that staff were allegedly told to ignore risk of fraud, reject . complaints because 90 per cent of customers did not appeal, or to deal with complaint . even if documents are missing. Of those who did go on to appeal, 84 per cent of complaints were upheld while just 16 per cent were rejected. Lloyds said that it had terminated its contract with Deloitte which operated the complaint handling centre on its behalf . PPI . covers repayments on credit cards and loans if the holder loses his or . her job or is unable to work due to an accident or illness. To . date Lloyds Banking Group has set aside a total of £6.7 billion for PPI . redress and paid out more than £4.3 billion to 1.3 million customers. Earlier . this year disgraced former Lloyds boss Eric Daniels launched an . astonishing attack on the bank's customers, blaming bogus PPI claims for . pushing up the compensation bill. Daniels – who is widely blamed for . steering Lloyds to the brink of collapse in 2008 – said up to half of . claims on payment protection insurance policies were 'completely . illegitimate'. In a rare public appearance since retiring from the bailed-out bank almost two years ago, the American also insisted that the bank carried out 'good due diligence' on its disastrous takeover of HBOS during the financial crisis. He told the banking commission of MPs and peers he was 'deeply regretful' about customers  who were genuine victims of mis-selling, but blamed dishonest claimants for pushing up the compensation bill. And he offered no apology for the debacle, claiming PPI was 'good value for money'. He said: 'In the great majority of cases customers received a good sales process, and received a product that suited them.' However, his predecessor Antonio Horta-Osario went on to describe PPI mis-selling as 'unacceptable' becoming the first bank chief executive to apologise. The bank was fined £4.3million in February after the Financial Services Authority found it was not paying victims swiftly enough. There was one complaint every six seconds about PPI mis-selling by high street banks last year . Two million customers fed up at poor treatment from banks and insurers took their cases to the Financial Ombudsman in the past year –  a rate of one every six seconds. The service went on to investigate a record 500,000 complaints and ordered payouts to nearly 250,000 consumers. Of those complaints taken up by the Ombudsman in the financial year to April, 378,699 were about payment protection insurance. This figure was double that of the previous 12 months, according to its annual review. Chief ombudsman Natalie Ceeney said dissatisfaction had hit 'record levels'. 'People are becoming more aware of their rights and less willing to put up with poor customer service,' she said. 'Too many financial businesses still seem unable to sort out problems themselves, without the Ombudsman  having to get involved.' The high volume of complaints about PPI suggests banks are failing to clear a backlog which has built up over several years. They are struggling to process refunds for millions of consumers mis-sold policies they did not need alongside loans and credit cards. The scandal has led to an estimated bill of £15billion for lenders after they were ordered in 2010 to pay back premiums. The Ombudsman settles disputes between firms and customers, and a complaint would reach officials only after being rejected by a bank. Its annual report is another setback for banks, which have been mired in scandal since the 2008 credit crunch. Justin Modray, founder of financial advice website Candid Money, said: 'Financial giants prove time and again they're little more than shady salesmen masquerading as  pillars of society, who routinely reject complaints they're subsequently forced to settle. 'Continued financial mis-selling, coupled with an increasing willingness to complain, means the latest Ombudsman figures are sadly no surprise. 'The regulator needs to get far tougher by nipping bad practices in the bud, rather than relying on the Ombudsman to sort out the mess  further down the line.' Chief ombudsman Natalie Ceeney said dissatisfaction with banks had hit 'record levels' The report also showed a huge rise in the number of pensioners turning to the Ombudsman as a last resort. The over-65s accounted for a quarter of cases investigated – double the figure for 2011-12. However, more consumers are side-stepping claims management firms, which typically grab around 25 per cent of any compensation won. Miss Ceeney said growing numbers were 'realising they don't need to pay someone to make a complaint on  their behalf'. The Big Four banking groups still dominate complaints. RBS/NatWest, Lloyds Banking Group (including HBOS),  Barclays and HSBC accounted for 62 per cent of  complaints to the service, up from 52 per cent in the previous period. Leading institutions are still trying to recover from a string of high-profile scandals over the last year. RBS/NatWest suffered an IT system meltdown which left customers without access to their cash for weeks. Bankers at Barclays and its rivals were strongly implicated in the interest-rate rigging furore while HSBC was reprimanded for links to money laundering by Mexican drug barons. A spokesman for the British Bankers Association said: 'All banks have hired more staff to deal with complaints.' He criticised some 'unscrupulous' claims management firms for referring 'large  numbers of claims to the Ombudsman, whether there are grounds to or not'. This 'clogs up the system, meaning that people with genuine complaints don't always get the service they deserve'. If . you are thinking about ditching your bank there are plenty of incentives to move. This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are. Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promises new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit. First Direct pays . £100 to new customers who switch to its First Account.

"Tony Blair has revealed he would like to be Prime Minister again. The former Labour premier, who left Downing Street in 2007, said he would now do a better job than during his ten years in power because of what he has learned since leaving frontline politics. Mr Blair has already confessed that he would like another big job, such as the Presidency of the European Council. Tony Blair appearing on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show this weekend . Doomed Europe: When he was interviewed by Andrew Marr he said the eurozone will fail unless Germany agrees to underwrite the debts of struggling members . But this is the first time he has confessed he would like to return to No10. Mr Blair, now 59, admitted his . prospects of a comeback – which would be the first since Harold Wilson . reclaimed Downing Street in 1974 after losing a general election in 1970 . – were ‘not very likely’. But his determination to return to the . political fray is a headache for Labour leader Ed Miliband, who will be . concerned that he will be overshadowed by Mr Blair. In an interview with the London . Evening Standard: ‘I am seeing a lot of the world and I have learned an . immense amount in the past five years. ‘One of my regrets is that what I have learned in the last five years would have been so useful to me [as Prime Minister]. Because when you see how the world is . developing you get a far clearer picture of some of the issues our . country is grappling with.’ Asked directly if he would do the job again, he said: ‘Yes, sure, but it’s not likely to happen is it.’ Mr Blair also said Gordon Brown had . condemned Labour to defeat by ditching the New Labour policies that got . him elected three times. Blair, his wife Cherie and their children have their photo taken as they say goodbye to 10 Downing Street in June 2007 . He accused Mr Brown of having him . ‘forced out’ of power, saying he would have liked to have stayed in the . job but left to avoid a ‘bloody battle’ with Mr Brown’s supporters. Looking back to the day of his resignation, he said: 'I didn’t want to go but I felt that I had to. 'The only choice would have been to have fought a very bloody battle internally which I thought would damage the country as well as the party.' Mr Blair suggested that in some ways he is better equipped now to be PM than he was during his time in Downing Street. 'I have learned an immense amount in the past five years,' he said. 'One of my regrets is that what I have learned in the last five years would have been so useful to me (as prime minister). 'Because when you see how the world is developing you get a far clearer picture of some of the issues our country is grappling with.' Mr Blair said that it was 'inevitable' that Labour would go down to defeat in the 2010 general election after it became clear that, under his successor Gordon Brown, it did not know whether or not it wanted to stick to the New Labour agenda he had mapped out. Before the storm: Then Labour leader Tony Blair and his right hand,shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown during a news conference in London in 1996 . Gordon Brown with Tony Blair on stage at the special Labour leadership conference in Bridgewater Hall, Manchester when Gordon Brown took over the Labour party in 2007 . He predicted that the Liberal Democrats will struggle at the next election, scheduled for 2015, and urged Mr Miliband to stick to the centre ground. 'My advice to the Labour Party is to sort ourselves out with a strong modern policy,' said Mr Blair. 'Frankly you can’t tell what will happen, if there will be a coalition or not, but I suspect it will be far more of a two-party fight next time. 'Ed Miliband has made a conscious decision that he is going to keep the Labour Party in the centre, and that is sensible.' Despite the upheavals caused by the financial crash of 2008 - which he admits he did not foresee - Mr Blair said Labour would be wrong to shift to the left. 'My view is that you still in order to win from the Labour perspective have to have a strong alliance with business as well as the unions. 'You have got to be very much in the centre ground on things like public sector reform,” Mr Blair said. 'But I understand that some people think the financial crisis has altered everything. And the mood is against this - personally I don’t think that’s correct.'","Say he did not want to leave office in 2007 but felt he had to to avoid 'bloody battle' withing the Labour party .

As guests enter the elevator, the theme music would begin to play and the second the doors shut, Erakat, dressed as the character Raidan, the thunder god, would spring into action. He would then quickly calm down the people, though one couple that ran for their lives after seeing him as he fake choked a friend may be scarred for life.

"Veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke dismissed UKIP supporters as 'grumpy old men' Veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke has dismissed UKIP as a party full of ‘grumpy old men’ who have had ‘disappointing lives’. The former Chancellor and Home Secretary said Nigel Farage’s supporters were like a ‘mob’ – blaming the country’s woes on foreigners. Mr Clarke’s remarks are just the latest bitter attack on the insurgent eurosceptic party following the defection of backbench rebel Mark Reckless on Saturday. David Cameron accused Mr Reckless of betraying activists who worked to get his ‘fat arse’ on the Commons benches. The remarks emerged after London Mayor Boris Johnson claimed Tory MPs who left to join UKIP were the type of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners. Addressing a rally at the party's annual conference in Birmingham last night, Mr Johnson said would-be defectors were the kind of people who might inflict ‘barely credible’ injuries on themselves by ‘vacuum cleaner abuse’. Less than 24 hours later it emerged his former deputy London mayor Richard Barnes had also defected. This week’s vicious attacks on UKIP come despite the Prime Minister admitting that previous attacks on the party had been a mistake. Mr Cameron said it had been wrong to describe UKIP as a party of ‘fruitcakes and closet racists’. He added: ‘We need to show respect for people who have taken the choice to support this party. And we're going to work really hard to win them back.’ Speaking yesterday afternoon, the Tory former leadership contender David Davis told a meeting designed to address how to tackle the threat from Mr Farage that the Tories ‘should not be insulting people who vote Ukip’. But just hours later, Mr Clarke launched his assault on UKIP supporters and defectors. He said he was not ‘the slightest bit surprised’ that Mr Reckless and fellow rebel Douglas Carswell had joined Ukip. He said: ‘I could never understand why they were not members of Ukip before.’ Mr Clarke likened UKIP supporters to a racist thugs. He said in the aftermath of the great fire of London a ‘mob went through the streets beating up and hanging Frenchman despite all the rumours about a baker shop somewhere in London’. He added: ‘They were concerned it was French arsonists who caused the problem. UKIP captures the spirit of that.’ He said the insurgent party was ‘largely appealing to the disappointed elderly, the grumpy old men, people who've had a bit of a hard time in life and are a bit disappointed and think the country is going to the dogs and are susceptible to the argument it's all the fault of foreigners’. Mr Reckless, pictured with Nigel Farage, announced on Saturday that he was joining UKIP, but admits he could lose the by-election in Rochester and Strood . Douglas Carswell became the first Conservative to defect to UKIP last month, sparking speculation that up to eight MPs were considering leaving the party . He said Mr Farage had ‘absorbed the BNP vote’ and claimed there was ‘a nasty undertone’ in Mr Farage's party. The veteran Tory MP said: ‘He does attract elderly male people who have had disappointing lives.’ The Tory party conference has been rocked by recent Tory defections to UKIP which have threatened to overshadow the Conservative leadership’s planned focus on the economy. While Mr Cameron is resigned to the fact that Mr Carswell, a long-standing Eurosceptic MP, will win the by-election in Clacton, he is furious at Mr Reckless’ ‘betrayal’. Speaking at several parties and receptions held around the conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron has become increasingly animated about the way Mr Reckless relied on the support of Conservative activists to get elected. The Prime Minister argues that committed volunteers have ‘knocked on doors, stuffed envelopes, licked stamps to get his fat arse on the Commons benches, and this is how he repays them’. At another event Mr Cameron is said to have claimed that if Mr Reckless 'got off his fat arse and worked harder he wouldn't have to defect to UKIP to save his skin'. Boris Johnson's former deputy London mayor Richard Barnes defected to UKIP from the Tories today . The Tory party is expected to mount a huge effort to hold the seat, with local activists lining up to criticise Mr Reckless’ decision to change parties. Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the EU, clawing back powers from Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum in 2017. Under pressure from Eurosceptics, Mr Cameron has made clear he will not argue for Britain to remain in the EU if it is not in the national interest.","Former Chancellor  said Nigel Farage's supporters were like a 'mob'

"David Cameron today backed Sir John Major's warning that public concern about EU immigration could push Britain out of Europe. Sir John said this week that the chances of Britain leaving the EU were now 'just under 50 per cent' - and warned the prospect of 'Brexit' would grow unless Brussels agrees to accommodate British concerns about free movement. Speaking in Germany, Sir John said he wanted Britain to remain in the EU. But he said public concern about the scale of immigration, and its impact on public services, could no longer be ignored. Scroll down for video . Support: David Cameron, pictured speaking today in Canberra, said that he agreed with Sir John Major's speech, in which he warned that the UK is likely to leave the EU unless it allows restricted immigration . Asked about his predecessor's comments at a press conference in Canberra, Australia, Mr Cameron said: 'I think it was an excellent speech and I agree with what he said, particularly the point that he went to Germany to make a very clear speech about the need there is to address Britain's concerns about immigration inside the EU. 'I think it is very powerful that a former Prime Minister, a very respected British politician, with a long record of negotiating in Europe, felt it necessary to make that speech in those terms so clearly. 'It seems to me that one of the reasons he feels so strongly about this is that when countries in Europe have difficulties that need to be addressed, Europe needs to have the flexibility to address them. 'When there are problems with the French budget or countries' differing views about what power sources they should use or problems countries have with particular aspects of the EU, we need a network that is flexible enough to cope and manage on these things.

Mr Cameron was speaking alongside Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who welcomed him to the Canberra Parliament with a speech in which he hailed the UK as 'a European country with a global role'. Mr Abbott indicated that he would prefer Britain to stay in the EU. He said: 'I'm not going to offer any specific directives to other countries, or indeed to the European Union. 'Obviously, it is in all of our interests that Europe collectively is strong, effective and successful. It is in all of our interests - particularly Australia's interests - that Britain is strong, effective and successful. 'I think Britain has very much kept its own character, very much kept its freedom of action, while at the same time being a strong and effective member of Europe.

"A security screener at Los Angeles International Airport has been taken into custody after quitting his job and making threats that led officials to clear and search terminals at the airport, the FBI said in a statement on Wednesday. Nna Alpha Onuoha, 29, was arrested shortly before midnight on Tuesday east of Los Angeles in Riverside, and he remains in custody on suspicion of making threats pending additional investigation. Authorities searched Onuoha's minivan on Wednesday morning as part of the investigation, according to FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller. Scroll down for video . Ex-TSA screener Nna Alpha Onuoha, 29, has been taken into police custody after he made threatening police calls demanding that LAX should be closed . Police found several threatening notes in Onuoha's apartment including this one which alluded to today's 12th anniversary of 9/11 . Officers cleared the church parking lot where the van was parked, and a KABC-TV news helicopter showed a bomb squad robot conducting a search in and around the vehicle. Onuoha is an army vet, reports KABC-TV, who lives at a shelter for ex-soldiers in Inglewood, near LAX. A search of his otherwise empty apartment turned up a note containing unspecified threats that cited Wednesday's Sept. 11 anniversary. Additional details of the contents of the letter were not immediately provided. No harmful materials were found at the airport or the man's apartment, the FBI said. The Los Angeles Police Department Bomb Squad also inspected a package allegedly left at TSA's headquarters in the airport after he resigned from his job, and the package was addressed to another agency employee, officials said.

It was not clear early Wednesday what the incident had been. Later, a man authorities believed to be Onuoha made two phone calls to TSA saying certain airport terminals should be evacuated. During one call, the man told an employee he would be monitoring to see if authorities would evacuate the terminals as instructed. No threats were found in authorities' search of the terminals.

"It’s dog eat dog in the wild, or in the case of this video captured by a visitor to the Samburu National Reserve in Kenya, it’s a matter of crocodile or lion eats elephant. When an elephant died at the side of a lake in the African reserve, leaving enough meat to feed a multitude of animals, a group of hungry lions and a crocodile with a serious meat craving immediately clocked the easy catch. But the elephant meat wasn’t easy for either  predator to win if this video of a rare stand-off between crocodile and lion, uploaded to YouTube by Kai Banks, is to be believed. No sooner than each animal spots its ready-killed prey, the young male lion and muscular Nile crocodile, the world’s largest reptilian predator, which boasts over 30 teeth in its gargantuan jaw, begin to eye each other up. It might initially seem that the crocodile has the evolutionary upper hand, killing creatures as it has been for over 250 million years and outliving even the dinosaurs, but as two more lions join their daring companion, pinning the reptile down in the water, it starts to seem like this is anyone’s game. Face off: two of the most ferocious species in Africa prepare to duel over hard won elephant meat . A cry for help? As the trio of ferocious lions overwhelm the solitary crocodile it spreads its jaw, as if wailing . Much splashing ensues and although one lion is left with blood on its leg, the first round of fighting leaves the crocodile and cat on a level peg. It might be three against one, but this is by no means an easy ride for the lions. A massive 99 per cent of young crocodiles end up being eaten by fish, lizards and even other cannibalistic crocodiles, so the ones who end up surviving are the toughest of the tough, with a jaw so powerful it’s thought to rival that of a T-rex. Splash attack: water flies as the lions and crocodile get rowdy in the African lake . A tough tackle: the lions join their forces to pile onto the crocodile and pin down the ancient beast . An issue experienced by YouTuber Kai Banks filming this jaw-dropping scene means that the second fight is seen in a dramatic slow motion succession of still shots that see the lions slap the crocodile around the snout like house cats batting string. The reptile weakens as the lions pile onto the ancient reptile, one of them even blighting it further by biting its pointy webbed foot. As the battle concludes, the crocodile retreats, crippled and defeated. The lion who picked the fight stands water-soaked and triumphant over its weakened opponent while the rest of its pride descend to gorge on the elephant prize. Meow! the lion lashes out at its reptilian opponent's jaw, which thought to be as strong as that of a T-Rex . Eyes on the prize: a pride of lions gorge on the tough-won dead elephant that will feed them well .","A trio of lions take on a ferocious crocodile to battle for elephant meat .

"One in four Australians admit they do not do any exercise at all, despite the revelation exercise is one of the most powerful anti-depressants. Dr Tim Sharp, Chief Happiness Officer at The Happiness Institute, says millions of Australians would not only be healthier but also happier if they made exercise a crucial part of every day. People are putting their mental health at risk when they neglect to make exercise a crucial part of every day, as exercise is 'a natural drug' and a 'potent, underutilised antidepressant'. Research from The Happiness Institute and Fitness First Australia has found that more than half of all Australians do not do enough physical activity to meet the recommended guidelines from the Australian Department of Health. A third of those that admit they fail to undertake adequate physical activity say that they feel less happy. Some even reported they never feel happy. Scroll down for video . Dr Tim Sharp, Chief Happiness Officer at The Happiness Institute says millions of Australians are putting their mental health at risk when they fail to exercise adequately . Dr Sharp says exercise is just as important for the mind as it for our muscles: ‘Exercise is just as effective as an anti-depressant, if not more so because it doesn't have the negative side effects' When we exercise, the body releases endorphins which act as mood enhancers and stress busters . ‘Millions and millions of Australians are not taking advantage of the simply strategy of introducing regular exercise,’ said Dr Sharp. ‘Exercise has a profound impact.' Dr Sharp says exercise is just as important for the mind as it is for our muscles. ‘Exercise isn’t just about the body. Research shows it has a profound effect on the mind. ‘It is just as effective as an anti-depressant, if not more so because it doesn't have the negative side effects medication can have.’ Dr Sharp has provided tips for how to create 'happy habits', explaining that a positive attitude will lead to taking action in our lives, which results in happy feelings . Research from The Happiness Institute and Fitness First Australia has found that more than half of all Australians do not do enough physical activity to meet the recommended guidelines from the Australian Department of Health . On his Instagram page, Dr Sharp sends motivational messages to encourage people to have a positive attitude and take action in their lives. This message is often to get up and move . Dr Sharp says many Australians are unaware of the positive effect exercise can have, alleviating many of the psychological issues they may be dealing with. ‘As a psychologist, I’m an advocate of exercise, it does wonders,' said Dr Sharp. 'When we exercise, the body releases endorphins which lifts the mood and alleviates stress. ‘I often prescribe it to people to improve their state of mind.' ‘Exercise is a mood enhancer and a stress buster. It’s a natural drug, so to speak. ‘There is physiological evidence that when we exercise, the natural hormones and transmitters that are released counteract stress and the damage that stress can do’ 'Anyone else finds lifting weight lifts their mood?' Another motivating message from Dr Sharp's Instagram page, advocating exercise to improve one's mental health . A message from Dr Sharp: 'Exercise is the most potent and underutilised antidepressant... and it's free!' Dr Sharp argues that physical movement is ‘a potent anti-depressant’ – and an extremely underused one . Dr Sharp, who also goes by the name ‘Dr Happy’, says incorporating exercise into a person’s diet is one of those most effective, lasting ways of improving mental health and building a happy life. ‘People often think that it’s easier to take a pill. It seems like a quick fix to take a little pill to change all their problems.’ Dr Sharp argues that physical movement is ‘a potent anti-depressant’ – and an extremely underused one. ‘One of the simplest and most profound contributors to life longevity is a healthy lifestyle. ‘It’s the things we do every day that make the difference, not now and then.’ Dr Sharp says our reasons for exercising largely determine whether or not we will successfully form long-term exercise habits . Another inspiration quote from Dr Sharp (also known as 'Dr Happy'): 'Exercise... My happiness can't live without it!' Dr Sharp says being motivated to exercise to be happy will be more likely to lead to life-long habits, whereas the motivation to exercise look good largely doesn't last long . The leading expert in happiness and positive psychology says a person’s reason for exercising is often key to whether or not they succeed. Dr Sharp says those who work out for the sole reason that they want to look good are most likely to lose motivation. ‘The motivation of wanting to look good tends to not last very long,’ said Dr Sharp. ‘When I ask people why they want to exercise, it all comes down to wanting to be happier. It gives them a powerful purpose. The psychologist practices what he preaces: Dr Sharp says he regularly goes to the gym and enjoys exercising outdoors, and says it is one of the times he is happiest . ‘Effective motivations are things like being able to go outside and play with their kids, or being able to enjoy life in their 60s.’ The psychologist regularly goes to the gym and enjoys exercising outdoors, and says it is one of the times he is happiest. He says exercise is deeply personal and it is crucial that every individual finds a way to make exercise fun for themselves. ‘It we make it fun, we’re more likely to do it,’ explains Dr Sharp. ‘Whether it be adding music, working out with friends, doing a variety of goals or setting a big goal. Whatever works for you.’ Tracking your progress is also key to forming lasting habits and feeling a greater sense of achievement and happiness. ‘Watch your progress – track yourself, set goals and reward yourself,’ explains Dr Sharp. ‘Once we start to progress, we get a sense of satisfaction and pride which is linked to happiness.’ Dr Sharp says enjoying exercise is crucial, which is different for everyone.

"Most of us remember the days when we could play football and ride our bikes in the street without too much fear of anything happening more ghastly than a grazed knee. But that's not the case for the growing number of children being brought up in cities and large towns. So a group of parents in Colchester have decided to adopt an idea that will see their road closed, cars driven out of the way and children will have free reign to play. They also hope closing the road to traffic . for two hours every week will help boost community spirit and give . children a safe place to play during the summer. Parents and children in Colchester react to the news that they can close their street for two hours to allow free play from August . Road closures during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee have seen an increase in the popularity of street parties. Naomi Fuller, communications co-ordinator for Playing Out, an organisation that helps communities with similar schemes, said that Bristol was the first city to adopt the idea. Ms Fuller said: 'The main aim behind it and the way it grew was based on active play, particularly for urban children that don't live near any green space. 'Bristol was the first local authority . to make it easy for residents to apply for regular road closures for . play and brought in a new policy to enable this to happen across the . city.' Some streets carry out road closures once a week while many others do it every two weeks or once a month. She added that the idea was beneficial to children's health and got neighbours together, helping gain a sense of community. Childminder Kim Barnetson said: 'It's not just about children playing out. It's about the community reclaiming their streets and using the area not only as something you drive through but somewhere you catch up with your neighbours.' The schemes are designed for children in urban areas who don't always have access to green space . Mrs Barnetson said families wanted to continue what they had started with their Diamond Jubilee street party last summer. She said: 'It was great to see the kids out in the street going up and down on their scooters. 'One of my neighbours put a little slip through the door about a scheme in Bristol and asked if it was something I would like to set up. 'I contacted the people in Bristol and they have been really helpful with the legal stuff. We spoke to Essex County Council and said we would like to pioneer the scheme. 'We're going to be guinea pigs and if it works we can encourage others to do it and if it doesn't then at least we have tried.' The scheme was first used in Bristol two and a half years ago. Mothers Alice Ferguson and Amy Rose wanted to get to know their neighbours better. Three years later there are more than 30 streets in Bristol and beyond replicating their Playing Out sessions . The first closure in King Stephen Road will take place next month. Residents of King Stephen Road will have to inform Essex County Council when they want to close the road in advance. They will then be able to shut it to cars for two hours. Residents will act as wardens at either end of the closure. They will instruct through traffic they cannot enter as well as letting through emergency vehicles. Many people living on the street have said they will move their cars for the closure, but it is not compulsory, and people can drive down the street as long as they are going at walking speed and guided by stewards .","Streets closed to cars for children who don't have access to green space .

"Binge drinking fuelled by cheap alcohol is having a ‘huge impact’ on health services, the head of the NHS warned yesterday. Chief executive Simon Stevens said the Government needed to deal with the ‘overuse’ of alcohol urgently as it is creating problems for over-stretched A&E units. He highlighted figures showing that the average price of alcohol relative to wages has dropped by almost half since the 1980s. The head of the NHS warned the Government needed to deal with the ‘overuse’ of alcohol urgently as it is creating problems for over-stretched A&E units (file picture) Although Mr Stevens did not directly call for a minimum price for alcohol, he said ministers should ‘take a look’ at what needed to be done. The most recent NHS figures show that more than one million patients are being admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illness and injuries every year –twice as many as a decade ago. But despite the ever-growing toll on health services, the Government has so far refused to introduce minimum pricing. Ministers claim it would hit responsible drinkers but critics accuse them of ‘dancing to the tune’ of the alcohol industry. Mr Stevens refused to be drawn on whether he supports a minimum price per unit. But at a conference at the King’s Fund think-tank in London, he said the problem of alcohol abuse needs to be examined imminently. ‘Alcohol, together with sugar, is one of the debates we really need the new government to address very early,’ he said. ‘The relative price of alcohol has come down by 48 per cent between 1980 and 2010. So that is something we will want the next government to look at. ‘We want the Health Service to stand up and be counted in this debate, recognising the huge impact alcoholism and alcohol-induced emergencies have all across the NHS. ‘It is an area of concern given the impact that overuse of alcohol is having on A&E departments and emergency admissions.’ The Coalition had proposed setting a minimum price for alcohol of 40p a unit in 2012 but shelved the plans the following year. The most recent NHS figures show that more than one million patients are being admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illness and injuries every year –twice as many as a decade ago . Ministers cited lack of ‘concrete evidence’ and warned of hitting responsible, middle-class drinkers. But last year it was revealed they had held 130 meetings with members of the drinks industry since 2010, prompting claims they caved in to lobbyists. Researchers say a minimum price per unit of at least 45p could save 600 lives a year and stop 23,000-plus hospital admissions. Yesterday Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said: ‘We have tolerated excessive consumption and that is harming people. ‘The acute problems we see are people being very drunk, injuring themselves and ending up comatose. ‘It is possible to buy alcohol 24/7 and for vast numbers of the population, they have to go less than a few hundred yards. If you make it cheaper and more available, alcohol-related injury and illness will go up.’ Jackie Ballard, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, welcomed Mr Stevens’s comments and ‘support for a minimum unit price’. She said: ‘Excessive consumption is taking a heavy toll on the health of the nation and we’re all paying towards a £21billion annual bill. Hospitals are straining from the burden and police are stretched to their limits.’","NHS chief Simon Stevens says overuse of alcohol is overstretching A&E .

"Train companies and energy firms have been urged to be 'socially responsible' towards flood-hit customers hit by huge bills. David Cameron backed the idea of first class carriages being scrapped to make more room on disrupted trains for stand class ticket holders and urged power firms to consider waiving some charges for people who have been flooded out of their homes. The Prime Minister also insisted councils should not be charging residents in flood-hit areas for sandbags. Strong winds and heavy rain across the UK have caused major disruption across large parts of the rail network, including these commuters at Manchester Piccadilly . High . winds, heavy rain, fallen trees and flood waters have hit train services . across large parts of the country, with many trains cancelled or . delayed. In many areas speed restrictions have been imposed, with just a fraction of the normal number of services running. It means those trains which are running are packed with commuters and people struggling to get to work or visit friends and family. Those in standard class are forced to stand in increasingly cramped conditions, while first class carriages remain out of bounds. Now the Prime Minister has agreed to discuss lifting restrictions on first class to make travelling on Britain’s railways less uncomfortable. Mr Cameron was challenged during an interview on BBC Radio Berkshire, where he was told that just five trains an hour were running from Reading to Paddington, compared to the usual 25 services. Prime Minister David Cameron . Asked if first class carriages should be opened up to all passengers, the PM said: ‘That’s a very good suggestion which I will take that up with them. ‘I’ll discuss that with First Great Western when we have the Cobra meeting this afternoon. ‘What we need to do is recognise these are going to be very difficult times because there are only limited services that can be run. First Great Western and Network Rail are doing everything that they can.’ He also urged utility companies to consider cutting bills for people in flood-affected areas if they were unable to use their services. 'They need to be socially responsible partners to their customers and they should be considering these things, particularly if people haven’t been able to use the services,' he said. David Cameron said he would discuss scrapping first class rail restrictions at a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee . Town halls must not charge for sandbags, David Cameron said today. The Prime Minister said councils could recoup the costs from central government. Christchurch Borough Council in Dorset has been asking locals to pay £30 for a 'flood pack' of four standard sandbags and one to protect doorways. A spokesman said: 'The situation is that if an emergency is called then we will provide sandbags free of charge.' Up until the end of last week, Tewkesbury Borough Council was issuing free bags to local people - but asking them to pay for sand to go in them. A spokeswoman said it had now decided to be 'flexible' about the policy. But writing on Twitter, Mr Cameron said: 'I've told local councils they should not charge for sandbags in flood-hit areas - central government will pick up the cost.' However, Labour leader Ed Miliband called on the Prime Minister to live up to his pledge to ensure money is no object in dealing with the relief effort. 'We need the Government to turn warm words into real action - from the provision of sandbags to getting our transport infrastructure up and running, to having the necessary investment we need in flood defence,' Mr Miliband said. 'The Prime Minister made big promises this week, now he’s got to deliver on them. 'The problem has been that the Government has been too slow and inconsistent in its response.' Train services hit by the atrocious weather include those run by First Great Western, First TransPennine Express, London Midland, Northern Rail, Virgin Trains, East Coast and Northern Rail. The winds were so severe last night Virgin trains urged all customers to 'abandon travel'. Travellers already on trains were let off at the nearest station. Many travellers who were already on board trains described being stuck for several hours. Rachel Sigsworth wrote on Twitter: 'Stuck on a wobbling train in the middle of a storm! Freezing! starving! Wet foot! Send help!' Tony Hawks posted a message to say 'I am stuck on a train in the West Country. I have been on it for five hours'. And Erin Mary Elizabeth wrote: 'Seriously was stuck between Basingstoke and Fleet for ages on the train in the dark. Not fun.' First Great Western is advising passengers not to travel, but has lifted ticket restrictions across the network until tomorrow. A spokesman said: 'We recently removed first class compartments on our local commuter trains to create more space for standard class customers. 'In addition our train managers are already empowered to declassify first class carriages on our high speed trains as the need arises. 'We are re-enforcing this message between Paddington and Reading to make sure this happens when it is sensible to do so.' The service from London Paddington to Cardiff has been cancelled, but all other trains between London Paddington and Swansea are still running and will call at Cardiff Central. A half-hourly service will run between London Paddington and Bristol, while service will run every hour from London Paddington and Exeter St Davids. Trains between Worcester and London Paddington will only run between Worcester and Oxford and an hourly shuttle service will run between Oxford and Didcot Parkway . On the London to Reading route, stopping services will run every 30 minutes, while a shuttle service will run between London Paddington and Slough every hour. In the North West services run by First TransPennine Express, London Midland, Northern Rail and Virgin Trains are all affected, according to National Rail Enquiries. No trains will run between Liverpool Lime Street and Crewe until approximately 10am because of overhead wire damage near Runcorn, and replacement buses will be running. Trains between Preston and Blackpool North may be delayed by up to 20 minutes because of a problem at a level crossing. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the government had to turn warm words into action . East Coast and Northern Rail trains between Leeds and Wakefield Westgate/Doncaster will not run until at least 8am because of an overhead wire problem near Fitzwilliam, while East Coast, CrossCountry and First TransPennine Express services between Darlington and York may be delayed because of overhead wire problems between these stations. Trains between Edinburgh and Newcastle have an 80mph speed restriction, meaning delays of up to 15 minutes. In Wales storm-force winds are expected to cause further delays today. Trees on the line between Clarbeston Road and Fishguard Harbour mean no trains will be running between these stations, while trains are suspended between Llandudno Junction and Blaenau Ffestiniog because of an obstructed line. Buses will replace trains between Aberystwyth and Machynlleth until noon because power cables have been blown on to the tracks between Aberystwyth and Dovey Junction . No trains are running between Wolverhampton and Stafford because of an overhead wire problem between the stations, which is not expected to be fixed until 8.30am.","Train operator Virgin implored all customers to 'abandon travel'

"Ew! Police in Germany are hunting a busty female who stole from a chemist - by spraying staff with her breast milk. File picture . Police in Germany are hunting a busty female who stole from a chemist - by spraying staff with her breast milk. Police say the lactating bandit squirted the milk at employees to distract them so she could steal cash from the till. The woman, dubbed 'The Milk Sprayer' by police, had bought a 20 euro vacuum pump from the drugstore in the city of Darmstadt and paid for it with a 200 euro note. As the cashier gave her 180 euros in change the woman ripped open her blouse, pulled out her right breast and 'sent a stream of milk into the face of the employee,' according to police spokesman Ferdinand Derigs. 'She then moved on to the second cashier and sent an eyeful in her direction too. 'The staff and customers were frozen to pillars of salt, so unused as they were to this extrarordinary act.' The Milk Sprayer, aged between 35 and 40, struck at the pharmacy in the city's Ludwigplatz shortly before 4.30pm on Monday. Employees told how she 'exerted pressure with her fingers to spray us with milk.' Police say after the breast-attack the woman fumbled around the store feigning confusion...but after she was forced out the door, her breasts still on show, employees discovered 100 euros missing from a till. 'She created the confusion to steal,' added Derigs. 'This was a most extraordinary crime. We have never dealt with such a thing before.' The woman was described as strong, with long dark hair tied into a pony tail and she spoke in a foreign language. She left behind the breast pump that she had paid for.","Police say the bandit squirted the milk at employees to distract them .

"A hospital worker boasted on Twitter that he intended to stick pubic hair shaved from a patient on to his face to recreate the famous sideburns sported by Sir Bradley Wiggins, a disciplinary hearing has been told. Paul Nam tweeted: 'I was going to save the pubes from the first patient I shaved today and stick them on Wiggins-style', the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) was told. The operating department practitioner, who was working at United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, posted the tweet on August 1 2012 - the first of a series on the site before a member of the operating theatre team raised the alarm and Nam was suspended in September that year. Paul Nam said he wanted to use patients' pubic hair to give himself sideburns like those of cyclist Braldey Wiggins (pictured) Other tweets posted by Nam under an explicit pseudonym included 'working in gynae theatres AGAIN today. I'm seriously considering going gay!' followed by references to women's genitalia, the HCPC heard. He claimed while tweeting about one surgeon that it was 'a sort of backhanded compliment' adding that he was someone he could 'get on with in theatre'. 'I do understand how I could have seriously undermined public confidence in my profession', his earlier statement read. Nam was 'embarrassed and ashamed', adding: 'I accept that I got things badly wrong on this occasion. 'I was partly ignorant of the consequences of using something like Twitter. I felt ashamed really from day one when I was first confronted with it and suspended from the Trust. 'As far as I was concerned at the time I was just Tweeting to colleagues. Nam posted the tweets online while working at Lincoln County Hospital (pictured) Nam told the panel, 'I had worked at Lincoln County for about six years and there were incidents with procedure at the hospital that gave me a great deal of concern.' The operating department practitioner was 'effectively excluded' from team meetings and had struggled to report concerns his managers. He also posted a photograph on Twitter of the trust board and executive team with an accompanying comment 'Bunch of Vandals except top right, No, he's a complete *******'. The hearing was told he breached confidentiality by posting a photograph of an ambulance and commenting 'casualty busy as ever! I am now waiting in A&E for the victims of a light aircraft crash, will keep you posted'. He also tweeted a photograph of a theatre list showing surgeons and anaesthetists' names and procedures with the comment 'think yourself lucky your (sic) not doing my list'. Paul Nam posted the tweet about Wiggins (pictured) on August 1 2012 and was suspended a month later . Nam, who is present for the hearing in central London, has admitted posting the tweets and further admitted misconduct. His lawyer, Lee Gledhill, has told the panel hearing the allegations that it is up to them to decide whether his misconduct amounts to his fitness to practise being impaired. Elena Elia, for the HCPC, said Nam had accepted that he had posted the tweets and apologised for them in a letter he sent once an internal investigation was under way. He attributed his behaviour to 'frustration for my own predicament' including his 'limited career progression' at the trust. In relation to the Wiggns tweet, she said Nam had commented: 'There was no actual patient, it was just a joke around Wiggns' sideburns.' The HCPC was told that Nam, who began working for the trust in April 2007, resigned ahead of a disciplinary hearing in February last year. The hearing, which took place in his absence, found that, had he not resigned, he would have been dismissed, Ms Elia told the panel.","Paul Nam suspended after posting comment on Twitter in August 2012 .

"As home extensions go, it’s rather more ambitious than your average conservatory. Boasting a 16-seat cinema, squash court, casino, bar and bowling alley, this is the little corner of Las Vegas that grandfather of five Graham Wildin has built in his back garden. Perhaps unsurprisingly, planning officials don’t like the 10,000sq ft building one bit and Mr Wildin could be forced to tear it all down. The leisure-centre style complex also features a 25ft tall, three-storey doll’s house, a soft play area and indoor tennis and badminton courts. Graham Wildin is appealing the council's order to tear down the complex in his back garden which includes a bowling alley, cinema room, play area and badminton courts as he says he followed planning laws strictly . Mr Wildin, 62, says he did not think he needed permission when he started construction, and claims he built the complex 18ft into the ground to ensure it could not be seen. But council officials say the building breaches planning laws and have issued an enforcement notice ordering the millionaire accountant to return the land to its original state. He is appealing against the decision. ‘This is my family home,’ he said. ‘All my children and my grandchildren come to visit, it’s the place they all go. ‘If all this fuss hadn’t been kicked up nobody would know it was there. ‘I have spoken to all my neighbours and none are bothered. They have all written letters of support to the council.’ The 62-year-old said the centre was not bothering anyone and that he had built it for his grandchildren. He is pictured in the 16-seat cinema . Despite spending almost a year on the project, council officers told Mr Wildin to tear the structure down. The games room complete with a bar . Table tennis, badminton and tennis are among the activities Mr Wildin had in mind when building the impressive structure for his family . He began building the luxury extension at the back of his six-bedroom home in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, a year ago, and is set to finish it in only four weeks. Mr Wildin – who refuses to disclose how much the development has cost – wants his family to be able to watch a movie, play roulette and go bowling without leaving home. ‘If you look at the building from the street you can’t see it at all,’ he said. ‘You can maybe just see a fence. You’d have to be in a helicopter to see it. ‘I looked at the rules permitting development before I started. 'They are very generous rules. There are five steps that must be adhered to, and this qualified in all of those. I built it to take advantage of all those things.’ The accountant says he built the structure for his family who constantly visit his home and that no one else would even know of it . Throughout the complex's construction Mr Wildin said he followed planning rules meticulously to avoid any future disruption of the kind he is now facing. Pictured, a squash court during building work . Andy Buckmaster, whose property backs onto the complex, is the only neighbour to object to the building. He is unhappy with the height of the complex – and the clatter of the pins in the bowling alley. ‘At night, it is one of the quietest places you could live,’ he said. ‘But the other night he had a practice with his skittle alley and it sounded like it was in my house.’ Mr Wildin has purchased the bungalow next door and is planning more works on his land. The enforcement notice issued by Forest of Dean District Council states: ‘The construction of walls and the erection of a building on the area of land which has been excavated is harmful to the residential amenity of the surrounding land in terms of the overbearing impact of a physical structure and the level of impact from the uncontrolled use of the building.’ A senior planning officer said: ‘We also believe that a building such as this is not something we would be able to support with planning permission. We are looking for a workable solution.’ A spokesman for Forest of Dean District Council said: ‘The Council advised Mr Wildin of the need for planning permission and suggested he apply so that the merit of the development could be considered through the normal planning application process. ‘Mr Wildin disagreed that planning permission was necessary and continued with the development despite advice from the Council that he should cease work.’ She added that the council later decided the development was ‘unacceptable’, and that Mr Wildin then appealed against the enforcement notice. The outcome of that appeal will be decided in the coming months. She added: ‘If it is found that permission was required the inspector has the power to grant planning permission for what has been built. ‘If the inspector decides it is unacceptable they can uphold the notice requiring its removal.’ The soft play area for his five grandchildren as it was being built over the past year. Mr Wildin spent months working on the property and maintains it is not harming anyone . A state-of-the-art gym has also been installed in the complex in the complex which has taken almost a year to complete since breaking ground . In addition to a cinema room, the accountant built a games room with plush leather sofas, a table-football game and chess boards . Mr Wildin said he plans to appeal the planning committee's ruling claiming he followed planning laws meticulously while building the centre . These include, but are not limited to: . One neighbour, whose house (pictured) backs onto the sports complex, said the noise from clattering bowling pins was too loud . Workmen dug 18ft in Mr Wildin's garden to ensure the structure could not be seen by neighbours from the other side of their fencing . Mr Wildin dug out 9,000 tonnes of soil from his back garden to make room for the building and maintains that it is not imposing to neighbours . The complex's roof slopes down from fencing at the bottom of Mr Wildin's garden so that neighbours' views are not obstructed . Neighbours have written to the council in support of Mr Wildin but to no avail. A planning committee told the man he must restore his garden to its former state . The complex as it was being built over the last year. Forest of Dean officials said it had an 'overbearing impact' on surrounding properties .","Graham Wildin built the impressive entertainment complex in his garden for his five grandchildren to enjoy .

"Danny Simpson will be back at Old Trafford on Saturday but admits the place bears no resemblance to the Manchester United he once knew. The Leicester City full back is one of a number of former United players in Nigel Pearson’s squad as they attempt to do an unlikely double against the Reds. Danny Drinkwater and Matt James came through the academy ranks at Carrington and Ritchie de Laet was signed as a promising 20-year-old defender from Stoke City before all were shown the door by Sir Alex Ferguson. Danny Simpson is targeting an unlikely double against Manchester United on Saturday . While the latter is still serving a three-match ban after seeing red against Aston Villa on January 10, De Laet and Drinkwater should join Simpson in the Foxes’ starting XI. They’ll know all about the surroundings, but Simpson insists the familiarities end there given the upheaval at the club since Ferguson’s retirement in 2013. ‘There’s a few of us here but there is also a quite a lot in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘It’s special for us to go back and try and put in a performance. ‘It’s a bit different as we don’t know Louis van Gaal as it was Sir Alex so it’s good for us to go back. Simpson played with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford . ‘It’s a new manager, new ideas and new players so it will take time. He is a top class manager with top class players so I’m sure they are more than satisfied. ‘I’ve had some good results going back to Old Trafford. Hopefully we can put in a good performance and we can show desire. If we can show that again like we did in our last game against them then you never know. ‘ . That was the 5-3 demolition at the King Power Stadium back in September, after which they wobbled severely – a 13-match winless run. Leicester beat United 5-3 in the corresponding fixture at the King Power Stadium in September . But the last-gasp FA Cup win at Tottenham, coupled with an upturn in the Premier League, sees Pearson’s side travel to United in a positive manner. They are likely to come up against a youthful side, and Simpson moved to credit Van Gaal for blooding youngsters such as Tyler Blackett and James Wilson – even though his own experience was rather more difficult, leaving five years ago after earning just one Premier League stat. ‘It’s a tough first-team to break into but a lot of the young lads are getting a few minutes,’ he added. ‘I’m sure they will make the most of it and kick on and try and cement themselves as a full time first-team player. It’s a great club so good look to them.’","Danny Simpson one of a number of former Manchester United players in Nigel Pearson's Leicester squad .

"Granny Smith apples were found to contain high levels of a compound that promotes good bacteria in the gut, helping people feel fuller for longer . An apple a day keeps the doctor away, goes the saying. But a new study has found more specifically, that a Granny Smith a day could be the key to preventing obesity. The bright green, crisp variety helps people feel full,  inhibiting the urge to eat. They were found to promote friendly bacteria, which invokes the feeling of being full. The study, published in the journal Food Chemistry, revealed that the non digestible compounds in the fruit, which include fibre and polyphenols, do not get broken down by stomach acid. When they reach the colon they are fermented by bacteria in the colon which helps friendly bacteria in the gut to grow. Scientists at Washington State University tested several different varieties of apple on mice, to see which caused the most growth of friendly bacteria. Granny Smiths worked better than Golden Delicious, Gala, Braeburn and other popular varieties, they discovered. The variety, known for its slightly tart flavour, had a particularly high fibre content and compounds like polyphenols which do not break down when eaten, they reported. The team analysed mouse droppings after feeding the animals, some of which were obese, different types of fruit. They discovered the balance of bacteria in the colon of obese people is often 'disturbed' in a way that can disrupt the metabolism and make people feel hungry. It was revealed that the faeces of overweight mice that had eaten Granny Smith apples had changed and become similar to that of slim mice. The discovery could lead to future treatments for weight problems. Professor Giuliana Noratto, from Washington State University said: 'We know that, in general, apples are a good source of these non digestible compounds but there are differences in varieties. 'Results from this study will help consumers to discriminate between apple varieties that can aid in the fight against obesity. 'The non digestible compounds in the Granny Smith apples actually changed the proportions of fecal bacteria from obese mice to be similar to that of lean mice.' The discovery could help cut disorders linked to obesity, including low grade inflammation. 'What determines the balance of bacteria in our colon is the food we consume,' said Professor Noratto. Scientists at Washington State University believe the findings might help combat obesity.

"The impact climate change will have on the world's future is a subject of hot debate - some experts believe the effects will be minimal while others have predicted scenes of devastation. Now artists have imagined how London’s landmarks may change in a hundred years or more, including soldiers riding on camels at Horse Guard’s parade, futuristic flying cars above the City, a giant lily pond at Piccadilly Circus, and the Houses of Parliament marooned in water. In different scenarios, global warming have ravaged the capital in different ways, flooding the city, or conversely turning it into a barren, desert-like wasteland. Scroll down for video . London in 2100+? Artists have imagined how London’s landmarks may change, including soldiers riding on camels at Horse Guard’s parade, futuristic flying cars above the City (pictured), a giant lily pond at Piccadilly Circus, and the Houses of Parliament marooned in water . In one image, London looks noticeably more hi-tech with more skyscrapers than ever and hovering cars as well as zeppelins. The city is cramped with buildings that give off an electric glow.  As far as the eye can see there is no sign of nature. While some images depict the catastrophic effects of climate change other views, created from the perspective of The Shard skyscraper, reveal how towering buildings will change the capital’s skyline. The realistic mock-ups were created by future forecasting company GMJ and take into account approved planning applications in boroughs all over the capital. That sinking feeling: In different scenarios, global warming have ravaged the capital in different ways, flooding the West Eng  or conversely turning it into a barren desert-like wasteland. Here, Piccadilly Circus is under water, but is being put to good use with wind turbines generating power . Turning up the heat: This image suggests that London will be hotter than it is now, with soldiers on camelback rising into Horse Guard's Parade . A wash out? In a survey commissioned by The View From The Shard, around five million Londoners said they think the capital will one day be flooded, so that Westminster (pictured) might be partially under water or even a little bit like Venice - maybe politicians will commute by boat . They include more than 100 new points of interest from The View from The Shard’s North, East, South and West views, some of which are shown here. A study commissioned by The View from The Shard, found 29 per cent of Britons believe their capital will be unrecognisable by 2030. Incredibly, one in five people living in the capital think it would be better off as its own country. While more and more skyscrapers are springing up, 80 per cent of those surveyed say they are concerned about diminishing green space and 60 per cent want to see more bikes on the road instead of futuristic cars – hovering or not. Londoners predict that by 2030 free Wi-Fi will be everywhere and we will no longer use paper money, preferring mobile payment.

In an exhibition at The Shard skyscraper, visitors will be able to ‘look into the future’ using interactive ‘tellscopes’ that juxtapose images from the Museum of London’s archive stretching all the way back to Roman times, with modern day and 2030 London. A series of events over the coming week called ‘London As I See It’ will play host to architecture, engineering and literary experts who will discuss what London might look like in 30 years. ‘With the highest view over one of the best cities in the world, there is really no better place to think about what the future holds for our society,’ said Clive Stephens, CEO of The View from The Shard. Transformation in progress: A study commissioned by View From The Shard, found 29 per cent of Britons think their capital will be unrecognisable by 2030, and 38 per cent of Londoners. These are two of the skyscrapers that are planned and will alter the city's skyline. The Canaletto is pictured left and 52 Lime Street, right . Londoners like their personal space: Incredibly, one in five people living in the Capital think it would be better off as its own country. While more and more skyscrapers are springing up (those planned by 2030 are shown in this view from The Shard), 80 per cent of people in the UK want more green space and 60per cent want to see more bikes on the road instead of futuristic cars - hovering or not . GMJ said: ‘This initiative gets the public directly involved in the debate about the kind of city we want and are about to get. It shows people how the skyline will change and tells them about each project in detail. ‘For us it’s a huge task. Our aim is to add as many new and significant projects to each view. We want to use this release and launch as a ‘call out’ to developers and architects to provide us with the information we need to add more and more projects to this and the other views.’ To support the futuristic view of what the capital might look like in 2030 The View from The Shard commissioned a survey to find out how the public think London’s skyline and urban society will change over the next 15 years – and the results have been staggering. From transport and climate through to architecture and politics, the Future View from The Shard Report explored a wide range of topics and issues. Picture perfect?

"Lionel Messi could remarkably be honoured with a mid-match stoppage at the Santiago Bernabeu during El Clasico later this month. Messi is just three goals from breaking Athletic Bilbao legend Telmo Zarra's record of 251 La Liga goals and could do it during the clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona on October 25. Javier Tebas, president of Spain's professional football league, has confirmed that they are considering a tribute for Messi when he breaks the record, which may include a pause in the match in Madrid. Mundo Deportivo leads with the prospect of a tribute to Lionel Messi at the Santiago Bernabeu . Sport also discusses the prospect of a Messi tribute in front of the Real Madrid fans at the Bernabeu . Telmo Zarra's tally of 251 goals has stood since 1955 but it is now inevitable that Lionel Messi will break the record. Messi could make history before El Clasico if he scores a hat-trick in Barcelona's home match against Eibar on October 18. If he fails to score three, then he will face the mouthwatering prospect of breaking the record at the home of Barcelona's great rivals Real Madrid. Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo contemplates the prospect of a 'Messi nightmare at the Bernabeu' with Barca midfielder Xavi saying 'it would be nice' if Tebas speaks about stopping the match. Xavi also said: 'If it happens in the Clasico, it would be another stadium, another group of fans would easily recognize his achievements. He’s one of the greatest players ever so it would be a great opportunity for the Bernabeu to pay homage to him.’ Sport goes with the headline 'Messi threat Madrid' as it further discusses the prospect of the match between the two great rivals being stopped to pay homage to the Barcelona star. Tebas also features on the front page of AS after reiterating that Barcelona and Espanyol would not play in La Liga if Catalonia gains independence. The quote reads: 'According to the Law of Sport, only one non-Spanish state's clubs can play in La Liga, ad that's Andorra.'

"It's a booze-soaked hoedown that, year after year, police attempt to shut down. But the annual 'Unofficial St Patrick's Day' at the University of Illinois - which comes one week earlier than the Irish knees-up - was bigger than ever this year, with thousands of party-loving students descending on the city of Champagne for a day of beer-guzzling. The event first started in 1996 with a day of drinking to replace the real St Patrick's Day, which falls during spring break on March 17. Last year, students traveled from nine states, 15 cities and 47 colleges. This year, 14,150 people registered as attending 'Unofficial' on Facebook.

(AP Photo/The News-Gazette, Rick Danzl)  MANDATORY CREDIT . 'We've seen more people on Facebook this year saying they're coming to the event,' said Lt. Jim Clark of the Champaign police department told The News-Gazette. 'We want it to go away. All of our goals are to put an end to Unofficial.' Lt. Clark and his department started a social media campaign to try and educate students against alcohol-related crimes. They began posting warnings on Twitter about fines in an attempt to dissuade them from going overboard. However hundreds are still expected to be arrested, mostly for underage drinking.

"Sunning herself on a Miami beach and laughing with friends in the sea, Nicole Minetti appears to have forgotten that she is facing five years behind bars. The Anglo-Italian showgirl was sentenced in July for procuring and grooming prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi’s bunga bunga parties. But she seemed to have left the weight of the world behind her when she was pictured enjoying a break in the Florida coastal city over Christmas. What conviction? Nicole Minetti enjoys the sun on a Miami beach over Christmas while awaiting an appeal over her five-year prison sentence for procuring prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi's bunga bunga parties . Fun in the sun: Minetti (left) frolics in the sea with a friend. The 28-year-old acted as a Madame running a stable of more than 30 young women for the ex-Italian premier's sex parties, a court in Milan ruled . A court in Milan ruled that the 28-year-old, whose mother is British, acted as a Madam running a stable of more than 30 young women for the ex-premier’s sex parties. However, she has been allowed to walk free while she appeals the decision. Minetti, a regional councillor for Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in Milan, helped to recruit 33 female guests, who were given envelopes stuffed with 500 Euro notes and expensive gifts after the dinners at the prime minister’s luxury villa near Milan. Prosecutor Pietro Forno had told the court that Minetti acted as 'the brothel manager, paying salaries and choosing locations'. Pimp: Minetti, a regional councillor for Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in Milan, helped to recruit 33 female guests, who were given envelopes stuffed with 500 Euro notes after dinners at his luxury villa . Guilty: In a separate but related trial, Berlusconi was convicted of underage sex with Moroccan nightclub dancer Ruby the Heart Stealer, who was then just 17 years old . Files included a telephone tap transcript in which a former police officer told a friend sordid details about the bawdy parties. He said: 'Minetti was there with her chest out kissing Berlusconi continuously. It was a real whorehouse. All the girls were given rings and necklaces.' Among the young girls recruited for the erotic parties was Ruby, a then 17-year-old Moroccan-born exotic dancer whose real name is Karima El-Mahroug.

"A young graduate died when she was hit by a train after she ran on to the tracks to rescue the dog she was walking. Yasmin Jones, 22, is thought to have chased after the pet when it wriggled beneath the gates at a level crossing. The crossing had been branded ‘high risk’ because of a nearby bend in the track which makes approaching trains only visible for a matter of seconds. Scroll down for video . The 22-year-old drama graduate killed by a speeding train 'while she tried to rescue a dog' at Fisherman's level crossing in Lancashire on Wednesday has been named as Yasmin Jones (above), from Glastonbury, Somerset . The popular young woman had just graduated from Liverpool John Moores University with a 2:1 drama degree . Yasmin’s father, Nigel Jones, yesterday said she had been trying to chase her boss’s dog when it ran off and she was tragically hit by a train at Freshfield, near Liverpool. Mr Jones, from Glastonbury, Somerset, said she had just graduated from Liverpool John Moores University with a 2:1 in drama and had decided to stay on Merseyside as she had ‘fallen in love’ with the city. She had taken up a part-time job at a local pub and had offered to walk the landlady’s two dogs. He added: ‘Yasmin had taken the dogs to a nature reserve, where she had been looking for red squirrels. The dog caught sight of another dog on the other side of the line and ran. 'Without thinking Yasmin followed.’ Yesterday friends paid tribute to Miss Jones. Residents close to the incident, which occurred just before 3pm on Wednesday, said Miss Jones had been trying to rescue a dog when she was struck by a passing train. Police said her next of kin had been informed . The drama graduate, from Glastonbury, was killed at Fisherman's level crossing near Ainsdale, Lancashire . Former school friend Adam Prescott, wrote on Facebook: ‘Such a lovely kind quiet girl. I’m devastated.’ Sophie Goddard-Jones added: ‘So much love for such an outrageously outstanding human. Keep sharing the love just like she always did.’ University friend Kathryn Schofield added: ‘Still in shock and been thinking of you and your loved ones all day Yasmin Jones our beautiful DIVA!!’ A spokesman for British Transport Police confirmed the death and said the incident was not being treated as suspicious. Miss Jones' father Nigel described his daughter as 'beautiful' and said the family had been left devastated . Tributes on Facebook to the 22-year-old describe her as a 'wonderfully spirited girl who will be sadly missed' The tragedy happened at a crossing, known as Fisherman’s Path, between Freshfield and Ainsdale stations, north of Liverpool, at 3pm on Wednesday. Kanesh Saran, who works at a nearby newsagents, said: ‘People say that it’s a dangerous spot. Dogs can get underneath the gate. That’s where the problem started. She has gone through the gate to protect the dog which was on the track and then been hit. It’s very, very sad.’ It is understood that the dog also died. Network Rail graded the crossing as ‘high risk’ in its most recent inspection due to the 146 trains that pass each day and the number of people who use it. Miss Jones grew up in Glastonbury but had decided to stay living in Liverpool after graduating earlier this year . In an email from Network Rail to local councillor Nina Killen in April, a spokesman said it planned to close the crossing in the next 18 months. It added: ‘We have secured funding for a footbridge at Fisherman’s Path and if all goes to plan, it should be installed within the next 18 months.’ Mr Jones said his family had been left devastated. He added: ‘No words can describe the emptiness we feel at this time. We are comforted by the knowledge that her energy and love of life has touched the hearts of so many. Miss Jones had graduated from Liverpool's John Moores University and was thought to have been working at a nearby city centre bar called The Caledonia at the time of her death. Friends say she was a 'lovely character' ‘As a family we ask for privacy at this time so that we can try and come to terms with this awful tragedy.’ Another, Courtnie Cassidy, who is believed to be a university friend, wrote on Twitter: 'I can't believe it, such sad news. 'You were such a funny, lovely character and made our first year of uni such a laugh so many memories. 'Can't stop thinking of all the memories we shared during first year, you diva. 'Thoughts are with your loved ones. Rip Yasmin never forgotten.' Imelda Quinn added: 'Make the most of everyday, how simply life can be taken away . 'RIP Yasmin! You truly were a ray of sunshine!' And Rebecca Yoxall said: 'Reading the news about Yasmin. Such a tragedy... such a lovely girl gone far too soon #RIP.' One group, called GlastonburyBackpackers At TheCrown, also paid tribute to Miss Jones, writing on Facebook: 'Our thoughts go out to Yasmin Jones friends and family today. You were a wonderfully spirited girl and will be sadly missed. Rest in peace sweetness xx' British Transport Police, Merseyside Police and the North West Ambulance Service were called to the level crossing just before 3pm on Wednesday following reports of the incident. Officers, who are still trying to establish the exact circumstances of what happened, said her death is not being treated as suspicious. Residents near the crossing, which is close to Ainsdale's busy commuter station, said they were aware Miss Jones had been trying to rescue a dog before the tragedy. British Transport Police said the incident was not being treated as suspicious and the woman's next of kin had been informed. Services were severely disrupted in the area following the incident on Wednesday afternoon .","Young woman killed by speeding train in Lancashire named  as Yasmin Jones .

"A Darwin woman has been receiving death threats after starting a crocodile conservation group. The woman, who wants to be known only by her nickname of 'Broady', started the NT Crocodile Conservation & Protection Society last week after reports the Northern Territory government is considering a crocodile cull in response to a fatal crocodile attack earlier this month. Within 24 hours of starting the group, the mother-of-one, who works in the crocodile industry, had received five death threats via Facebook. Scroll down for video . A Darwin mother started a crocodile conservation group after part-albino crocodile, Michael Jackson, was killed for fatally attacking a fisherman earlier this month . 'Three were insinuations that I should go for a swim with the crocodiles, that sort of thing. Another guy told me if he saw me on the river he'd capsize my boat,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Broady believes the threats came from 'fishermen with bees in their bonnets' and said while they were unpleasant, she is unfazed by their comments. 'It didn't scare me, it didn't deter me, all it did was p*** me off and make me want to fight harder.' Bob Irwin, the father of Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, who gave his support to the newly-founded society, said he had received threats over the forty years he has been working in environmental conservation, but added that 'death threats or any threats of physical violence are totally out of order'. 'The problem here in Australia is, we’ve got very very few predatory animals and we don’t seem to give them the just recognition they deserve, they are really important to the health of our environment. We have to look after our predatory animals the same as we do any fluffy furry koala,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I’m just really pleased we have a group of young Australians in the Northern Territory who are prepared to get out there,' he said. Mr Irwin added that the group was 'very brave' and would 'cop a bit of flak' because 'when it comes to crocodiles you do get people with very strong views indeed.' Bob Irwin, pictured with his son Steve Irwin, has come out in support of the conservation group saying they were 'brave' for standing up to 'cowboys' Broady started the conservation group after a famous crocodile 'Michael Jackson' was shot and killed for fatally attacking a fisherman on the Adelaide River . Michael Jackson was a 4.5-metre pied leucistic crocodile, which meant he had a distinctive white head but a pigmented body . Broady was motivated to start the conservation group after a popular Northern Territory crocodile, Michael Jackson, was shot and killed for attacking a local fisherman. Tran Van Lanh, 57, was killed by the crocodile in front of his wife while fishing in the Adelaide River on August 18. After the death, the 4.5 metre crocodile, who had a distinctive white head, was killed by authorities so Mr Lanh's remains could be recovered. Broady describes Michael Jackson, who was pied leucistic, meaning he had pigmentation on his body but an albino head, as 'very dear to my heart'. 'I lived on the Adelaide River and he used to sit outside my house. I used to watch him while I did the dishes,' she said. 'He was so genetically rare, he was one in a million, he was so amazing… Generally [leucistic crocodiles] are attacked quite aggressively by other crocodiles and birds, so to get him out in the wild to the size he was, was a miracle.' Broady started a petition for Michael Jackson to be captured and have his stomach pumped, rather than be killed, and had even lined up a buyer in the U.S. willing to pay several hundred thousand dollars for the crocodile, but her campaign was unsuccessful. The society started by Broady aims to give a voice to those who are concerned about crocodile culls and trophy-hunting and she is hoping they will be able to achieve non-profit status. 'We're not out there to say all the fishermen are bad. It's about finding common ground and finding a solution that works for everyone.' 'Croc selfies', featuring people posing in front of or on top of crocodile traps in the Northern Territory have drawn strong criticism . A man fishes from on top of a crocodile trap . Chief Minister Adam Giles said the death of Mr Lanh two weeks ago was 'a sign that the density and population of crocs in the NT is becoming somewhat of an issue' and that the cabinet would consider culling as a long-term policy as well as safari hunting. 'It's not about going out and randomly killing crocs, it's about having a well-developed plan that protects the interests of the animal but also the interests of the general public,' Mr Giles said. Adam Britton, Senior Research Associate at Charles Darwin University, says that while there are significantly more crocodiles in the Northern Territory waters than there used to be, the crocodile population is merely returning to its natural levels. Saltwater crocodiles were almost driven to extinction by hunting in the 1960s and it is estimated their population dropped to about 3,000. Now, there are approximately 100,000 saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory, the result of a management program that was put in place in 1971. Mr Britton says the management program has been doing 'an excellent job' of restoring the ecological balance that was threatened by the low numbers of crocodiles and said that since they have increased in number, crocodiles have become a significant economic asset for the Northern Territory as well. Brutus, a six-metre crocodile who is missing its front foreleg, is another famous crocodile in the Adelaide River near Darwin . Brutus the crocodile pictured last month eating a shark . In the 1970s, the saltwater crocodile population dropped to 3,000 due to excessive hunting. A management program was implemented to restore their numbers, which involved protecting the species. Now there are an estimated 100,000 saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory. On average crocodiles kill one person every two years in Australia. This year, four people have died in crocodile attacks in the Northern Territory. Tran Van Lanh, 57, was killed by the crocodile in front of his wife while fishing in the Adelaide River on August 18. The remains of 22-year-old Travis Costa were found inside a saltwater crocodile in Tiwi Islands north of Darwin earlier this month. In June a 62-year-old man was snatched by a large crocodile from a boat moored in Kakadu National Park. In January a 12-year-old Aboriginal boy was killed by a crocodile while swimming with friends at a billabong in Kakadu. 'Some vocal people believe they should be curbed and the question has to be looked at very carefully... I don’t think it’s going to achieve anything close to what people are hoping it will achieve, it will reverse the progress we’ve seen with crocodiles over the last few decades. 'It will affect a significant number of people without necessarily saving any lives,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Britton added that having a large cull of crocodiles in the state would be 'folly'. 'If the NT government said: ""It's open season on crocodiles and we're going to remove 50,000 crocs from the wild"", there would be some fairly serious repercussions of the way people see Australia.' Mr Britton said that according to statistics one person is killed by crocodiles in the country every two years, but there has been a 'cluster' of deaths in recent months. As well as the crocodile attack that claimed Mr Lanh, there have been three other deaths in the Northern Territory from crocodile attacks so far this year. Earlier in August the remains of 22-year-old Travis Costa were found inside a saltwater crocodile in Tiwi Islands north of Darwin; a 62-year-old man was snatched by a large crocodile from a boat moored in Kakadu National Park in June and in January a 12-year-old Aboriginal boy was killed by a crocodile while swimming with friends, also at Kakadu. Mr Britton said it was too early to tell if the deaths were a trend or a statistical 'blip' and said it was more helpful to compare the number of crocodile fatalities in Australia with those in surrounding countries, where fatalities from crocodile attacks were much more common, despite smaller populations of the animals. Mr Britton added that while he is not in favour of a large-scale cull of the animals, he does think it is necessary to kills crocodiles who attack humans. 'I think it's an unfortunate necessity in most situations if a crocodile has killed someone, that crocodile has learned that it can successfully attack and kill someone at that location, that makes it incredibly dangerous. I would rather see that crocodile killed and removed from the system,' he said. He added that in the case of Michael Jackson it was 'unfortunate' because he was a very popular animal, but that considering he lived right next to a busy boat ramp 'it would have been madness' to let him live after he had successfully killed a human.","Darwin woman, known as 'Broady', started a crocodile conservation group .

The . duo worked together at West Ham, with Redknapp handing a 17-year-old . Ferdinand his professional debut in 1996, and both will be hoping for a . positive reunion. In signing 35-year-old Ferdinand, Redknapp is certain he is not falling into the same trap for a second time. 'We are determined not to make those mistakes again,' he said.

And Fernandes tweeted: 'This season is all about players who want to play for us. Some will move to bigger clubs most will stay some will come.' With a clothing brand, online magazine and record label, as well as working as a pundit for the BBC during the World Cup, Ferdinand has many interests that could have seen him move away from a playing career. But, with reports that Ferdinand's basic wage at QPR will be as low as £40,000 a week, Redknapp feels there are enough factors which prove his desire to continue. Experience: Ferdinand won six Premier League titles and a Champions League during his time at United . The future: Ferdinand was a big part of the BBC's coverage at the 2014 World Cup . 'The money he has come here for, he doesn't need to put himself out,' he added. 'How many championships has he won? He's been there and done everything.

"Steve McClaren leans back, puffs out his cheeks and says with a smile: ‘You’re really depressing me! I think we’ve spoken enough about that.’ The topic is England 2 Croatia 3, November 21, 2007 — the night his ambitions as national manager turned to dust. A reluctance to continue the conversation beyond a 10th question is quite understandable, but so too is the link drawn from that match to now, the day McClaren returns to the Wembley dug-out. He does so, by his own admission, a better manager leading a vibrant Derby County side into a game worth more than £130million to the victor. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Steve McClaren talk ahead of Championship play-off final . On the brink: Derby boss Steve McClaren has put his side just one win away from promotion to the Premier League . Staying dry costs: McClaren was dubbed 'Wally with the Brolly' as he watched England fail to qualify for Euro 2008 . The fact that he owes this moment to the man who is his opponent on Saturday makes the match even more fascinating. Harry Redknapp gave McClaren a coaching job at Queens Park Rangers at the start of this season that the former England manager calls ‘fantastic for me’. It saved him from trips to Tesco and afternoons gardening. It also gave him an insight into ‘the worst’ dressing room he has witnessed, with players who ‘didn’t want to be on the training field, didn’t want to play for QPR. Only Harry Redknapp could have sorted that out’. Three months later and after positive reviews from inside Loftus Road, Derby chief executive Sam Rush came calling, having dismissed Nigel Clough. The stint in west London was not pivotal to McClaren’s appointment but it helped soothe supporters initially angry at the removal of a legendary name. Friendly face: QPR boss Harry Redknapp gave McClaren a coaching job at the start of the season but the two will take on each other at Wembley . The 53-year-old unlocked the team’s potential to such an extent that Derby head into this  Championship play-off final as favourites despite bringing less experience and a significantly smaller annual wage bill (£12m v £78m). ‘It’s a fairy-tale ending to the season,’ says McClaren. ‘It will be great to see Harry, the staff and players again. I had three great months but I always had one eye on getting back into management and once this opportunity came I’d have walked here. ‘Harry and I will have a cup of tea together before the game and a big hug at the end no matter what happens.’ McClaren has been back to the scene of his darkest hour plenty of times in the past seven years, most recently for last weekend’s FA Cup final, but never to marshal a team, never with the cameras directed his way. Staying dry: McClaren uses an umbrella during an England match in 2008 . He was derided as the ‘Wally with the Brolly’ the last time as the rain fell and he stood sheltered under an umbrella watching England fail to qualify for Euro 2008. On this occasion he has been good-humoured enough to joke that he ‘won’t be taking a bloody brolly’. But he also addressed those memories with seriousness. ‘The biggest thing that hurt me that night and ever since, was the failure to qualify,’ he says. ‘It felt like I’d let the nation down. That’s what I’ve had to live with. That’s the hardest thing, nothing else peripheral, like the “Wally with the Brolly”. ‘That disappointment will not go away and still hurts, but you have to get on with life and football. To be fair I wanted to work the next day. I wanted to get back on the bike as quickly as possible. I had support from a lot of good people and I think that is what you need. All managers go through it.’ On reflection, he thinks the England job came too soon but he felt compelled to take the opportunity, having guided Middlesbrough to one League Cup and the UEFA Cup final. ‘I thought I was ready and the job finds out that you are not,’ he says. ‘I didn’t have the experience. ‘But because I was England  manager it has given me some great opportunities. I don’t think I would have gone abroad unless I had actually done that job. So it had its bad and good points.’ A title with FC Twente in Holland and a spell at Wolfsburg in Germany followed, but last summer he  was without a club, until a chat about coaching at QPR with Sportmail’s Jamie Redknapp at a dinner. Teeside spell: McClaren guided Middlesbrough to one League Cup and the UEFA Cup final during his tenure at the Riverside . Going Dutch: McClaren won the Dutch title with FC Twente in 2010 . Derby County (4-3-3): Grant; Wisdom, Buxton, Keogh, Forsyth; Bryson, Thorne, Hendrick; Ward, Martin, Russell. QPR (4-5-1): Green; Simpson, Dunne, Onuoha, Hill; Hoilett, O’Neill, Barton, Traore, Kranjcar; Austin. Kick-off: 3pm, Wembley Stadium. TV/Radio: LIVE on Sky Sports 1 and Radio 5 Live from 2pm. Referee: Lee Mason. Saturday is the first time that goal-line technology will be used in a Football League match. The Hawk-Eye system will be used for all three play-off finals. ‘He mooted the idea and said he would mention it to his dad,’ says McClaren. ‘What was the choice? Doing the gardening and Tesco’s or working.’ The atmosphere he walked into, however, was toxic. ‘After a week I remember saying to Harry, . “You’ve got a hell of a job on to turn it round”. There were many players who didn’t want to be there. I think only Harry Redknapp could have done that job, I really do. Anybody with less experience or a foreign manager would not. ‘He had zero tolerance and the club were very supportive. Many players left. After two months of hard work you could see they had a squad who’d got spirit. There’s a lot of pressure on QPR to go up, they are talking about a lot of money. Harry’s done a fantastic job.’ Most would say the job performed by McClaren in lifting a team who were 14th when he took over to third with a club-record points haul and as the division’s top scorers is rather brilliant too. Eye-catching: Under McClaren Derby are entertaining to watch and are the division's top scorers . Training is detailed and enjoyable, loan signings have been smart, and substitutions more often than not paid off. The football is attractive, and the side are youthful — Derby’s likely starting XI has an average age of 24.9. Crowds have risen from an average of 23,228 last season to 24,933 this. The buzz reminds McClaren of his time as assistant to Jim Smith in the 1990s when the pair guided Derby to promotion and then consolidated in the Premier League. ‘They were great days with Jim, I knew then what Derby County was all about,’ says McClaren. ‘Coming back we just want to create those times again.’ A cathartic win at Wembley would begin to realise those hopes. ‘I was having afternoons off school to play matches – I probably wasn’t cut out to teach really! It does seem a bit ridiculous to spend four years qualifying and then to spend not so long actually doing it.’ Friendly showdown: Redknapp and McClaren face each other for a place in the Premier League next season . But all of that has gone into the making of a manager who is already attracting interest from Premier League clubs. He is certainly more akin to a PE teacher in the technical area, preferring his tracksuit and jumper to any suave or sophisticated suits. Will he make a change for Wembley? ‘Not on the touchline,’ he insists. ‘I will lead my team out in a suit, but I’ll be putting my tracksuit on for the game. I have to get my battle gear on, don’t I?’ It seems hard to imagine this gentle giant as a general leading his troops to war, but come 3pm on Saturday, battle will commence. DERBY . 1 GEORGE THORNE, 21 . The 6ft 2in January loan signing from West Bromwich Albion has taken to the Derby midfield like it’s been his home for years. Thorne will sit as the fulcrum, break up attacks, and start moves. 2 JAKE BUXTON, 29 . From Conference football with Burton Albion in 2009 to the Premier League in 2014 would be a remarkable journey but the central defender (right) commands respect with his solid displays. 3 CHRIS MARTIN, 25 . Became the first Derby player since Dean Sturridge in 1996 to reach the 20-goal mark and now has 25 for the season. Good interplay and finishing. Not bad for a free summer transfer from Norwich. QPR . 1 JOEY BARTON, 31 . Needs no introduction. Marginalised by the club last season when he went to Marseille on loan but pulling the strings in midfield now. Can Barton be a hero? 2 NIKO KRANJCAR, 29 . Been a Wembley winner before with Portsmouth.

"Pat Robertson believes gay men are knowingly spreading the HIV virus while shaking hands with others using a special ring. The host of the 700 Club and founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network made the remarks Tuesday and said attacks are most prevalent in cities like San Francisco. Robertson said his comments were taken out of context had CBN edit them from video posted online, however footage of the former Baptist minister’s odd claims can still be viewed elsewhere on the web. Scroll down for video . Dead serious: Pat Robertson told 700 Club viewers Tuesday that gay men intentionally spread HIV using special rings that transmit the virus during a handshake . It began with a question and answer segment. A viewer named Mary wrote in wondering what to do after she discovered her church had her unknowingly ferrying a man dying of AIDS to and from Sunday school for weeks. ‘I feel deceived,’ Mary wrote. ‘What if there had been an accident?’ Robertson began by admitting his ignorance in matters of HIV transmission. Like this: Robertson demonstrates how the rings work to his co-host Terry Meeuwsen . Unconvinced: The normally pliant Meeuwsen wasn't even in full agreement and the exchange was edited from the web version of the broadcast. However, the full video can still be viewed online . ‘I used to think it was transmitted by saliva and other things,’ the 83-year-old said. ‘Now they say it may be sexual contact.’ Robertson’s advice to Mary was, ‘don’t have sex with him.’ ‘But that’s too simplistic,’ he continued, ‘There are laws now, I think the homosexual community has put these draconian laws on the books that prohibit people from discussing this particular affliction, you can tell somebody you had a heart attack, you can tell them they’ve got high blood pressure, but you can’t tell anybody you’ve got AIDS.’ This last remark and those that followed were edited from the video posted to CBN’s website and the YouTube videos of the full exchange that surfaced were promptly taken down on copyright claims. However, Huffington Post’s video of the broadcast remains viewable. ‘You know what they do in San Francisco, some in the gay community there they want to get people so if they got the stuff they’ll have a ring, you shake hands, and the ring’s got a little thing where you cut your finger,’ Robertson said. ‘Really. It’s that kind of vicious stuff, which would be the equivalent of murder.’ Robertson later claimed that what he meant was gays from ‘years ago,’, not gays today. ‘Our organization sponsored a meeting years ago in San Francisco where trained security officers warned me about shaking hands,’ he told the Atlantic Wire. ‘In those days, certain AIDS-infected activists were deliberately trying to infect people like me by virtue of rings which would cut fingers and transfer blood.’","The 700 Club host has a history of anti-gay remarks .

"Katia Zatuliveter pictured at the Immigration Appeals Directorate in London yesterday . An alleged Russian spy yesterday admitted a four-year relationship with a married Liberal Democrat MP - but denied she was a honey-trap sent to snoop on Britain. Katia Zatuliveter, 26, also had a string of affairs or 'flirtations' with other political figures including a Nato official and a Dutch diplomat. She is accused of trying to access secret defence information from Mike Hancock, for whom she worked as an aide. She admitted opening his 'private and confidential' defence select committee letters, and allegedly influenced questions he asked in Parliament. Yesterday she launched an appeal against Government efforts to deport her and insisted she was not a Russian agent. Miss Zatuliveter told a hearing that she first met Mr Hancock in 2006 when she was 21 and studying international relations at St Petersburg University. He attended a conference in the city and she was assigned to ‘chaperone’ him. On the night they met she resisted his advances after they went for a drink in the lobby of his hotel, she said. 'He told me he wanted to sleep with me. He went up to his room and he brought a CD and some money,' she said. She refused to sleep with him or take the money. 'He made it very clear from the beginning he was interested in me. He tried to kiss me. He was very charming during this time. 'I was not getting much attention from men during this period.' Later she travelled to Moscow to meet him, but told the court her intention was to practise her English before an exam and not to sleep with him. Jonathan Glasson, for the Home Office, said: ‘The real motivation was so you could develop a sexual relationship wasn’t it?’ She replied: ‘I could prepare to do an exam in St Petersburg or I could go and spend a few days with a native speaker.’ Affair: Married MP Mike Hancock had a four-year relationship with Miss Zatuliveter, it was claimed . Mr Glasson went on: ‘You knew exactly what was going to happen didn’t you, and it didn’t have anything to do with practising your English? It was to develop a relationship with Mr Hancock.’ She answered: ‘No it wasn’t.’ Their relationship began in June 2006, and that year Miss Zatuliveter moved to Britain. She said she worked part time for Mr Hancock three or four days a month and applied for, and was given, a Parliamentary pass. In 2008 she began working for him full time as a Parliamentary researcher, with access to his Parliamentary email account. She then moved in with Mr Hancock at his central London flat, where she opened weekly correspondence from the select committee including letters marked ‘private and confidential’. She said: ‘I was able to read them, but I was not interested.’ Together: Miss Zatuliveter had access to the House of Commons and to Mr Hancock's official email account . But Mr Glasson said: ‘You have been reporting from Londongrad, from the heart of British democracy, the UK Parliament. ‘You were much more than a researcher for a backbencher MP. You have ensured that the Russian Intelligence services have eyes and ears in the House of Commons, you were someone who would ensure that questions were asked in Parliament.’ He added: ‘You were pleased to be getting attention from a man who was in a powerful and influential position?’ She replied: ‘I know he is not particularly powerful, he is a back bench MP – why are you trying to portray him as a senior government minister?’ Giving evidence before a panel of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, which will rule whether she can stay in the country, Miss Zatuliveter claimed she had no idea the Portsmouth South MP was married until the end of their affair. Tribunal: The 26-year-old Russian is currently fighting deportation from Britain . But she admitted taking money from him. Lawyers for the Security Service claim she knew Mr Hancock was a womaniser and used that knowledge to get close to him. Mr Glasson said Mr Hancock was ‘potentially vulnerable’ to the Russian intelligence services because allegations of his extra-marital affairs ‘have circulated for many years’ and were published in the British press. Miss Zatuliveter denied any knowledge of this. Later, she said he told her he had an ex-girlfriend in Moscow. The court heard her role was a ‘dream job for a Russian’. Partying: Miss Zatuliveter has had affairs with several diplomats, it was claimed . The hearing was also told that Mr Hancock was chairman of the All Parliamentary Group on Russia. And it heard that Miss Zatuliveter had contact with a suspected Russian spy – given the name ‘Boris’ by the court – who has since been expelled from Britain. ‘He was a Russian intelligence officer, wasn’t he?’ Mr Glasson said. She replied: ‘That’s what I was told by MI5, so I don’t know it’s true. 'But they also said that I was, so I don’t know.’ She claimed she broke off contact with Boris on Mr Hancock’s advice after he tried to arrange a meeting with her. Miss Zatuliveter said there was ‘no truth’ in MI5’s allegation that she was an agent for the Russian intelligence services by April 2006. She added: ‘I am innocent and I don’t believe I should be deported without having done anything. 'I am legally here, I have a work permit until August 2012.’ She was served with deportation notice in December 2010. The hearing continues.","Katia Zatuliveter 'deliberately targeted womaniser Mike Hancock', says Government lawyer .

"Mental health staff have been accused of 'lamentable failures' by a coroner after they left a man alone to kill himself despite having seen a noose on a visit to his home. Bryan Jobson, 44, was visited at his home in Leeds by nurses David Bibbings and Paul Oates after being called to the house by Leeds Partnership Foundation Trust's crisis team. But Mr Jobson was found hanged the following day after the pair left him alone in the house despite his 'suicidal state of mind.' Bryan Jobson, pictured with his estranged wife Diane, was found dead a day after a visit from two mental health nurses . Wakefield Coroner's Court had heard that Mr Jobson's relationship with his wife had broken down and he had been in relationships with two men who both died in tragic circumstances. Coroner David Hinchliff said that Mr Jobson had probably been left depressed by personal tragedy, but added that his death could have been prevented had the nurses acted differently. Following a two-day inquest, Mr Hinchliff said in a narrative verdict: 'Bryan was the victim of lamentable failures of two experienced key workers from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team who, despite visiting Bryan and observing a ligature in place and Bryan's suicidal state of mind, left him alone in the house - placing the responsibility of Bryan's safety on him, which enabled him to deliberately end his life by and act of self suspension at his home address. 'Bryan Jobson's death could have been prevented then had those key workers removed the ligature and remained with Bryan, or alternatively arranged Bryan's admission to hospital, either informally or pursuant to a Section of the Mental Health Act or made immediate contact with Bryan's family to stay with him until he could be seen by the Acute Crisis Service the next day.' Following the verdict, Mr Jobson's sister Teresa McDarby, also criticised the mental health workers. She said: 'If they had done their jobs right he would have been alive the next day.' Mr Jobson had been diagnosed with an adjustment disorder and was said to be drinking heavily. Both Mr Oates and Mr Bibbings had been interviewed under police caution following Mr Jobson's death and were investigated to see if a charge of gross negligence manslaughter could be brought against them. David Bibbings (left) and Paul Oates (right) spotted a noose at Mr Jobson's house but left him alone anyway, an inquest heard . But the Crown Prosecution Service had decided against a prosecution due to a lack of evidence. Earlier in the hearing, Mr Bibbings said that he was worried that he had no legal right to remove the noose from Mr Jobson's house. He said: 'I have been told previously that we had no legal right to do things like that and that was in the forefront of my mind.' When questioned by Mr Jobson's sister, Teresa McDarby, about why the noose was left where the carers found it, he added: 'It does seem very damning but we were thinking about legal aspects of our behaviour as we do when we are in someone's home. 'That is that person's home and they own everything in it. 'I know it seems ridiculous but we do have rules to abide by, we are not happy about it.' Speaking after the verdict Mr Jobson's . sister Teresa McDarby said: 'It's good to see that see the coroner . identified the failings. 'Bryan . had presented historically as not engaging with the services so if he . is not engaging with the services why didn't they take him away that . night? 'They weren't professional, they didn't behave in a professional manner. 'If they had done their jobs right he would have been alive the next day. 'Who . knows what would have transpired but the fact is we are talking about . that day and that could have been and should have been avoided.' Dr Guy Brookes, a psychiatrist and associate medical director with the trust, gave evidence at the inquest on Monday. Coroner David Hinchliff asked Dr Brookes: 'What these two nurses did was to try and seek reassurance from Bryan that he wouldn't do anything inappropriate and he would engage with the service the next day.' Dr Brookes replied: 'Yes.' Mr Hinchliff said: 'He has set up a ligature hasn't he, which they saw?' He added: 'Would you agree with me that it was foolish in the extreme to leave a person with Bryan's history and mental health alone in his home when he has set up a ligature in the way he has, expecting him to voluntarily engage with the service the following day in the light of him being un-cooperative?' Dr Brookes said: 'I think without reducing the risk significantly, yes, I would agree with you.'","Bryan Jobson was suffering from break down of his marriage .

"The Kremlin is calling on the world's most powerful countries to urgently develop the technology and weapons systems to destroy asteroids and meteors that threaten Earth. Almost 1,200 people suffered injuries last week when an untracked lump of space rock exploded over the Urals, with the debris narrowly missing a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, with a population of 1.13 million. Hours later the closely-monitored asteroid 2012 DA14 buzzed the planet at a distance of only 17,200 miles, the closest ever known for an object of such size, equivalent to an Olympic swimming pool. Russian officials called for nations to join forces to create an early warning system to prepare for asteroid threats . Terrifying: A meteorite shower hit Russia injuring at least 100 people, including school children . The Kremlin has called for a a joint effort to detect asteroids after the Urals region was struck by falling fragments . 'Instead of fighting on Earth, people should be creating a joint system of asteroid defence,' demanded Alexei Pushkov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and chairman of the Russian foreign affairs parliamentary committee. He urged the US, Russia and China to join forces to create an Anti-Asteroid Defence System, warning this was far more urgent that the American priority of a European-based star wars defence system aimed at deterring attacks from rogue states. Deputy premier Dmitry Rogozin made clear Russia will lead an international drive for such a move. 'I have already spoken of the need for an international initiative aimed at creating an early warning system that would also prevent extraterrestrial objects from coming dangerously close to the Earth,' he said. 'Humankind must create a system to identify and neutralize objects that pose a danger to the Earth.' The disaster in the Urals - which led . to damage to hundreds of buildings from a ten ton space fireball that . had the force of a nuclear bomb - was a wake-up call to the world, which . is not ready to cope with the threat, he warned. 'Russia . and other major countries do have a system of space monitoring and . control, but it is mainly geared towards monitoring instances when . spacecraft may come dangerously close to space junk,' he said. The key task was 'not waiting for new incidents to happen but handling problems in advance'. He . called on international players to pull their efforts together instead . of 'piling up military stuff in space, aimed only at lowering our . planet's defences'. Rogozin . expressed the hope this latest incident would make 'officials think of . more important issues and look beyond the space horizon'. There . are some 1,300 space rocks on NASA's list of 'potentially hazardous . asteroids' - yet many like the one that struck Chelyabinsk were not . tracked in advance. Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact . Wake-up call: Experts said asteroid 2012 DA14 should drive nations to work together to create a warning system . Destruction: Officials later said that if an early warning system had been in place, Russia would have been able to prepare for the destruction caused by asteroid debris . The US-based B612 Foundation, which includes NASA veterans, said Friday's close encounters amount to a wake-up call. 'Of the million asteroids as large as or larger than 2012 DA14, we have only tracked less than 10,000,' said the organisation. Divers . were yesterday scouring frozen Lake Chebarkul for remnants of the . meteorite that struck on Friday with two monumental explosions, as . 20,000 emergency workers cleared up the damage from broken glass, . collapsed roofs and structural damage to buildings. Former Kremlin minister Alexander Pochinok called for a joint US, Russian and EU initiative. 'We will clearly have a need to create near-earth stations, with stronger, advanced telescopes,' he said. Shockwave: People heading to work in Chelyabinsk, Russia, heard what sounded like an explosion, saw a bright light and then felt a shockwave when a meteor soared across the sky above them . Local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk regions . 'Perhaps the calculations might show us that we can even bring nuclear weapons into orbit. It is impossible to envisage it now. It is a matter of calculations, we need to figure out what needs to be done to detect such meteorites, asteroids, to forecast them coming, to change their trajectory, to destroy them. These are tasks for physics and engineering.' Leading scientist Andrei Kokoshin stressed: 'It is high time to create a common international centre for monitoring and responding to natural threats from space. 'The UN should create a special committee within its structure to coordinate efforts.' If the meteorite had hit at a different time of day, it could have struck the UK with devastating consequences .","Deputy premier Dmitry Rogozin called for international early warning system .

"A grieving husband who hid his dead wife’s body and told police she had ‘gone on a cruise’ has been jailed for one year. David Parker, 50, of Halstead, Essex, concealed the body of his 52-year-old wife Jacky, claiming he went into shock following her sudden death. She collapsed and despite desperately trying to save her with mouth-to-mouth and chest compressions Parker could not revive her. Jailed: David Parker (left), 50, of Halstead, Essex, was asked by his wife Jacky (right), 52, to care for her at her caravan because she was suffering from flu-like symptoms . But instead of reporting the death of his estranged wife, Parker ‘cleaned up’ her body before wrapping it in a blanket and putting it under a bed at a caravan in Clacton. Chelmsford Crown Court heard Mrs Parker was last seen alive on October 31, 2013 - and Parker made a ‘distraught’ phone call to his brother four days later confessing what he had done. Police were sent to the couple’s caravan at Valley Farm Holiday Park and questioned Parker. But despite the dead body being just feet away from an officer, he believed Parker’s lie that his wife had ‘gone on a cruise’. It was only when police returned in the following days as their investigations continued that Parker confessed the truth. He was jailed for a year after admitting a charge of concealing a body and preventing a lawful burial at an earlier hearing. Visit: Police were sent to the caravan at Valley Farm Holiday Park (pictured) in Clacton and questioned Parker . The court heard that unemployed Parker had panicked when his wife died because there were two restraining orders in place preventing him from contacting her. 'There was no sinister motivation here but we are all entitled to be treated with respect in death, as in life' Judge John Dodd QC . A post mortem proved inconclusive but investigations took place to find out if the death was unlawful. Following a review of the case the Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was ‘no realistic prospect of conviction’ on either murder or manslaughter charges as there was no evidence to suggest Parker played a part in her death. In a prepared statement, read out to the court, Parker, of Halstead, Essex, said his wife had choked on her own vomit. He also admitted breaking the two restraining orders. Despite being jailed for a year, Parker will be out of custody imminently due to the amount of time he has served on remand awaiting the conclusion of the court case. Sentencing: Chelmsford Crown Court (pictured) heard Mrs Parker was last seen alive on October 31, 2013 - and Parker made a 'distraught' phone call to his brother four days later confessing what he had done . Judge John Dodd QC said: ‘There was no sinister motivation here but we are all entitled to be treated with respect in death, as in life. There is something profoundly distressing about this case.’ Robert Miric, prosecuting, told the court Parker was asked by his wife to care for her at her caravan as she was suffering from flu-like symptoms. 'We are all completely devastated by this news. Our mum will truly be missed and loved forever. We are all deeply heartbroken' Parker family . She told her husband that she was in the process of getting the restraining orders lifted.  Mr Miric said after a week Mrs Parker felt well enough to go out for a meal but the next day she was dead. Parker denied perverting the course of justice by lying to the police about the disappearance and that count was left to lie on file. After her death, Mrs Parker’s family paid tribute in a statement. They said: ‘We are all completely devastated by this news. Our mum will truly be missed and loved forever. We are all deeply heartbroken.’","David Parker concealed the body of his wife Jacky at caravan in Clacton .

"Tragedy: The heartbroken mother of Harley Pascoe, who had a heart defect, told his inquest five operations were cancelled because of a lack of hospital beds . A baby born with half a heart died at a children’s hospital after his operation was cancelled five times because of a lack of beds, an inquest heard. Harley Pascoe survived for just 12 days after he was born as the surgery was repeatedly delayed. After the operation to have a device fitted in his heart to help blood flow to his lungs was put off four times, doctors realised his condition was deteriorating. He was upgraded to the status of ‘emergency patient’ but the operation was postponed yet again. When Harley finally underwent the procedure, doctors were forced to perform it twice because he suffered a cardiac arrest on the operating table. After six hours in theatre – for a procedure which would normally take 90 minutes – Harley was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, but died hours later after suffering another cardiac arrest. He is among 13 children who have died or become seriously ill since 2008 after treatment on Ward 32, the hospital’s cardiac unit. A series of inquiries into the ward have led to allegations of neglect and mistreatment. Yesterday Harley’s mother Danielle Gatehouse, 23, said she was repeatedly told her baby was not a priority case. In a statement, the book-keeper said: ‘The day before his first scheduled operation, we were told it was not going to go ahead as they had no available beds. ‘His next operation didn’t go ahead again due to a lack of beds in the PICU. We were told he was stable and not considered an emergency.’ Family: Danielle Gatehouse and Lee Pascoe with their baby Harley who died hours after undergoing a major heart operation at the scandal-hit Bristol Royal Hospital for Children in October last year . Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court, near Bristol, heard Harley had pulmonary artesia, a congenital heart condition. Miss Gatehouse and her partner Lee Pascoe, 30, of Fraddon, Cornwall, were told he would require an operation shortly after he was born. Miss Gatehouse gave birth on September 19 at St Michael’s Hospital, Bristol. Harley, who weighed 7lb 7oz, was immediately taken to the PICU before being transferred to Ward 32 four days later. Operations were cancelled on September 26 and the three subsequent days. On September 30, Harley underwent an echocardiogram which showed the duct in his heart was closing, and he was upgraded to ‘emergency patient’ status. Despite being prepped for surgery, Harley’s parents were told it would not take place and would be re-booked for 8.30am the next day. Angry: Harley's parents said that their son was considered too healthy for emergency surgery until it was too late and he died at 12 days old . During the procedure on October 1, surgeons were forced to replace the shunt when it became blocked and Harley fell into cardiac arrest. Once the problems had been rectified, he was finally taken back on to the PICU at around 3.30pm in a stable condition. But again his condition deteriorated and at 11.27pm he suffered an ‘unexpected cardiac arrest’ and doctors were unable to revive him. The inquest heard that although the operation was deemed urgent, the delay would not have led to Harley’s death. Consultant cardiac surgeon Serban Stoica said: ‘This situation became an emergency but we thought it would be better to do it the next day.’ He added: ‘I don’t think the delay would have contributed to Harley’s death’ Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner Maria Voisin said Harley died following ‘necessary surgery’ for complex congenital heart disease. Harley’s family said they were contributing to an independent review into the hospital by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of the NHS. A spokesman for University Hospitals Bristol said: ‘We would like to repeat our sincere condolences to Harley Pascoe’s family. ‘Harley’s surgery had to be rescheduled to accommodate children needing treatment more urgently and we understand how distressing this must have been for his parents. ‘The coroner found that this did not contribute to his death.’","Doctors in Bristol said Harley Pascoe's believed case not urgent enough .

Scroll down to watch video . Jacky Goodfellow, 40, arrived home from Tesco to find an illegal immigrant on her driveway. She gave the 23-year-old Eritrean a Penguin chocolate bar and a packet of Hula Hoops to keep him busy until police arrived . Mrs Goodfellow said: 'It was really surreal. The police asked us to stop him running away. 'He was a very pleasant young man but obviously he shouldn't be here. I just felt for the guy.' Mrs Goodfellow said that she had unpacked her shopping and asked if he was hungry: 'We are all human. 'I gave him a Penguin and a packet of Hula Hoops. But he didn't know how to open the crisp packet. It was a weird afternoon.' The mother-of-six said she then sat and chatted with the young man - a science graduate in his own country - while her daughter called the police to their home in the village of Elvington, near Dover, Kent . Mrs Goodfellow said the man could speak English well, and told her that he had a degree in science and wanted to claim asylum in the UK and become a teacher. She said he told her he had come to the UK on a ferry after hiding beneath  a lorry. He said he had gone undetected by sniffer dogs at the port of Calais. After crossing the channel he said he then let go of the lorry near a field and walked to Elvington in the hope of finding a police station. The migrant claimed to have walked all the way to Calais from Africa. Her daughter, hairdresser Alice, 19, said she had been 'shocked' to see the migrant in the driveway at around 2.30pm on Monday. But she said: 'He was quite friendly, quite chilled out and just wanted help really.' Mrs Goodfellow said: 'It was really surreal. The police asked us to stop him running away.'He was a very pleasant young man but obviously he shouldn't be here.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Kent Police was called at around 2.30pm on September 29 to reports of a suspected illegal immigrant in Elvington. 'Patrols attended and will convey the man to the custody of Home Office Immigration Enforcement.' Migrants are launching ever-more-desperate attempts to reach the UK from Calais. The wave of immigrants arriving from Calais is causing 'overcrowding' issues at detention centres in the London area, so hundreds are being moved into hotels on the coast. Last week it emerged that 130 asylum seekers were staying at the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone, Kent, close to the Port of Dover. The Freight Transport Association (FTA) has called for the European Union to bring in stricter border controls to deal with what it describes as a 'worsening situation'. The incident comes just days after a suspected illegal immigrant was discovered after clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it was being driven from Calais to a suburban road in Kent . Meanwhile, more than 3,000 people have signed an e-petition demanding the UK Government help solve the problems faced by British truckers. They want fines of up to £2,000 per migrant, which are imposed on lorry drivers and hauliers if stowaways are caught hiding inside their vehicles, to be scrapped. Earlier this month, a suspected illegal immigrant was discovered after clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it drove from Calais to a suburban road in Kent. The man, believed to be in his late teens, is thought to have tied himself to the chassis of the vehicle before it entered the Channel Tunnel. He emerged after the two-hour journey as Paul Coles and his daughter, Joanne, were returning the vehicle to its owner in Ashford.","Jacky Goodfellow, 40, gave the 23-year-old Eritrean snacks as they chatted .

"In the last Prime Minister’s Questions before the Scottish referendum, David Cameron was given a stark warning. Tory grandee Sir Edward Leigh told the PM he had been 'complacent' about the risk of Scotland leaving the UK which would trigger a 'national humiliation of catastrophic proportions'. Four days later, the Westminster party leaders – and much of the London-based media – were jolted out of the assumption that the Union was safe, when a YouGov poll put the Yes campaign ahead. It triggered extraordinary panic, saw Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg rush north to campaign, and led to the offer of increased tax and spending powers to Scotland which will reshape the whole of the UK. Scroll down for video . Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft conducted a poll on the day of the referendum to break down how the country divided . Lord Ashcroft's survey found that women were more likely to vote against independence - but contrary to earlier claims, men also backed the Union . For months the No campaign had been ahead in the polls. In the year to August, Better Together had enjoyed a lead on average of 22 points. But as referendum day approached, and Alex Salmond triumphed in the second live TV debate with Alistair Darling, the polls narrowed dramatically. Late on Saturday September 6, details of a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times emerged, putting Yes on 51 per cent and No on 49 per cent. It was a huge boost for Mr Salmond, and a wake-up call for complacent politicians in Westminster. While there had been a trend of the polls narrowing, as more and more ‘undecided’ voters fell to one side or the other, it came as a huge shock. Mr Cameron cancelled Prime Minister’s Questions to fly to Scotland, where he urged voters not to use the referendum to give ‘the effing Tories a kicking’. Labour’s Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg also took to the campaign trail. But it was the dramatic revival of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown which proved to be the most significant consequence of the YouGov survey. Building up a head of steam during a series of public meetings and rallies, Mr Brown appeared to bounce the Westminster parties into a new timetable for increased powers for devolution. He announced his cross-party package of measures giving Scotland greater control over spending, welfare and taxation could be in place by the end of next month and in operation by the end of January. Now there are growing doubts about whether the package was necessary, and offered in a rush to reverse one opinion poll. Eminent elections expert Professor Michael Thrasher said: 'I doubt the Yes campaign were ever ahead.' And Andrew Hawkins, from polling firm ComRes, said: 'The move to afford Scotland greater powers looks like a knee-jerk reaction - opening a Pandora's box in Westminster that creates problems for both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband in the run-up to the General Election.' An overnight survey carried out by Lord Ashcroft reveals more details about how Scots actually voted. The poll of 2,000 people shows that the No campaign won among men (by a six-point margin) as well as women (by twelve points). It contradicts earlier surveys suggesting men were split 50:50, with women overwhelmingly against independence. Almost three quarters (73 per cent) of those aged 65 or over voted No, while 51 per cent of 16-24-year-olds back Yes, along with 59 per cent of 25-34-year-olds. Lord Ashcroft said: ‘As the recent tightening in the polls suggested, those who made up their minds late in the campaign were more likely to choose independence. Alex Salmond claimed the Scottish people were moving in their droves to the 'Yes' campaign and confidently predicted that they would back independence but only his party's supporters backed separation . The under 55s in Scotland backed independence but were out-voted by the older generation of Scots . Alex Salmond's campaign against the Union dramatically increased support for independence - but was not quite enough . ‘Two thirds of those who decided in the last few days voted Yes; No voters were much more likely than Yes supporters to say they decided more than a year ago or always knew how they would vote.’ Mr Brown’s offer of more powers to Scotland now risks overhauling th whole of the UK. In a statement in Downing Street this morning, Mr Cameron said he would use the opportunity to pursue ‘English votes for English matters’. Mr Brown said new powers could be voted on in the Commons by March next year. Alex Salmond said Scotland expected the new deal to be agreed by this date. However, Conservative and Labour MPs are at odds over how the new settlement will work, throwing the future of Scottish devolution into doubt. Mr Cameron said it was 'crucial' to give England the same powers over tax, spending and welfare as Scotland. He pledged to make this happen at the same time as devolving powers to Scotland, following his last minute pledge for further devolution during the referendum campaign. Mr Cameron said: 'The people of Scotland have spoken. It is a clear result. They have kept our country of four nations together. Like millions of other people, I am delighted.' He said it was now time for the United Kingdom 'to come together and to move forward'.","Party leaders 'panicked' after shock YouGov poll put 'Yes' campaign on 51% .

"Hate: Muslim Cleric Abu Qatada, pictured arriving home in London after being released from prison, justified attacks on British civilians, according to the dossier . Hate preacher Abu Qatada issued orders to kill British and American civilians after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to a secret MI5 report seen by The Mail on Sunday. The Security Service document has raised questions as to why Qatada – who the British Government has tried and failed to deport to Jordan – has not been put on trial in the UK for inciting murder. The report is marked ‘secret UK eyes only’ and claims Qatada is the author of a fatwa that ‘encourages Muslims to take part in jihad against the West’. The Qatada fatwa also gives religious justification to the 9/11 attacks in the US which killed 2,977 civilians. The MI5 case file on Qatada was discovered abandoned in the British ambassador’s residence in Tripoli by The Mail on Sunday after the toppling of Colonel Gaddafi last year. It says: ‘In arguing the legal case for the attacks of September 11, Abu Qatada advocates fighting jihad against America and the West. ‘However, he goes further to include not only the aggressor (the American government), but anybody associated with the aggressor (its civilians) as prospective targets.’ Qatada, who has been described as Osama Bin Laden’s right-hand man in Europe, remains on bail in London after Home Secretary Theresa May lost the latest round in her battle to deport him to Jordan, where he is wanted for his alleged roles in two bomb plots against foreigners. The court ruling – which means the extremist preacher is free to walk the streets of London for six hours a day – prompted Prime Minister David Cameron to say he was ‘completely fed up’ with the Qatada problem. MI5 says Qatada issued the fatwa about ten years ago, when he was on the run in the UK from MI5 and counter-terrorism police trying to detain him under the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. If the document had been published in this country, Qatada could be prosecuted for incitement to murder. Last night politicians involved in the long-running case and senior lawyers said they had not been told of the fatwa and called for Qatada to be prosecuted here. Jihad: The documents found in the ambassador's Tripoli residence. Qatada justifies attacks on civilians in nations allied to America . Abandoned: The documents were found in the ambassador's residence in Tripoli . Ken Macdonald QC, the former director of public prosecutions, said of the fatwa: ‘You need to establish that he actually said those words. ‘If he did say those words then you are possibly looking into an investigation for incitement to murder.’ Labour MP Keith Vaz, the chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘If Qatada has committed a crime then he should be prosecuted here. ‘I think this fatwa needs to be looked at to see if he has broken the law here. I am appalled by this.’ Labour MP Keith Vaz says he is 'appalled' by the documents but believes Qatada should be tried in Jordan . And one senior prosecution lawyer said that it was important to establish whether MI5 had shared this intelligence with the Crown Prosecution Service to properly consider a prosecution in this country. MI5 says the fatwa was issued after Qatada’s infamous decree in 1995, where he gave religious authority to the killing of women and children in Algeria by Islamists during the civil war there. That fatwa was used by the Algerian terrorist group, the GIA, to slaughter thousands of civilians, including women and children, say experts. The MI5 document says Qatada was linked to the Hamburg terror cell who went on to commit the 9/11 terrorist atrocities. The dossier says 18 video tapes of Qatada’s sermons were found in the Hamburg flat used by three of the hijackers, including ring-leader Mohammed Atta. The so-called shoe bomber Richard Reid – who tried to blow up a transatlantic airliner – was also a follower of Qatada, says the document. Last night Mr Vaz said: ‘I still believe that the best place for him to be tried is Jordan. ‘I think the Home Secretary needs to go to Jordan and ask the King to make that change in law that prevents Qatada from being deported. It is better for him to be in Jordan than be walking around in Wembley.’ Qatada was released on bail last week subject to a 16-hour-a-day curfew and other restrictions. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission, which heard the case, said Mrs May had failed to satisfy the court that Qatada would be given a fair trial. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile QC, who was the previous Government watchdog on counter-terrorism, said: ‘I deplore this fatwa. I regard Abu Qatada as an extremely undesirable resident in the United Kingdom, but we have to apply the law.’ He added that the fatwa alone may not be enough to prosecute Qatada in the UK. Pledge: Home Secretary Theresa May has vowed to send the cleric to Jordan to face trial . The Crown Prosecution Service said it was unable to comment on the alleged fatwa. A senior Whitehall source said that all information relating to Qatada had been frequently reviewed by police to see whether it was possible to prosecute him. The US State Department refused to comment about whether it had considered extraditing Qatada over allegations that he had incited the murder of American citizens. Last year The Mail on Sunday found other documents abandoned in the ambassador’s residence in Tripoli which revealed that Labour had lied over the Lockerbie disaster and had kept Libyan dissidents under house arrest in the UK at the request of Gaddafi.

"Kate Spicer, 35, has had more than her fair share of unfair dismissals by boyfriends . After 20 or so dates in six weeks, each one more heart-stoppingly exciting than the last, I was pretty sure that Ben was The One. Good-looking, with the naughtiest twinkle in his dark-brown eyes, he was also smart, stylish and, most importantly, funny. My 35-year-old head knew perfection wasn't possible, but my heart said something different. And, from the passionate nature of our relationship, I assumed he was similarly besotted with me. Naturally, I was desperate to share my good fortune, so I broached the idea that, maybe, we should make our relationship public. 'Wait a bit,' he said. Reluctantly, I agreed, even though the last thing I felt like doing was muffling my excitement like some guilty schoolgirl with a crush. A few weeks later, the big night came when he invited me to dinner with a few of his friends. I climbed the stairs to his flat with my heart in my mouth. This must be it, I thought. Inside there were two men and three girls, all a lot younger than me, and all unnervingly beautiful. Perhaps the warning signs were there when Ben introduced me as 'my friend Kate'. Dinner then proceeded with a slightly odd atmosphere, with Ben appearing to show more interest in some of his other guests than me. I went into the kitchen to talk to him as he plated up the main course. 'So, what do you think?' he said. 'Of what?' I replied. 'Of her,' he said, nodding in the direction of the dining room and the stunning girl in a tight Herve Leger bandage dress and with a veritable cascade of lush dark hair. I looked down at my flat shoes through my boyish bob. Suddenly it became devastatingly clear that this was his way of ditching me. Not for him a tearful break-up during a walk in the park, nor even a 2am phone call in which he'll pledge to be my best friend for ever. Instead, unable to do the decent thing, he invited me around to show me the reason I was being dumped. Humiliated, I tried to hold on to my dignity - but the risotto stuck in my throat and I gulped down his vintage Burgundy like it was orange squash. I've been dumped by text, during a shouting match in front of hundreds of people at a wedding, and even by a man who got his best friend to call me and tell me. But never like this. Forget 'it's not you, it's me', this was 'it's not you, it's her'. Tennis player Caroline Wozniaki in happier times with her then boyfriends, golfer Rory McIlroy . This experience (it still makes my spine shiver and fists clench two years later) came to mind as I read about Rory McIlroy's gallant way of finishing with Caroline Wozniacki, the Danish tennis player. She revealed in an interview last week how the Northern Irish golfer, the love of her life, ended their three-year relationship just days after their wedding invites had gone out. It came in a brief phone call, no longer than a couple of minutes, during which he said nothing except the wedding was off. No reasons, no remorse. He left those for the press release that he shared with the entire world a couple of hours later. Wozniacki admitted that the split last May left her 'shocked'. 'I thought at least it would be face-to-face or something, but there was nothing. It was a phone call and I didn't hear from him again,' she added. So what is it about men that they can't end relationships with manners, dignity and, yes, some emotion? Why do they think it'll be easier for the woman if they don’t show their feelings, rather than shed a tear and at least come up with a lame excuse? There are ways for men to dispatch a woman, and Rory clearly needs some practice. As does the spineless worm who dumped my sister after passionately courting her for almost six months. Literally all he said was ‘goodbye’ before walking out. No wonder she was left sobbing on my sofa for weeks. Just last weekend, several years after the event, we had a ceremonial shredding of the love letters - great sheaves of them. And, still, she kept asking, 'Why?' During her emotional outpourings, my sister was lamenting not only the end of a long relationship but the fact there wasn't a reason for the ending. The loss was bad enough but the not knowing why was worse. There must have been a why, it's just that the man - and, let's be honest, most men - found it nigh-on impossible to express it. Women need closure, while men seem able to suppress their emotions and build impenetrable walls around unfinished aspects of their lives, as if those loose ends no longer exist. I've been subjected to many crass dumpings since I first kissed a boy 30 years ago, and I've no doubt my experiences are pretty standard. There was the long-term boyfriend who finished with me as we walked towards a taxi after a party, with the words, 'This isn't working, it's over.' Then he jumped in the cab and took off. I cried for two months and felt paralysed with regret about the possible reasons for his emotional brutality. I obsessed over the fact we argued about whether to eat chips (me) or boiled potatoes (him). Was it my personality, fashion sense, family, friends, looks? The minutiae of my character was endlessly assassinated by my worst enemy - me. Russell Brand reportedly told his wife Katy Perry that he wanted a divorce by text message . After weeks of sorrow-drowning, I bumped into him. It turned out he'd got together with a mutual friend who he 'always had a thing about', but thought it was best not to tell me. He assumed he was being kind - but that's one of the things that differentiates the sexes: one man's 'kindness' is another woman's 'crass insensitivity'. I appreciate there's never a good way to end a relationship - my preferred exit strategy is to let things get so bad that I can't help but finish things - but at least I end it with some explanation. And, after three decades of experience, I've nailed the golden rules for leaving a relationship. Anything less than six months deserves at least a phone call letting them know where they stand. Anything over that - especially if the physical bond has morphed into something more serious, with thoughts about 'the future' - then a face-to-face chat is a necessity. You know the scene - TV ominously switched off, wine glass filled, together on the sofa but with little eye contact. The lines are just as familiar: 'We can still be friends'; 'This isn't about you, it's me'; 'I just think we've grown apart'; 'I'll always love you'; blah, blah, blah... These are the easy ways out but I'm not convinced they satisfy any more. Man up and dignify us with a little honesty, will you? Tell us you’ve fallen in love with someone else, that you’re bored with us, can't abide our friends or whatever. That's how to dump a woman. Make it unequivocal and honest. It gives us the chance to wipe the slate clean as soon as you've grabbed your coat and hotfooted it out of the door. How refreshing it would be not to behave like a coward, as McIlroy did, or actor Daniel Day Lewis, who sent a short note by courier to the gorgeous French actress Isabelle Adjani, whom he had been seeing for six years and was pregnant with his child. Or Russell Brand, who sent a text to his wife Katy Perry saying he wanted a divorce. Or, as one of my more honest male friends recently admitted to me, cowering under - yes, under - a car when he saw a girlfriend coming to his house in order to ask why he hadn’t called her for a week. I asked behavioural psychologist Linda Papadopoulos why men were so incapable of being respectful when dumping a woman. 'It's pretty simple,' she says. 'It's all about how comfortable you are with emotion. 'And if we must gender stereotype, lots of men are not comfortable with it. The technology age has made it even easier for them to take the path of least resistance, to disengage with minimal confrontation.' Perhaps, then, it's time we women radically changed our approach. To stop looking for reasons and to start being selfish. To be ruthless not wet, emotionless not soppy, to embrace the clean break rather than look for a made-up excuse. So my heart goes out to you, Caroline Wozniacki. You’ve had a rough time but, let's be honest, it won't take you long to find another man - and hopefully this time he'll be tall enough to allow you to wear high heels. You're only 24 and you certainly don't need my help on how to find love - but here's a little advice on what to do if it doesn't work out next time: be a man about it.","Kate has been dumped by text and in front of hundreds at a wedding .

"Defeated SNP leader Alex Salmond this morning accused Westminster of ‘tricking’ Scottish voters into rejecting separation - and suggested the country could declare independence without a referendum. He said the No campaign’s last minute promise of more powers for Holyrood had swayed voters – and accused David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband of reneging on their word. But the outgoing First Minister, who dramatically announced he was stepping down from the job on Friday, claimed holding a referendum was 'only one of a number of routes' to independence. He said despite last week’s referendum defeat the ‘writing is on the wall’ for the Union. Mr Salmond said: ‘I think the destination is pretty certain, we are only now debating the timescale and the method.’ Scroll down for video . Alex Salmond said the two million voters who rejected independence would be furious if Westminster's devolution 'vow' was broken . David Cameron finalised his surprise demand for English votes for English laws over a late-night Downing Street curry with George Osborne, it has been revealed. The Prime Minister and Chancellor tucked into the takeaway with close aides as they prepared to ‘explode a bomb on Labour territory’, a source present revealed. The ‘curry summit’ took place in Mr Osborne’s dining room in Number 11, Downing Street, as the results from the Scottish referendum came in on Thursday. Mr Cameron’s demand for English only votes in the House of Commons threatens to deny Ed Miliband a chance for an overall majority after the next election. The Labour Party currently has 41 MPs representing constituencies north of the border which would be banned from voting on any legislation only affecting England – including education and health policy. Interviewed yesterday on Sky News, Mr Salmond said: ‘There are a whole range of ways Scotland can improve its position in pursuit of Scottish independence.’ He added: ‘I think referendums are great, they have been my policy and even I have been surprised by an 85 per cent poll and the degree of public engagement, but of course for many years there was a “gradualist” attitude to independence. ‘That is to say you establish a parliament, you establish successfully more powers until you have a situation where you’re independent in all but name and then presumably you declare yourself to be independent. Many countries have proceeded through that route. ‘There is a parliamentary route where people can make their voice heard as well - so a referendum is only one of a number of routes. ‘I think it’s the best route incidentally, that’s always been my opinion but my opinion is only one of many.’ Mr Salmond's remarks came amid mounting nationalist fury over the perception that Westminster was wobbling over honouring its promise to devolve more powers to Scotland. For full interview click here. The three main Westminster party leaders made a ‘vow’ to Scottish voters that new powers over tax, welfare and spending would be transferred to Edinburgh. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there would be a vote in the Commons on the proposals by March next year. But the Prime Minister shocked Westminster on Friday morning – just hours after the result was announced – by revealing that any new devolution of powers to Scotland would have to go hand in hand with ‘English votes for English laws’. Mr Cameron’s demand sparked an angry backlash from Labour MPs – with Ed Miliband accusing the Prime Minister of playing politics with Westminster’s pledge to transfer powers to Scotland. The Prime Minister has insisted that the timetable for further devolution would be met. A Downing Street spokesman this morning said: ‘The three pro-union parties have made commitments on further powers for the Scottish Parliament and we have set out a clear timetable to do this. This Government has delivered on devolution and we will do so again in the next Parliament.’ But Mr Salmond said the Tories and Labour should have thought about their differences ‘before they made a solemn vow and pledge to the Scottish people’ and accused them of breaking their pledge. He said: ‘I don't see how they can be kept between David Cameron who says they must go in tandem with changes in England, and Ed Miliband who says they can't go in tandem with changes in England. These seem to be two irreconcilable positions from political interest at Westminster. ‘It's the people who voted No because they believed these commitments from the Westminster leadership, these are the people who are feeling most angry, most hurt, most disappointed in Scotland today. ‘The wrath of Khan will be as of nothing to the wrath of a No voter who has been gulled by the Westminster leadership.’ He said the ‘vow’ was ‘really important’ in convincing voters to reject independence. Labour leader Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of coming up with 'English votes for English laws' on the back of a 'fag packet' in an attempt to play politics with the issue of Scottish devolution . In the hours after the Scottish referendum result was announced on Friday Mr Cameron pledged to devolve more powers to Edinburgh - but said new rules introducing 'English votes for English laws' had to be established 'in tandem' David Cameron will hold a summit with Tory backbenchers over Scottish devolution at his country retreat at Chequers tomorrow. The Prime Minister has invited more than 20 of his MPs to the 16th century Buckinghamshire estate. Mr Cameron is desperate to head off a rebellion over his pledge to devolve a raft of new powers to Holyrood. He wants to win Tory support  in return for guarantees that he will introduce new laws blocking Scottish MPs from voting on English-only legislation. Mr Salmond said ‘No’ voters in last week's independence referendum were ‘tricked’ by a late vow of more devolved powers. He said: ‘I am actually not surprised they are cavilling and reneging on commitments, I am only surprised by the speed at which they are doing it. They seem to be totally shameless in these matters.’ Mr Salmond claimed that independence was now only a matter of time. He said: ‘When you have a situation where the majority of a country up to the age of 55 is already voting for independence then I think the writing is on the wall for Westminster. ‘I think the destination is pretty certain, we're only debating the timescale and the method.’ But Alistair Darling this morning insisted the pledge for more powers would be acted upon within the stated timetable. ‘The agreement reached between the three parties is non-negotiable,’ he told the Marr programme. ‘It was promised, it's got to be delivered, and anyone who welches on that will pay a very heavy price for years to come.’ Under the plans agreed by the three Westminster leaders, legislation transferring powers to Westminster would be delivered by whichever government comes into office at next year's general election. A motion to be laid before the UK parliament by the three parties on Monday sets out steps to deliver further devolution to Scotland within a tight timetable.","Salmond accuses Cameron, Clegg and Miliband of 'reneging' on election vow .

"A window cleaner is suing one of Britain's biggest ever lottery winners – over an alleged unpaid bill of £375. Steve Rix claims £56million jackpot winner Nigel Page withheld payment because a member of the cleaning team took a picture of one of his sports cars. Mr Rix, 57, says his staff spent four hours polishing mirrors, wiping down glass staircases, and cleaning swimming pool windows in Page's £5million rural eco-mansion. Window cleaner Steve Rix, 57, is suing EuroMillions winner Nigel Page, right with wife Justine,  over a £375 bill . But an hour after he left he got a call from the estate manager, Danny Baker, who told him that CCTV footage captured one of the workers photographing a McLaren sports car. Mr Rix, who earns £13,000 a year, says he apologised and ensured the image was deleted - but claims Page refused to pay due to the 'breach of privacy'. He said yesterday: 'That money is nothing to him but to me it's half a month's wages. 'To come up with such a petty reason not to pay is just ridiculous. 'He probably earns the money he owes every minute in interest. There's no reason for him not to pay up.' Nigel Page, 48, won £56million on the EuroMillions jackpot in 2010 - the UK's sixth biggest windfall. The former property maintenance worker married Justine Page, 45, shortly after the win, and they moved into the six-bedroom Cotswolds home, near Bibury, Gloucestershire. It has a swimming pool, a 25-seat cinema, and vast grounds. Mr Rix says he was asked to clean glass inside the home by Mrs Page in May, a one-off commission that took four of his workers four hours to carry out. They were followed around the property by the housemaid who told them that the glass had never been so clean. Mr Rix said he was asked to clean the house near Bibury in a one-off commission that took his team four hours . But in spite of their apparent good work, Mr Rix was told they would not be paid for their work after a 'breach of privacy'. He said recalled: 'On the way out one of the lads saw a McLaren F1 car. He hadn't seen anything like it before so he took a picture on his phone. 'After Mr Page saw the incident on CCTV he went mad and we were told they wouldn't be paying us. 'To use a reason like that is ridiculous. That car is often seen out on the public highways, driving around. 'He didn't include the registration plate or any of the house in it either. At no point were we told there were to be strictly no pictures. 'They kept refusing to pay. That money is the equivalent of a week's wages for one of my lads.' Mr Rix launched a case at the small claims court on October 2 and Page has 14 days - until October 16 - to respond. Mr Rix, who has been running Bourton Vale Window Cleaning Services for 20 years, added he has lots of rich and famous clients and none have ever acted like this before. He said: 'We do a lot of famous and rich people and we have their keys. Everything we do, we do on trust.' Nigel and Justine Page are currently out of the country and have been unavailable for comment, although a family member said it was 'unlikely' they would have anything to add. Answering the intercom at their house, the Pages' estate manager Danny Baker said: 'I don't really want to comment on this other than the fact it was a breach of security as made out when he first arrived on site.' He added it was Mr Rix's 'prerogative' to take them to court if he wished. A few months after Mr Page's massive lottery win, he was the subject of legal action from his ex-wife Wendy, who then received £2million of his winnings despite leaving him for another man ten years previously.","Steve Rix, 57, runs Bourton Vale Window Cleaning Services in Cotswolds .

"Three members of security at the Commonwealth Games have been sacked after taking a photograph with Usain Bolt. The incident occurred when the Jamaican sprinter was training beside Hampden Park ahead of his country's 4x100m relay heats on Friday night. Volunteers at the 2014 Glasgow Games have now been warned by supervisors to remain professional at all times, in light of the controversy.

"The Labour leader is expected to lambast the retailer over zero-hours contracts . High street retailer Sports Direct has snubbed remarks made by Ed Miliband over its use of zero-hour contracts. In a speech today the Labour leader condemned the firm, owned by billionaire Mike Ashley, for using 'Victorian practices' for its 20,000-strong workforce, which give no guarantee of a minimum amount of work. But the company has hit back saying it is reviewing 'core' employment procedures with a spokesman adding: 'With enemies like these, who needs friends?' according to the BBC. The rebuttal is reportedly intended to be a dig at recent poll ratings and reports that some Labour members want him to step down. Miliband told supports in central England today: 'Sports Direct has thousands of its employers on zero hours contracts, the vast majority of its workforce. 'Sports Direct has predictable turnover, it is a modern company with stores on many high streets and, judging by its success, where many people shop. But for too many of its employees, Sports Direct is a bad place to work.' Labour said more than eight out of 10 of Sports Direct's workers across its 400 UK stores were on zero hours contracts. Miliband promised that if his party wins next May's national elections, it would ban such contracts for staff who work regular hours. Sports Direct, which posted a 12 per cent rise in quarterly sales in September, told British media it was in the process of reviewing and updating its employment procedures. Last night Tories accused Mr Miliband of hypocrisy, as several Labour-run councils employ zero-hours staff. Doncaster Council, the authority in Mr Miliband's constituency, has admitted it employs 300 people on the contracts. Freedom of Information inquiries show that in 2013, Derby Council employed 1,333 people on the contracts, Gateshead 1,285 and Bury 3,418. All are run by Labour. Many of the company's 20,000 strong workforce are on zero-hours contracts despite working regular shifts . It came as a poll of business leaders found just 14 per cent trust Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls on the economy. Nearly six in ten prefer David Cameron and George Osborne. The YouGov survey, commissioned by the Conservatives, also found six in ten thought the Tories would deliver a 'strong and healthy economy for Britain' compared with just 12 per cent for Ukip. But Tory business minister Matthew Hancock said: 'Another rehashed policy from Ed Miliband can't hide the fact that he still hasn't got an economic plan … We're already tackling the abuse of zero-hours contracts – after 13 years of Labour doing absolutely nothing about it.'

"Thomas Muller may be joint leading scorer at the 2014 World Cup, but he was severely off target during a Germany training session - as one man eating lunch found to his cost. The Bayern Munich forward is on course to reclaim the Golden Boot that he won at the 2010 World Cup after scoring a hat-trick in Germany's opening 4-0 demolition of Portugal - making it eight goals in seven games for him at the tournament.

"Two men have been jailed after they beat a chef so badly that it is feared he will never get his memory back. Marcus Dawson, 20, and Aaron Warrington, 24, kicked Farhad Ghassemi, 32, in the head so hard that one of their shoes fell off in the attack in Ramsbottom, Lancashire. A witness to the attack said that at one point they saw one of the offenders take three steps back before kicking at him again. Chef Farhad Ghassemi had to have two blood clots removed from his brain following the vicious assault . Aaron Warrington (left) and Marcus Dawson (right) were jailed for their parts in the assault in which a witness said they saw one of the attackers stepping back three paces to kick him in the head with extra ferocity . Mr Ghassemi was just yards from Ramsons restaurant in Ramsbottom, near Bury, with his girlfriend's 14-year-old nephew when he met Dawson, Warrington and a group of friends. They were drunkenly staggering in the road trying to stop cars from driving past them. They banged on Mr Ghassemi's window so he got out of his car to remonstrate with them. However, he was punched to the ground where he was kicked 'like his head was a football' despite being unconscious on the pavement. They left him in a pool of blood and he was taken to hospital had two blood clots removed from his brain and suffered a fractured skull. He had to stay there for seven weeks. Dawson was jailed at Bolton Crown Court today for five years while Warrington received a sentence of three years and four months. Judge Elliott Knopf said: 'We in the courts are familiar with these acts of mindless violence committed by those who may be drunk or may be acting under the influence of drugs or may be angry or may do it for fun. Referring to a case of three teenagers who beat a tramp to death for a dare, he added: 'We are reminded of the sentence of the three lads in Liverpool yesterday for their mindless violence which resulted in the death of a man. 'It is only through sheer luck you do not stand before the courts on the offence of manslaughter. Ramsons restaurant in Ramsbottom, Bury, where Mr Ghassemi worked before the attack. It is not yet known if he will be able to return to work . 'The consequences could have been . lethal, fortunately that was not the case but you know he has suffered . very significantly and will continue to suffer from what was perpetrated . by you.' Judge Knopf added: 'Mr Ghassemi could have remained in his car but there is no reason why he should be criticised. 'He got out of the car seeking to persuade you two to let him go on his way. His reward for showing that courage to make his point which one would  expect could happen in a civilised society, was to be punched by you Warrington with such force that you hurt your own fist with the punch and Mr Ghassemi was kicked to the ground. 'It would appear his head struck the pavement and he was rendered unconscious. One would have hoped matters would be left, perhaps you may have sought medical attention but it seems that was not enough because the violence continued. A judge said Mr Ghassemi should not be criticised for getting out to remonstrate with the pair of yobs . 'You Dawson approached Mr Ghassemi when he was not moving on the pavement and kicked his head with such force that your shoe flew off. 'That was done by you and others may have been involved in kicking and punching him as he lay prone on the ground.' People nearby came to the rescue of Mr Ghassemi and Warrington and Dawson fled the scene. Dawson went to a bar nearby with one shoe missing and blood on his clothes. He said: 'I've just been in a fight and somebody got in the way. The other guy is worse than me. I'm hiding from the police.' He later claimed not to remember the attack because he had drunk so much brandy that evening. Mr Ghassemi has not been able to work since the attack in September last year because of memory loss and his state of mind. Dawson, from Greenmount, Bury, pleaded guilty to attempted grievous bodily harm and Warrington, from Ramsbottom, admitted inflicting GBH. Detective Constable Dave Looby said: 'This was a completely unprovoked attack on a man who simply wanted to remonstrate with this pair who were being a nuisance. 'There was no reason whatsoever for this to turn to violence, let alone for it to result in him receiving life-threatening injuries. All of this was played out in front of a boy who will be permanently scarred by what happened. 'Both these men now have a long time to reflect on this savage assault.'","Farhad Ghassemi may never work again after the attack .

"Steve Higgins, pictured, was awarded £1,000 in compensation from Synergy Leads Ltd. The company has yet to pay the money . A father-of-three has successfully won compensation from a phone company that bombarded him with calls about payment protection insurance. Steve Higgins, 38, is believed to be one of the first people to receive a payout from such a business after he and his wife, Gemma, 27, received almost 100 cold calls in just two months. The couple, from Northampton, told Synergy Leads Ltd that they were not eligible for a pay-out, but the calls kept coming. He decided to take action against the firm, which is registered with Companies House at an residential address in Camerton, Bath. He invoiced the company £10 per call he received, stating they were wasting his time. he gave them two weeks to reply but after not hearing anything he made a claim for a default judgement on the basis that they had not responded. A judge ruled in his favour and Synergy Leads Ltd was ordered to pay £1,000 - £940 for the calls plus £60 for making the court claim application. Little information exists on Synergy Leads Ltd. An address search shows it is based in a cottage in an idyllic part of Somerset, around seven miles out of Bath. The company's contact number is ex-directory and it does not have a website. Mr Higgins, from Nottingham, said: 'I think it sends a message to telesales companies that there's a way for customers to fight back. 'I don't think I'll get the money back to be honest. I'll go down the enforcement route and send bailiffs out to the registered address. The company's contact number is ex-directory and it does not have a website . 'It wasn't about the money - it was more about the principle and I wanted everybody to know that they don't have to stand by and allow these nuisance calls to persist in their homes. 'They were breaking the law because we were registered with the Telephone Preference Service - which means they should not have been contacting us in the first place. 'But when I tried to call them - I was just spoken too very rudely and sometimes they would even hang up on me. 'There was just no way of communicating with them and it had got to the point where it was unbearable and I felt like I had no choice but to chase it through the small claims court.' Synergy Leads was given until today to pay up, but the company has not yet done so. The company could not be contacted for comment. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'People need to know that whether it’s their phone number or address, their personal information cannot be passed around by companies with no regard whatsoever for people's privacy.

"A 23-year-old Norwegian man of Somali origin is being investigated over the bloody attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre last month. Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, 23, is believed to be one of four men pictured in CCTV footage from the mall which has been released by Kenyan authorities. Dhuhulow is believed to have links to Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, known as Ikrima, who is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group. He is believed to have left his home in Larvik, 75 miles south of Oslo, for Somalia in 2009 and taken part in the attack by the militant group, al-Shabab. Scroll down for video . Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a 23-year-old Norwegian man of Somali origin is being investigated over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre last month - a relative said he could be the one dressed in a black shirt or jacket . Brainwashed: According to one of his relatives who watched CCTV footage of shooting he may 'have been brainwashed' Former neighbour Morten Henriksen told BBC's Newsnight that one of the attackers on the video clip, in a black shirt or jacket, . could be Dhuhulow, whom he described to the programme as 'pretty . extreme'. A relative, who spoke anonymously to . the programme, said Dhuhulow had made a phone call in the summer saying he was in trouble and wanted to come . home. In total at least 67 people died in the September siege and it remains unclear how many militants were involved. Today it was revealed that two charred bodies pulled from the building in Nairobi 'highly likely' to be attackers, a Kenyan MP told the BBC. Ndung'u Gethenji, chairman of the parliamentary committee investigating the attack, also said the body of a Kenyan soldier had been recovered. Chilling: Surveillance footage has emerged of the moment a gunman shot down a shopper in the Kenyan mall attack last month . Fear: Men, women and children run for their lives as the terrorists target the shop . Target: One man cowers in front of a cashier desk, but he is immediately spotted by one of the terrorists who mercilessly shoots him at close-range and walks away . Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight an estimated  20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up as fighters for the Islamist militant group al-Shabab. 'The biggest problem is the so-called 'Generation 1.5', those who weren't born in Norway, but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures,' he said. In Norway there are now more than 100,000 Somali immigrants. Amnesty International award winner Amal Aden (pictured above) has criticised the Somali community in Oslo for being unwilling to integrate into the Norwegian society. She says she has not 'fit in' with Somalis there, including the relatives who brought her to the country when she 13. She claims that Somalis in Norway are often outcast as 'betrayers' if they try to connect with ethnic Norwegians, although she says some Somalis like herself are defiant and want to integrate into their new home. But many Somalis feel particularly vulnerable as they are not as well established as other Muslim communities such as the Pakistanis who have been there for decades. Somalia is struggling to rebuild after decades of conflict and a U.N.-backed African Union peacekeeping force is trying to drive out al Qaeda-linked Islamist rebel group al Shabaab. Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, known as Ikrima in Kenya, is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab and is believed to have spent some time in Norway. He is thought to have been a target of a SEAL raid earlier this month, although he managed to escape. Last . week, Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers . to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen was involved in the . attack on the Nairobi mall. Yesterday chilling footage emerged of the moment a terrorist mercilessly gunned down a shopper during the attack. Surveillance video from . a supermarket in the shopping centre shows the moment . terrified men, women and children ran for their lives from the . attackers. One man cowers . in front of a cashier desk, but he is immediately spotted by one of the . terrorists who shoots him at close-range and walks away. Sprawled out in a pool of blood on the shop floor, the man desperately tries to gather the strength to crawl away to safety. He drags himself up to a sitting position, but falls back on to the tiled flooring. The gunman soon returns and shows the terrified man no mercy, shooting him again. The chilling video clips obtained by the news outlet show just the first day of the bloody massacre. In another surveillance video the British four-year-old who famously told one of the terrorists that he was a 'very bad man' can be seen with his mother and six-year-old sister. His mother, a film producer, had been queuing to buy milk when the militants struck.

Hostile: A terrified teenage girl walks through the supermarket with her hands in the air. She is wearing a white top stained with blood and is being tailed by the gunman . She hid under a cold meat counter in the . Nakumatt supermarket for an hour-and-a-half with her children beneath . her before terrorists finally found them and shot her in the thigh.

Horror: Terrified shoppers run in terror as the attackers stalk them through the mall . The brazen attack by Islamic militants has underscored Kenya's value to the West in the war against terror. The Somali Islamic group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the assault and said it was in retaliation for Kenya sending troops into neighboring Somalia. The killers, who were dressed in Western clothes, ordered all Muslims to leave, before carrying out rudimentary tests to see if hostages could recite the Koran and name the mother of the Prophet Mohammed. Witnesses told how terrorists with faces hidden by Islamic scarves stormed the building, tossing grenades and spraying shoppers with AK-47s. At one point Kenyan authorities said a woman might have been involved in the attack, prompting speculation that British terrorist suspect Samantha Lewthwaite - who was married to July 7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay - might have had some connection with the attack. Dubbed the 'White Widow', Lewthwaite is known to be in East Africa and is wanted over alleged links to a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the country's coastal resorts.

"The Queen last night issued an ‘unprecedented’ plea to the nation to ‘come together’ and strive for a truly united kingdom. From Balmoral, she acknowledged the rancour of recent days but urged people to put aside their ‘strongly-held’ opinions for the sake of unity. Her statement, issued after SNP leader Alex Salmond resigned, was also a clear message to politicians trying to appease voters on both sides of the border. Scroll down for video . Queen Elizabeth today released a statement on the Scottish decision to remain in the Union . Her Majesty apparently told a well-wisher on Sunday that voters should 'think very carefully about the future' The Queen, attended a church service in Balmoral on Sunday with her family in a strong show of unity . Urging the country to come together ‘in a spirit of mutual respect and support’, she implored them to work ‘constructively for the future of Scotland and indeed all parts of this country’. The Queen made clear her own deep-seated affection for the Scots, adding: ‘My family and I will do all we can to help and support you.’ The 88-year-old monarch had resisted being drawn into the referendum debate, and senior royal sources said it was an ‘unprecedented statement for an unprecedented time in our country’s history’. Entitled ‘A Statement From Her Majesty The Queen’, and signed Elizabeth R, it read: ‘After many months of discussion, debate, and careful thought, we now know the outcome of the Referendum, and it is a result that all of us throughout the United Kingdom will respect. For many in Scotland and elsewhere today, there will be strong feelings and contrasting emotions – among family, friends and neighbours. The Queen is said to look forward to her annual retreat to Balmoral and was concerned over independence . ‘That, of course, is the nature of the robust democratic tradition we enjoy in this country. ‘But I have no doubt that these emotions will be tempered by an understanding of the feelings of others. ‘Now, as we move forward, we should remember that despite the range of views that have been expressed, we have in common an enduring love of Scotland, which is one of the things that helps to unite us all. 'Knowing the people of Scotland as I do, I have no doubt that Scots, like others throughout the United Kingdom, are able to express strongly-held opinions before coming together again in a spirit of mutual respect and support, to work constructively for the future of Scotland and indeed all parts of this country. ‘My family and I will do all we can to help and support you in this important task.’ Referring to the vote, a senior aide told the Mail last night: ‘She is head of state and this was a significant constitutional moment for the nation. It is right that the Queen should reflect and respond to that. In 1959 the Queen, right,  entertained US President Dwight Eisenhower, left, at her private retreat in Balmoral . ‘While the campaign was going on it was also right that the Queen should stay constitutionally impartial and she maintained throughout that period it was a matter for the people of Scotland.’ Last night, the Queen was due to mark the success of the Better Together campaign at the Ghillies Ball at Balmoral. Until last week, Buckingham Palace had stayed out of the referendum debate. But last Sunday the Queen uttered her first public words on the subject during a walkabout after church. They were seized on by many in the No camp as an endorsement of the Union. Speaking to wellwishers, she said: ‘I hope everybody thinks very carefully about the referendum this week.’ Constitutional experts said she chose her words carefully to maintain her neutrality on politics. Alex Salmond, pictured,  today announced his resignation claiming his time as leader 'is nearly over' The Queen is believed to have been kept fully updated as the independence vote was counted last night . The Queen, pictured here with Alex Salmond, right, was said to be privately concerned about the prospect of Scottish independence and the breakup of the United Kingdom which she pledged to govern .

Under water: The body of the plane lies submerged in water with other aircraft seen at the airport in the rear . Brave: A rescue worker looks out from the cockpit during a search for passengers . Crash: This map shows the location of the airport . The plane which crashed was owned by Lion Air, whose company motto is: We Make People Fly. It is Indonesia's largest privately-run airline company, securing the largest share of the domestic market. The operator is currently banned from flying with the European Union because of concerns over its safety levels. The . company has recently been involved in a scandal - in January last year . Indonesia's Transportation Ministry said that a number . of crew members had been found in possession of crystal meth. Their . licences were revoked. The . airline flies to major cities around Indonesia, as well as other routes . in South East Asia, taking passengers to Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia . and even Saudi Arabia. Established in 1999, the company started out using a single Boeing 737-200. Lion . Air is a low-cost carrier that holds about a 45 percent market share in . Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago that's seeing a boom in both . economic growth and air travel. Lion inked a $24 billion deal last . month to buy 234 Airbus planes, the biggest order ever for the French . aircraft maker. It also gave Boeing its largest-ever order when it . finalized a deal for 230 planes last year. The planes will be delivered . from 2014 through 2026. Many of the passengers escaped through emergency doors which opened . half way along the fuselage and made their way to the shore in . inflatable yellow dinghies. After being evacuated off the plane, they were taken to the airport terminal for treatment. Airport officials said that . several people were injured in the crash, but the extent of their . injuries were not known. Lion Air is currently banned from flying with the European Union because of concerns over its safety levels. Pictures from the scene show the . passenger jet with its distinctive red Lion name on the side lying . partially submerged in the water near rocks at the end of the runway. The . plane had broken its back - the rear section drooped further into the . water and a large split could be seen in the last portion of the jet. Other passengers milled about at the airport as police and officials . attempted to establish what had happened to cause the jet to crash into . the sea. Bali Police Chief Arif Wahyunadi said: 'All passengers and crew have been taken off the aircraft as it lies in the sea. 'They are being attended to at the airport.' Up to 45 people were taken to several different hospitals for treatment. I Made Krisna Maharta, an official with Bali's search and rescue agency, . said all of the passengers and crew were safely rescued. He . said initial reports showed there were 101 passengers and seven crew . members aboard the plane. Mr Wahyunadi said the jet had originated in the city of Bandung, . Indonesia's third largest city - a tourist attraction because of its . ancient architecture. Hurt: A passenger from the stricken airliner  receives medical treatment as she arrives at a hospital in Kedonganan, Bali . Frightening: More than 20 people were taken to three different hospitals with various injuries . Pain: Although no passengers died during the crash, many were hurt, including this man . A photo on TV One shows the plane sitting on top of the water. An official at Bali's international airport said: 'We believe all the . passengers and crew are safe. They are currently being attended to by . medical staff, police and airline officials. The . Transportation Ministry's director general of aviation, Harry Bakti . Gumay, said the plane overshot the runway and fell into the sea from a . height of about 50 meters (55 yards). The cause of the accident was . unclear, and Gumay said an investigation was under way. Accident: The plane crashed as it came into land at Ngurah Rai Airport, near Denparsar. As this image shows, its runway extends out into the sea . Disaster: Local residents stand outside the fence at Bali's international airport  after news that a plane missed the runway and crashed into the sea . Interest: Concerned local residents look towards the airport following news of the plane crash . 'We will know what happened later but it appears the aircraft . overshot the runway. Fortunately it has come down in shallow water.' Bali is a popular holiday getaway for Britons and other Europeans looking to escape the cold northern hemisphere weather. Indonesia has a bad record for air . crashes, many of the airlines using second or third hand aircraft . purchased after other countries have finished with them. Ngurah Rai Airport is Indonesia's second-busiest international airport. The airport is named after I Gusti Ngurah Rai, an Indonesian National Hero who died in November 1946.

The newspaper column – timed to coincide with Horatio’s inquest – pokes fun at his privileged background and implies his death was somehow justified. The ‘tasteless’ article, which appeared on page 2 in the ‘Troublemaker’ section and is still available online, ran under the deeply offensive headline: ‘Eton by bear? The inquest begins.’ It concludes: ‘Troublemaker has long supported campaigning for the environment. Now we have another reason to save the polar bears.’ Adrian Weale, 50, whose son was in the same year as Horatio at Eton, condemned the piece as ‘disgusting’. The writer and Army Reserve officer said: ‘That the Socialist Worker thinks the violent death of a child is a fit subject for humour indicates a level of depravity and insensitivity to the suffering of others which is surprising. ‘The paper should undoubtedly apologise to the family of Horatio and take a long hard look at their editorial process. The Socialist Worker claimed the incident was 'another reason to save the polar bears' ‘The headline was written in an inane and stupid way and using a polar bear to fuel a class war is simply ludicrous. They should not place this extreme view onto an article which deals with the tragic death of a child.’ The newspaper is the mouthpiece for the Socialist Workers Party, which describes itself as ‘possibly the largest far-left group in Britain.’ It was yesterday condemned by critics across the political spectrum. Author Bobby Friedman accused the Socialist Worker of ‘thinking it’s OK to laugh at a child dying because he went to Eton’. Broadcaster and Guardian columnist Owen Jones wrote on Twitter: ‘Horrible. This is not socialism’ The writer and musician Sean Fleming sent a message to the Socialist Worker’s official Twitter account, saying: ‘The Troublemaker piece is beyond appalling. 'As a socialist and a worker, you don’t speak for me.’ Dylan Morris wrote: ‘I know someone else who was on this trip and only JUST survived. The Socialist Worker is scum made print.’ The 'tasteless' article, which appeared on page 2 in the 'Troublemaker' section and is still available online, ran under the deeply offensive headline: '¿Eton by bear? The inquest begins' (stock picture) Stockport councillor Iain Roberts, a Liberal Democrat, said: ‘Saw the article this morning – disgusting that Socialist Worker is gleefully crowing over the death of a child. 'Was glad to see others on the Left also appalled.’ The article follows abuse Horatio’s family received on Facebook after his death in August 2011. Internet trolls created vile profiles on Facebook which mockingly ‘mourned’ the killer polar bear. A spokesman for the Socialist Worker was not immediately available for comment when contacted by the Daily Mail. A spokesman for Horatio’s parents, GP Olivia and surgeon David, said they were unable to comment on the article. Yesterday, their son’s inquest heard how Horatio was killed by an elderly bear suffering from worn-down teeth. The pain it was in would have made it ‘aggressive and unpredictable’. Horatio was killed during a £4,000 trip organised by the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES). Four others were hurt before the bear was shot dead at their camp site. Horatio, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, had recently finished his penultimate year at Eton, the prime minister’s former public school which charges more than £11,000 a term. Horatio had hoped to study medicine at university, following in the footsteps of his parents. His grandfather, Field Marshal Sir John Lyon Chapple, was head of the British Army from 1989 to 1992 and was governor of Gibraltar from 1993 to 1995. The Chapples’ local MP, John Glen, said last night: ‘I am shocked and appalled by what I have read in the Socialist Worker. ‘These vile words will appal everyone in and around Salisbury. ‘To see such vulgar words is utterly comprehensible and I hope a full apology will be forthcoming. ‘It seems focus on where Horatio went to school has provoked a reaction – and what a warped view of the world it shows.’","Horatio Chapple, 17, was dragged from his tent by 39-stone animal .

"Vaccine: An American couple have been awarded more than £600,000 by a U.S court after claiming their son developed autism as a result of the MMR jab (file picture) Parents who claim their 10-year-old boy developed autism as a result of being injected with an MMR vaccine when he was a baby have been awarded more than £600,000 in a landmark court decision in America. Saeid and Parivash Mojabi claimed that son Ryan suffered a ‘severe and debilitating injury to his brain’ after being administered with two measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations in December, 2003 and in May the following year. They said in court papers that Ryan was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The ruling comes months after a judge in Italy awarded £140,000 to an Italian couple who said their son had autism after his routine childhood MMR inoculation. The American decision - although it doesn’t lay fault for the child’s disability with the drug - fuels anti-MMR campaigners challenging the view of the majority of the medical profession that holds the vaccinations are safe. The claim was against the US government which set up a Vaccine Programme. Although a judgement rules whether or not each case is eligible for compensation and the amount - in this case against the US Health Department - it does not apportion blame. The San Jose, California, based family took their case to the US Court of Federal Claims in 2006. Under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Programme, parents can petition the US government for compensation for injuries or deaths allegedly caused by compulsory childhood vaccines. A judgement in Ryan’s case, which was first filed in 2006, was made on December 13 last year by the Office of Special Masters set up by US Congress to decide on compensation claims. The defendant in the case was the US Secretary of Health and Human Services. The damages payment takes into account the boy’s future loss of earnings because it’s unlikely he will be able to work. In statements to the court, Ryan’s grandmother Paravaneh Shah-Mohammadi and his aunt Pooran Vahabi told how the boy appeared ‘lethargic’, ‘hardly responsive to noises and people around him,’and ‘unable to hold himself upright’ after having the first MMR vaccination. Under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Programme, parents can petition the US government for compensation for injuries or deaths allegedly caused by compulsory childhood vaccines (file picture) The number of autism cases in the UK has soared over the past four decades. At the last count researchers found one in 64 British children have some kind of autistic condition. In the Eighties, only four in every 10,000 children showed any signs of autism. The Department of Health and NHS doctors insist that better diagnosis of autism and environmental factors are responsible for the dramatic rise in the number of cases and dismissed MMR vaccinations as a cause. No link between the jabs and autism has been found in the British courts. In America, nearly 5,000 families blame the MMR injection for causing their children’s autism. Boost: The case is likely to fuel the arguments of anti-MMR campaigners (file picture) In 2008, a girl called Hannah Poling was awarded £1 million damages by the US government when a court ruled that receiving nine vaccines in one day, including the MMR, had caused her autistic condition. But the court said that Hannah had an underlying cell disorder, mitochondria, which had been aggravated by the vaccinations and manifested itself as autism. In Ryan’s case, Chief Special Master Patricia Campbell-Smith decided his family was eligible for damages under the US government’s Vaccine Programme.","Saeid and Parivash Mojabi claimed their son suffered a 'severe brain injury'

"Fed up with the morning commute on the roads of Birmingham, an internet entrepreneur has come up with a novel way of getting to the office. Mike Bandar has taken advantage of the fact that the city has more canals than Venice and is paddling his way to work. The 23-year-old takes 40 minutes to cover the two-mile distance through the heart of the city, avoiding the busy traffic and not having to put up with public transport. Mike Bandar paddles his kayak two-miles to his office in Birmingham every day . He gets some funny looks as he walks through town with his 8ft craft but people are getting used to it now . Each morning, Mr Bandar carries his 8ft kayak through the Jewellery Quarter to the Fazely Canal to work at his dating website. He said: 'Every morning other people heading off to work have a good laugh at me as I walk down the street with my kayak under my arm. 'But those looks quickly turn to admiration from the walkers and cyclists when they see me kayaking down the canal. 'Walking or cycling the canals simply does not compare to kayaking in terms of how enjoyable an experience it is. 'All day I'm usually on my phone or answering emails, but on the kayak it's total switch-off time. Luckily for me I haven't fallen in yet.' Mr Bandar explained how he originally came up with the idea to take to the water while on his way to work at Birmingham Science Park. Mr Bandar says he likes to set himself a different challenge every month and for August he wants to kayak to work . He said that kayaking the route is better than walking or cycling and it gives him time to switch off . 'I live by challenging myself to do something new each and every month for 30 days,' said Mr Bandar. 'This ranges from 30 days of mediation, to learning French for this time to eating meat - despite me being a veggie. 'So a month ago I was looking for my . latest challenge and decided that travelling to work by kayak would be . the perfect new thing for me to do.' The Birmingham Canal Navigations network is 100 miles long in total, while Venice has just 26-miles.

"A child sex abuse victim of an Australian man at the centre of a surrogacy storm says pedophiles shouldn't have children and she's disgusted he has a baby daughter. David Farnell was placed in the international spotlight after a Thailand surrogate mother alleged he and his wife abandoned his Down Syndrome son Gammy and returned to Australia with the healthier twin sister, now seven-month-old Pipah. Questions have been raised over Mr Farnell's suitability for surrogacy after it emerged he was jailed in 1997 for indecently dealing with three girls. One of Mr Farnell's victims, using the pseudonym Sarah, has spoken about the impact of the offences. The Farnells, pictured here with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, have been at the centre of the surrogacy scandal after Ms Janbua claimed they left Gammy in Thailand because of his disability . 'The damage is done and it can take years to repair,' she told The West Australian newspaper. 'It's my belief he should not have any children - not just him, all pedophiles.' The 39-year-old said she feared for Pipah's safety. 'We need to stop putting these perpetrators first ... because there are so many innocent babies and children that are abused day in, day out. 'It's disgusting.' Pattaramon Janbua, pictured here with surrogate child Gammy, has claimed she was asked to abort him and his twin sister Pipah seven months in to her pregnancy . Earlier this month the adult daughter of Mr Farnell broken her silence to admit she was responsible for whispers that the Farnells believed baby Gammy was dead. In an interview published by local newspaper The Bunbury Mail, Jane Farnell said she had told friends the baby, who has Down Syndrome, had died because it was simpler than 'dragging them into all the confusion'. 'My parents never said Gammy had died, that came from me,' the newspaper quoted Ms Farnell saying. Earlier this month the adult daughter of Mr Farnell, Jane Farnell (left) broke her silence to admit she was responsible for whispers that the Farnells (right) believed baby Gammy was dead . The Farnell family: Featuring Jane (far right), David (far left) and Wendy (right of David) 'The only reason I told my friends that he had died was that it was easier than dragging them all into the confusion.' 'I thought it would be easier to say he had passed away and then have to explain it later on if he came home.' Ms Farnell added that baby Gammy's twin sister, Pipah, was a happy little girl who only cried during teething. She said that Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender had done a 'terrible thing' in the past, but she believed in the integrity of the child protection system. The Farnells were placed in the international spotlight after a Thailand surrogate mother allegedthey had abandoned their Down Syndrome son Gammy and returned to Australia with the healthier twin sister Pipah .

Pattharamon Janbua claimed on Thai Rath News that David and Wendy Farnell asked her to abort both children when she was seven months pregnant. Ms Janbua also said the agents and doctors caring for were aware that Gammy had Down Syndrome early into her pregnancy. 'It was the agent ... she said that they (the Farnells) wanted to abort both of the children'. Ms Janbua told the program, adding she broke down in tears when she received this news. 'She said that the parents had been very shocked and frightened... they were insisting on the abortion. I said I couldn't do that... cause I was seven months into the pregnancy already.' Ms Janbua said she was then given the option to abort just one of the children - the one with a disability - though she still refused this as she believed she was too far into the pregnancy. 'They told me that the child would have to be injected with some drugs (or poison) to take his life and then be taken out by surgical process. Then the girl would go into the incubator right away ... these words have since then stayed in my head', Ms Janbua revealed.","A woman who claims she is one of David Farnell's child sex abuse victims said she does not believe Mr Farnell should be allowed to have children .

"A perverse loophole in the Affordable Care Act will soon make illegal immigrants more affordable to hire than native-born Americans. Once millions of people living in the U.S. illegally receive resident cards and work permits, they will be eligible to hold jobs and earn wages. But they won't qualify for Obamacare benefits or subsidies. That means employers with 50 or more full-time workers can't be penalized for failing to provide them with company-based medical insurance. Ordinarily that fine amounts to $3,000 per worker, per year. The end result is a strange, looking-glass scenario – an incentive to hire people who today can't legally hold jobs – that will also hand President Obama's political adversaries another rhetorical cudgel to beat him with. America's overall labor participation rate – the percentage of able-bodied working-age adults with jobs – is at its lowest since 1978, despite rosy federal government numbers showing the official unemployment rate has decreased in recent years. NOT A PROBLEM: Obama insisted Tuesday in Chicago that immigration reform would grow the economy and add jobs in the long run . BACK OF THE LINE: Native-born Americans could find themselves with one strike against them because they will cost an extra $3,000 to hire if a company with 50 or more employees doesn't provide insurance to all its workers . The contrast is due to a Bureau of Labor Statistics accounting trick: The agency releases a number each month after adjusting it to exclude from the labor pool everyone who has given up on finding a job in the previous six months. The dearth of middle-class jobs, however, persists. And that job market will tighten when today's illegal immigrants become tomorrow's job-eligible immigrants – and they’re cheaper to hire. The Washington Times first reported Tuesday on the odd consequence of the temporary deportation-free status Obama aims to confer on about 5 million illegal immigrants for three years . 'If it is true that the president's actions give employers a $3,000 incentive to hire those who came here illegally, he has added insult to injury,' Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith told the Times. 'The president's actions would have just moved those who came here illegally to the front of the line, ahead of unemployed and underemployed Americans.' The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday as administration officials prepared to pardon some turkeys and brine others. Obama, however, pledged on Tuesday during a speech in Chicago that his mainstreaming of illegal immigrants will not drive down Americans' wages. 'Immigrants are good for the economy,' he said. 'We keep on hearing that they’re bad, but a report by my Council of Economic Advisers put out last week shows how the actions we’re taking will grow our economy for everybody.' The Times reported that a comprehensive immigration reform bill that cleared the Senate last year – the one the White House favored before it stalled amid partisan squabbles – created the same unusual hiring incentive. That bill, called the 'Gang of Eight' proposal because four Democrats and four Republicans crafted it, gave put illegal immigrants on probationary status that conferred work eligibility but not public entitlements. JOBS PROGRAM: Illegal immigrants and their families may soon also be thanking the White House for preferential treatment in the American labor market . Brian Rogers, a spokesman for Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain – one of the 'eight' – said Tuesday that Obamacare's entire employer insurance mandate should be scrapped in order to 'eliminate the incentive to hire people who are ineligible for Obamacare subsidies.' The Obamacare-immigration loophole has existed since at least 2012 as part of a White House strategy to quell criticism about the preisdent's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. DACA provided safe haven for hundreds of thousands of people brought to the U.S. as children prior to mid-2007. Republicans howled at the time that the new swell of mainstreamed so-called 'DREAMers' would sap resources and be a drain on public benefits, including Obamacare. The Homeland Security Department later carved out a special status for the DREAMers, deeming them legal residents but denying them access to benefit programs. Obama's executive actions on immigration will only apply to people who were in the United States by January 1, 2010.","Bizarre quirk makes illegal immigrants ineligible for Obamacare benefits .

Amira Osman Hamed says she is prepared to be flogged in defence of her right to leave her hair uncovered . Her case has drawn support from civil rights activists and is the latest to highlight Sudan's series of laws governing morality which took effect after the 1989 Islamist-backed coup by President Omar al-Bashir. 'They want us to be like Taliban women,' Hamed said in an interview with AFP. Defiant: Even though she is a Muslim, she is campaigning for the right to escape religious-based laws . Under Sudanese law women's hair is supposed to be covered with a hijab similar to this . She is charged under Article 152 which prohibits 'indecent' clothing. Activists say the vaguely-worded law leaves women subject to police harassment and disproportionately targets the poor in an effort to maintain 'public order'. Hamed said she was visiting a government office in Jebel Aulia, just outside Khartoum, on August 27 when a policeman aggressively told her to cover her head. 'He said, ""You are not Sudanese. What is your religion?""' 'I'm Sudanese. I'm Muslim, and I'm not going to cover my head,' replied Hamed. Her dark hair, tinged golden, is braided tight against her scalp with a flare of curls at the back.

"More than 20,000 patients waited at least two months for vital cancer treatment last year, figures show. This is up by a quarter on the previous year, raising fears delays are hindering survival chances. Rules state that 85 per cent of patients should wait no longer than 62 days for surgery, chemotherapy or other drugs after being referred by their GP with suspected cancer. But figures covering the quarterly period from October to December show only 83.8 per cent were treated. Rules state that 85 per cent of patients should wait no longer than 62 days for surgery, chemotherapy or other drugs after being referred by their GP with suspected cancer. (File image) Charities say this is a ‘fundamental failure’ of the NHS and warn that thousands of patients are being let down, possibly suffering tragic consequences. Within the figures are some patients who have had to wait more than four months for vital surgery, over which time tumours can spread to other organs and be untreatable. There is also concern that Britain’s cancer survival rates will begin to ‘slide backwards’ having so greatly improved in recent decades. Dr Fran Woodard, Director of Policy and Research at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘It is deeply concerning that the cancer waiting time targets, which outline the time it should take for people with cancer to begin treatment following an urgent GP referral, have been breached once again in England. ‘This marks a year of this target being consistently missed, a year in which we’ ve barely seen any improvements to waiting times being made. Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, pictured, said cancer patients have been waiting too long to start treatment . ‘This shows a fundamental failure within the NHS.’ Sarah Woolnough, Cancer Research UK’s executive director of policy and information, said: ‘This isn’t just about missed targets – consecutive breaches mean thousands of patients are being failed. ‘These targets exist to ensure swift diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment, which is vital if we’re serious about having the best survival rates in the world. ‘The breaches of this target must end, which is why urgent action must be taken to support the NHS.’ Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said: ‘In the last year, thousands of cancer patients have waited too long for treatment to start and, in some cases, their chances of survival have been harmed. ‘Ministers have left families facing anxious waits for cancer tests and treatment and their complacency is dangerous. When it comes to cancer, speed is everything.' NHS officials say the delays are occurring because hospitals are having to treat rising numbers of patients diagnosed with cancer, mainly due to the aging population. Sean Duffy, NHS England’s National Clinical Director for Cancer, said: ‘Swift diagnosis of cancer is key. ‘But it’s crucial we focus on maintaining waiting time standards for treatment as demand increases so we are closely scrutinising these figures to pinpoint any issues on the ground.’ The number of women being screened for breast cancer has fallen for the third year in a row, raising fears of a loss of confidence after controversy over the benefits. NHS figures show 30,000 fewer women aged between 53 and 70 were screened for the disease in the three years prior to March last year than in the previous period. A major review into the screening programme in 2012 concluded it saves 1,300 lives a year, but leads to 4,000 women having treatment they never needed.","Figures show NHS repeatedly missed cancer treatment waiting times target .

"They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but scientists believe it may be possible to prove whether a lady, or indeed a man, is foxy or not. Researchers have discovered that what makes for a beautiful face in a fox, is similar to the features of an attractive human. The study found that features seen in farmed foxes - such as flat faces and smaller jaws, as well as a large space between the height of the cranium and face - are the same features that humans find desirable. A study has found that features seen in specially bred foxes - such as flat faces and smaller jaws, as well as a large space between the height of the cranium and face - are the same features that humans find beautiful . The research, by the University of Cambridge, also discovered that the presence or absence of such desirable features alters parents’ treatment towards their offspring. It has long been known that the bone structure of people’s faces determines their beauty and marks them out as a suitable mate. However, scientists are interested in whether the shapes of faces relate to other desirable attributes in a mate, such as fertility, social status and health and now they think a friendly looking face might be an important signifier of good character. Correlations between some of these attributes and beauty have been established, but scientists have said that as people live closely together, temperament and a friendly outlook are important characteristics in a partner too. The ugly face of a cartoon witch typically has a small forehead, a pointed face and a hard jaw with an unfriendly expression . Biological anthropologist Irene Elia told The Economist that a suitable experiment had been performed on foxes five decades ago that answers some of the questions. In 1959, Dmitry Belyaev, tried to breed tamer silver foxes, which could be more easily handled by farmers in the fur trade in Russia. The geneticist found the selective breeding process, with focused on breeding the friendliest animals, created foxes with floppy ears, rounder skulls and flatter faces, with stubbier noses and shorter jaws that crowded their teeth. He looked for foxes that displayed friendly behaviour that was not fearful or aggressive, but calm and eager and sociable. According to Dr Elia, the link is hormonal and estradiol and serotonin, which regulate behaviour, also dictate some aspects of development. In her research, published in the Quarterly Review of Biology, Dr Elia said in a sociable species such as the human race, people seek out those with friendly faces for partners. She found that the same features of the foxes – flat faces, a small nose, more delicate jaw and large forehead – are sought after features of a partner for humans. Dr Elia also said the presence of such characteristics in people’s children also plays a role in dictating how they treat their offspring. More than 15 separate studies have shown that mothers treat prettier or more handsome children better than less attractive children, even if they claim they treat them equally. Geneticist Dmitry Belyaev tried to breed tamer silver foxes (pictured), which could be more easily handled. He found the selective breeding process, which focused on breeding the friendliest animals, created foxes with floppy ears, rounder skulls and flatter faces, with stubbier noses and shorter jaws . In the animal kingdom, parents might neglect uglier offspring, resulting in their death, inadvertently making sure ‘beautiful’ features were passed on to the next generation. If the features do indeed indicate an animal is friendlier and more sociable, as they do in foxes, these characteristic would also be passed down the genetic line. Dr Elia said that in humans, attractive children are largely better adjusted and more popular than less attractive children, according to 33 studies. They are also believed to have higher intelligence and better social skills. One study found that babies just a few days old preferred the faces of classically beautiful people, while another piece of research said people are more beautiful now than in the past, as beauty is evolving. This has reportedly been shown by assessing the beauty of reconstructions of early humans. While the studies seem to back up Dr Elia’s findings, they do not prove it, but her studies suggest facial beauty is not an arbitrary characteristic, but a sign of a good character.","A Russian experiment to breed friendlier foxes .

"A pitbull terrier that had been mauled by another dog and left to die in an alley in the bitter Chicago winter in sub-zero temperatures has undergone facial reconstruction surgery. Named Flapjack by staff at Felines and Canines, the one-year-old pup was discovered emaciated and shivering near a dumpster with his bottom lip hanging from his jaw from an apparent bite-wound from another dog. Flapjack was rescued by an Animal Care and Control Officer and brought to the local pound, where vets removed a portion of the infected, decaying tissue from his jaw. Badly injured: Flapjack was left to die in the cold with a terrible injury to his face caused by another dog . His injuries were extreme and he required extensive reconstructive surgery. The puncture wounds to his face pierced the bone, severed an artery and removed the muscle from the bone.

Handsome boy: His carers say Flapjack knew how good he looked after surgery and pranced around, showing off . Good-natured: Even with his painful condition Flapjack was friendly, curious and affectionate . It's possible Flapjack was used as bait for fighting dogs or was being trained to fight himself before he was abandoned. 'Somebody used him for something,' shelter executive director Abby Smith told DNAInfo. 'Those are bite marks... I just can't believe it.' Flapjack underwent surgery last week and it went 'unbelievably well.'

'We had tears in our eyes when we saw him this morning - he is SO happy and knows how good he looks. His whole body was wiggling his tail was wagging so hard and all he wanted to do was give us the biggest, happiest kisses!' reads the post.

Potential targets during last year's festive season included iPhones, iPads, games consoles like the Nintendo 3DS, as well as designer gear such as Ugg boots, Nike trainers, Jimmy Choos, and jewellery such as watches, charms, rings and precious metals, according to the Home Office. This year the list is likely to include the iPad mini and Air, Kindles, and the new Xbox One and PS4 games consoles. And it's apparent from Barclays' study that shoppers are making life for cyber criminals far too easy.

But shoppers should remember if something looks too good to be true it often is.' Logging on: 33.6 million of us are planning to do our shopping on the web this Christmas . Alex Grant, Managing Director, Fraud Prevention at Barclays, said: ‘As the number of people shopping online is set to peak this Monday – with 33.6 million of us planning to do our shopping on the web this Christmas – cyber-criminals will have a field day if precautions aren’t taken. Our research has shown that internet shoppers will be faced with a high level of threat to their personal and financial information as they hit the online stores this Christmas. ‘That’s why we’ve teamed up with Kaspersky Lab to offer all our customers free access to their suite of products that keep financial information safe and have created a range of tools and advice working with Getsafeonline.org. ‘If everyone takes some simple steps, we can all avoid giving fraudsters a gift this Christmas.’When it comes to taking precautions online, consumers should follow the lead of older shoppers, who tend to be more cautious. While over eight in ten (82 per cent) of over 55s take precautionary measures to protect their finances, just six in ten (62 per cent) 18-24-year-olds do the same. Tony Neate, CEO of Get Safe Online said: ‘I’ve been talking to people about shopping safely online for years but every Christmas, without fail, I see worrying statistics about people being scammed online. £1.5 billion is a huge amount of money. The problem is, scams are evolving and getting more sophisticated all the time, they also change as trends come and go so it’s understandable that people sometimes get caught out.’ Not only does the older generation take the necessary steps to safeguard their online purchases, nearly nine in 10 (87 per cent) say they always consider the risks of online fraud when making a purchase, compared to less than seven out of ten (68 per cent) of their younger counterparts. David Emm, Senior Security Researcher at Kaspersky Lab said: ‘Fraud is not the only thing that will be putting Brits at risk when they hit the online stores this Christmas. In 2013 more than one in three people encountered malware when searching the web. With the anticipated spike in online shopping traffic in the run up to Christmas, this statistic must act as a red flag reminder that we need to protect ourselves against the variety of cyber threats we may face. ‘The good news here is that the answer to protecting ourselves against these threats lies in common sense. There are simple tools and tricks we can all employ when shopping online to avoid risk – such as being mindful of where you log on to the Internet and keeping your personal information secure. 'It’s not dissimilar to offline safety. It might be okay to walk alone at night – but it’s risky. If we take the right precautions in the first place, for example taking well-lit routes, staying close to our friends, the risk reduces. We should adopt a similar common sense mindset when we shop online.’ Tony Neate added: ‘At Get Safe Online we make it our responsibility to try and highlight new types of fraud as much as we can to keep shoppers safe online. What consumers need to do is keep the basics in mind as a good preventative measure. 'We know that Christmas is a busy and stressful time for people so we don’t try and overwhelm people with over complicated advice. If you’ve managed to hunt down that perfect present that you’ve been traipsing round the high street for online, at a fraction of the cost, take a step back and think before you buy it. Is it too good to be true?’ Barclays has a good record for fraud protection, with its customers benefitting from its handheld pinsentry device while logging on. Now, in a show of festive generosity, it’s ramping up the defences for its customers even further by offering the Kaspersky Internet Security Suite, Kaspersky Mobile Security Suite and Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Mac free of charge to all its online and mobile banking customers.","There were over 11,000 online fraud crimes reported last Christmas .

"Several small bombs exploded in front of a Communist Party building in the northern Chinese city of Taiyuan on Wednesday, killing one person and injuring another eight, state media said. The official Xinhua news agency said what appeared to be small-scale bombs went off outside an office building of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party. Taiyuan is the capital of Shanxi province. 'Judging from the scattering of small metal balls, it is suspected that improvised bombs exploded,' the news agency said. Attack: Smoke rises into the air outside the Communist Party headquarters after several explosions went off . Aftermath: Onlookers watch policemen working at the site of the explosions outside the provincial headquarters of China's ruling Communist Party in Taiyuan . There was no immediate explanation for the attack. But such incidents are not uncommon in China and underscore the government's worries about stability in the world's second-largest economy, with a widening gap between rich and poor and growing anger at corruption and environmental issues. Photos circulated on Chinese social media sites showed smoke filling the wide avenue where the party office is located and vehicles with blown out windows. Emergency trucks were parked outside what appeared to be undamaged buildings. Xinhua cited residents as saying people in the area scattered after as many as seven blasts went off. Blast: A Chinese police officer is framed by the glass window of a vehicle damaged by the explosions . Casualties: Bloodstains were left on the pavement after the explosions . Response: Members of a Taiyuan police Swat team arriving at the site of the attack . The microblog of the official People's Daily newspaper said one person had been killed and another eight were injured, including one person with serious injuries. The Chinese government blamed Islamists for an attack in central Beijing last week when a car ploughed through bystanders on the edge of Tiananmen Square and burst into flames, killing three people in the car and two bystanders. The incidents come as China ramps up security before top leaders gather on Saturday for a plenum meeting in Beijing to discuss key reforms. In 2011, a farmer bombed three government buildings in Fuzhou city in Jiangxi province after failing to get redress over seizure of his land. Two people and the farmer were killed. A 42-year-old farmer with terminal lung cancer detonated a home-made device aboard a bus in Fujian province in 2005, injuring 31 and killing himself, possibly to protest prohibitive healthcare costs.

Speaking as Yahoo’s Global Football Ambassador, Mourinho said that Arsenal's midfielder, who play for him at Real Madrid, 'needs trust' if you want to get the best out of him.

But injuries and fatigue followed, and he was on the end of some significant criticism as the campaign came to a close. ‘I think it's hard to criticize him, because Özil is Özil,' said Mourinho. 'If you were expecting Özil to be super aggressive and to be running miles and miles from side to side and to show great enthusiasm and aggressiveness, this is not Mesut. ‘If you are waiting for somebody where every time he touches the ball, the ball smiles. ‘Every time he makes a pass, the ball goes with the right direction, the right speed, the right intensity, this is Özil.'

Mourinho added: 'At the same time, I learned with him because we were together for quite a long time, that he's a very sensitive boy. He needs confidence. He needs trust. He needs to feel that people is with him. When he's on the pitch, every time he touches the ball, the ball goes beautiful. 'And he’ll always finds the right man on the right place.

"Michael Grimm, a Republican who has represented New Yorkers in Congress since 2011, plans to enter a guilty plea Tuesday in federal court, admitting that he helped prepare a fraudulent tax return for a restaurant he partially owned. The federal felony could bring him up to three years in prison, but a person who is familiar with the congressman's negotiations told DailyMail.com on Monday that the congressman doesn't expect to go to prison. Grimm is a former FBI agent and is a rare Republican in the Democrat-friendly Big Apple. His fate will be up to Federal Judge Pamela Chen, however, when she hears the terms of a plea agreement. Grimm was originally charged with 20 separate federal crimes and has been serving his constituents while under the terms of a $400,000 bond granted in the spring. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE CRIMINAL INDICTMENT . ON HIS WAY OUT? New York Republican Rep. Michael Grimm is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday to a federal tax felony . Grimm maintained his innocence throughout the 2014 congressional campaign season but will cop to a crime now that he's won re-election . Loretta Lynch, the sitting U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, N.Y., brought the indictment against Grimm this year making him the first federal lawmaker to face criminal charges since 2008. Lynch later became President Barack Obama choice to succeed Eric Holder as U.S. attorney general. By pleading guilty to a single tax charge, he will avoid a trial that was scheduled to convene in January. Jurors would heave heard details of Grimm's alleged scheme to hide more than $1 million of his restaurant's sales and wages in order to dodge taxes between 2008 and 2010. He was also accused of hiring illegal immigrants to work for him. The plea hearing is scheduled for 1:00 p.m. Tuesday in a Brooklyn federal courtroom. Neither prosecutors nor Grimm's attorney has commented for the record. The person who spoke to DailyMail.com, and two others who talked to the Associated Press, said Grimm will enter a guilty plea on a single count of 'aiding and assisting in the preparation and filing of a false or fraudulent tax return.' The Staten Island Republican easily won re-election in November despite campaigning under a cloud of suspicion for nearly five months. He beat Democrat Domenic Recchia by a 55-42 per cent margin to win a third term in office. If Grimm avoids a prison sentence, the shoulder-chipped GOPer is expected to argue that he should remain in office during a period of probation. That decision, however, will depend on the leanings of his fellow House Republicans, who hold a sizable majority and could vote to expel him. The House Ethics Committee has let its own investigation idle while the wheels of justice turn. But if he admits to a crime on Tuesday, the committee could quickly move to throw him out of Congress. House Speaker John Boehner's office kept mum on Monday, declining to speculate to DailyMail.com about Grimm's prospects to keep his job. Grimm owned a 45-percent interest in 'Granny Sayz,' a company that did business as Healthalicious, a Manhattan health food restaurant. Lynch's indictment accused him of helping the company avoid paying taxes on more than $1 million in income, and using cash to underpay workers under the table. Some of those employees were allegedly illegal immigrants and earned less than the minimum wage. The government alleged that Grimm kept two separate payroll ledgers, one of which was fictitious, allowing him to skirt income taxes, payroll taxes and workers' compensation costs. When some of the employees sued the company for back wages, Grimm was deposed under oath. Prosecutors claim he testified, falsely, that he had never paid the restaurant's workers in cash. In January, Grimm became a household name when a New York City journalist caught him on video threatening to throw him off a U.S. Capitol balcony for asking him a tough question about an unrelated federal probe into his 2010 campaign finances. Grimm posted a $400,000 bond to remain free while tax fraud charges pended against him in a case revolving around alleged illegal cash payments he made to illegal-immigrant restaurant employees in order to avoid paying taxes . Grimm went ballistic when NY1 reporter Michael Scotto strayed away from the approved interview topics after President Obama's State of the union Speech on January 28. The congressman waled out of range of the camera suddenly when the topic came up, saying he didn't want to speak 'off-topic.' Michael Scotto, a video journalist for the NY1 television station, was on the receiving end of a Grimm threat in January at the US Capitol . Grimm 'does not want to talk about some of the allegations concerning his campaign finances,' Scotto said, closing his televised segment. But the camera kept rolling as the congressman barked. 'Let me be clear to you,' he said. 'You ever do that to me again I’ll throw you off this f***ing balcony.' 'Why? It’s a valid question,' Scotto responded. 'No, no, you’re not man enough, you’re not man enough,' Grimm sniped back. 'I’ll break you in half. Like a boy.' Grimm apologized the following day. His long-time girlfriend, Diana Durand, pleaded guilty in September to illegally funneling money to his campaign by paying 'straw donors' to make the contributions. In some cases she reimbursed them after the fact. The scheme obscured where the donated money originally came from and allowed Grimm to reap more of Durand's campaign cash than the law allowed. Conservative filmmaker Dinesh D-Souza pleaded guilty to the same crime in May. He paid his friends back for their donations to college friend Wendy Long's failed U.S. senate campaign.

"Controversial QPR playmaker Adel Taarabt has been left in limbo, having been left out of Harry Redknapp’s pre season squad and with no interest forthcoming from AC Milan, the club he was loaned to last season. The 25-year-old Morocco playmaker spent time with Fulham and Milan during the last campaign, but neither would be willing to take the former Football League Player of the Year on a permanent move.

Even Gary O’Neil, who is out of contract at Loftus Road but in talks over a new deal, was included in the 26-man tour party at Taarabt’s expense. Rs owner Tony Fernandes spoke earlier this month about his interest in keeping Taarabt at Loftus Road, but his relationship with Redknapp would appear to rule their former talisman out of the first team for now. 'He is probably one of the best players I have ever seen,' Fernandes said. 'He has a great football brain – he knows it. But it is up to him whether he wants to do it or not. From a professional standpoint I think it would be great if he stayed.' Not keen: Redknapp's relationship with the once-talismanic playmaker has cooled .

"A housewife called the RSPCA animal cruelty hotline for help when her husband refused to get out of bed to take their pet dog for a walk, it has been revealed. The request was released on a list of the charity's top 'silliest calls', which ranged from a person complaining her cat was not responding to calls to come home, a woman who wanted the RSPCA to come out and teach her dog the green cross code and a man who was worried about a bird perched on a telephone line. Other calls included a confused motorist who called them instead of the RAC and someone who wanted to know where to get a CD full of bird sounds. The RSCPA has seen a rise in the number of silly or prank calls, which is stretching its resources in the busy summer months . The list was released as the over-stretched charity asked people to think carefully before calling. A person complaining her cat was not responding to calls to come into the house. A caller who wanted the RSPCA to go out and teach her dog the green cross code. A caller who was worried about a bird perched on a telephone line. A person who was watching a film where an animal had been attacked. A caller who was angry because she had seen a report which said children were behaving 'like animals'. She was disgusted because 'animals don't behave badly'. A confused motorist who called them instead of the RAC. Someone who wanted to know where to get a CD full of bird sounds. A woman who couldn't get her husband out of bed to walk the dog. Someone who thought they had spotted Bigfoot. A concerned woman who witnessed animal abuse - in a film more than 40 years old. A spokesman for the RSPCA said staff always expected a higher level of calls in summer months, but crank or silly calls wasted their time. The hotline has seen an increase in calls of 65 per cent since January. The spokesman said: 'Calls about stubborn cats, mythical creatures and birds on a wire put unnecessary strains on services during the summer. 'This is at a time when the RSPCA get more calls about dogs in hot cars, animals wounded in airgun incidents or animals dumped in the holidays - all of which must be a top priority for the charity and increase during the lighter summer months.' RSPCA chief inspector Dermot Murphy said: 'Summer has always seen surges in demand but like many charities we are facing a big rise in calls at a time when our resources are under most strain. 'Much as we would like to help, we simply haven't got the staff to personally investigate each and every issue that the public brings to us, so we must prioritise to make sure we get to the animals most in need.' The charity advised callers that local authorities dealt with stray dogs and police needed to be involved with animals left in hot cars, while injured wildlife should be taken to a vet and information on the RSPCA website should be consulted first before calling the charity. One woman called the charity after she saw actor Charlton Heston shoot an animal in the 1972 film Call of the Wild .",Other calls included from person who thought they had spotted Bigfoot and man who confused charity with the RAC .
"One of Boris Johnson's former deputies defected to UKIP today - just hours after the London Mayor claimed Tory 'quitters' were the type of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners. Former London deputy mayor Richard Barnes announced his decision to leave the Conservatives with a parting shot at his party for failing to ‘speak the language of normal people’. Mr Barnes, who served under Mr Johnson between 2008 and 2012, was embroiled in controversy last year after naked selfies were posted on his Facebook account. Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson's former deputy London mayor Richard Barnes defected to UKIP from the Tories today . It was initially thought that his iPhone had uploaded the shots automatically, but the politician insisted he had fallen victim to hackers. His defection was announced today just hours before Mr Johnson is due to deliver his main speech to the Tory conference in Birmingham later. In a cameo appearance at a rally last night, the London Mayor urged the ‘the great conservative family’ to unite to defeat Labour. He also mocked UKIP defectors turning up at A&E with ‘barely credible injuries’ inflicted through ‘vacuum cleaner abuse’. Referring to EU Commission plans to ban high-powered vacuum cleaners, Mr Johnson said: ‘If you do not handle your vacuum cleaner correctly, you may end up inhaling the hamster - the budgerigar through the bars of the cage. ‘And I have read that there are some people - probably the type who are thinking of defecting to Ukip - who present themselves at A&E with barely credible injuries sustained through vacuum cleaner abuse.’ Mr Barnes today hit out at the Tory party for being out of touch with ordinary people. He said: ‘There seems to be a detachment from ordinary people’s lives in the Westminster Village.’ Mr Johnson attacked Tory 'quitters, splitters and kippers' at a campaign rally in Birmingham last night . David Cameron and the London Mayor have been stung by three defections from the Tories to UKIP since last month . The former top Tory said he wanted the UK to leave the EU and return to a free trade agreement with the continent. He also dismissed David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Europe as ‘unrealistic’, and accused the Government of failing to address immigration concerns. The news came as Mark Reckless was officially installed as Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern - the traditional way of quitting the Commons. Mr Reckless was unveiled as Nigel Farage’s latest Tory catch at the UKIP conference on Saturday, triggering a by-election in his Kent constituency of Rochester and Strood. It came after rebel backbench MP Douglas Carswell stunned Westminster last month by announcing that he was leaving the Tories to join UKIP. The twin defections have forced other Conservative MPs to deny they are planning to join Mr Farage’s party. Mr Barnes was embroiled in controversy last year after naked selfies of a man appeared on his Facebook page . The former deputy London mayor said he had been the victim of hackers . Wrekin MP Mark Pritchard told BBC Shropshire his ‘beating heart is Conservative’. ‘I’ve been a member of the Conservative party for a very long time and I intend to stay in the Conservative party,’ he said. ‘Yes, I’m an arch-Eurosceptic, I’ve been involved in most if not all of the supposedly Eurosceptic moves in the parliamentary party over the past few years and that will remain the same. ‘I want us to have a referendum on Europe, and I believe the only way that can be delivered is with a Conservative government. Labour won’t, the Lib Dems certainly won’t, and with the best will in the world I don’t think even Nigel Farage on a good day will say there’s going to be a Ukip government.’ Mid Bedfordshire MP Nadine Dorries has also insisted she will not be the next to defect.","Former London deputy mayor Richard Barnes left the Conservatives today .

"Sir Elton John kisses baby Lev during a news conference at a hospital for HIV-positive children in the town of Makeyevka outside Donetsk in 2009 . The grandmother of a little boy in Ukraine who Sir Elton John tried unsuccessfully to adopt has called on the singer for ‘any help’ he could give. Sir Elton and his husband David Furnish were captivated by little Lev Ageyev when they encountered him at an orphanage in 2009. But under Ukraine’s laws, gay men are banned from adopting and in any case Sir Elton, then aged 62, was considered too old. Sir Elton said at the time: ‘I would love to adopt him. He has stolen my heart.’ Lev’s grandmother Yulia, 61, has now rescued him from the orphanage. She said: ‘I have taken Lev out of the kindergarten until the trouble is over.’ She added: ‘I know he felt something for Lev. We’re worried what will happen so any help he could give us would be appreciated.’ She added: ‘Lev went away to a camp recently and ended up becoming the star. 'And he told everyone that Elton John wanted to adopt him.’ After . failing to adopt him, the couple publicly pledged to find him a home in . his native country and send regular financial help. In . 2011 Lev's grandmother said she had not heard anything for Sir Elton . since his visit. She said the  the singer had also promised to help . Lev’s HIV-positive brother, Artyom . Lev’s alcoholic mother Marina, who was also HIV positive, died of pneumonia in 2010. Meanwhile, . dating agencies in Ukraine said they are being inundated with women who . are seeking British men in a bid to escape the troubled region. A . university art teacher with two degrees, told The Sun: ‘Right now, in . Ukraine, our society is falling apart and I’m very sad about it. Captivated: Sir Elton John (left) and his partner David Furnish (right)  pictured with baby Lev in 2009 . Lev Ageyeva, the Ukrainian boy who Elton John wanted to adopt pictured with his partner David Furnish . ‘I worked in Spain as a model and met a lot of British men there. ‘The British mentality really is very different. I like how your men have wonderful manners. ‘They can talk to you without boorishness. They know how to have fun and not to turn into drunken animals like our men do.’ Today Ukrainian national guardsmen opened fire on a crowd outside a town hall in eastern Ukraine. An official for the region's insurgents said there were fatalities. The bloodshed in the town of Krasnoarmeisk occurred hours after dozens of guardsmen shut down voting in a referendum on sovereignty for the region. Armed pro-Russia men ride armoured personnel carriers during celebrations to mark Victory Day in Slaviansk, eastern Ukraine last week . An photographer who witnessed the shooting said two people were seen lying unmoving on the ground and insurgent leader Denis Pushilin was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency as saying there were an unspecified number of deaths. Several hours earlier, guardsmen came to the town about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from the regional capital, Donetsk, and dispersed referendum voting that was taking place outside the town hall and they took control of the building. In the evening, more guardsmen arrived in a van and a scuffle broke out with people who were gathered around the building. Then the guardsmen fired shots. Eastern Ukraine has been gripped by unrest for the past month as pro-Russia insurgents occupied police stations and government buildings. Ukrainian forces have mounted a limited offensive to try to drive them out. The Donetsk and Luhansk regions conducted referendums on declaring the regions as so-called sovereign people's republics. Leaders of the vote, which is regarded as illegitimate by the central government and the West, say that sometime after the referendum, a decision will be made on whether to remain part of Ukraine, declare independence of seek annexation into Russia.","Sir Elton and his husband David Furnish were captivated by Lev Ageyev .

"Woody Allen's stepdaughter accused him of sexual assault after the idea was planted in her mind by her mother Mia Farrow during their acrimonious relationship, his attorney has claimed. Elkan Abramowitz appeared on the Today show on Tuesday - three days after Dylan Farrow, now 28, penned an open letter in the New York Times claiming Allen sexually assaulted her at age seven. 'I think it's part of Mia Farrow's desire to hurt Woody Allen,' Abramowitz told the Today show. 'His reaction is one of overwhelming sadness because of what has happened to Dylan. She was a pawn in a huge fight between him and Mia years ago. The idea that she was molested was implanted in her mind by her mother. Scroll down for video . Denial: Woody Allen's attorney Elkan Abramowitz told the Today show the filmmaker's adopted daughter only accused him of sexual assault because the idea was planted in her mind by her mother Mia Farrow . Abramowitz, speaking to Savannah Guthrie, said Allen was 'overwhelmingly sad' about the accusations . '[Dylan]'s not lying, she truly believes this happened. That's what the vice of this is - when you implant a story in the mind of a fragile seven-year-old... it never goes away.' Abramowitz added that the accusations were resurfacing now, 20 years on, because Allen's Golden Globe lifetime achievement award had 'revived the anger [Mia Farrow] has towards him'. Dylan Farrow's gut-wrenching first-person account, which was published online on Saturday, marked the first time she directly addressed the alleged sex abuse. She explained how, at age seven, her adoptive father, Allen, allegedly led her by the hand to a dim attic on the second floor of their house. 'He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set,' Miss Farrow wrote. 'Then he sexually assaulted me. He talked to me while he did it, whispering that I was a good girl, that this was our secret, promising that we'd go to Paris and I’d be a star in his movies.' Former family: Dylan Farrow, left, as a child with Woody Allen and her mother, Mia Farrow . Happily married: Mia Farrow tweeted this picture of her daughter Dylan (also known as Malone Farrow) with her husband on September 15, 2012 . Farrow went on to describe how the . award-winning director of 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan' would always find . a way to touch her and do things to her she did not like, including . sticking his thumb in her mouth, forcing her to get into bed with him . and placing his head in her naked lap. 'I thought this was how fathers doted on their daughters. But what he did to me in the attic felt different,' she said. What followed next was a drawn-out process in which Dylan was dragged from one psychologist to the next, recounting her story over and over again to see if she was lying. In the end, Allen was denied visitation rights with his children, but a Connecticut prosecutor declined to charge him, saying that while there was enough evidence for the case to potentially stand up in court, he was dropping criminal proceedings due to Dylan's fragile state. Farrow and Allen separated after Farrow . found nude photographs that Allen had taken of Farrow's adopted daughter . from a previous relationship, Soon-Yi Previn, when she was 20. Denial: Allen, pictured Monday, has denied the accusations, which he found 'overwhelmingly sad' Allen, 78, has always denied the allegations of sexual abuse against Dylan. He was never charged with, or convicted of, a crime in this case. Allen's publicist, Leslee Dart, said the director read the article 'and found it untrue and disgraceful'. 'Anger': Farrow, pictured, and Allen split after she found naked photos he took of another daughter . The case is over,' Abramowitz added on the Today show on Tuesday. 'There is no case.' Despite Allen's vehement denial, the accusations have caused outrage and division among Hollywood including Lena Dunham, who urged her 1.3 million Twitter followers to read Farrow's letter. 'To share in this way is courageous, powerful and generous,' Dunham wrote . Farrow's family, including her mother and stepbrother Ronan Farrow, have also been unwavering in their support of her. On the night of the Golden Globes . ceremony, Ronan Farrow, Allen's would-be son, brought up his sister's . alleged assault in a scathing tweet. 'Missed . the Woody Allen tribute - did they put the part where a woman publicly . confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?' the . newly hired MSNBC host wrote. But on Monday, Barbara Walters came to Allen's support on The View. The . 84-year-old co-creator of The View opened the discussion after Whoopi . Goldberg introduced the topic. Walters pointed out that the statute of . limitations had run out. 'I've been with Woody many times with . his two daughters,' Walters said referencing time spent with Allen, his wife Soon-Yi Previn and their two adopted teenage daughters, . Bechet and Manzie. Defending a friend: Barbara Walters defended her friend Woody Allen on Monday during a discussion on the public child abuse allegations made against the famed director by his adopted daughter Dylan . Spirited debate: Sherri Shepherd challenged Walter's defense of Allen . 'I have rarely seen a father as . sensitive, as loving and as caring as Woody is and Soon-Yi to these two . girls. I don't know about Dylan. I can only tell you what I have seen . now,' Walters said. Walters said that Dylan was . 'supposedly very angry' and made the child abuse allegations because . Allen was up for a Best Original Screenplay at the Academy . Awards for his comedy Blue Jasmine. But the . View's Sherri Shepherd, 46, challenged Walters by pointing out . that many people accused of crimes are often described as 'the most . wonderful person.' 'That's not what I'm saying,' Walters shot back. McCarthy also said the child abuse . claim wasn't so far-fetched since Allen started a relationship with . Farrow's adopted daughter Soon-Yi when he was 56 and she was 19. 'But it was mutual,' Walters countered. 'He married her. They've been married for 20 years.' See below for video .

"The man accused of shooting dead 12 cinema goers and injuring 58 others at a midnight showing of the Dark Knight Rises was involved with a number of different prostitutes in the months before the massacre, it has been alleged. It was reported last week that alleged Colorado shooter James Holmes had visited and posted on a number of sex websites. Sources told TMZ that he also wrote on a message board specifically for potential clients to write reviews for hookers in the Colorado area. A number of posts on the message board went up under Holmes' alleged screen name. In the posts, he writes detail about a number of sexual experiences he had with different prostitutes - some of them more than once. Scroll down for video . Bizarre behavior: James Holmes, pictured at his first court appearance on Monday, was involved with a number of prostitutes in the months before the massacre . James Holmes has been forced to wear a face guard in prison because he will not stop spitting at guards . When TMZ spoke to three of the hookers Holmes' allegedly rated on the forum, two of them said they couldn't be sure if it was the same guy while a third said she was positive she had met up with more on more than one occasion and maybe as recently as last August. The woman, who goes by the name Tiffany told TMZ: 'I had no issues with him…he was really nice. 'He felt bad that I wasn’t getting more customers while in Colorado, so he called a few days later and we met up again.' The news comes the day after it emerged that Holmes has been forced to wear a face guard as he keeps spitting at the guards there. It was also revealed that when authorities placed evidence bags over the 24-year-old's hands to preserve gunshot residue, he began playing with them as if they were two puppets, the sources told CALL7. He is being held in isolation at the Arapahoe County Jail but the continual spitting has forced authorities to cover his face while he is being moved. Out of it: Holmes, who said he dyed his hair to appear like Batman's nemesis The Joker, gave an alarming performance in court, but jail workers said he was not on any medication . Pain: Family members gather around the makeshift memorial behind the Century 16 cinema on Tuesday . Mourning: Left, two daughters of victim Gordon Cowden's embrace as another daughter leaves messages on a cross at the memorial site. The father of four, who was the oldest victim, is pictured right . Loss: Two of Cowden's teenage daughters were with him in the cinema at the time of the shooting . Struggle: The family gathers at the cross nearby to the cinema where their father was gunned down. In the foreground, a family portrait shows Cowden and his children . It is just the latest example of Holmes' bizarre behavior and comes as his mother revealed she feared he had . been disturbed for years and was concerned about his social isolation. Arlene . Holmes, who lives in San Diego, California and was only made aware of . the shootings when a reporter called her for a comment, is said to have . urged her son to seek counseling. The claim in the Washington Post about . Mrs Holmes, a nurse, is the first sign that she could have averted the . massacre and raises grave questions over what else she knew. When . she was called about the shootings on Friday, she told an ABC reporter . 'you have the right person' - in an apparent indication that her son was . the likely gunman. But . on Monday, her lawyer spoke out to claim Mrs Holmes's statement had . been mischaracterised, and she had in fact been confirming that she was . the 'right person'. According to reports, the neuroscience . graduate was adopted and Mrs Holmes, 58, and husband Robert, 61, a . software developer, raised him as one of their own. The reports come just one day after . Holmes's startling first appearance in court on Monday, where he rolled . his eyes, stared directly ahead and swayed from side to side. He also displayed a disheveled mop of . orange hair, apparently fading from the red he had dyed it in an . attempt to resemble Batman's arch nemesis, The Joker. He stayed silent throughout the appearance at Arapahoe County Court and at times appeared as if he was under heavy medication. But a jail employee has claimed that the 12-minute catatonic appearance was an act, not the result of any drugs. 'We don’t just hand out meds,' the Arapahoe County Detention Center worker told the New York Daily News. 'It just doesn’t work like that. If he was acting sleepy, he was faking it.' New images: The public is learning more about the victims of the horrific attack, including Petty Officer Third Class John T. Larimer, 27, left, and young dad Jonathan T. Blunk, 26, right .

Support: Best friends Allie Young, left, and Stephanie Davies recount how Stephanie saved Allie's life by applying pressure to a gun wound on her neck . The source added: 'I heard he’s not cooperating. He’s trying to act crazy. I know the people here believe . it’s an act, but only he knows for sure.' Dr Joan Neff, a criminologist from the . University of Virginia, told MailOnline that Holmes' appearance was . consistent with someone who was suffering from a mental illness, such as . schizophrenia. Mugshot: Holmes, 24, is suspected of shooting dead 12 cinema-goers and wounding 58 others . She said this would also explain why he dropped out of his PhD so abruptly. 'We . know that certain types of psychoses tend to have an onset in the early . 20s; if that's the case he may be in the midst of coping with that. He . may not know what's going on,' she said. Alternatively, . she said the conditions of his jailing - especially for someone who has . never been in trouble with the law - may have brought on an episode. 'Sometimes that can be an experience in and of itself,' Dr Neff said. 'So his appearance is not very surprising.' Jailors at the facility agreed Holmes has been . acting bizarrely ever since arriving and 'thinks he's acting in a . movie', they told the New York Daily News . 'He was spitting at the door and . spitting at the guards,' a released inmate said outside the jail. 'He’s . spitting at everything. Dude was acting crazy.' Mental illness is something the suspected gunman would be educated in, after completing a neuroscience degree before dropping out of his PhD program last month. Holmes was previously awarded a $26,000 federal grant from the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, part of the US Department of Health. The sum covered a stipend and his tuition at the University of Colorado in Denver. He was one of six neuroscience students at the school to receive the money, WNEW News reported. As . well as mental illness, there have been other suggestions at a motive, . including reports Holmes had recently split from a girlfriend and the . fact he had been struggling in school before dropping out. Backtrack: Holmes's mother feared he had been disturbed for years. On Monday her attorney Lisa Damiani (pictured) said the woman had no idea he was the suspect, despite earlier reports . Outrage: Tom and Caren Teves, whose son Alex was killed, and his girlfriend Amanda Lindgren, were just a few of the relatives at the court appearance. They branded Holmes a 'coward' Crowd: People, including victims and their relatives, listen to the court hearing of James Holmes on Monday . Ongoing: Crime scene tape is seen around the apartment where Homes lived in Aurora on Tuesday . Investigation: Members of the prosecution also arrive to look at Holmes's apartment . Whatever the . cause, families are now reacting to the killings by unleashing lawsuits . on the Century 16 Theater where the shooting took place, Holmes' doctors and Warner Brothers. TMZ reported that Torrence Brown, Jr. was in the cinema when Holmes shot dead 12 people and wounded another 58. One of his friends, 18-year-old A.J. Boik, was killed in the massacre, and Brown is now suffering from . extreme trauma, according to his attorney Donald Karpel. His lawsuit, . which has not yet been filed, will name the theater, for not properly . securing the emergency exit and Holmes’ doctors, for allegedly . prescribing medications, as defendants. It will also name the studio Warner Brothers, claiming that Dark Knight Rises is too violent. Lawsuit: Witness Torrence Brown, Jr. (right) is about to bring a lawsuit against the cinema, Holmes' doctors and Warner Brothers after suffering extreme trauma after his friend AJ Boik (left) was shot dead . Remembered: A woman grieves at a memorial for victims behind the theater in Aurora, Colorado . Outpouring: Thousands of people continue to visit the makeshift memorial to leave gifts or messages . Never forgotten: The community continues to come together as questions remain about the killer . After his brief appearance on Monday, Holmes is back in solitary confinement - but the families of the victims said they saw enough. 'I saw the coward in court today,' said Tom Teves, whose son Alex was among those killed. 'Alex could have wiped the floor with him without breaking a sweat.' Holmes is being held without bond and will hear the formal charges against him next Monday. The County District Attorney is considering whether to seek the death penalty.

He proceeded to talk her out of making a rash decision, all the while probing whether she would be going to the police about Lucy's killer since he still believes that his youngest daughter Abi is the culprit. ‘I’m not doing it because I don’t love it. I’m doing this because I already do. It’s for the best’, Lauren cryptically declared. And when Abi spilled the beans to Peter, he missed his own father's wedding to find Lauren at the clinic and tell her he wants to keep the baby. Shocker: Max Branning confronted his daughter Lauren at an abortion clinic . ‘I always wanted kids. Loads of them and I want them with you’, he pleaded. ‘I know we’d be young parents, but we’d be really good at it. I’d do everything for you… both of you.’ But it seems Lauren has already made up her mind and wants nothing to do with the Beale family, deciding to tell Peter the terrible truth about who killed his twin sister all those months ago. Jane and Ian – who have both been prime suspects in the never-ending murder mystery – certainly raised suspicions throughout the episode as they were both visibly dealing with guilt. As they exchanged vows, Lauren’s note (which featured prominently in Tuesday’s programme) preyed heavily on Jane’s mind. Visibly flustered, she paused the ceremony to ask where Peter was and stopped to get a glass of water. Anxious: Jane struggled to go through with the ceremony and is  hiding something from her family . Recovering enough to continue with the wedding, she made a speedy exit during the pub after-party and seemed to be preparing for the worst when Ian came to find her at home, shortly followed by Peter. As suspected, the Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) storyline from the first of this week’s special 30th anniversary episodes was a red herring. The soap kicked off with the outraged blonde querying why her father Max thought she had killed Lucy. ‘You were pretty angry with her. You might have pushed her, she might have banged her head or something’, he explained. Abi retorted: ‘I told you we had a row, and I slapped her!’ Not guilty: The Abi Branning bombshell turned out to be a red herring, although she did confess  she wished she had killed Lucy, who was having an affair with her father . Short-lived comeback: Jo  has returned to the soap for two episodes as Tanya Branning . Guilty: Dot Cotton confessed that she had left her drug addict son Nick to die . Dubious Max was still convinced his youngest daughter is the culprit and tried to cover it up from her mother Tanya Branning, who  returned to Albert Square especially for Ian and Jane’s nuptials. ‘I didn’t, but I wish I had [killed Lucy]’, Abi brazenly told her mother. Elsewhere, soap veteran Dot Cotton (June Brown) confessed to a murder of her own. She went to the hospital to apologise to bed-ridden Ronnie (Samantha Womack) – who has just woken up from her coma – for her son Nasty Nick Cotton (John Altman) putting her there. But as she was pouring her heart out about leaving drug addict to die, her grandson Charlie (Declan Bennett) entered the room and was stunned to discover the truth about his father’s last days. ‘I’ve killed my son’, the god-faring pensioner admitted. EastEnders continues on Thursday night, when viewers will finally discover who killed Lucy, and concludes with a fully-live episode on Friday. #howsadam?

"James Bulger's mother Denise Fergus says it is 'disgusting' that her son's killer has been allowed to sign up to an online dating website . The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger yesterday spoke of her fears after it emerged one of her son’s killers has been allowed to join a popular dating website. Denise Fergus, 47, said it was frightening women may have unwittingly contacted Jon Venables without having any idea of his true identity. Under strict rules put in place following his release from prison, the murderer and paedophile has lifelong anonymity, meaning anyone he speaks to online will not know about his past. Last night Mrs Fergus, who now runs a charity dedicated to her son’s memory, said: ‘It’s quite disgusting that a child murderer and paedophile can have access to online dating websites. ‘I feel so sorry for the girls and women who do not know who they’re chatting to. He’s capable of anything. ‘Who’s to say that he’s not prowling the internet, looking for mothers and targeting their children? That’s the most frightening thing. ‘The Parole Board should have some kind of system where they can watch what he is doing on the internet. He seems to be left to his own devices and getting away with it all the time.’ Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were only ten when they killed two-year-old James in 1993, after abducting him from a shopping centre in Bootle, Liverpool. They were jailed but released with new identities after serving eight years, without spending a day in an adult prison. In 2010, however, it emerged Venables, 32, was back behind bars for breaking the conditions of his release by downloading and distributing more than 100 images of child abuse, some involving victims as young as two. Scroll down for video . Child killer Jon Venables, pictured in 1993 after murdering James Bulger, has signed up to an online dating website in a bid to contact single women who have no way of knowing know his real identity . The pair (pictured left in CCTV footage) walked the two-year-old (right) around the streets of Liverpool for more than two miles, stopping occasionally to kick and punch him . Venables and Robert Thompson were only ten when they abducted, tortured and murdered James Bulger in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993. This infamous CCTV footage shows the pair abducting the toddler . In one instance he messaged another convicted paedophile claiming to be a married mother who abused her eight-year-old daughter, and offered to sell access to the child. He was jailed for a further two years before being released again in 2013. Journalist and child protection expert Mark Williams-Thomas found Venables’ online dating profile in a joint investigation with the Sunday Mirror. Mark Williams-Thomas, a child protection expert, said it was 'horrific' that Venables was allowed to trawl the internet, potentially looking for victims . He said: ‘James Bulger’s murder was so horrific that Venables should remain under constant supervision and never be allowed to freely trawl the internet, let alone with the added fact that he was also convicted of a child sex offence. ‘When Venables was convicted in 2010 after using the internet to commit child sex offences, everyone was saying, “How has he got access?” But now it is happening all over again.’ Mr Williams-Thomas said it was worrying that Venables could potentially contact single mothers, putting their children at risk of abuse. He added: ‘The thing about child sex offenders is that their behaviour does not change – he will always be a child sex offender.’ In his dating profile Venables, who pays a monthly subscription to the site, says he has a good sense of humour and loves music and football. It is not clear whether the name used on his dating profile is an online persona or the new identity given to him in 2001. In March 2013, similar revelations emerged that Venables was searching for love online. It was reported that, in 2007, he tried to seduce single mother Sarah Finn, 36, by sending her flattering messages on a social media website. Mrs Fergus’s husband Stuart, fundraising manager for the James Bulger Memorial Trust, said the Parole Board and Government are failing to take Venables’ crimes seriously. ‘One of the things that Venables did last time was pretend to be a female online so he could commit his crimes – there should be alarm bells ringing,’ he said. Robert Thompson was also convicted on the young boy's murder. When they were charged, they were the youngest people to face a murder prosecution in the 20th century .","Denise Fergus said it is 'frightening' that her son's killer is allowed online .

"Political leaders and commentators around the world are reacting to news that Scotland has voted no to leaving Britain - as attention turns to other separatist movements fighting for independence. While much of the international coverage of the referendum result has been positive, with everyone from Chinese media to German ministers cheering the no vote, other countries were less supportive. Among those criticizing the way the independence referendum was handled are a number of pro-Kremlin figures who have desperately sought to draw parallels with the much-criticized Crimean referendum in March, which came after Russia forcibly annexed the peninsula from Ukraine. With Scots rejecting the opportunity to form an independent nation, attention has now turned to other separatist movements around the world - with nervous Spaniards among those concerned that the referendum will lead to calls for similar votes in regions fighting for self-government in their country. Scroll down for video . Stateside: St. Andrew's Bar in New York City was filled to capacity last night as anxious Scots from all over Manhattan awaited the final results of the referendum . Scottish ex-pats from both the 'yes' and no' camps gathered in St Andrew's bar to watch the results . Mikhail Emelyanov, a Russian MP in the country's lower house of parliament, was among those attacking the way the independence referendum had been run. Speaking to the media today, he described the much-criticized referendum held in Crimea in March as having been 'fairer' than the one held in Scotland and hinted he thought underhand tactics may have been deployed by 'no' campaigners. 'In terms of legitimacy and the conditions in which they were carried out, the Crimea referendum was conducted in a much fairer way than the Scottish one,' he said. 'At least there were no power cuts, there was no fire alarm or halts in the counting of votes and so on,' he added - apparently referring to a brief power outage in Dundee, ironically one of only four Scottish regions where more people voted 'yes' to independence than 'no'. Many pro-Kremlin commentators had been passionately campaigning for a 'yes' vote - ostensibly in the hope that it may have sparked a wave of  referendums in former-Soviet republics that could lead to the countries demanding closer ties with Moscow. Disappointed: Konstantin Rykov, a former politician who supports Russian president Vladimir Putin, tweeted the words 'Oh, Scots, Scots. Well, not to worry. In 300 years or so you can try again' Difference: Following the 'no' result,  Alex Salmond (right) dramatically quit as Scotland's First Minister. David Cameron welcomed the outcome - but said now is the time to listen to the voices of England . Many of these people expressed disappointment when the vote came in - among them Konstantin Rykov, a former politician who passionately supports Russian president Vladimir Putin. Having proudly displayed a 'Yes' ribbon to his Twitter profile in recent weeks, Mr Rykov had removed it by the time he tweeted an image of Mel Gibson in his Braveheart outfit along with the words 'Oh, Scots, Scots. Well, not to worry. In 300 years or so you can try again.' All over: A pro-union supporter in Glasgow bursts into tears of relief as fellow No campaigners cheer welcoming the results as Scotland rejects separation . Another country less than positive about the referendum result was Italy, where leading daily newspaper La Repubblica said British spirit had been 'wounded' despite the outcome. The newspaper also suggested that Europe may appreciate the value Britain more than Britons themselves, saying: 'If Scotland no longer had a need for Great Britain, at least according to many voters, Europe needs Great Britain.' France's education minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem struck a similar tone when she described the result made her happy, adding: 'We never like to see European nations break up... The opposite result would have been a negative signal.' That sentiment was echoed by governing Socialist Party's secretary for Europe Philip Cordery and  centrist MP of the UDI party Bertrand Plancher - both of whom called the no vote a 'relief'. The Scottish 'yes' campaign had picked up strong support among French citizens however, who remain sentimental about a medieval anti-English alliance between the two countries. European support: France's education minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem (left) said the referendum result made her happy, adding: 'We never like to see European nations break up.' Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt (right) said 'The United Kingdom stays united. So must Europe' Decisions: Carl Bildt appeared to use the result to send a signal to Britain to think twice before holding a proposed future referendum of whether or not to leave the EU . Earlier this week it was reported that there had been 'worry' and 'mystification' over the referendum in Eastern Asia. Taiwanese animation studio TomoNews responded by creating a bizarre 'explainer' video . German media reacted to the Scottish result positively, with popular tabloid Bild headlining its report 'Britain stays Great'. 'The British can rejoice, the Kingdom remains intact. Their partners in Brussels and Washington can breathe, Great Britain can continue to fulfill its international responsibilities,' weekly news magazine Der Spiegel added. Sweden's foreign minister Carl Bildt, meanwhile, appeared to use the result to send a signal to Britain to think twice before holding a proposed future referendum of whether or not to leave the  EU. 'The United Kingdom stays united. So must Europe,' he said without elaborating on his comment. Another thinly veiled pro-European comments came from Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, who said: The European Commission welcomes the fact that during the debate over the past years, the Scottish government and the Scottish people have repeatedly reaffirmed their European commitment.' The Taiwanese animation shows David Cameron, carrying deputy prime minister Nick Clegg on his front, standing alongside Better Together leader Alistair Darling to encourage voters to back the No campaign . Better together? Mel Gibson as William Wallace (right), Rab C.Nesbitt (centre) and Groundskeeper Willie (left) all appear in the bizarre Taiwanese animation standing in front of a unicorn . Meanwhile NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said: 'I fully respect the choice that the people of Scotland have made in yesterday's referendum. I welcome Prime Minister Cameron's statement that the United Kingdom will go forward as a united country.' 'The United Kingdom is a founding member of NATO, and I am confident that the United Kingdom will continue to play a leading role to keep our Alliance strong,' he added. The independence referendum result also became a hot topic in China, where one social media user said: 'The UK shows the world its political civilization and shows other regimes, which only show their muscle and use force, how there are alternatives to handling disputes,' according to the Telegraph. The official Chinese state line was more muted however. While some politicians welcome the idea of a limited Britain, they remain key not to send out too many positive signals about independence movements as a whole so as not to further encourage those who have been fighting for the independence of the region of Tibet since the 1950s. Earlier this week it was reported that there had been 'worry' and 'mystification' in Eastern Asia, promoting Taiwanese animation studio TomoNews to produce a bizarre 'explainer' video packed with stereotypes about Scotland - and even a cameo  from Simpson's charactor Groundskeeper Willie. Another nation unsurprisingly keen to speak up for the concept of unity is Spain, which has long battled against independence movements in a number of regions including Catalonia (pictured) MPs in the state of Catalonia are today voting on whether to hold their own independence referendum in a move fiercely opposed by the country's central government in Madrid.

In a video statement that avoided any mention of Catalonia, Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy today expressed his content with the outcome in Scotland and attacked the Scottish independence movement. 'With their decision, Scots have avoided the large economic, social, institutional and political consequences that separation would have brought,' he said. 'Yesterday they chose between segregation and integration. Between isolation and being open. Between stability and uncertainty.

"The Obama administration took steps Wednesday to cut levels of smog-forming pollution linked to asthma, lung damage and other health problems, bringing jeers from business leaders who warn of trillions in compliance costs and millions of lost jobs. And evidence shows that a shifting regulatory environment could drive hundreds of U.S. counties over the new limit – for no reason other than their proximity to China's out-of-control smokestack society. Energy and industry trade groups painted the government's move as a roadblock that threatens to jeopardize manufacturing's comeback in the U.S. And Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe, who will take over the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in January, is vowing 'vigorous oversight' of the plan. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter said Wednesday that the Environmental Protection Agency's planned move 'will shut down job-creating projects in every state.' HOT SEAT: EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy insists that the benefits of changing America's clean-air standard outweigh any financial and job losses they might cause . PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF SMOG: Chinese industry has made air in Beijing practically unbreatheable, and much of that pollution wafts across the Pacific Ocean where it settles in the western US – in concentrations large enough to earn financial penalties from the federal government . Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, warned that 'tightening these standards could be the most expensive regulation ever imposed on the American public, with potentially enormous costs to the economy, jobs, and consumers.' Gerard and other business leaders accused the Obama administration of moving the goalposts, since states are still working to implement the previous standard put in place in 2008 by President George W. Bush. But green groups say it's all just spin. 'We've heard the sky-is-falling rhetoric before,' Environmental Defense Fund senior scientist Elena Craft told Politico. 'And in every case, American ingenuity and creativity have allowed us to move on and to do the things that we need to do to get those control measures in place and to bring cleaner and healthier air to all Americans.' “We know that the science and the law is clear,' she said. 'So we expect EPA to do their job and protect public health.' The nuts and bolts of the Environmental Protection Agency's new plan seem modest on the surface: The agency will move to a new, lower threshold for ozone pollution of between 65 and 70 parts per billion, lowering it from 75. The EPA could, however, push the legal level down as far as 60 parts per billion, a level sought by environmental activists. Dropping the limbo bar even 5 points could draw new legal challenges from western U.S. states where studies show Chinese factories are dumping enough ozone and other pollution to push them over the new limit. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research found that pollution wafting across the Pacific Ocean from East Asia can contribute up to 20 percent of the ground-level ozone measured in California and elsewhere. The Princeton University-led research team determined that in the springtime, Asia's dirty air adds between 8 and 15 parts per billion of ozone to atmospheric measurements in the U.S. If nothing else, an industry analyst told MailOnline on Wednesday, lowering permissible ozone levels across the country could put west-coast states at a competitive disadvantage in attracting new businesses. The six U.S. cities and towns with the highest ground-level ozone levels are all in California, according to the American Lung Association. In July Chinese officials recorded the worst smog days in Hong Kong's history. PRIMER: Ozone is a good thing in the upper atmosphere but can be harmful at ground level, produced by chemical reactions brought on by emissions from cars, factories and power plants . South Dakota Sen. John Thune has introduced a bill that would tie the EPA's hands and force it to postpone its plan. 'I expect there to be strong, bipartisan opposition to what will be the most expensive EPA regulation in history,' Thune said Monday in a statement. Legislation co-sponsor Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican senator, complained Wednesday that 'as Americans prepare to celebrate Thanksgiving with their friends and families, the Obama Administration has taken the opportunity to roll out what some experts estimate could be the most expensive regulation ever.' 'Almost 9 million people are still looking for good-paying jobs nationwide. The last thing workers and families in Missouri need is yet another burdensome regulation that will further stifle jobs and economic opportunity.' In 2010 the EPA proposed setting the permissible ozone levels in the air to somewhere between 60 to 70 parts per billion. That level would have doubled the number of U.S. counties who violate the rule. In addition to America's smog capitals like Los Angeles and Dallas, smaller regions including a county in Kansas with a population of just 3,000 would find themselves facing fines – and passing costs on to businesses. There's broad disagreement about how much the EPA's new plan will cost industry, and whether all those costs will ultimately be borne by consumers. Business groups say it would be nearly impossible for oil refineries and large manufacturers to comply without going bankrupt. A study commissioned by the National Association of Manufacturers determined that America's Gross Domestic Product will shrink by $270 billion per year and carry a compliance price tag of $2.2 trillion, while wiping out $3.4 trillion in economic output and 2.9 million jobs by the end of 2040. 'This would be the most expensive regulation ever imposed on the American public,' the NAM said in July. Its main concern is the difficulty a new clean-air standard would pose for companies looking to open new manufacturing plants. By federal law, the EPA is required to make its recommendations and set policy without considering the costs. NEW SHERIFF: Sen. James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican famous for deriding 'global warming' as junk science, will chair the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in January . The agency claims industry will only have to spend about $3.9 billion in 2025, the first year the new regulation would take effect, if the standard of 70 parts per billion holds. That cost, the EPA says, would grow to $15 billion if the final rule sets the limit at 65 parts per billion. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told the Associated Press that lower ozone standards would actually spur more businesses, investment and jobs by making communities healthier, repeating the administration's long-held view that government-nudged green investment is a net economic gain. 'Critics play a dangerous game when they denounce the science and law EPA has used to defend clean air for more than 40 years,' she wrote in an op-ed for CNN's website. 'The American people know better.' In a statement Wednesday, she insisted that 'bringing ozone pollution standards in line with the latest science will clean up our air, improve access to crucial air quality information, and protect those most at-risk.' 'It empowers the American people with updated air quality information to protect our loved ones – because whether we work or play outdoors – we deserve to know the air we breathe is safe.' McCarthy's EPA is under a court-ordered Dec. 1 deadline to issue its new smog standard. The proposal will also fulfill a pledge President Obama made during his first White House campaign – one that he reneged on during a contentious 2012 re-election campaign.","Pollution levels wafting from CHINA could be enough to push the entire western US over EPA's new limit for ground-level ozone .

"Risk: The new study suggests drinking more than a couple of glasses of wine early in pregnancy can harm a child's brain . Just one night out during pregnancy can have long-lasting effects on the child’s behaviour, a study suggests. Youngsters exposed to one or two binges of alcohol in the womb were more likely to have short attention spans and be badly behaved at the age of seven, it said. A binge was classified as two-and-a-half large glasses of wine or more. This could concern many women who enjoy drinks with friends before realising they are pregnant. The Danish study tracked the health of more than 30,000 babies born to women who had been asked about drinking in pregnancy. A binge was defined as downing at least 7.5 units of alcohol in one session, with a large wine containing three units. When the children were seven, the mothers filled in a another questionnaire about their behaviour. The results revealed the lasting influence of binge drinking in pregnancy. The impact was much bigger on children whose mothers drank in late pregnancy but subtle differences occurred in those exposed to binges early on. Worryingly, most of the women had only indulged once or twice in the first 16 weeks of expecting. Researcher Janni Niclasen said: ‘If you expose your child to one or two binges in early pregnancy, the brain will be less flexible. When that child grows up and is put in a difficult situation, it might make a difference to the way that child will cope.’ She added: ‘Women really shouldn’t panic. They should think about what they eat and drink for the rest of their pregnancy.’ Dr Niclasen, of Copenhagen University, also warned that binge drinking early in pregnancy is known to raise the risk of miscarriages, stillbirths and birth defects. Worrying: The results of the 30,000-strong survey suggest that binge drinking has a lasting effect in pregnancy . In a second study, she suggested that baby boys appear to be particularly vulnerable, perhaps because male and female brains develop slightly differently. The doctor, whose research is published in the European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry journal, advised mothers-to-be not to drink alcohol at all. Patrick O’Brien, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said a foetus exposed to binge drinking in the first week or two of pregnancy will, in general, be miscarried or survive unscathed. Linda Geddes, author of Bumpology, said other studies hint that babies are particularly sensitive to alcohol in weeks seven to 12, by which time many more women know they are pregnant.","Danish study tracked the health of 30,000 pregnant women .

"A drugs gang that flooded a county with drugs has been jailed for a total of 167 years after they were found with huge amounts of cash, heroin and cocaine. In total, 36 people were involved in the gang which operated in Lancashire. Pictures released by police show £200,000 in piles of cash and bags containing £1.5million of the class A drugs. Lancashire Constabulary carried out a series of arrests where they found bundles of cash including one haul of £51,240 in a Range Rover. This cash - £51,240 - was taken from a Range Rover that was pulled over in south Lancashire . This Asda bag full of cash worth £51,240 was also taken from the Range Rover. It was made through the sale of a kilo of cocaine . Another £29,920 in cash was recovered from a vehicle driven from Bradford through Greater Manchester on the M60 . A van being driven on the M6 motorway was pulled over and police found £18,650 (pictured) inside . A kilo of cocaine with a street value of £100,000 was recovered from another house while £18,650 was taken from a van driven by two gang members on the M6. Another £30,000 was seized from a vehicle on the M60 near Manchester. The gang operated mostly in the towns of Blackburn and Preston but they also dealt drugs in Cumbria, Merseyside and Cheshire. A series of trials have taken place over the last 18 months with the final sentencing at Preston Crown Court last week. During that hearing, Tahier Chand, 34, from Huddersfield, was jailed for five years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin. Detective superintendent Lee Halstead . said: 'Operation Oak has dismantled a network of drugs gangs responsible . for the supply of over £1.5million worth of cocaine and heroin across . northern England and has resulted in the recovery of huge sums of cash. 'As a result these people, who did . not have a legitimate income, led comfortable and in some cases quite . affluent lifestyles, acting as negative role models to young people.

'This was at the expense and misery of . other residents in the community, whose lives were blighted by the . effects of drug dealing and associated violence in their neighbourhoods. 'This has been a large scale . investigation and we have worked closely with officers from our . neighbouring forces and the Crown Prosecution Service.

Joanne Cunliffe, Crown Advocate from the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit added: 'The fact that 36 individuals have been brought to justice for their involvement in the large scale supply of Class A drugs across the north of England is a testament to the close partnership between the CPS, Lancashire Police, Cumbria Police and other neighbouring forces. 'From the early stages of this investigation, the prosecution team provided guidance and advice to the police and tirelessly worked with them to build a strong case against each defendant. 'As a result we have successfully secured their convictions and dismantled a prominent source of drugs in our region and surrounding areas. The message is clear, we will not tolerate the supply of drugs on our streets and we are wholly committed to prosecuting those responsible.'","Cash and drugs were seized from vehicles and properties in Lancashire .

"The parents of a six-month-old baby born with a congenital heart defect have finally been given some good news, that she will have access to lifesaving surgery. For the past six months, Darwin parents Lambros and Sandra Pastrikos have faced an uphill battle in the fight to keep their daughter, now one year old, Doreen, alive. Born with a condition known as Tetralogy of Fallot, which stops the heart delivering enough blood to the lungs, Dora was prevented from having life-saving operation at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital in February because of a severe change in her condition. Sandra Pastrikos is thrilled her daughter, one year old Doreen, finally got acceptance for lifesaving surgery . For the past six months, Darwin parents Lambros and Sandra Pastrikos have faced an uphill battle in the fight to keep their daughter, now one year old, Doreen, alive. Born with a condition known as Tetralogy of Fallot, which stops the heart delivering enough blood to the lungs . She suffered a 'tet spell', brought about by a dramatic drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood, which placed her in intensive care and ruled her out for surgery. The NT News have reported Dora saw a Melbourne specialist neurologist last week and following on from that, news she will finally get to undertake surgery. 'I feel vindicated, but our calls needed to be heard a long time ago,' Ms Pastrikos told the NT News. 'This has been an incredibly draining, emotional roller coaster and we have fought this decision as much as we could,' she said. At the time her daughter's surgery was denied, Ms Pastrikos squared the blame on Royal Darwin clinicians for failing to provide a proper duty of care. She demanded an inquiry be undertaken to investigate claiming she wasn't told about her daughter's condition straight away. Since February, Dora's family have been warned to prepare for her death but have been inspired by her will to live. 'Dora was taken off her respirator and moved to the Hospice ... but this little girl has just not given up and defied odds every second of the way,' Mrs Pastrikos told NT News. Big sis gave Dora some cuddles who now has scheduled lifesaving surgery . 'The aim of the surgery is to stop the tet spells and give Dora a chance at a normal life without the oxygen and feeding tubes,' said mum Sandra Pastrikos . She said she burst into tears on hearing the great news that her daughter would have a second chance in life and despite the risks, is very positive the procedure will be a success. 'The aim of the surgery is to stop the tet spells and give Dora a chance at a normal life without the oxygen and feeding tubes,' she said. There was elation all around when Dora's family learned off her surgery, posting their delight on Dora's update page on facebook. On Wednesday it read, 'hi everyone! Today we received some fantastic news, Melbourne have decided to operate on Dora!' 'Her operation will be scheduled for some time next week! We are so very happy and we thank everybody for all your support!' 'Please don't stop praying as she still needs to get through the operation and get home.' On Sunday another post to the site where family members said they were glad Dora had got a second chance. Doreen Pastrikos was born with a condition known as Tetralogy of Fallot, which stops the heart delivering enough blood to the lungs, Dora was prevented from having life-saving operation at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital in February because of a severe change in her condition . Dora has surgery scheduled for November 12 by leading cardiac surgery Dr Yves d'Udekem . 'She has proven EVERYONE wrong. We are so happy that she will finally be receiving the procedure she deserves and to be having it done by the same surgeon that saved my sons life with his heart condition seven and a half years ago.' 'DORA you certainly are an angel.' Dora's surgery, scheduled for November 12, is set to be done by leading cardiac surgeon Dr Yves d'Udekem. Earlier in the year, the director of medical services at RDH Dr Sara Watson confirmed that the patient (Doreen) was being treated appropriately under the care of local senior specialists in conjunction with interstate specialists. Ms Watson also said, 'In what looked like a positive sign of hope for the family, doctors had come forward with an offer to perform the surgery just three weeks ago, but that has since lapsed because of a high chance it could leave the six-month-old with brain damage.'","Darwin parents win fight to get their one year old daughter lifesaving surgery .

"An entire high school class in Germany is being investigated after the teenage pupils allegedly started greeting each other with 'Heil Hitler' and communicating in Nazi slogans. Parents and authorities are horrified after it emerged that some of the 29 student have been swapping Nazi sayings and slogans throughout the school day on instant messaging-app WhatsApp. Photos of students aged 14 and 15 at a school near Leipzig in east Germany show them giving Nazi salutes and wearing Hitler moustaches. Horrific: A photograph of one of the male students in class 9A at the Landsberg School near Leipzig, east Germany, shows him raising his right arm in a Nazi salute . Students in class 9A at the Landsberg Gymnasiums near Leipzig regularly made anti-Jewish slurs on the messaging app, while praising Hitler as a 'great man,' local media reported. Photos appeared in Germany's biggest newspaper BILD on Tuesday showing individuals giving the Hitler salute. One boy who was wearing a stuck-on Hitler moustache had his face blacked out. One of the messages from a student made a Holocaust joke that read: 'Why did Hitler kill himself? The Jews sent him the gas bill.' Parents of students in the class are outraged at the reports, saying it is unlikely an entire class of teenagers would be involved and that the media is tarnishing all 29 students with the same brush. Eli Gampel, 54, who has a son in the class, said: 'These discussions about the Nazi class from Landsberg are a load of rubbish. I thought it was a bad dream when I opened newspapers and read the article.' Fear: Parents are in shock after media reports that all 29 students in the class, boys and girls ages 14 and 15, appear to have been engaging in the behaviour on WhatsApp . Disgusting: Screen grabs from the WhatsApp conversations see students use 'Sieg Heil' phrase, right . Photos of 14 and 15-year-old students show them giving Nazi salutes and wearing Hitler moustaches . Gampel, the former head of the local Halle Jewish Community, said his son had experienced harassment at the school. 'My son told me that someone had stuck a far-right NPD [National Democratic Party] sticker on his jacket. It was well known, it seems, that he was Jewish.' 'I have made a formal complaint with police for an investigation, but on the other hand it would definitely be the wrong thing to simply accuse the entire class and tar them with the same brush.' He said: 'Even after I read about it, I found it difficult to get him to talk about what went on. It was only through a lengthy discussion that he admitted what was in the newspaper article was essentially true.' A spokesman the state educational affairs minister in Saxony-Anhalt said: 'I am shocked. If this is true there can only be one way forward here: zero tolerance!' The WhatsApp exchanges have been handed over to police and prosecutors. In shock: The school, Landsberg Gymnasiums near Leipzig, where the teenagers all study . The school headmaster Lutz Feudel said the entire school had been shocked, and that the secret Nazi sympathisers were confined to one class. Getting to the bottom of how it happened would be difficult because the autumn break had already started, he said. He said the parents of two of the children involved had been invited to a discussion together with their children, but that a third who they wanted to speak to was on holiday in Spain. He said he did not want instantly accuse the children, saying: 'Breaking taboos is part of young adulthood. I don't believe that they wanted to actively promote neo-Nazi ideology.' Any public display of Nazi symbols, salutes or phrases is a strictly forbidden act in modern-day Germany, and a first offence can carry a penalty of up to six months in jail. All the class students, like all children in Germany, have visited a Nazi concentration camp and regularly learn about the excesses of the Third Reich in classes. Police said two teenagers are under investigation  while a more extensive probe gets underway next week when the school reopens after the half-term break. Media reports said a psychologist has been arranged to meet with the children, teachers and their parents next week to try to get to the bottom of the fascination with Nazism. Neo-Nazi groups significantly stepped up their recruitment of children in recent years. The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern near Berlin has started carrying out background checks on would-be kindergarten employees after it was discovered several had been infiltrated by far-right females.","Year 9 class thought to have been communicating in 'Nazi slogans'

She said Mr Evans had fallen asleep in an armchair when morning approached and some condoms had fallen out of his pocket. She added: 'I got my lipstick out and drew a penis on his face. It was done for a laugh.' Miss Barrows said that when Evans woke up, he had seen the funny side of it. She also nodded off and woke to find a row going on. She said: 'It was just silly boy banter between Anthony and Tom. 'Anthony was saying about who was stronger than who. It was a joke. They were friends.' Miss Barrows said Mr Thompson had been trying to wind Evans up, while Evans was not reacting and was trying to calm things down. After people started to leave, she heard scuffling outside and found Mr Thompson on the ground when she got downstairs. Peter Clement, prosecuting, said that when Evans woke up he seemed to take the drawing on his face in 'good spirits'. As the banter continued, Mr Thompson was heard to say in bravado: 'I can knock any one of you blokes out.' Evans replied: 'You couldn't knock me out.' Mr Clement added: 'That set off a chain of events.' The trial continues.

"A Paris court ruled Friday in favor of a French auction house that plans to sell dozens of Native American tribal masks despite pleas from Arizona’s Hopi people, friends to the tribe like actor Robert Redford, and even from the U.S. government. After a saga  that began around a century ago, these intricate masks—which are fed and nurtured by the Hopi like the living dead—will be auctioned off to the highest bidder worlds away from where they began their journey in the deserts of Arizona. The potentially landmark decision with transatlantic repercussions means the sale can go ahead at Drouot auction house Friday afternoon, giving a rare glimpse of the ornate masks and headdresses to the European crowd. Scroll down for video . Ancient: Despite pleas from the Hopi people of Arizona that considers them sacred, 70 ancient masks and headdresses were OK'd for sale by a French court Friday . The Hopi Indians insist the masks, known as 'katsinam' are spiritual vessels that date back to the late 19th century and early 20th century were stolen from a northern Arizona reservation in the 1930s and 1940s. Numbering nearly 20,000, many remaining Hopi still lead a traditional way of life on three isolated Arizona mesas and believe the masks carry with them the spirit of divine messenger. The auctioneer argued that blocking the sale would have tremendous implications and potentially force French museums to empty their collections . ‘This decision is very disappointing since the masks will be sold and dispersed,’ said the tribe's French lawyer, Pierre Servan-Schreiber, outside the courtroom. ‘The Hopi tribe will be extremely . saddened by the decision,’ he said. ‘Especially since the judgment . recognizes that these masks have a sacred value. The judge considers . that the imminent damage (to the masks) is not sufficiently strong.’ Rare: European crowds got a rare glimpse of the uniquely American 'katsinam' masks April 11 in Paris ahead of the court's decision . Sacred: The antique masks like the 'Hemiskatsinmana,' left, and 'Angwusnasomtaqa,' right, will be auctioned off Friday afternoon in Paris, worlds away from their Arizona origins, where the Hopi say they were stolen in the 1930s and 1940s . American ambassador to France Charles Rivkin expressed his disappointment over Friday’s ruling after writing a letter to the French government Thursday that urged the sale be suspended due to the ‘importance of these sacred objects to the Hopi Nation.’ The Hopis' lawyers have filed a request with the Council of Sales, the French auction market authority, to suspend the sale, he added. A spokeswoman for the Council of Sales declined immediate comment. Criminal: Actor Robert Redford, a 'friend' to the Hopi, decried the sale as a 'criminal gesture' with 'grave moral consequences' Divine: Hopi say the masks, like the pictured 'Acoma,' are imbued with divine spirits and treat them as the 'living dead' Gilles Neret-Minet, of the Neret-Minet Tessier & Sarrou auction house behind the auction, said he would stop short of any triumphalism over the ruling, ‘but I'm happy that French law was respected.’ ‘I am also very concerned about the Hopis' sadness, but you cannot break property law,’ he said. ‘These are in (private) collections in Europe: they are no longer sacred.’ Neret-Minet said the auction house has received ‘serious threats’ ahead of the auction. Indignant: The Paris auction house where the masks will be auctioned Friday called the masks 'no longer sacred' Worth it? The striking masks of wood, horsehair, leather, and feathers are expected to fetch upwards of $66,000 . Last week, in an interview with Indian . Country Today Media Network, Neret-Minet was emphatic in his belief that . the objects' meaning had little sway for him or France. 'France is a country of rights! All the mail in the world will not change anything,' he said. 'Those masks are only sacred when used in a dance. They are not sacred afterward.' The 70 objects, mainly Hopi, went on display at Druout for the first time as the court battle kicked off Thursday. Unheeded: Outcries over the sale of the masks (pictured are the 'Sio Hemis Cachina,' left, and 'Tasavu,' right) were heard Thursday and Friday from the U.S. ambassador to France, two American museums, as well as the Hopi people . The masks are undoubtedly striking — surreal faces made from wood, leather, horse hair and feathers — and painted in vivid pigments of red, blue, yellow and orange. Hopi representatives contend the items were stolen at some point, and wanted the auction house to prove otherwise. They say the masks have a special status and are more than art, representing their dead ancestors' spirits. Disputes over art ownership, demands for restitution, and arguments over whether sacred objects should be sold are nothing new. Take the continuing row between the British Museum and Greece over the Elgin marbles, which Scottish diplomat Lord Elgin removed from the Parthenon in the 19th century. Greece wants them back; but opponents fear that would open the floodgates, forcing Western museums to send home thousands of artifacts. Sad: Hopi lawyers said the tribe, numbering around 20,000, will be 'extremely saddened by the decision'","The Hopi tribe of Arizona treat such masks as the 'living dead' and claim the items in Paris were stolen nearly 100 years ago .

"A fundamentalist Christian church at the centre of a multi-million-pound dispute over charitable status is being investigated about claims of child cruelty. The Exclusive Brethren, which has 16,000 UK followers, has gained the support of more than 50 MPs in its bid to retain its charitable status – and the entitlement to tax relief on donations. But this newspaper has uncovered allegations of a shocking regime inside Exclusive Brethren schools – including pupils being confined at home for using the internet, elders tearing pages from textbooks to remove material about gay rights or sexually transmitted diseases, and teenage boys and girls being banned from talking to each other. Regime: Pupils at the strict Wilton Park School, where liaisons are forbidden . Yesterday a local education authority confirmed it was investigating allegations of child cruelty and failures to teach the National Curriculum at an Exclusive Brethren school in Wiltshire. Wilton Park School, near Salisbury, opened in  September 2011 as an independent day school for boys and girls aged from 11 to 18. The probe, by Wiltshire County Council, local police officers and the Department for Education’s Due Diligence Team was triggered by a teacher at Wilton Park handing over a dossier describing alleged abuses. These claims include the punishments imposed upon six pupils for setting up a Facebook page. Elders from the church are said to have responded so harshly because of the Exclusive Brethren’s teachings on modern technology – laptops are considered instruments of evil and internet access is tightly controlled to protect followers from defiling material. Pupils are also banned from emailing each other because, according to a school memo, ‘such communications promote special friendships and are beneath the dignity of our calling’. The dossier states that, on the elders’ instruction, six pupils were withdrawn, confined to their homes and forbidden to have any communication with anyone outside their close families. Inside the Exclusive Brethren community these punishments are called ‘shutting up’. The teacher, who is not a member of the Exclusive Brethren, wrote: ‘As an employee I have known of families that have been “shut up’’ for different lengths of time. I have never witnessed pupils being shut up before. Faith school: Wilton Park School says it has a 'strong Christian ethos designed . to protect our students from the less desirable aspects of modern . society' ‘The pupils were shut up between the months of May and July 2012. The only girl was shut up for the longest number of days and was recorded to have had 37 days off out of a possible 70 [school] days between May 4th and July 22nd [when the school term ended]. All of her absences were recorded as authorised absences. ‘She was not allowed to have any communication with anyone apart from immediate family members, i.e. those who she shared a house with. She suffered both mentally and physically from this controlled withdrawal from her friends; she lost weight and was emotionally distressed. ‘When it was decided that she would be allowed back to school, it was controlled by the EB [Exclusive Brethren] elders. She was dropped off and escorted into a classroom. 'She remained there with work to do all day. She was not allowed to have contact with anyone apart from one or two teachers. They were not allowed to have any form of conversation with her unless it was study related. ‘At the end of the day she was picked up by a parent and taken home. She remained in her home until the following school day.’ A Brethren spokesman said: ‘Shutting up is not intended as a punishment but is meant to encourage people to consider the consequences of their actions. Where young persons are involved this decision is taken ultimately by their parents, though the advice of elders may be sought. ‘The trustees – all Brethren – decide what is best for the school based on their religious and moral beliefs.’ The six pupils were in Wilton Park’s sixth form. These boys and girls, aged 16 to 18, are subjected to gender segregation at all times – to reflect the school’s commitment to biblical values. Liaisons and relationships between pupils are prohibited and monitored using CCTV. Other stipulations include teenagers being forbidden to attend university or public events such as Premiership football matches. Pupils seldom play any competitive sport and have been banned from playing rugby by the church’s Australian leadership. As the dossier compiled by the Wilton Park teacher reads: ‘The sixth-form boys at the school are a very athletic group and they wanted to start playing full-contact rugby. They put forward a very articulate and well-thought-through presentation as to why they felt this was necessary. The trustees told them they would come back with an answer within 24 hours. ‘Their answer, as dictated to them by “Australia”, was clear that full-contact rugby should not be played as it promotes savagery. So for Exclusive Brethren schools in the UK, decisions are no longer made locally or even nationally.’ Teaching staff at Wilton Park must also abide by strict codes of conduct and dress, as set out by the school: ‘Female staff must wear dresses or skirts (at least knee-length) and clothing must be modest and not revealing or low-cut.’ Male teachers must have short hair and shave. The launch of the investigation comes just weeks before the Exclusive Brethren’s appeal against the Charity Commission is heard by a legal tribunal. The Commission recently decided the church did not qualify for charitable status. Unless the verdict is overturned, the Exclusive Brethren stands to lose its entitlement to tax relief. As a charity, the church currently claims 25p from the Inland Revenue for every £1 received in donations under the Gift Aid scheme. The case is worth so much to the church that it has spent £1.5 million on a legal campaign. THE five-day tribunal in March will hear evidence about the church’s charitable works. But other witnesses, including former members of the Exclusive Brethren, may gave their testimonies from behind screens – such is their fear of the potential consequences. An Education Department spokeswoman confirmed she was aware of the dossier and added: ‘We are working with police and local council to take any action necessary.’ A spokesman for Wiltshire Council said: ‘An allegation has been received in relation to this school. ‘The council is committed to protecting and safeguarding every child in Wiltshire. We take all allegations of child abuse seriously.’ 'Sensitive': Pupils at Linton Park in an English lesson . AS part of our investigation, The Mail on Sunday was given unprecedented access to another Exclusive Brethren school. All 192 pupils at Linton Park School, near Maidstone, Kent, come from Exclusive Brethren families – in keeping with the church’s stance of separation from the community, including other Christian groups. The pupils are aged from seven to 18. Deputy head teacher John Welch admitted that his staff – who don’t belong to the controversial church –  censor books to remove content that the school’s trustees consider incompatible with their faith. Deputy head:  John Welch admitted his staff censor books . He also admitted the Exclusive Brethren’s stance on issues such as gay rights and abortion made teaching ‘delicate’. Mr Welch, a former policeman, said: ‘I’ve been working in Brethren schools since 2001 so by now I know the areas that are sensitive. But today I still have to get approval for resources such as DVDs. Blasphemy is another area so we blank out any swear words. ‘Recently I was teaching post-1945 British history and the legalisation by Harold Wilson’s government of abortion and homosexuality. Many communities would say these were advances in society, the Brethren would not. It is delicate.’ According to pupil Nathan Woodcock, 15, his community is being unfairly targeted. He said: ‘We do a lot of work for the public benefit and I really enjoy helping the less fortunate. For instance, we put on “Pie Days”, when the homeless come to our meeting hall and we feed them. 'The public don’t understand we only eat and drink with people with whom we share the Lord’s Supper.’ The Exclusive Brethren, which has 16,000 followers in the UK and 46,000 worldwide, formed in 1848. In that year they broke off from the much larger Plymouth Brethren – an evangelical Christian church founded in 1832. The church’s worldwide leader Bruce Hales, based in Sydney, Australia, assumed the leadership after the death of his father. Hales preaches that the world is ‘evil’ and that separation from it is the ‘greatest thing that the Lord has provided’. Imposing: The Brethren Assembly Hall built next to the school . Leading man: Bruce Hales (third from left), who leads the 40,000 members of the Exclusive Brethren . Since publication of this article the school closed for a month but reopened after being cleared by an investigation into claims that pupils were punished for using Facebook. Wilton Park School, run by fundamentalist Christians, the Exclusive Brethren, shut in February after an anonymous teacher made claims including that sixth-formers were disciplined after accessing the social networking site.  The teacher also claimed that textbooks at the school near Salisbury, Wiltshire were censored to remove material about gay rights and evolution, and that social interaction between boys and girls was banned. Now Wiltshire County Council states: ‘It has been unanimously agreed by all agencies involved that no specific safeguarding issues were identified and the investigation has now concluded’. A letter from the Council to the school described the concerns as ‘unfounded’. A statement from the school says: ‘Wilton Park School is delighted that the Local Education Authority, the Department of Education, and the Wiltshire Police have unanimously agreed that there were not safeguarding issues at the school after the enquiry that followed an anonymous complaint about its pastoral care. The school has now re-opened with the strengthened resolve on the part of both the teaching staff and pupils to maintain the standard of excellence that characterises Focus schools. •         We are happy to confirm that, contrary to our article on January 20, boy and girl pupils are not segregated at all times and pupils play competitive sport.","School investigated over allegations of child cruelty and failure to teach the National Curriculum .

"The arrest of ‘femme fatale’ spy Anna Chapman in America was the trigger for MI5 to target a Russian blonde having an affair with an MP in the UK, it was alleged yesterday. Katia Zatuliveter, 26, was accused of spying only when the British Secret Service decided it ‘had better see’ if there were other Moscow-backed women using sex to ensnare powerful men, a court heard. MI5, it is claimed, swiftly believed the Commons research assistant had been recruited by the Russians as a teenager and ‘worked her way through significant men to get secrets’. Laughing and joking: Katia Zatuliveter (C), 26, walks with her lawyers to the immigration hearing in London today . But Miss Zatuliveter was really targeted because she had ‘many similarities’ with Chapman, a deportation tribunal heard. This is because both Russians were ‘young, attractive and adept networkers’. Miss Zatuliveter admits having an . affair with Mike Hancock, 65, the MP for Portsmouth South and a then . member of the Commons defence select committee. But her lawyers insist MI5 had decided . she must be a spy simply because Mr Hancock was ‘pro-Russian’ and ‘had . vulnerabilities in his private life’. Femme fatale: Russian spy Anna Chapman . Yesterday a woman MI5 officer known as . witness ZZ said Russian intelligence would have marked Mr Hancock out . ‘as a good candidate’ to be targeted by a female Russian spy. As well as having an affair with Mr Hancock, Miss Zatuliveter admits being sexually involved with an unnamed Nato official. Tim Owen QC, for Miss Zatuliveter, said these two affairs were ‘the crux of the security services case against her’. He added: ‘Your case is that she has been an agent since 17 or 18 and working her way through significant men to get secrets.’ Giving evidence from behind a curtain, . the MI5 agent admitted these points were part of the case against Miss . Zatuliveter but could not be discussed ‘in open’ session. They will be . considered in a closed session of the hearing by special . security-cleared advocates. The FBI arrested Chapman in June 2010, . and Miss Zatuliveter was stopped for questioning at Gatwick airport in . August the same year. Miss Zatuliveter was appearing for the . second day before the tribunal in a bid to remain in the UK. The . Government wants to deport her on the grounds her presence is a danger . to national security. Spy links: Miss Zatuliveter was compared to her compatriot Anna Chapman, and it was said that it would not be obvious that either worked for Russian intelligence . Similarities: Anna Chapman was likened to Miss Zatuliveter because they were both 'young and adept networkers' ZZ said she was familiar with the . Chapman case in the U.S. She said: ‘The security services case is there . are similarities but not by any means the same.’ She said one difference is the FBI ‘has found an evidential case which could be described in open in a criminal prosecution.’ Mr Owen said: ‘The difference is the FBI has got some evidence. Yes?’ The MI5 officer replied: ‘I’m unable to disclose what is in the closed case, but there is a closed case.’ Mr Owen asked her: ‘Your decision to . become interested in Miss Zatuliveter in 2010 was entirely because of . Anna Chapman, wasn’t it?’ The agent denied the suggestion. Married: Mike Hancock pictured at his house in Fareham, Hampshire, with his Jacqueline . The hearing was told Miss Chapman had an ‘obvious route’ into espionage, as her father was involved in Russian Intelligence. ZZ said: ‘To ordinary members of the . public, to someone who meets Miss Chapman or Miss Zatuliveter in public, . it wouldn’t be obvious they were working for the Russian Intelligence . services.’ Mr Owen asked ZZ: ‘Are you saying . this woman was able to co-exist for four years in a relationship with . Mike Hancock, genuinely loving him…but all the time acting in secret . with the Russian Intelligence Service?' ZZ said: ‘I’m afraid I’ve gone as far as I can in open [session] on this question.’ Mr Owen also referred to a statement . from Miss Zatuliveter’s brother in law who said he thought it unlikely . she was a spy as she was often ill and unlikely to be able to cope with . the ‘pressure’ of espionage. Miss Zatuliveter began working for Mr Hancock in 2006, later getting a Commons pass and moving into his London flat. The hearing continues.

"Let's hope they kept both hands on the wheel! A new survey has found that 11 percent of drivers have had sex while driving. The online questionnaire attempted to discover how much 'living' goes on in people’s cars – whether it be eating, using their phone or having sex. Driving sexy: 11% of U.S. adults participating in the survey admit to having sex in their cars . Those aged 35 to 44 were the leading age group for acknowledging their sexual exploits in moving cars. The Scout GPS survey, which involved around 2,000 people found men were three times more likely to admit to participating in sexual activity than women (17 percent and 5 percent respectively). Men were also twice as likey to flirt with another driver. 10% have applied makeup and somehow 4% even admitted to reading a book behing the wheel. Driven to distraction: 10% have applied makeup and 9% have flirted with another driver . Having a meal was also something people admitted to doing whilst in the driver's seat - and not just a sandwich or a burger that would only require the use of one hand, but 19% said they had eaten something that required a knife and fork. The survey also revealed some intriguing figures on what people would get up to if no-one was watching. Nine percent of respondents said they’d drive naked, 15 percent said they would have sex, 30 percent said they would pick their noses and 54 percent admitted they would sing out loud. Some disturbing trends were revealed about the use of cellphones with 19 percent of participants admitting they had checked social media, email, or played games whilst driving. 60 percent confirmed they had used a phone in some capacity. Shaving while driving was the most dangerous activity. Of those who confessed to shaving in the survey, almost one-in-five said they had actually been in an accident.

"Success: Cardiff Sixth Form College saw 94.7 per cent of their 112 A-level pupils pass with grades A* and A . An obscure fee-paying college in South Wales has beaten top public schools such as Marlborough and Rugby to become the country’s top private school for A-levels. Cardiff Sixth Form College has more than 330 students from 32 countries, including high-fliers from the local community who study for free. This summer 112 pupils took A-levels, 94 of them from countries such as China, Russia and Albania, including several receiving sponsorship from their governments for the £29,700 fees for boarders. Eighteen were home students on full academic scholarships which cover their £12,000-a-year day pupil fees, with some drawn from schools in the South Wales region. Today the Independent Schools Council league table of 350 fee-paying schools reveals pupils at the college passed 94.7 per cent of A-levels with grades A* and A. Almost all the remaining grades were Bs, with just one pupil handed a single C. Yasmin Sarwar, executive director of the college, attributed the school’s success to dedicated teachers – mainly drawn from the state sector – and a tough selection process for pupils. Entry requirements for British students are six A*s at GCSE, although most have between eight and ten A*s. Mrs Sarwar added: ‘We have got students from all around the world who are ambitious, and we combine that with the best from Britain. ‘One thing my head girl said in her speech was that she would never in a million years have thought her best friend would be someone from Hong Kong. ‘She’s from Caerphilly. That sums up the environment.’ Students also have the benefit of being taught in small groups  and are encouraged to take  part in school Olympiads – international subject competitions – to stretch them beyond the A-level syllabus. Entry requirements for the sixth form (not pictured) are six A*s at GCSE, though most have six to eight . More than 100 leading schools – including Eton, Harrow and Westminster – opt out of league tables, amid claims they give parents an incomplete picture of what a school has to offer. Even so the latest rankings reveal how independent schools, such as Marlborough in Wiltshire, the Duchess of Cambridge’s alma mater, look set to tighten their grip on prestigious universities. The number of privately educated pupils achieving three or more A*s leapt 22 per cent on last year to 2,311, with boys more likely to achieve the feat than girls. The highest-achieving state school which contributed to A-level league tables published last week was Queen Elizabeth’s School in Barnet, Hertfordshire, a boys’ grammar, where pupils passed 95.97 per cent of exams at grades A*, A or B.","Cardiff Sixth Form College has more than 330 students from 32 countries .

"A baby is being born to a refugee fleeing the civil war in Syria every hour, the United Nations warned today as it launched a £500million appeal to help Syrian children. More than 21,000 Syrian babies have been born as refugees since the crisis began nearly three years ago with many living in appalling conditions amid the freezing temperatures of winter in makeshift camps. The shocking figures were given by the UN’s children’s organisation Unicef with a warning that more had to be done to help the babies and children of the civil war if a ‘disaster’ is to be avoided. Shocking figures: More than 21,000 babies have been born to Syrian refugees since the civil war began three years ago. A young child is pictured crying at a refugee camp in Arsal in Lebanon . Vulnerable: Of the 2.2 million Syrian refugees, more than a million of them are believed to be children. Refugees are pictured at the Quru Gusik camp on the outskirts of Arbil, in Iraq's Kurdistan region . It is estimated that more than a million children are among the 2.2 million Syrians who have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries with the most babies being born in Lebanon where conditions are particularly bleak. With snow falling regularly and many of the refugees living in flimsy tented camps, temperatures plunge nightly below freezing causing a rise in cases of pneumonia among children together with respiratory infections. The UN says about 500,000 Syrian children are at risk of contracting polio after missing vaccinations because of the civil war triggering the first polio outbreak in the region for more than a decade. The majority of babies born as refugees do not have their births officially registered meaning they will be more vulnerable to abuse, such as people trafficking and forced child marriage. Only 23 per cent of the 781 babies born in Lebanon to Syrian mothers in October had birth certificates. Risk: Around 500,000 Syrian children face contracting polio after missing vaccinations, pictured being administered at a camp in Raqqa, eastern Syria . Syrian refugees children play with snow outside their tent at a refugee camp in the eastern Lebanese border town of Arsal . Disturbingly, Unicef said the percentage of Caesarean-section deliveries inside Syria has doubled as mothers try to avoid the risk of being unable to reach health centres and hospitals and forced to endure unattended births. They add the same concerns over emergency care are seeing the need for Caesarean deliveries increasing dramatically among women living as refugees outside Syria. Since refugees from Syria began teeming into neighbouring countries, over 2,500 women have given birth to babies in refugee camps in Turkey. Ten babies a day are born to Syrian refugee women in Jordan. In Lebanon, more than 835,000 refugees live in tented camps, unused buildings or with friends or family, according to figures from the UN High Commission for Refugees. The government of the country of just 4.5million people estimates the numbers to be much higher, at around 1million. Unlike in Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, the Lebanese government is not providing facilities or land to temporarily accommodate refugees despite the continuing influx, which has effectively increased the population of the country by 25 per cent. Many Syrians in Lebanon live in appalling conditions, finding shelter in slums, tents and tin shacks strung with laundry lines and wedged between farmland outside towns and cities. Poor winter housing: More than 835,000 refugees live in tented camps, pictured, or unused buildings in Lebanon . A Syrian refugee boy fetches water at a refugee camp in the eastern Lebanese border town of Arsal after heavy snowfall . The turmoil in Syria has torn families apart, with more than 3,700 children in Jordan and Lebanon living without one or both of their parents, or with no adult care-givers at all. By the end of September 2013, UNHCR had registered 2,440 unaccompanied or separated children in Lebanon and 1,320 in Jordan. In some cases the parents have died, been detained, or sent their children into exile alone out of fear for their safety. ‘Some of them are literally speechless because they have seen horrors that affected them so much... they can’t get it out of their mind, and they are highly traumatized,’ UNHCR spokesperson Roberta Russo said. With no end to the conflict in sight and dwindling international support to help Syria’s neighbours cover the costs and burden of providing for influx, many of the refugees now worry about how they are going to survive the winter. ‘We used to be scared of wolves coming inside the tents at night,’ said Umm Mohammad, a 45-year-old refugee from the contested Damascus recently, ‘Now there’s so much more to worry about. ... How will we survive the winter?’ A Syrian refugee boy carries his brother near a butcher's shop at the Zattari Syrian refugee camp in Mafraq city, Jordan .

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan hailed teachers as ‘heroes’ yesterday as she tried to end the bitter battles with the unions fought by her predecessor Michael Gove. Mrs Morgan, appointed to the Cabinet in July to smooth relations with the teaching profession, went out of her way to praise classroom staff for their efforts – and pledged to cut their workload. Unions last night welcomed the change of approach and praised Mrs Morgan for her ‘warm words’. But delegates at the Conservative Party conference showed their appreciation for Mr Gove’s tough stance, giving him an extraordinary standing ovation when Mrs Morgan briefly mentioned him. Scroll down for video . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said she did not want her children taught by exhausted teachers . Embarrassingly, the applause for Mr Gove was noticeably more enthusiastic than that given to Mrs Morgan at the end of her speech. Mrs Morgan praised her predecessor for the ‘passion, conviction and leadership [which] first provided the spark’. She insisted she would be continuing his reforms. Former Education Secretary was given a rapturous reception at the conference after being praised by Mrs Morgan . But she indicated she would adopt a far less confrontational approach to the teaching unions. Mrs Morgan began her speech by praising Britain’s ‘dedicated and inspiring’ teachers, adding: ‘If our school story has a hero, it is them.’ She said she would offer them a ‘new deal’ designed to cut their workload – a key demand of the unions – and added: ‘When I hear of teachers working late into the night marking books, planning lessons, preparing for inspections that may or may not come, I do two things: I marvel at their dedication; but I also think, there must be a better way.’ Mrs Morgan said ministers would work with the unions and carry out a wider consultation among teachers to ‘craft a new deal for teachers that treats them as the professionals they are’. She also signalled a slight shift away from Mr Gove’s focus on academic rigour, which some critics had claimed was too narrow. ‘For too long there has been a false choice between academic standards and activities that build character and resilience,’ she said. ‘But the two should go hand in hand.’ Mrs Morgan said she wanted schools to help young people ‘develop character, resilience and grit’, adding: ‘As much as I want the next generation to be able to solve a quadratic equation, I also want them to be able to make a compelling pitch for a job and to be able to bounce back if things don’t work out.’ Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, welcomed Mrs Morgan’s approach, but said her words needed to be turned into action. ‘This was a well-delivered, well-crafted speech with welcome warm words for the teaching profession,’ she said. ‘Teachers will welcome the recognition that their professional lives are blighted by excessive workload.’ But Mrs Morgan also made it clear that she will continue many of Mr Gove’s reforms, saying the Conservatives were the ‘true progressives in education’. She also announced plans to establish a further 35 free schools.","Tory cabinet minister Nicky Morgan heaps praise on Britain’s 'hero' teachers .

"The parents of Reeva Steenkamp have revealed the reasons behind their torturous decision to accept 'blood money' from Oscar Pistorius after he shot their daughter. June and Barry Steenkamp were given £340 a month by the athlete in a series of deposits that began several weeks after the model's death on Valentine's Day last year. Mrs Steenkamp said the payments made her feel 'uncomfortable' but felt the family had no option after they were declared bankrupt and evicted by their landlord. Her husband had also suffered a stroke as a result of his grief two months after Miss Steenkamp was gunned down. But Mrs Steenkamp has vowed to pay 'every single cent' of the £6,300 total back, declaring: 'My child was priceless. He can't buy her life.' Scroll down for video . 'We had no choice': The parents of Reeva Steenkamp, Barry and June (pictured outside court at Oscar Pistorius's sentencing) said they were forced to accept the athlete's money because they had gone bankrupt . Victim and killer: The Steenkamp's were given £340 a month by the athlete in a series of payments that began several weeks after he shot their daughter Reeva (above) at his Pretoria home on Valentine's Day last year . Mrs Steenkamp told the Daily Mirror: 'We didn’t have much choice. We were in such a bad way, we didn’t even have food on the table. It was that or starve.' The Steenkamps also refused a lump sum payment of £21,000 which he raised from the sale of his car. Mrs Steenkamp said: 'Oscar has made us other offers which we turned down. 'Thankfully now we are in a position where we can say we don't want any money from him.' Details of the payments were initially revealed at the Paralympian's sentencing hearing, to the surprise of many in court, when he was jailed for five years for Miss Steenkamp's manslaughter. Barry Steenkamp suffered a stroke around two months after his daughter was killed as a result of his grief . Mrs Steenkamp has written a book, published this week, called Reeva: A Mother’s Story in which she dismisses outright Pistorius's account of the night he killed her daughter. She said she believes Pistorius shot the 29-year-old dead after a furious row - not, as in the runner's version, fearing that she was a dangerous intruder. 'Oscar's story I don't believe,' she wrote in the book, released weeks after the athlete was found not guilty of murder and sentenced to five years in prison on a lesser manslaughter charge. 'Not one of his actions suggests he felt protective towards her. 'They had a fight, a horrible argument, and she fled to the bathroom with her mobile and locked the door. 'I think he may have shot once and then he had to go on and kill her because she would have been able to tell the world what really happened, what he is really like. 'There is no doubt in our minds: she had decided to leave Oscar that night,' she wrote, adding that Miss Steenkamp had indicated that the pair had not had sex. 'I believe their relationship was coming to an end. In her heart of hearts she didn't think it was making either of them happy.' Take him down: Oscar Pistorius is led away from court after being sentenced to five years in jail for the manslaughter of the 29-year-old model . 'It was Reeva's bad luck that she met him, because sooner or later he would have killed someone. I do believe that.' Mrs Steenkamp also described the desperate pain of not being there to help her daughter in her time of need, of medication to numb the anguish and of her husband Barry's recent stroke. 'In our worst imaginings, we picture how scared she must have been to retreat behind that door, and lock it, with no one to protect her. 'One bullet blew the brains out of her skull.' Miss Steenkamp added that while she forgives Pistorius, she would like to meet him to ask questions. 'I have forgiven him. I have to - that's my religion. But I can't forget what he has done. I hate what he has done to my child.' In the book, Steenkamp describes at length the pain of seven months of tortured court hearings, culminating in a verdict which the state has described as 'shockingly light' and will appeal. 'I felt let down by the justice system,' said Steenkamp. She described Pistorius's account of events as 'vague, evasive and shifty.' 'I was so shocked that he was actually standing there saying not guilty to every single charge. How could he say that when Reeva is dead and he shot her?' 'He has to live for the rest of his life with the knowledge of what he's done.' Prosecutors are appealing the manslaughter verdict and five-year sentence after failing secure a murder conviction.","Steenkamps were paid £340 a month by athlete after he shot their daughter .

"Jaymin Abdulrahman admitted throwing her six-day-old baby girl down a bin chute but had denied her intention had been to kill her . A mother tried to kill her newborn daughter by dropping her more than 40ft down a tower block rubbish chute, a court heard yesterday. Jaymin Abdulrahman is alleged to have ‘completely swaddled’ the baby, put her in the chute, then tidied up her fifth-floor flat. The girl was found – apparently lifeless – by her father later that day. She had suffered severe head and brain injuries, including several skull fractures. During her fall, she had struck a metal deflector plate placed at the foot of the chute to slow items of rubbish. Pieces of a broken Moses basket were found in a bin at the bottom of the chute and bits of wood were discovered inside the flat, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Abdulrahman initially told police that the six-day-old girl had been kidnapped by strangers, the jury heard. The 25-year-old, from Wolverhampton, denies attempted murder, causing grievous bodily harm with intent and inflicting grievous bodily harm. But prosecutor Andrew Smith QC said it was expected that Abdulrahman would accept during the hearing that she put the baby, who cannot be named for legal reasons, into the chute. The jury would hear evidence from two psychiatrists who had assessed her in recent weeks, he said. ‘The prosecution contend that Miss Abdulrahman knew what she was doing when she carried the baby from the flat and dropped her those five floors down the chute,’ Mr Smith said. The defendant’s ‘reason or capacity’ to understand the consequences of her actions had not been removed by any mental illness at the time of the incident, he added. Birmingham Crown Court heard that when the baby hit a metal plate at the bottom of the chute it was travelling at around 32mph. Miraculously it survived but suffered severe brain injuries including several skull fractures . The court was shown computer-generated . images as Mr Smith outlined how a crash test dummy had been used to . reconstruct the baby’s fall, which took 2.2 seconds. Prosecutors said they believe Abdulrahman knew what she was doing and intended to kill the baby . He told the jury: ‘As the police . investigation developed, an expert in accident reconstruction was . instructed to examine how she fell and what type of forces would have . been involved.’ Experiments with a dummy of a . nine-month-old child revealed the vertical drop of 44ft produced an . estimated impact speed with the metal plate of 32mph. ‘In summary, the expert who carried . out these tests was able to conclude that the force with which the baby . would have struck the metal deflector was comparable to having been in a . 30mph car crash without wearing a seat-belt,’ Mr Smith said. ‘The reason why she decided to place her daughter in the rubbish chute may never be known or understood. ‘However, the prosecution say that her . intention can be clearly identified from her actions on that September . afternoon last year. There is unlikely to be any dispute that . Abdulrahman did cause undoubtedly serious injuries. ‘The focus, the prosecution anticipates, will be on the defendant’s state of mind in those crucial minutes. ‘The prosecution anticipates that the . key issue for you in this case will be what did Jaymin Abdulrahman . intend, if anything, when she put her into the rubbish chute. The . prosecution submits in this case that her intention was to kill.’ The baby was found in a large bin wrapped in a piece of material after she was thrown down the rubbish chute .

"Most Premier League footballers these days are more than a little guarded. However, Manchester City players let their defences down when they left some rather revealing doodles behind during a recent press conference in Abu Dhabi. Striker Sergio Aguero, midfielder Fernandinho and goalkeeper Willy Caballero all released their artistic flair during the event. Prof Cary Cooper reckons Sergio Aguero's drawings hint that rivals Chelsea are the devil . Fiery Argentinian ace Aguero unleashed a smoking devil-type creature on his page. While Fernandinho clearly had his eyes on getting out of the press conference and back to training as he neatly drew a football pitch. Goalkeeper Caballero displayed a keen eye as he drew a smart business man walking away from his car at the end of the day. Psychology expert believes Willy Caballero's design shows he is keen on getting on with the job in hand . Professor Cary Cooper, a psychology expert at Lancaster University, believes each design shows a reflection of the person or how they are feeling, . He said: 'I think Aguero's mind might be going to the Premier League match against Chelsea that's coming up. I think Chelsea may be the devil-type character. 'This game coming up is the biggest game for City this season because if they win that game, psychologically it will be more than three points. City is the lion while Chelsea is the devil – and they are after the devil. Prof Cooper, a psychology expert at Lancaster University, believes Fernandinho is focused on the game . 'Caballero's skilled scribblings show his willingness to get on with the job – despite defeat against Arsenal. He added: 'I think this is a perception of himself. He's saying ""I'm in a job just like any other job – I drive to work, I do my job, it's just a game"". He's also a very talented artist. Fernandinho, Cooper says, is: 'Totally focused on football, It does seem like he's tried to incorporate the letterhead into the goalposts, in which case he could be saying we are the current kings and we are going to knock Chelsea off the top.'

"A 1,700-year-old lead tablet with a violent curse inscribed upon it has been discovered by archaeologists in Jerusalem. Found in a wrecked Roman villa, the 'magical tablet' is thought to have been created by a magician. The curse, written in Greek, which calls for help from six gods to punish a man called Iennys, is believed to play a role in a bitter legal dispute and was ordered by a woman named Kyrilla. A 1,700-year-old lead 'magical tablet' (pictured) with a violent curse inscribed upon it, thought to the work of a magician, has been discovered by archaeologists in Jerusalem in a wrecked Roman villa . A translation of the ancient script reads: 'I strike and strike down and nail down . the tongue, the eyes, the wrath, the ire, the anger, the . procrastination, the opposition of Iennys.' She asks the gods to make sure that Iennys is 'in no way oppose, so that he say or perform nothing adverse to Kyrilla...but rather that Iennys, whom the womb bore, be subject to her'. Robert Walter Daniel, of the Institut für Altertumskunde at the University of Cologne said in a study, published in the journal Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphi, that a professional magician probably created the curse for Kyrilla, as the small script on the tablet is . rapid and fluent, suggesting practice at inscribing leaden tablets. A translation reads: 'I strike and strike down and nail down the tongue, the eyes, the wrath, the ire, the anger, the procrastination, the opposition of Iennys' 'While the words might be purely metaphorical, it seems more likely that Kyrilla actually used a hammer and nail(s) while carrying out a magical rite designed to enhance the efficacy of thecurse,' the study said. Professor Daniel wrote: 'If she hammered and nailed several objects, they might have symbolised the seven items in the list of . Iennys’ body parts and behaviours. 'If it was just a single . object, then it probably symbolised the first item in that list - Iennys’ tongue - or more generally the person of Iennys. Whatever this object . was, it was probably not the leaden sheet itself.' To . judge from the tablet's physical condition, it was neither pounded with a hammer . nor pierced with nails, but merely has the type of damage that occurs to leaden tablets . while laying in the ground or during opening. Horizontal creases show that the tablet . was folded from the bottom to the top between eight and ten times. The archaeologists believe both Iennys and Kyrilla were probably members of the Roman middle or upper class at war with each other over a legal matter, as the curse bears some resemblance to other tablets discovered in Cyprus that were also used in legal cases. The tablet was recovered from a ruined . Roman mansion and suggests that the occupants of the building were . wealthy, as several gems were found at the . site alongside other decorative objects including the marble bust of a boxer. The discovery of the mansion and its contents provides firsthand archaeological evidence of the southward expansion of the Roman occupation over the southern part of Jerusalem in the late third century AD, Professor Daniel wrote. The ancient Tower of David at the Jaffa Gate entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem, is pictured . Come to me, you who are in the earth, chthonic daemon, you who rule and bind, Abrasax; come,Hecate, three-form queen, Ereschigal; come to me, king Pluto, by your great name Yesemmigadon;come to me, chthonic Earth and chthonic Hermes and Pluto and queen Persephone. I strike andstrike down and nail down the tongue, the eyes, the wrath, the ire, the anger, the procrastination,the opposition of Iennys, whom the womb bore, so that he in no way oppose, so that he say orperform nothing adverse to Kyrilla, whom the womb bore, but rather that Iennys, whom the wombbore, be subject to her. Lady Phersephoneia, fulfi ll this perfect spell. (magical signs and letters) The tablet was found in the northwest part of the building, which is believed to . be around 2,000 square metres, along with pieces of mosaic and fragments of frescoes . as well as a decorated box full of carved bone pieces. The curse calls upon six gods (including Hermes - a statue is pictured) to help settle Kyrilla's legal score with Iennys . Archaeologists told LiveScience that a female figurine - possibly that of a goddess - was also recovered by the Israel Antiquities Authority and could have been used in a private cult of people living in the huge mansion. While they are unsure of the purpose of the room, on the first floor of the house, . Professor Daniel said it could have been a place where Iennys lived or . worked, so the curse was close to him, or the room was near to a courtroom. The house was a large peristyle building of the Late Roman period has been unearthed on the northern part of the hill in Jerusalem known as the City of David during excavations that started in 2007 and are still continuing. Archaeological evidence suggests that the structure came to a violent end, as the latest coins found under the collapse of different rooms are from the year 363 AD, suggesting that the building was ruined as a consequence of the earthquake that occurred in Palestine on May 18 of the same year. 'No single coin retrieved from secure loci inside the building is dated later than 363 AD,' the study said. The discovery of the mansion and its contents provides firsthand archaeological evidence of the southward expansion of the Roman occupation over the southern part of Jerusalem in the late third century, Professor Daniel wrote.","The 'magical tablet' was found in a huge Roman villa in Jerusalem that was probably destroyed by an earthquake in 363 AD .

"A mother who sexually abused her own six and eight-year-old daughters with a boyfriend has been sentenced to 30 years in prison by a judge who declared her 'the vilest b**** that I have ever met'. Amanda Arellano, 29, pleaded guilty to rape and aggravated child molestation on Thursday in Bibb County Superior Court, Georgia. Among the horrific abuse she committed with 30-year-old boyfriend Daniel Kelly Copeland, the mother admitted to holding one of her girls down so her partner could rape the child. Amanda Arellano, 29, was jailed for 30 years in Georgia on Thursday for the rape of her own daughters, aged six and eight. Her boyfriend was previously sentenced for the sex attacks. The judge said this week there was 'a special place in hell' for people like Arellano . Daniel Kelly Copeland, 30, was sentenced to 25 years in 2012 for raping two girls . The sexual abuse took place on the little girls three years ago when the couple decided to bring the children 'into their sexual behaviors as a couple', The Telegraph reported. Details of the case left many in the courtroom in tears as they heard details of how the sisters were forced to take part in sex acts with the couple and photographs were taken of the sordid acts. The children were also forced to watch the pedophiles have sex. 'This is how men show you they love you,' Arellano reportedly told one of the girls. The vile abuse took place between September 1, 2011, and January 18, 2012. The crimes took place at the couple's home in Macon, Georgia along another home and an abandoned trailer. Arellano was due to stand trial next week but she pleaded guilty with prosecutors agreeing to the plea to spare the children the torment of testifying about the abuse. Copeland was jailed for 25 years for child rape in 2012 after his father called the police when his son admitted to abusing the girls. The mother will spend 30 years in jail and was registered for life as a sex offender. She whispered apologies to the court on Thursday to which Judge Howard Simms reportedly responded: 'Ms. Arellano, I don’t know that I have ever said a curse word from this bench but you may be the vilest b**** that I have ever met.' He added that 'hell had a special place' for those who committed crimes like Arellano. It's not the judge's first brush with controversy. He was caught drink-driving in October 2012 and entered rehab but did not resign from the bench. He was reprimanded by the officers who stopped him in Bibb County but was not charged. He told 13WMAZ: 'It has been hard and a difficult process but also the most rewarding year of my life. I've reconnected with a family I ignored and got a lot more involved in the things that I do, and my life from day to day.' Simms ran for re-election to the Macon Judicial Circuit, Georgia. He won without opposition in May this year.

"Fraudster: Jonathan Thompson, 35, has been jailed for four months after completing just one hour of a 100 hour community service order . A convicted fraudster who only completed one hour of a community service order because it made him feel too depressed - has been jailed. Jonathan Thompson, 35, was given 100 hours of unpaid work after admitting conspiracy to defraud in June last year. He was part of a group who pretended to order goods online and then claimed refunds from Royal Mail when the phantom parcels were not delivered. He received the 12-month community sentence after admitting taking part in the scam and allowing his address to be used. But Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard yesterday that Thompson had only completed one hour of unpaid work after suffering with depression. Judge Paul Glenn told him he had treated the order with ‘complete contempt’ and re-sentenced him to four months in prison. He said: 'He is making no attempt whatsoever to deal with this court order. 'He had the shot across the bows in January. He knew what was expected of him. I accept you have some form of depression. So do an awful lot of people. 'The reality is you do not fancy doing some work for nothing. The original offence was serious. You have treated this order with complete contempt. You have willfully and persistently refused to comply with it.' The court heard the probation service had . applied for the order to be revoked in January this year, saying it was . unworkable due to Thompson’s health. Sentenced: Thompson was jailed after the judge said he had shown  'complete contempt' for the community service order. Criminals are seen here carrying out community service (stock picture) But Recorder Bal Dhaliwal refused to revoke the order and told Thompson, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, to re-engage or risk going to prison. He breached the order again by failing to report for community service on March 2 and March 16. Defending Thompson, Catherine O’Reilly said he had no previous convictions before he became involved in the Royal Mail conspiracy. But the court heard he had since assaulted his wife in December last year - for which he received a community order with 18 months supervision. Miss O’Reilly said: 'He is clearly suffering from depression of some form or another.","Jonathan Thompson, 35, given 100 hours community service last year .

"Russian Orthodox Church spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin said Russia should not be dictated to by liberal Western values . The Orthodox Church in Russia has demanded a national referendum on criminalising gay relationships in a move certain to deepen conflict with the West. The demand comes less than a month before the start of the Winter Olympics in Sochi when a number of participants and visitors are expected to stage protests against laws banning the promotion of homosexuality to young people. President Vladimir Putin - who signed the legislation into force - has promised to make sure that gay and lesbian 'athletes, fans and guests feel comfortable at the Olympic Games.' The spokesman for the church - which . is seen as close to Putin - said Russia should not be dictated to by . liberal Western values, and urged a referendum on a return to a Soviet . law enacted by Stalin which criminalised homosexuality. 'There is no question that society should discuss this issue since we live in a democracy,' said Vsevolod Chaplin. 'For this reason, it is . precisely the majority of our people and not some outside powers that . should decide what should be a criminal offence and what should not.' He . urged in an interview with pro-Kremlin Izvestia website:  'I am . convinced that such sexual contacts should be completely excluded from . the life of our society.

"Jailed: Leanne Black has made multiple false allegations of rape against a series of ex-boyfriends over the past eight years . A woman who made a string of false rape allegations against five men in eight years was behind bars last night. Leanne Black, 32, repeatedly cried rape with bogus sex assault reports to police after rowing or breaking up with her former partners. In one case, Black claimed she had been drugged and raped. In another she told police a boyfriend kidnapped and molested her. A court heard that her innocent partners would have faced up to five years in jail if they had been found guilty of such serious sexual allegations. However, Black was herself jailed for two years, with a judge condemning her actions, telling her that genuine rape victims would be undermined by her lies. The court heard that, in the most recent case in March, her boyfriend Kevin Crowley was held on suspicion of rape after he had called police to report she had thrown plates at him in their flat. David Wooler, prosecuting, said officers arrived at the scene of the domestic argument at the home shared by Black and her boyfriend – and she turned the tables on him. Mr Wooler said: ‘When she was questioned by police she told them her boyfriend had raped her while she slept at his flat. ‘It was the most recent in a number of repeated false rape allegations against men since 2005.’Newport Crown Court heard that, in June 2005, Black had  made a rape allegation but the case did not proceed. In July 2006, she accused her then . partner of raping her twice and also claimed she had been kidnapped and . raped. In 2009, she claimed she had been the victim of a serious sexual . assault. And in 2010, she fabricated a story . about being drugged and raped. Then, earlier this year, she made the . accusations against Mr Crowley. But she finally owned up, admitting one count of perverting the course of justice against Mr Crowley. Judge William Gaskell told Black, of . Cwmbran, South Wales, she had made it more difficult for genuine rape . victims to be believed. He said: ‘Police have to take all allegations of . rape very seriously. Trial: Black was sentenced to two years in prison after pleading guilty at Newport Crown Court, pictured . ‘Rape, when it happens, has a devastating effect for victims and causes great trauma. Many women never get over it. ‘Women who make false allegations like you undermine the whole system and police investigations. ‘It undermines the public’s belief in the truth when allegations are truthfully made.’ Gareth Driscoll, defending, said Black had entered an early guilty plea and made a full admission. She will serve half her sentence before being released on licence. Inspector Rory Waring, of Gwent . Police, said the sentence should act as a warning to anyone thinking . about making false allegations of rape. He said: ‘As well as causing distress . to innocent people accused of this terrible crime, cases like this . distract officers from supporting real victims and prosecuting real . offenders. ‘Those who have suffered from genuine offences are also undermined.’ Siobhan Blake, Deputy Chief Crown . Prosecutor in Wales, said: ‘False allegations of rape are extremely . uncommon, but where they do occur they are serious offences. ‘Such cases will be dealt with . robustly and those falsely accused should feel confident that we will . prosecute these cases wherever there is sufficient evidence and it is in . the public interest to do so. ‘Earlier this year, the CPS published a report highlighting how rare false allegations of rape and domestic violence are. ‘We must not allow these cases to undermine our work to support victims of rape and domestic violence. ‘We want victims to feel able to . report the abuse they have suffered and we are working hard to dispel . the myths and stereotypes that can be associated with these cases. ‘One such misplaced belief is that . false allegations of rape and domestic violence are widespread. We know . that is not the case.’","Leanne Black, 32, falsely accused five partners of molesting her .

"Forget spreadsheets, diaries and time stamps, a design studio in London has created the ultimate work planner made entirely of Lego that syncs with online calendars - meaning it is always up to date. Created by Vitamins Design, the Lego calendar is mounted to the studio wall in East London and staff members are each assigned their own mini figure. Each row of flat Lego represents a month, with time slots and tasks determined by different coloured and sized Lego bricks. When a photo is taken of the calendar, specially-designed software scans the image, identifies the various parts and syncs the data with an online, Google Calendar version. Each row on the Lego calendar, pictured, represents a month and every column is a day of the week. Staff members each have their own mini figures. A work project is given its own colour, and a paper colour index is created for each staff. Each Lego brick then represents a half day spent on a particular project . Each row represents a month - the Vitamins Design team have three on the wall of their studio. Every column represents a day of the week and each staff member has their own row. A work project is given its own colour and an index is created so that everyone knows which colour represents which project. Each Lego brick then represents a half day spent on a particular project. Vitamin Designs has additionally created software that scans the image, searching for the position and colour of every brick. It then syncs with a cloud version of the calendar - Vitamins Design uses Google Calendar - and the information is synced and automatically updated across devices of anyone who has subscribed to it. The software has been designed to work with any phone. Vitamins Design said: 'One thing we always talk about in the . studio is how to organise ourselves - it’s something we always think we . can improve. 'So we started looking at all the different ways people . organise things; from post-it notes on computer screens, diaries, to-do . lists and some really complex project planning software. '[The Lego calendar] makes the most of the tangibility of . physical objects, and the ubiquity of digital platforms, and it also . puts a smile on our faces when we use it!' The calendar has also been designed to be secure. Vitamins Design added: 'We needed something we could put up on the wall without revealing our client names, or project information to casual passers by'. The team has three months visible at any one time on the wall of their studio. Every column represents a day of the week and each staff member has their own row. A work project is given its own colour, and an index is created so that everyone knows which colour represents which project.

'We use Google Calendar at the moment, but this would . work with any cloud based calendar.' The design studio has been using the calendar for around a year and the team joke that staff members sometimes hide emergency blocks of 'time', and have started using double height bricks to represent deadlines and important meetings. 'Its power is in its the immediacy and tangibility. Rather than recording minute details about what to do each day, it shows you an immediate overview of how your time is allocated spent in relation to the rest of the studio. 'It sounds crazy, but this way you . actually notice when something has changed, and you need to physically . find a place to put the bricks you have removed - rather than a digital . square quietly vanishing in the background on your computer screen.'

"Two weeks after Creed frontman Scott Stapp was placed on psych hold for 72 hours after telling cops he hears voices that say his son will be killed by ISIS, his estranged wife Jaclyn is trying to get him committed again - for 60 days. Jaclyn claims Scott is trying to detox with no help, and that he is 'deep into drugs, including amphetamines, steroids, weed, coke, PCP, Ketamine and others. She believes that he will harm himself or others if not treated according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Dispute: Jaclyn Stapp (above) says her estranged husband Scott is trying to kick drugs with no help, and that he should be on a 60 day psych hold . 'I went two days without eating and I ended up in an emergency room': Creed frontman Scott Stapp revealed he was broke and homeless in a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video posted Wednesday . Cryptic: He also posted a message to Facebook on Friday saying it was his 'last statement' The revelation comes two days after it emerged that Jaclyn, his wife of eight years, former Miss New York, filed for divorce last month, claiming the former millionaire threatened to kill her and their two children - and that he has guns to do so. In fresh legal documents she also alleges that Stapp called their child's school warning of an ISIS attack on November 10. She said he was driven to believe biological weapons and Satan were coming to Florida. Stapp wrote rather cryptically on Facebook Friday, 'I'm going to step back and let God control everything from here on. I should have continued to do that before I allowed my hurt, frustration, and emotions take control and post those videos. All I can say is that the truth will set you (me) free, and I'm holding on to Jeremiah 29:11 and Isaiah 44:8.' 'This is a test of faith, and I will NEVER give up or lose my faith. No matter what. This will be my last statement until after justice is served. Love to you all my friends.' Stapp, who was once worth $10 million, recorded a desperate, 16-minute Facebook video last Friday insisting he is 'as sober as can be'. In the recording he revealed he is now broke, homeless, and living in a Holiday Inn. According to Mrs Stapp, the father-of-three sent a text message that read: 'Florida is not safe. Biological weapons on the way. U have to leave with kids and meet me in Atlanta.' Another said: 'I'm coming to get you Satan and children. No mercy. You know how this ends. God created you and now God is ending you.' Stapp denies allegations of drug abuse, insisting he's as 'sober as can be'. On Wednesday he took to Facebook lambasting the claims, revealed in the Miami Herald. He said 'all hell broke loose' after an audit of his record company and personal accounts found 'people have stolen money from me'. Admitted to followers that he is now homeless, he explained: 'Right now I'm living in a Holiday Inn by the grace of God, because there's been a couple weeks where I had to sleep in my truck. 'I had no money not even for gas or food. I went two days without eating because I had no money and I ended up in an emergency room.' The Grammy winner sold an estimated 53 million records worldwide with his neo-grunge band in their nineties heyday.

'I want you to know your dad is sober - no drugs no alcohol!' In the video, the Dying to Live crooner pleads his sobriety to his children - Jagger, 16, Milan, 7, and Daniel, 4 (pictured in August) But 15 years after the release of hit single With Arms Wide Open, Stapp is 'completely penniless'. 'During the course of that audit a lot of things were uncovered. A lot of money was stolen from me or royalties not paid,' he said. 'There's people who have taken advantage and stolen money from me, and they're trying to discredit me, slander me, and I've even been threatened that if I went public like I'm doing right now, that any impropriety I've done in the past, that these individuals can get their hands to humiliate and embarrass me and try to ruin my credibility.' He added: 'The IRS has frozen my bank accounts two or three times to leave me completely penniless. 'I don't even understand that, why all this is happening at the same time. When I called to find out why, they said, ""Oh we had an address mix-up, it was a clerical error, so we'll return your funds in nine to 10 months."" I don't understand how that's fair America.' The comment was an apparent response to his estranged wife Jaclyn Nesheiwat, who claimed he was using amphetamines, crystal meth, and steroids in her divorce paperwork. It comes seven years after the Dying To Live singer openly apologizing to Jaclyn for assaulting her with an Orangina bottle following his arrest in 2007. She dropped the charges. Seeking legal representation: The Break Out belter announced he was looking for 'an honest, good attorney that's ready to fight and take it all the way to the top' 'We haven't spoken with Scott since the last tour': Meanwhile, Creed guitarist Mark Tremonti said this month that no one in the four-piece Florida band has spoken to Scott since their comeback tour in 2012 . Horrible hiatus: Stapp hasn't released any solo material since his second studio album Proof of Life a year ago (pictured in 2012) In his home video, Stapp pleads his sobriety to his children - Jagger, 16, Milán, 7, and Daniel, 4. 'They've been through a lot over the years, especially my son Jagger,' Stapp said. 'These rumors going around right now are hurting him very bad...I want you to know Jagger, your dad is sober - no drugs no alcohol. This is a vicious attack because people we know, and at the record company, and outside that have stolen a lot of money.' He announced he was looking for 'an honest, good attorney that's ready to fight and take it all the way to the top.'

'I . think the [Warrior] Games  [in the US] had such a profound effect on . every single individual that actually took part in it,’ he said. 'Finally . they get the chance to set their mind to a task. Bear in mind these are . military people who have been cut down in their prime. They want to . have a goal in life. To be told in a day, ‘right that's it, no you’re . not going to walk again, you’re not going to see again’. This is an . opportunity for them and members of the public as well to walk in . together with one goal as such. 'It's . life changing, really it's life changing. Listening to them talk about . it is inspiring. Prince Harry with the wheelchair Basketball teams at the Copper Box in the Queen Elizabeth Park, London . There seemed to be a gap in the conversation between the Prince and London Mayor Boris Johnson, as he attended the launch of the games . 'They see this as an opportunity for the next six months . to set their mind on a goal, to bring themselves back into society when . some of them feel, now that they are disabled, they are pushed aside. 'They are not. This is so much more than that. ‘ . Although . there is going to be a competitive edge to the Games, Harry stressed . that it was one of the few sporting occasions that the taking part . really mattered. ‘It's not . about the winning or losing, the fact that the guys have got to this . stage to be able to take part in these events, they have already won in . my mind,’ he said. 'I just hope that September,  summertime this year, the sun will be out and it will be wonderful event. So please come. ' Dressed . in his arm fatigues, Harry, a serving Army officer who recently quit . flying the Apache attack helicopter to take a desk job in London in . order to work on the Invictus project, added: ‘Hearing the stories that . came back from the [Warrior] games really ignited something inside me . and made me want to basically broaden this to a wider audience. ‘I . saw first-hand the power of sport to inspire recovery, supporting . rehabilitation and demonstrating life beyond disability - a group of . inspirational people proving anything is possible. ‘Why . bring it to the UK? Well it was such a great concept by the Americans . that it had to be stolen, quite simple as that, really. Prince Harry was inspired after a visit to the Warrior Games in America last year. He is pictured as he participates in a seated volleyball exhibition match, in May 2013 . He added: 'This is an inclusive games and we're going to have hopefully 100 UK competitors, 100 from America and the rest of the 180 is going to be made up from other nations' ‘I wanted to bring this inspirational event to a broader and more international audience.’ Prime . Minister David Cameron welcomed the launch of the event as a ‘wonderful . opportunity to recognise the commitment of those who serve in the . United Kingdom's and our allies' armed forces and to pay tribute to the . sacrifice of those who are wounded or injured.’ Also . present at the launch was London Mayor Boris Johnson who quipped, much . to the prince’s amusement, that when Harry first suggested his idea he . thought he was resurrecting the ill-fated It’s A Royal Knockout or an . international version of the Eton Wall Game. But he went on to describe the Invictus Games as ‘a winner’. The . name has been taken from William Ernest Henley’s famous poem which . says: ‘I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.’ Invictus also means, appropriately, in Latin ‘unconquered’.","Invictus Games, would 'have a long-lasting impact' on ex-soldiers, he said .

"The father of dead teenager Michael Brown made an emotional plea for calm yesterday as he walked the tense streets of Ferguson with Thanksgiving turkeys to hand out to residents as the town braced for a grand jury announcement many fear could lead to more violence. Traveling the same streets where his son was gunned down, many residents were surprised when he knocked on their doors, Saturday. 'I had to come and just give back to the people,' Brown told reporters. He wore a red T-shirt bearing a picture of his son's face and the messages 'Gone Too Soon' and 'I Will always Love You.' Michael Brown Sr. (L), the father of 18-year-old Michael Brown who was shot dead by a police officer, greets a neighbor as he distributes turkey for Thanksgiving where his son was killed in Ferguson, Missouri . 'Everyone is suffering over this,' he added. 'I just feel that this was needed, so I came back to make sure that people have a nice Thanksgiving.' Looking across the street, over the memorial of flowers and stuffed toys placed on the spot where his son fell in August, he held up a bird and called to a young woman: 'You get one yet?' She smiled and waved back, yes. St. Louis prosecutors have said they will hold a news conference to announce the outcome of the grand jury, although the date, time and location remained undetermined. The 12-member panel met behind closed doors again on Friday. However, CNN reported that the weekend passed with a decision, and the jury will not reconvene until Monday. St. Louis prosecutors have said they will hold a news conference to announce the outcome of the grand jury, although the date, time and location remained undetermined . A grand jury in St. Louis meets for a standard four months, but went beyond that time frame on Sept. 10. Their service was extended by two months along with an additional 60 days. Prosecutors say the full term, which ends on January 7, will no be necessary. Anthony Gray, an attorney for the Brown family, told reporters on Friday that the deliberations could last an hour, a day, a week, or a month. ""No one can forecast when that decision will actually be reached,"" Gray said. This was not Brown Sr.'s first attempt to keep the peace. On Friday, Brown Sr appealed for restraint in a somber video plea. 'Hurting others or destroying property is not the answer,' he said. On Friday, Brown Sr appealed for restraint in a somber video plea: 'Hurting others or destroying property is not the answer' Cal, the dead teenager's stepmom, said they gave out more than 60 turkeys ahead of Thanksgiving next week, some bought by the family and the rest donated. 'Hopefully, we'll have big things come out of this,' she told AFP, adding the family would particularly miss Michael during the holiday season. 'Of course we'll miss him, his wittiness, his pranks. Him with his big plate of food sitting there like a king. We'll miss all of that, but despite it all, we have to try to have the normal for the other children.' In the United States, grand juries meet in secret to review some cases before deciding whether criminal charges should be brought. Anthony Gray, an attorney for the Brown family, told reporters on Friday that the deliberations could last an hour, a day, a week, or a month. The jury could indict Wilson, meaning he could face trial, or it could determine there is no case for him to answer. St Louis County prosecutors have made arrangements for a press conference to announce the decision, but no date or time has yet been confirmed. Schools in the area announced they would close Monday and Tuesday due to potential unrest. Thanksgiving will keep them closed for the rest of next week. Some residents doubt the jury will indict Wilson. Thomas Bradley, a 24-year-old barber, predicted that protests would be worse than in August if the officer is cleared. 'If that's the case, I believe they will burn this city down. They'll burn it down. For sure,' he said while finishing off a young boy's buzz cut. Schools in the area announced they would close Monday and Tuesday due to potential unrest. Thanksgiving will keep them closed for the rest of next week . Shopkeepers and residents have boarded up stores and homes preparing for the decision, as Brown Sr. hopes to ease tensions . Yahoo compared the preparation to 'hurricane watch.' 'We’ve never seen anything like this,' shoe repairman Quentin Virgil, who works across from the St. Louis Police Department, said. 'The law office next door is boarded up. That’s not normal.' The headquarters was boarded up Saturday morning while stores were flooded with residents stocking up on supplies. 'I try not to think about it, but if they break my window, they’ll put me out of business,' said the owner of Busy Bee Alterations & Shoe Repair, Maria Mathias. 'They've really got my heart pumping right now.' Mathias said she was terrified to see the police department being boarded up and to think of the damage her store could endure if a riot did break out. One person tried to charge her $2,000 just to out plywood on her windows. 'I can't afford that,' she said. A small gaggle of protesters braved the cold late Friday to demand that Wilson stand trial for shooting Brown dead. Brown, a high-school graduate planning on attending technical college, was shot at least six times by Wilson. His body was left in the street for hours. Wilson reportedly told the grand jury he acted in self-defense after tussling with the youth. Others say Brown had his hands in the air when he was shot. 'I'm here for justice. If we don't get justice, ain't nobody gonna get no peace,' said 22-year-old Ebony, who works in security and refused to give a second name. 'We're going to keep protesting until we know what's right gets done,' she said. 'I want to see Darren Wilson go to jail.'

"An alleged arsonist has been arrested on suspicion of starting an out-of-control Northern California wildfire that has driven nearly 2,800 people from their homes and continues to grow, authorities said on Thursday. Wayne Allen Huntsman, 37, is suspected of starting the fire east of Sacramento on Saturday, authorities said at a news conference today. He was arrested late on Wednesday in Placerville and booked into El Dorado County Jail, where he was being held on $10 million bail. Huntsman is charged with one count of arson of forest land for willfully and maliciously setting a fire, according to a criminal complaint. He also faces a special allegation of arson with aggravating factors because the blaze east of Sacramento put a dozen firefighters in serious danger, forcing them to deploy their fire shields. They all escaped unharmed as it emerged today that four crew had lost their homes. By Thursday, the blaze had burned through 111 square miles - doubling in size overnight on Wednesday - as winds surged to 25 mph and continued to fuel its rapid expansion, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The King Fire doubled in size from 44 square miles on Wednesday when it forced additional evacuations. It was 5 per cent contained. 'This fire is definitely eye-opening,' Cal Fire spokeswoman Alyssa Smith said as it emerged that four firefighters had lost their homes in the furious blaze. The fire has been fueled by heavy timber and grass that is extremely dry because of California's third straight year of drought. Many of the more than 2,000 threatened homes were in Pollock Pines, 60 miles east of Sacramento. Though the fire grew substantially late on Wednesday, it burned mostly into wilderness land in the El Dorado National Forest away from the town, according to Cal Fire. The blaze was burning about 20 miles from the Desolation Wilderness, a popular hiking area south of Lake Tahoe. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency late on Wednesday, freeing up funds for the two fires. Brown had also secured federal grants to fight each of them.

Tasha Davis, 30, said she was given two minutes to grab what she could from her apartment and evacuate. 'We then packed my car and sat on the road and just watched everything burn,' she said on Tuesday in an email from Mount Shasta, where she spent the night with her family. Insurance companies worked to find places to live for the people who lost their homes. The cause of the blaze was under investigation. It was 60 per cent contained after burning 375 acres. The town and the forest that surrounds it were a tinderbox this summer after three years of drought. The steady breezes were what attracted town founder Abner Weed to build his lumber business there in 1897, after he realized that wood dried more quickly when fanned by nature. But it is these winds - reaching up to 40mph -  that helped the wildfire rage across the lumber town. A plane drops fire retardant on the King Fire near Fresh Pond.

I've never seen anything like this,' Jim Taylor, a retired butcher who has lived in the town for 30 years said Tuesday. 'I'm not a real religious person, but somebody was looking out for me.' Taylor said fire bombers dropped retardant over his house. As his home and his deck furniture turned pink from the retardant, another house nearby erupted into flames. Across the street, pine and oak trees were burned to a crisp, and small flames and smoke drifted up from chunky embers. Burned neighborhoods remain off-limits, but people have been finding ways in since the fire started. The Rev. Bill Hofer, pastor of Weed Berean Church, said power was back on in his home, which was still standing on the edge of the devastation zone, and he was planning to return Wednesday night - despite the evacuation order - to deter vandalism.

"Surely it’s what many of us dream about while trudging into the office during another April downpour. Why not escape the rat race and the grey skies to live on a sunny tropical island? Brendon Grimshaw has done just that. In 1962, the Yorkshireman bought Moyenne - a small island just half a mile wide - in the Seychelles for the princely sum of £8,000, and he has been living there ever since. Scroll down for video of Brendon . Life's a beach: Brendon Grimshaw on Moyenne, the Seychelles island he bought in 1962 for £8,000 . The sprightly 86-year-old wakes to the sound of rustling palm trees and the Indian Ocean lapping against the shore. He spends his days caring for the island’s tortoises and birds that also call it home. When he bought Moyenne, it was . overgrown with scrub so dense that coconuts could not fall to the . ground. But Brendon worked tirelessly to transform the island into his . own little patch of heaven. Living . in this unique wildlife reserve, he has survived tropical storms, . sharks, ghosts, a coup d’etat in the Seychelles and a mercenary raid. Scattered . over a vast area of the Indian Ocean, the 115 islands of the Seychelles . are among the most spectacular on the planet. There are just 85,000 . inhabitants, but hundreds of secluded beaches. I visited the Seychelles while filming my new BBC TV series, to find Somali pirates in the prisons and Dutch Special Forces training local troops to repel more attacks. But it was a visit to Brendon’s island, and meeting the man himself, that caught my imagination. Just a hop away from the capital, Victoria, on the island of Mahe, and surrounded by azure and turquoise waters, the 22½ acres of Moyenne stand out from the neighbouring islands, which are owned by billionaires, Arab princes and Russian oligarchs, and include some of the most glorious holiday retreats in the world. Island: Moyenne was abandoned until Brendon purchased it 50 years ago . Paradise: Brendon wakes to the sound of rustling palm trees and the Indian Ocean lapping against the shore . Surrounded by protective coral reef, Moyenne looked wild and uninhabited - until I caught a glimpse of a wooden building poking through the trees. I was warmly greeted by Brendon in his T-shirt and shorts, standing on a picture-perfect beach. Lithe, wiry and tanned, he still has his Dewsbury accent, which seems wildly out of place in such an exotic setting. Together we climbed steps hewn out of . the rock and past clusters of palm trees to where Brendon’s one-storey . wooden house clings to the hillside. It’s where he looks after his 120 giant tortoises. A . whopper was sitting on the steps. Among the world’s longest living . creatures, they have been known to survive for more than 180 years. Giant tortoises are indigenous to the Seychelles, but have been killed off on most of the other islands. Brendon . has been gradually reintroducing them to his corner of the Indian . Ocean, painting them with identifying numbers and giving them names such . as Alice, Florita and Four Degrees South (the island’s latitude). His house is eccentric and well-worn, . a bit like its owner, and furnished with African souvenirs and curios . that testify to Brendon’s years in the tropics. Real life Robinson Crusoe: Brendon has helped preserve the region's giant turtles. He paints them with identifying numbers and even names them . Local: Brendon still has his Dewsbury accent, which seems wildly out of place in such an exotic setting . Outside I spotted a sign: ‘Please respect the tortoises. They are probably older than you.’ Fluttering above the tortoises were just some of the 2,000 birds that Brendon has encouraged to flock here . There . was the indigenous pigeon Hollandais, so named because it shares the . colours of the Dutch flag, and the beautiful reddish-orange fody weaver . bird, a native of Madagascar. As they feasted on rice from the five 50kg bags Brendon puts out each week, they made a magnificent sight. We set off for a walk around Moyenne, with Brendon bounding along in flip-flops. He first arrived in the Seychelles on . holiday in the late Fifties, restless and seeking adventure after years . spent working as a newspaperman in Africa. ‘I started thinking about buying property almost as soon as I arrived, but I couldn’t find the right place,’ he told me. It . wasn’t until the very last day of his holiday that he heard about . Moyenne. ‘I knew the moment I set foot on the island that it was the . right place for me.’ Brendon had dinner with the owner and a deal was done. Yorkshire’s Robinson Crusoe had found his paradise. He hired his own Man Friday, a Seychellois called Rene Lafortune, who helped him transform Moyenne. Together they planted palm trees, mango and paw-paw. They saved rainwater and pumped it up the hillside by hand, or rowed back to the main island to collect a barrel of fresh water. It was backbreaking, exhausting work. ‘My hands were covered in blisters,’ said Brendon. When . he arrived there were no birds on the island, so he brought ten from a . neighbouring island - which promptly flew straight back. Man Friday: Brendon recruited local Rene Lafortune to help him make Moyenne habitable . Natural disguise: Surrounded by protective coral reef, Moyenne looks wild and uninhabited . He brought a few more, which also disappeared. But then a couple returned. Brendon started feeding them, and more birds settled on the island. Slowly the trees grew and fruited, and eventually water, electricity and a phone cable were piped across from Mahe. ‘But we weren’t doing it to make it into a national park or anything like that,’ said Brendon. ‘No, no, no! We were doing it to make it habitable for me.’ It . might have been accidental conservation, but while the rest of us have . been busy concreting over our front gardens, Brendon was creating a . second Eden. Rene died a . few years ago, so now the tortoises and several pet dogs are Brendon’s . companions. I asked him if he’s ever been lonely. ‘Yes, only once in my life - when I was living in a bedsit in London. I was miserable then, but never here.’ Brendon is not a recluse. He relishes visitors and company, and regrets not marrying. ‘But how could I ask anyone to live out here?’ he said. ‘We didn’t have running water for years!’ Though his mother always refused to . visit Moyenne because she didn’t much like ‘abroad’, Brendon’s sister . Sandra moved to Mahe with her husband and opened a cafe. And when his father Raymond was widowed in 1981, he accepted Brendon’s invitation to come and live on Moyenne. New home: Brendon makes himself at home on Moyenne shortly after he 'moved in' in 1962 . ‘To . my surprise, he moved from Seaford in East Sussex to be with me when he . was 88,’ said Brendon. ‘We had a wonderful time together, and became . the best of friends.’ Raymond died following a fall five years later and is buried on the island next to a grave Brendon has already dug for himself. Even now, he is not alone. Day-trippers are allowed to visit from Mahe for £10 each. Brendon has a strict rule that no one is allowed to stay overnight, but some visitors try to linger a little longer. A . Saudi prince once offered him a blank cheque for Moyenne, and other . rich visitors have also been so entranced they’ve tried to buy it on the . spot. But Brendon certainly isn’t selling. ‘The only reason someone would want to buy this island is to build a big hotel,’ he said. Yes, . of course he wants to keep his hideaway pristine, but perhaps he still . has hopes of finding the pirate treasure rumoured to be buried somewhere . on the island. More than . 200 years ago, the Seychelles were a hideaway for pirates, including the . infamous Oliver Levasseur, known as The Buzzard, who was hanged in . Mauritius in July 1730. He plagued the shipping in the western Indian Ocean, plundering their valuable cargoes. His . missing hoards of treasure, including the fabled Portuguese Fiery Cross . of Goa encrusted with diamonds and rubies, were buried on islands in . the Seychelles, including Moyenne. Or at least that’s what the stories say. One treasure trove is supposed to be worth more than £30 million.

There are graves on the island that are said to be the burial sites of pirates, and Brendon has found some evidence of man-made hiding places. But if he found gold, he isn’t letting on. He loves the pirate tales as much as anyone, and seems happy to feed the rumours with a conspiratorial nudge and a wink. Presenter: Simon Reeve visits the Seychelles in next Sunday's episode of Indian Ocean on BBC2 . But it’s fair to say Brendon has never been motivated by money. He could have taken the Saudi prince’s blank cheque many years ago and moved to a luxurious retirement home. Instead he has worked tirelessly to transform and preserve Moyenne, ensuring that when he finally does leave the island it will be protected and passed to the people of the Seychelles as a protected national park. ‘Brendon is the modern Robinson Crusoe,’ says Joel Morgan, environment minister for the Seychelles. ‘He’s a naturalist, a conservationist and a damned hard worker.’ Moyenne Island National Park boasts a glorious array of wildlife, along with 40 species of palm trees, including the exotic bwa-bannann (known as the wood banana) and 13 coco de mer, or sea coconut. The island has been Brendon’s life, and as he has struggled and toiled to create a spectacular home,  it has repaid him by giving him a tonic that no doctor can prescribe: a real sense of purpose and meaning. Out in the Indian Ocean, Brendon Grimshaw, Dewsbury-born and Yorkshire proud, is still living the  dream.","Sprightly 86-year-old bought Seychelles island for £8,000 in 1962 .

"Martin McGuinness, former IRA commander and deputy Irish first minister, is considering whether to accept the invitation . The revelation that former IRA commander Martin McGuinness may attend a state banquet hosted by the Queen sparked a furious reaction last night. The Sinn Fein politician is still considering whether to accept an invitation to the white-tie event at Windsor Castle next month. Buckingham Palace refused to confirm that Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister is on the guest list for the banquet, in honour of Irish president Michael D Higgins. McGuinness is also thought to have been invited to a reception, also at Windsor and hosted by the Queen, a few days later. But former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit, who survived the IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton in 1984 which left his wife Margaret paralysed, said: ‘Were I the Queen, I think I would be looking very hard for a reason not to be inviting Mr McGuinness to my home.’ Newark MP Patrick Mercer, a former Army colonel who also served in Northern Ireland, said: ‘The IRA was responsible for killing and injuring many of my colleagues and, while I fully appreciate the need for conciliation, I feel this invitation is going too far.’ A former Parachute Regiment member, who was involved in Lord Saville’s long-running and costly Bloody Sunday inquiry, said: ‘The thought of this former IRA commander walking into Windsor Castle makes me feel physically sick. People should remember what the IRA did and how many innocent lives have been lost.’ Brian Goodman, whose policeman son was gunned down by an IRA fugitive in North Yorkshire in 1992, said: ‘This invitation is absolutely disgusting. He shouldn’t even be allowed into England.’ Other critics pointed out that the Queen’s cousin, Lord Mountbatten of Burma – who was also Prince Philip’s uncle – was murdered by an IRA bomb on his fishing boat in the Irish Republic in 1979. However, some saw the invitation as a possible further step in the peace process. Democratic Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson said: ‘There are many in Northern Ireland who still carry the pain and the scars of the IRA and other terrorist organisations. Opposition: Lord Tebbit (left) said he 'would be looking very hard for a reason not to be inviting Mr McGuinness to my home' while MP Patrick Mercer (right) said the invite was 'going too far' 'But if the Republican movement is prepared to recognise the legitimacy of the Queen as Head of State then that might be looked upon as some sort of progress.’ Former army officer Colonel Tim Collins said: ‘There will be some people who will be deeply upset but I believe this is a move which speaks of the power of reconciliation.’ Ulster Unionist chairman Lord Empey said: ‘It’s just a tragedy that so many people had to lose their lives before he [McGuinness] realised that violence was futile and the IRA campaign was doomed to failure.’ McGuinness, who met and shook the hand of the Queen in Belfast two years ago, would need any acceptance of an invitation to be ratified by senior Sinn Fein officials. Last night the party refused to discuss when that decision would be made. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘We would never announce in advance the invitees to state banquets.’","State banquet to be held in honour of former Irish president next month .

"Young people in rural Pennsylvania can buy heroin more easily than a bottle ofwine and getting high with the opiate can be cheaper than buying a six pack of beer, according to an investigative report released on Tuesday. Overdose deaths have climbed steadily since 1990, when drug deaths in rural areas of the state were at one per 100,000 population. As of 2011, that figure stood at 13 deaths per 100,000, the Center for Rural Pennsylvania said in the report. 'Heroin is cheaper and easier for young people to obtain than alcohol,' said State Senator Gene Yaw, the Republican chairman of the center, a joint legislative state agency. According to an investigative report , heroin is easier to access than wine and cheaper to purchase than a six-pack of beer in Pennsylvania . Pennsylvania is not alone in its heroin problem. In rural Vermont, Governor Peter Shumlin said his state was experiencing a 'full-blown heroin crisis,' while the overdose rate in New York City has surged as well, especially in the wealthiest neighborhoods. In Pennsylvania, Yaw said a small packet of heroin costs between $5 and $10 and delivers a high lasting four to five hours. The report, based on evidence submitted in hearings across the state this summer, listed Cambria County in central Pennsylvania as having the highest overdose death rate outside of Philadelphia, 22.6 deaths per 100,000 population. That is equal to Philadelphia's drug death rate, the report said. Yaw suggested Cambria County's drug death rate was not caused by any special factors, but state Representative Bryan Barbin, a Democrat, was not so sure. The high number of overdoses in Pennsylvania are also a result of poor treatment options . Barbin said Johnstown is easily accessible from heroin distribution centers like Baltimore. Dealing heroin is an attractive career option for those with few economic prospects, he said, especially those with drug crime records. The report called for a number of legislative actions, including making it easier to prosecute dealers whose customers die of overdoses, and a 'Good Samaritan' law assuring that people who seek help for overdose victims will not face criminal charges. Putting more addicts in jail will not solve the problem, the report said. State Representative Richard Marabito, a Democrat, said Pennsylvania has about 760,000 residents with addiction problems, but that only about 52,000 are receiving treatment. Only one in eight addicts can be helped with existing state resources, the report said. The report suggests that to curtail the number of Pennsylvania heroin overdoses, a 'Good Samaritan' law should be in place to guarantee 'people who seek help for overdose victims will not face criminal charges'","Center for Rural Pennsylvania concluded there is a current 'epidemic' that crosses all geographic, economic and racial boundaries .
Nearly 3,000 Pennsylvania residents have died over the past five years because of abuse of heroin or other opioids .
A packet of heroin capable of producing a high lasting about five hours costs $10 or less .
In rural areas during 2011, 13 of every 100,000 deaths were overdoses, up from one per 100,000 in 1990."

"Yesterday, a study revealed online daters are more likely to end up in a happy marriage than those who meet randomly. I agree with the psychologists’ view that it’s because there’s a higher motivation to find love among internet daters. There’s a lot that’s right about online dating. It’s time efficient - simply go online in the comfort of your own home and view hundreds of potential partners on any number of dating websites catering for every possible taste. And it’s convenient - you can narrow the search for a partner by listing what you will and won’t put up with. But the biggest advantage of online dating is also the biggest disadvantage. On the upside, it means the people you meet are likely to be more compatible with you than some random guy you meet in a bar who you know nothing about. Why will you never meet the perfect man online? Because there's no such thing, says Tracey Cox - and if you really believe there is, you're heading for disappointment . On the downside, it feeds into our already rampant expectations that there is indeed a perfect person out there who will tick all our boxes. Online dating is like making a shopping list. You’re effectively making a list of all the characteristics and features that make up your idea of the perfect person: hair colour, height, income, likes, dislikes. And the trouble with clicking all those boxes online is that we start to think there’s someone out there who will actually have all those things. So when you do meet up with someone and quite like them, there’s a little voice in your head saying, 'This guy’s nice but he’s not perfect. Maybe the next guy I meet will tick all the boxes'. So you have one more online date and he’s not completely without fault either, so you try another and another… and let me save you a whole lot of bother by telling you this straight up: there is no perfect person out there for you because there’s no perfect person out there for anyone. They don’t exist. Tracey Cox: 'We’re human. We have flaws. Believing in Mr Perfect is about as silly as believing Christian Grey really does exist' Even if you end up falling head over heels for someone and they do seem perfect at the time, when the love hormones wear off, there will be one or two areas where he won’t be flawless. It’s called real life. We’re human. We have flaws and imperfections. Believing in Mr Perfect is about as silly as believing Christian Grey really does exist. The other thing I can tell you is the . person you’ll end up falling for will probably look and be nothing like . what you’re imagining right now. And this is the other great failing of . online dating: it discounts one very important, extremely powerful . variable - chemistry. Chemistry . is what’s responsible when you meet some guy who is totally not your . physical type and the complete opposite in personality to guys you . normally get on with - but you don’t care. It’s illogical, irrational . and out of our conscious control because it works on a primitive level . based largely on whether your body wants to get close to theirs (which . is why you don’t know if you’ve got it until you meet in person). The . list goes out the window when chemistry walks into our lives and so it . should. Chemistry alone won’t guarantee you a great relationship but if . you have it, you’re streets ahead of the couple who don’t. By . all means date online - it’s a highly effective and successful way to . meet a partner. Just be aware that the more specific you are and the . more boxes you tick, the fewer men you’re going to meet in person. The . more closed you are about the ‘type’ you’re prepared to meet, the less . likely you are to meet someone who really is perfect for you but just . happens to be one year younger and half an inch shorter than the box you . ticked. Tracey Cox's new book Dare: What Happens When Fantasies Come True is published by Hodder and Stoughton (£7.99 paperback, £4.99 kindle); her book and the Dare product range is now available from www.traceycox.com.","The so-called perfect man does not exist, says Tracey .

"Just one in ten of those living in Channel 4's latest Benefits Street are on long-term benefits while crime rates in the area are lower than the national average, statistics have revealed. Television crews started filming in Kingston Road, Stockton, last week in the follow up to the controversial first series shot in Birmingham. But according to figures broken down by household on the road in 2011, only eight per cent were classed as long-term unemployed. Dot Taylor an unemployed grandmother   is being lined up to be the next star of the new Benefits Street . And police figures show that crime in the area is lower than the national average with 52 crimes per 1,000 people reported in the Stockton borough. This is the lowest rate in the Tees Valley region, the Sunday Times reports. Producers are already being accused of filming residents who have no desire to be in the show. A number of residents living in the area have hit out at the choice of location with one insisting it 'paints a really bad picture on the area'. The controversial first series made stars of James Turner Street in Birmingham - including White Dee, who reportedly accepted £100,000 to appear on Big Brother. However, the show received almost 2,000 complaints by viewers who said the show was 'exploiting people' for the 'sake of entertainment' and branded 'poverty porn'. It has been reported that an unemployed grandmother Dot Taylor is being lined up to be the next star of the show - and is set to be joined by a neighbour with a horse in the front garden of his terraced house. Producers of the new series of Benefits Street are already being accused of filming residents who have no desire to be in the show . TV crews started filming in Kingston Road, Stockton, last week in the follow up to the controversial first series shot in Birmingham . The 48-year-old grandmother, who has given up trying to find a job after 20 years out of work, has spoken about life on the deprived Stockton-on-Tees estate taking part in the second series of the Channel 4 show. Dot - who is 4ft 11ins - wants to be the new matriarch of the TV series and hopes it could bring her fame and fortune. But statistics from the 2011 census, published in the Sunday Times, show that just over a third of residents in Kingston Road were in full time or part-time employment or were self employed. Just 16 per cent were unemployed and 16 per cent were disabled or long-term sick, the newspaper reports. In Stockton this week, MPs  were disappointed their town had been chosen, despite the production company being told they were not welcome. Labour MP for Stockton North, Alex Cunningham hopes to talk residents  into pulling out of appearing on the show . Labour MP for Stockton North, Alex Cunningham hopes to talk people into pulling out of appearing on the show. He said: 'There is no doubt this is about exploiting vulnerable people in order to make money.' 'I know they will say it is about trying to give people a voice, but all they will do is expose them to the full glare of the national media.' James Wharton, Tory MP for Stockton South, said: 'I don't want them here making a programme which will show people in the worst possible light and potentially do such huge damage. 'For the producers it's easy ratings for a few weeks, but the damage they do can last much longer."" Stockton Council leader Bob Cook was 'deeply disappointed' the Benefits Street cameras were in the town. 'No doubt this programme won't highlight the excellent work that is on-going to make our town an even better place to live and work,' he said. Residents have given a mixed reaction to the filming. Amanda Bedford, 37, a cashier living on Temple Court close to the filming location, said: 'On the last series they made everyone look really bad. 'My daughter was filmed in the garden at her friends house. 'I was never asked about this before hand and I hope they won't use the footage, or at least black out her face. 'They should have got my permission first, and I would have said no. The controversial first series made stars of James Turner Street in Birmingham - including White Dee, pictured . 'The majority of people here are good , hard working people, and I cant believe that people have decided to do it. Another resident, who did not to be named, said: 'I don't think it is right at all. I definitely don't want to get involved with it. 'I cant quite see why people would want to be a part of it if they have seen the first series. It paints a really bad picture on the area.' A Channel 4 spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Benefits Street does not only feature residents who are long term unemployed. 'Some participants are receiving other kinds of welfare allowance while others are in full-time employment - though the majority of households on the street do have someone claiming benefits. 'The series is about streets that have a real sense of community and residents who are getting on with their lives despite the challenges they may face.' Kieran Smith, the creative director at Love Productions, told the Sunday Times: 'We've come here with good intentions... I want to show the authentic experience of living on Kingston Road. 'We are not focusing purely on people claiming people claiming benefits.'","Fewer than one in ten on new Benefits Street are long-term unemployed .

"Apple made a number of improvements to the camera on its iPhone 5S to make pictures look more professional, and a new patent hints at what we could expect from the camera on future versions of the phone. The patent details a system capable of capturing low-resolution images that can be refocused even after they’ve been taken and processed. It would do this by capturing the whole light field of an image, similar to the technology seen in Lytro cameras, meaning the shots appear in 3D rather than 2D. Apple's patent, pictured, details a camera attachment that takes images which can be refocused, even after they've been processed, similar to the technology used in Lytro cameras. This means images appear in 3D and the focus can be changed numerous times to create different shots . Apple’s digital camera, according to the patent, . would be made up of a shell with an image sensor mounted inside it. This sensor would be fitted with a number of sensor pixels for . capturing digital images. An adaptor, including a microlens array, . could then be inserted between the imaging lens and the image sensor meaning users could switch to what Apple calls the 'low-resolution . refocusable mode.' As the name suggests, the array would be fitted . with micro lenses that capture light from multiple sources and . directions. This is called light-field photography and gives the appearance of 3D. These images would then be able to be digitally refocused because the camera has enough light-field information to change how it looks. Earlier this week Apple confirmed it had bought Israeli motion-sensor company PrimeSense. PrimeSense was involved during the early development stages of Microsoft's Kinect sensor. The . company hasn't discussed its plans for motion-sensor technology, but . some experts believe it could be a part of the rumored Apple TV. The set could also feature the camera detailed in the latest patent. According to patent papers, which were originally filed in 2011, photographers could take an image and change the main area of focus numerous times to produce different shots. These images would be taken through what’s called a microlens array. According to Apple's patent, this array would be detachable and could be removed when the user wanted to take a traditional high-resolution photo. A similar array is already used in Lytro’s Light Field Cameras. Lytro was set up in 2006 but the first cameras didn’t go on sale until 2011. They use a technology called plenoptic imaging. Each plenoptic camera contains a series of small lenses fitted to a chip that capture light from multiple sources and directions. This is known as 4D light field information. Other companies, including California-based Pelican Imaging, produce similar cameras and in May, Nokia announced plans to invest in this firm. Apple's patent makes explicit reference to manufacturer Lytro and its plenoptic camera, pictured. Lytro cameras went on sale in 2011 and use technology called plenoptic imaging. Each plenoptic camera contains a series of small lenses fitted to a chip that capture light from multiple sources and directions . Rumours suggest the investment will lead to the Finnish phone maker launching a smartphone with a plenoptic camera by 2014. Apple makes explicit reference to Lytro and plenoptic camera patents, however, by making the microlens array in its own camera detachable, the firm believes this would make its design more consumer-friendly. ‘This invention has the advantage that the digital camera system can be configured to capture both low-resolution refocusable digital images and high-resolution non-refocusable digital images’ said the patent.","The camera in the patent is fitted with a detachable microlens array .

"A heartbreaking tale could well have a happy ending. A puppy, that was found by a group of workers at a construction site in Turkey with its ears cut off, is getting used to her new life at a local veterinary facility in the province of Bursa. The young dog - named Can - was bleeding from the head when teams from the municipal veterinary institution arrived at the scene and they immediately took it in for surgery. The maltreated dog was found with its ears cut off by workers on a construction site . Before being put in with his new friends, the puppy is allowed to take in its new environment . Wearing a special collar for her own protection, the extent of the puppy's injuries is  evident from a large portion of scaring on her head. In the video footage, she is allowed to approach some other dogs who are in a cage, prior to being fully introduced. Just before the puppy is thrown in with new friends, she is given a friendly tickle to calm any nerves. And all seems well in the new dog shelter, with the puppy affectionately nuzzling her  new housemate. To relax her before her new meeting the puppy is given a friendly tickle by the man at the sanctuary . It is hoped the dog - named Can - will come on leaps and bounds despite the horrific savagery . 'Her ears were cut from their base. But we have successfully conducted a plasticesthetic surgery. 'Our puppy, which we have named 'Can,' will be able to regain her health soon' said veterinary surgeon Ayşe Yazıcı following the operation. Animal rights activists have often complained about the lack of legal provisions regarding the torture of animals without owners. But the local veterinary department head, Mürsel Büyükçoban, stressed that the current law does contain measures against those who cut the ears or the tail of animals. 'Unfortunately, there are people still doing it despite all the warnings and sanctions. This is just inhumane,' Büyükçoban said. There are still people in Turkey who continue to carry out 'inhumane' acts against dogs . Local in Turkey have long believed to show good care to their pets and even stray dogs and cats, but in recent months there has been a rise of violence against these animals reported. A woman was captured on security cameras kicking to death stray kittens and was caught in August by police in Istanbul. Another man in Eskişehir was captured beating to death a stray dog. This has led to animal rights activists urging the government to change the legislation that labels dogs as 'goods' rather than 'living'. This essentially means if something is found to have beaten, or even killed a dog, it would be classed as damaging 'property' and could see the assailant let off with a fine.","Puppy found on construction site in Bursa, Turkey, bleeding with no ears .

The Gardner-Serpollet 18HP Type L Phaeton Steamer was one of the first-ever vehicles on Britain's roads in 1905. Its first owner was steam car enthusiast Alec Hodson who sold it to farmer George Milligan in 1957 for £450 - roughly £9,467 in today's money. In 2009 Mr Milligan sold the car at auction in London for £238,000 and just five years later it is being sold again - and is expected to make another £100,000 profit. The historic steamer - which has the number plate AH 100 - is set to fetch between £340,000 and £360,000 when it is auctioned on October 31. The car is still going strong and is due to take part in the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run on November 2.? It was voted the historically most important car in the 2010 event. Bonhams said Mr Milligan had an 'amazing collection' of early motor cars. One of them, a 1929 super-charged Mercedes-Benz SSK, sold at the auction house for £4.18 million in 2004.

"An Osama bin Laden doll made as part of a secret CIA project in 2005 and designed by the creator of G.I Joe is up for sale by online auction. The 12-inch bin Laden doll, one of only three to be made, was part of a programme called 'Devil Eyes' which planned to distribute the dolls to children in Afghanistan to encourage them to reject al-Qaeda.

The toy has two detachable heads, one 'normal' head with a turban and a beard and another demon-like depiction of the now dead terrorist group leader with a red face and green eyes. The project didn't meet approval with the 'influence operation' though, leaving just three dolls completed, two of which are in the CIA's possession. When Levine died in May this year, his estate decided they would sell the doll through Nate D. Sanders auction house, with bidding starting $2,500 (£1,600). The 12-inch doll was part of a programme called 'Devil Eyes' which planned to distribute the dolls to children in Afghanistan to encourage them to reject al-Qaeda . The auction house describes the doll as a 'scarce and nearly unbelievable prototype of Osama Bin Laden doll intended for use in Arab countries in order to dissuade children from idolizing the terror leader.' The auctioneers say the dolls is in near fine condition due to two small glue stains on the white robe and that there is a certificate of authenticity from Levine's son.","Osama bin Laden doll designed by GI Joe creator Donald Levine .

"They were feather-light yet anchored faster than Britannia in a storm. With their vivid shades and contrasting colours they were often the most captivating aspect of their wearer’s outfit — without ever overshadowing the royal head atop which they sat. Little wonder, then, that the hats of Philip Somerville have graced the heads of three generations of royal women: the Queen, Princess Diana and the Duchess of Cambridge. The milliner, who died this week after a long career, was loved and trusted by the Queen — as well as countless celebrities, from Lady Thatcher to Joan Collins — for his ability to make appropriate yet fashion-forward headwear. Scroll down for video . The Queen wears a straw brim and a silk crown to match her dress in Kuala Lumpur in 1989 (left) and a posy of flowers on the back of a mauve pillbox while visiting Singapore in 1989 . Both the Queen and Kate Middleton have worn creations by Philip Somerville to public occasions . He could just as easily turn out a youthful feathered number for Kate as a turban or Diana in the Middle East or a diplomatic fur hat for Thatcher to meet Gorbachev in Moscow. But it is his prodigious work for the Queen, for whom he created 40 or 50 hats a year, for which he will be best remembered. Crucially, he had her complete confidence, which meant she trusted his judgment and was willing to explore different shapes and colours. Veiled in a pale blue hairband during a 1990 visit to Japan (left) and this half-turban, half-hat (right) caused a stir in Abu Dhabi in 1989 . A soft ‘Smurf-style’ hat to match an Escada coat in 1989 (left) and a yellow silk-laced brim (right) to accompany the Queen Mother to Trooping The Colour in 1991 . His hats, while elegant and deceptively simple, moved royal style away from the small, back-of-crown affairs favoured by the Queen Mother and the young Queen to something much more striking and substantial. The son of a cobbler from Winchester, Somerville would visit the Queen at Buckingham Palace for fittings, after being sent swathes of fabric and dress designs from which to work up matching headpieces. He was far from intimidated by the experience. ‘Often I’ve put something on Her Majesty’s head and said: “Oops, I don’t like that, that’s not right,” ’ he once said. ‘I don’t think she’s used to that.’ Philip Somerville creates interesting shapes and textures with his hats but admits that sometimes they don't quite work . After agreeing the style, colour and fabric, he would then create the hat by hand on a wooden block and return to fit it again in person. Somerville had a similar impact on Diana, encouraging her towards bigger brimmed, bright hats with contrasting bands, from under which her heavily made-up eyes would peer out. He explained that she could get away with such huge headwear because of her statuesque figure. As he put it: ‘You could still see her underneath.’ And his love of modern design meant that well into retirement age he was still making hats that looked up-to-date on Kate, 50 years his junior. Opposite are his glorious creations as worn by the Queen, Diana and Kate . . .","The hats of Philip Somerville have graced the heads of three generations of royal women: the Queen, Princess Diana and the Duchess of Cambridge .

She said she does not think she will be able to return to the university to finish the semester, but that she still has every intention of graduating. She also refuses to read Rodger's manifesto or watch his videos, in which he describes his plan to 'slaughter' every girl in a sorority house to get back at them for paying him no attention.

"After the US rugby team failed to match New Zealand in Chicago on Saturday, the American press then failed to identify the legendary All Blacks correctly in the press. The 74-6 win at Soldier Field must have shocked the hosts, with the Chicago Sun Times newspaper referring to them as the 'legendary Aussie team' in a report. The mishap was reportedly the talk of New Zealand's flight over from the States to England ahead of this weekend's international at Twickenham. Julian Savea scored two tries as New Zealand thrashed the USA in Chicago on Saturday . The Chicago press referred to the New Zealand side as the 'legendary Aussie team' The All Blacks warmed up for that Test by running in 12 tries in a crushing victory at the weekend. The tries - through Nathan Harris, Cory Jane, Patrick Tuipulotu, Williams (two), Charles Piutau, Julian Savea (two), Joe Moody, Aaron Cruden, Israel Dagg and Sam Cane - show Steve Hansen's side are on devastating form ahead of the Autumn Tests against England, Scotland and Wales. Elsewhere, Joe Launchbury has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a neck injury, plunging England’s preparations for the autumn Tests at Twickenham into turmoil. The 23-year-old Wasps lock has been suffering from a persistent neck problem, caused by a nerve irritation, and his country have reluctantly had to accept that he will miss the four-match series against the Kiwis, South Africa, Australia and Samoa.

"Paul Brown (pictured) crashed into the back of Joseph Wilkins' bicycle while eating a sandwich . A lock-keeper has been spared jail despite killing a fireman when he crashed into the back of his bicycle while eating a sandwich. Paul Brown, 30, failed to see Joseph Wilkins, 39, as he drove along the country road between Appleton and Eaton, Oxfordshire. Mr Wilkins was thrown from his bike and landed on a grass verge while on a ride with friend Philip Forbes at 9.10pm on May 24 last year. Brown broke down in tears as Mr Recorder Andrew Burrows QC said that Mr Wilkins had two children who had been left fatherless. He said: 'He was killed instantly when the Ford . Focus driven by you from the direction of Appleton hit him from behind . on a straight section of Eaton Road. 'He leaves behind Nicci Saunders, his partner of seven years, and the rest of the family and close friends. 'She has known him since she was five years old and they have two daughters aged two and five years. 'Nicci . Saunders attended each day of the trial for causing death by dangerous . driving and I would like to take this opportunity to extent the sympathy . of the court to her and the family for the loss.' Brown was cleared by a jury of causing death by dangerous driving but admitted the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. During the trial the court heard that Brown, who looks after several locks along the River Thames in Oxfordshire, had been eating a sandwich shortly before the crash. However, Mr Recorder Burrows told the court that although he had been holding the sandwich, Brown had his eyes on the road ahead of him and had not been distracted by a mobile telephone or radio as he drove between 55 and 60mph. 'We're dealing with facts significantly below dangerous driving,' said Mr Recorder Burrows. You simply failed to see Joseph Wilkins. One might describe it as momentary inattention. 'I . have in the absolute forefront of my mind that cyclists are vulnerable . in the road and motorists should take care to avoid them.' The court was also told that Brown had no previous driving convictions and had not been involved in any other crashes in the 12 years he had been driving. He did have two previous convictions for possession of cannabis for which he was sentenced at magistrates' court, the court was told. Mr Wilkins was thrown from his bike and landed on a grass verge between Appleton and Eaton, Oxfordshire, on May 24 last year . Reading a letter written by Brown, Mr Recorder Burrows said: 'Since the trial verdict of not guilty for death by dangerous driving a lot of people have said ""You must be thrilled"" but that is not the case. 'Yes I feel relieved that a weight has been lifted from my shoulders but there are no winners in the situation.' The court heard how Brown had suffered from sleepless nights since the crash and regretted that he had left two children without a father. 'I know there is nothing I can do and this feeling of sorry will live with me forever,' he wrote in his letter. Brown, of Eynsham, Oxfordshire, was ordered to carry out a community order with an unpaid work requirement of 240 hours within the next 12 months, as well as four sessions of restorative justice. He was also given a supervision order and banned from driving for 12 months, with his licence endorsed.","Paul Brown hit Joseph Wilkins while driving between 55mph and 60mph .

"Vanished: Nida Ul-Naseer, 18, left her medication fro anaemia at home in Newport, South Wales, last week . The family of a missing teenage girl who is believed to have walked out following a row about university have made an emotional public appeal for information on TV. Nida Ul-Naseer, 18, went missing from her home in Newport, south Wales, on December 28 when she went to take the rubbish out. When she left, Nida did not have shoes, her mobile phone or a jacket and she needs medication to stop her becoming anaemic. A major police search operation to find her, which has gone on during the extreme weather, is continuing today. Her father Naseer Tahir, sister Naila Anwar and a brother appeared together in an interview on ITV's Daybreak programme this morning. The programme said they felt that earlier reports of a family argument involving Nida had been taken out of context. It also showed a printed sign pinned to the front door of their home in Newport which reads: 'Nida please come home. Don't worry. We are all missing you.' Her father said: 'We have some issues, but only in the family. The family are good. We want to see Nida here.' Naila Anwar described her sister as someone who is 'very close to us. She would always share everything with us. It is just out of character'. She said of her sister: 'She can't live without a phone. She just always talks to me on the phone.' She agreed there was no indication that her sister had in any way prepared to leave before vanishing. She had packed nothing. Pakistan-born Nida had been forced to sacrifice a place at the University of South Wales due to money problems . 'Everything is at home, her purse that she used, everything is at home, she's not even taken her coat. Nothing.' Nida is described as a quiet and very shy girl who is addicted to her mobile phone and afraid of the dark. It is not known what condition she suffers, as it is understood that the family have declined to elaborate. Her sister added: 'If you know anything about Nida, just tell us, just call the police. We just want to know that she's safe.' Friends . said the 18-year-old was 'disturbed and depressed' when she ran away . after a row with her parents over her wish to go to university. A major police search across marshlands is now under way as Nida remains missing for more than a week . Police have been scouring scrubland by a nearby river after the area was flooded in the storms. Nida’s parents have put a sign on the door of their home in Newport, South Wales, pleading with her to come home. The family, who were all born in Pakistan, are Ahmadiyya Muslims, an offshoot of Islam. Women . are usually allowed to go to university but are not allowed to marry . outside the community. Parents arrange marriages and men can take . multiple wives. Nida’s father, homeopath Naseer Tahir, 54, and mother Najma, 47, have refused to speak publicly about their daughter. However, . their eldest daughter Shamyla Naseer, 23, said: ‘They are really . depressed. It is a big loss for us. We are still looking.’ Nida, . a diligent student who finished school last summer, was looking forward . to starting a business and finance degree at the University of South . Wales but had to give up her place because of money problems. The family placed a sign on the door and issued public appeals to encourage Nida to come home . Gwent Police said: 'We believe she had a verbal disagreement within the home' Friends of the family said she fled after a furious argument with her parents on Saturday, December 28. ‘Her mother came to our house after to tell us,’ one said. ‘They . said she was in anger [sic] and she just left the house with nothing. No shoes on and no money. No medication, no jacket. She was supposed to . go to university but she couldn’t. They just said she couldn’t go.’ Another . close friend said: ‘She was disturbed about university admission and . finance problems. She couldn’t go so had to start a different course at a . college.’ The friend’s husband added: ‘She couldn’t go to uni and she was depressed and had arguments.’ Gwent Police assistant chief constable Paul Symes said: ‘We believe she had a verbal disagreement within the home which could have upset her and led to her leaving.’ Nida is 5ft 3in and slim with long dark hair. She is described as being of Asian-Pakistani appearance and was last seen in blue jeans and a black top.","Nida Ul-Naseer, 18, 'disturbed' when she fled South Wales home last week .

"Stopped: The Duke of York was ordered to 'verify his identity' by armed police officers in Buckingham Palace gardens . Scotland Yard today came out in support of armed police who challenged the Duke of York in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. They stopped Prince Andrew less than 48 hours after a break-in at the historic house and asked him to 'verify his identity'. It is the second time the Duke has had a run-in with police under similar circumstances. He has also been denied entry to Sandringham after he failed to show his official pass, which all royals are expected to carry with them. A source told the Evening Standard that the officers were 'doing what they are supposed to do', particularly so soon after a break-in. Former royal protection officer Ken Wharfe told the paper: 'I think this was a straightforward challenge at a time when there were probably extra patrols deployed. I do not think that guns would have been drawn. 'I could see Prince Charles having a joke about it, but Prince Andrew may have lost his rag a bit.' Prince Andrew reacted with fury at the two gun-wielding officers who confronted him as he walked in broad daylight through the grounds, sources revealed last night. The fifth-in-line to the throne stood his ground asking the officers 'Don't you know who I am?' and was said to have ‘made his thoughts plain’ during the highly-charged confrontation that followed. A royal source said: ‘He was incredibly, incredibly angry. It was very much a case of guns being pointed at him and “halt who goes there”.’ Yesterday police issued a humiliating apology to the Duke of York over the extraordinary error. According to the Daily Mirror, a source said that the Duke was red faced as he shouted at officers like a school teacher. Scroll down for video . Incident: Prince Andrew had gone for a walk around the gardens in Buckingham Palace when the two officers stopped him . They said: 'It got pretty heated because he just kept repeating himself ""Don't you know who I am?"". 'He felt the officers had sneaked up on him and believed they had behaved disrespectfully towards him.' They added that when the penny dropped they apologised to Prince Andrew. But this was not enough. The . source added: 'He gave them a proper dressing down, shouting at them . like a schoolteacher before he walked back to the main house - . completely livid.' It was . the second police fiasco within three days at what should be one of the . most secure estates in Britain. Just 48 hours earlier officers . discovered a mentally ill man attempting to smash down a door with a . fire extinguisher after he scaled a 12ft wall and broke in. Yesterday . Scotland Yard revealed senior officers had personally apologised to . Prince Andrew in a bid to draw a line under the latest matter. In . an unprecedented statement, a spokesman said: ‘We are grateful to the . Duke for his understanding and have apologised for any inconvenience . caused.’ Scotland Yard . declined to comment on reports that the officers shouted at the . 53-year-old royal, telling him to ‘put your hands up’ and ‘get on the . ground’. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh attend church yesterday. They were accompanied by Prince Charles . The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were in Aberdeenshire for the . Braemar Gathering where they attended a church service yesterday morning . A source said it . would not be ‘uncommon’ for police to shout when challenging someone, . but added that they did not know if he was ordered to lie down. In return, Prince Andrew issued a . conciliatory statement, saying: ‘The police have a difficult job to do . balancing security for the royal family and deterring intruders, and . sometimes they get it wrong.’ But . hinting at his anger over the confrontation, he added: ‘I am grateful . for their apology and look forward to a safe walk in the garden in the . future.’ Break in: Victor Miller was arrested inside the palace . Royal sources . said Andrew had been ‘infuriated’ by the fiasco. They continued to . insist that weapons had been drawn by police, who were in a state of . high tension following the previous security breach. One source said: ‘[Andrew] has calmed down now but it wasn’t a pleasant experience at all, and he was furious at the time.’ Another . palace aide told the Mail: ‘The police have acknowledged the incident . and apologised and he is happy to move on. He knows they have a . difficult job to do and is supportive of them.’ However, . senior palace sources also made clear that the prince had not been . willing to make a public statement until he had received a full apology . from the Met. The prince had just . returned from a two-week holiday in Spain with his former wife Sarah, . the Duchess of York, and their daughters Beatrice, 25, and Eugenie, 23. The . pair of uniformed marksmen challenged him after discovering him near a . perimeter wall in a relatively isolated area of the palace garden. Royal . staff are said to be incredulous that those involved failed to . recognise the prince, although officially police chiefs are saying they . did nothing wrong. One . source said: ‘Once it was clear who Andrew was, he certainly made his . thoughts plain about what had happened. 'It has been the subject of a lot . of conversation, especially as Andrew is not exactly known for . suffering fools gladly.’ His former protection officer Ken Wharfe describes him as rude, bossy and terse. At . the time of the incident, the Met’s Royal protection unit was on high . alert after Victor Miller, 37, was caught inside the ornate State Rooms . on Monday night. The complex can be accessed only through an inner . courtyard at the heart of the palace. The . DJ and sound engineer – who claims to have worked with stars including . Amy Winehouse, N-Dubz and Tinchy Stryder – is being held in a secure . mental health unit after being arrested and questioned on suspicion of . burglary, trespass and criminal damage. A suspected accomplice, a man aged 38, was found outside the palace and arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary. No royals were present when the break-in took place but experts are incredulous that Miller got so far before being stopped. The . two incidents highlight the tension between police and the royal family . over security. The Queen – who is currently staying at Balmoral Castle . with Prince Philip – has made it clear she wants the palace to be . accessible to the public as possible. Former . Scotland Yard Commissioner Lord Blair played down the Prince Andrew . confrontation as he said it was impossible to make any site completely . secure. ‘They will have to look at this,’ he added. ‘The story of the . burglar is a much more difficult story than the Andrew story.’ Last . night, former royal protection chief Dai Davies said of the Prince . Andrew incident: ‘[The officers] were alert and that was good, but . saying that, they should know who His Royal Highness is. ‘It . is a very big garden and we don’t know where he was and who he told, . but you would expect officers to be aware if he had gone out. 'Why wasn’t . anybody aware that he was having a walk about? ‘They . are right to challenge anybody they don’t know, quite obviously if they . don’t and something happens … they are criticised.’ A . Metropolitan Police spokesman declined to comment on whether the . officers would face any disciplinary action or ‘words of advice’. He . said: ‘Uniformed officers approached a man in the gardens of Buckingham . Palace to verify his identity. The man was satisfactorily identified. ‘No . weapons were drawn and no force  was used. 'We can confirm that the man . spoken to by officers was the Duke of York. We are making this public . with His Royal Highness’s permission.

"Mahdi Hassan, 19, may be the youngest person to join the group of British jihadists after travelling to the Middle East . A British teenager is thought to be the newest member of an al-Qaeda linked group of Islamist opposition fighters in Syria. Police believe Mahdi Hassan, 19, may be the youngest person to join the group of British jihadists after travelling to the Middle East in October. The former private school pupil from Portsmouth could be one of many UK graduates being encouraged to 'pack their bags' and travel to the war-torn country to avoid repaying student loans. The 19-year-old who is using the alias Abu Dujana is thought to have been recruited to the Islamic State in Iraq and Sham (Isis), an organisation accused of torturing children and exploiting boy soldiers as young as 10. The cousin of Ifthekar Jaman, a British man who was killed in Syria last week, has also joined the fight and spoken of his willingness to be 'martyred', the Sunday Times reports. A third man thought to be working within the organisation has been urging university graduates to abandon outstanding student loans and travel to Syria instead, using the disguise of aid workers to get in to the country. At least six British people are thought to be operating from the northern city of Ar-Raqqah which was seized by Islamist rebels earlier this year. According to the teenager's Facebook profile he has also travelled to Chechnya and Yemen, with his last online post simply stating in Arabic: 'Thanks be to Allah'. The 19-year-old is a former pupil of St John's College, a Catholic school in Portsmouth which charges £10,000 a year for day pupils and more than double for boarders. Hassan has been linked to Ifthekar Jaman (left) who was reportedly killed in Syria last week . Hassan has been linked to Jaman, 23, who was reportedly killed by a tanker last week after going to Syria in May. A second British man using the pseudonym Abu Qa'qaa is thought to have been shot in the foot in the same crossfire. Following the incident, Qa'qaa wrote on Twitter: 'He was a lion in battle and is now with his Lord,' while Jaman's younger brother last week tweeted: 'I know this is what you wanted; that's why I'm 100 per cent happy for you.' Another of the deceased's family members has been in Syria for several months under the alias of Abu Abdullah. In one online post the man said he was looking forward to being 'under the throne of Allah' and meeting his cousin again. According to the teenager's Facebook profile he was once a pupil at St John's College in Portsmouth . Abu Layth, a British man who claims to . be of Afghan origin, is another member and an avid follower of Anwar . al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda preacher who is credited with recruiting a . generation of terrorists online. The man, whose real identity is not known, has instructed people to join Isis by advising them to travel to refugee camps on the border with Turkey before entering Syria. Isis, which has strong links to al-Qaeda, has become increasingly formidable in recent years with members claiming responsibility for a string of suicide bombings throughout Iraq. The organisation has been accused of torturing and recruiting vulnerable children in Syria, with videos posted on YouTube seemingly showcasing boys as young as 10 being indoctrinated at its camps.","Mahdi Hassan is believed to have joined group of jihadists in Syria .

"A happy young couple who drowned in the raging torrent of a flooded river after going to wash their dogs died accidentally, a coroner ruled today. Recently engaged Alicia Williams and David Platt, both 25, had taken their five pets close to a weir on the River Clywedog, near their home in Wrexham, North Wales, on September 26 last year. Torrential rain had turned the river into a raging torrent, the inquest into their deaths held at Mold Magistrates’ Court heard. They were last seen 'laughing and joking' and washing the dogs on the edge of the water around 4.30pm. Alicia Williams and David Platt died after going to wash their dogs afer taking them for a walk . The body of Miss Williams, a stable-hand who had a three-year-old daughter, Ella, was found downstream from a half-empty shampoo bottle at around 5pm later that day. The body of Mr Platt, a carpenter who intended to turn professional as a boxer was found hours later partly submerged and trapped against a fallen tree in the river. No drugs or alcohol was found in either bodies, both were fit and healthy and there were no abnormalities to suggest either could have fainted or passed out and fell in the river. A pathologist concluded Miss Williams died from 'dry drowning' which can take the form of the trachea detecting water in the system causing it to close to prevent further fluid going into the lungs. Mr Platt’s lungs were filled with water. Recording her verdict, Nicola Jones, deputy coroner for North Wales, ruled both deaths an accident. Ms Jones said: 'There’s no evidence as to how Alicia and David have entered the water. 'There’s . no evidence as to why, and for us to guess would be mere speculation. They were a happy-go-lucky couple prior to this incident. 'The most . likely cause is that they have fallen into this river or gone into this . river and the river has taken over and they have drowned in that raging, . powerful torrent. They drowned close to a weir on the River Clywedog, near their home in Wrexham, North Wales . 'They . have entered that water and they have not stood a chance. They had no . idea what a dangerous position they were in by being that close to the . weir.' Mr Platt's mother, Sharon Platt, . said earlier that day her son told her he intended to go with Miss . Wiliams with their dogs, two jack russells, two retrievers and a whippet . to wash them by the river. Sian . Edwards, in a statement to the hearing, said she was walking her own . three dogs in the area and could hear a 'loud roar' from the water so . decided it was too dangerous to let her own dogs off the lead. Ms Edwards said the river had broken its banks in parts. She . saw the young couple on the edge of the weir adding: 'I could see them . talking and laughing with each other, washing and rubbing the dogs.' Miss Williams had a three-year-old daughter and worked as a stable hand . John Holland, another witness said he saw two of the dogs 'appear to struggle' against the 'very strong' current while in the river before managing to get out. John Davies, from Oswestry, was alerted by another dog-walker to something in the water and spotted the body of Miss Williams but there were no signs of life. 'The river was very, very fast, the power coming from that would be immense,' he told the inquest. Teacher David Humphrieys took his own dog to the same area when he saw four of the couple's dogs and thought it 'strange' the owners were not with them. He also saw a half empty bottle of shampoo on the ground before being alerted to Miss Williams' body in the water on a shingle bank a few hundred yards downstream. 'I could see it was a female with long hair and I had no doubt she was dead,' he said. The coroner asked him: 'Had someone fallen into the river that day, what chance would they have of surviving?' 'None,' he replied. The coroner continued: 'A fit young man, capable swimmer?' 'No,' Mr Humphrieys replied, 'No chance.' The inquest heard that around an hour after Miss Williams's body was found her family alerted police that she had gone to the river with Mr Platt. But it was only at 9.09pm that the North East Wales Search and Rescue Team was called, finding his body in the river just after midnight. But the coroner said a police helicopter had been used in the search with heat-seeking equipment but there were no signs of life. And Mr Platt's body did not have injuries to his arms and hands normally associated with someone clinging to a rock or branch in the hope help is on its way. 'There were no injuries of that nature,' Ms Jones added. 'I'm satisfied that he died quite quickly after entering the water,' she added. 'It is scant consolation that the delay in recovering David would not have saved him in my opinion.' The coroner added she would be writing to the National Trust, which owns the land near the river, the local council and the government authorities to take steps to improve signs warning of dangers near the riverbank.","Alicia Williams and David Platt, both 25, found dead in river near Wrexham .
