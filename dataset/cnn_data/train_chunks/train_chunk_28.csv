"(CNN) -- A 26-year-old man was arraigned Tuesday on murder charges in the January strangling deaths of his girlfriend and her four small children in an Oklahoma apartment. Joshua Durcho told a friend he choked Summer Rust but said her children were elsewhere, an affidavit says. Joshua Steven Durcho is charged with five counts of first degree murder in the January deaths of Summer Rust, 25; her son Teagin, 4; and daughters Evynn, 3, and Autumn and Kirsten, both 7. All five bodies were found January 12 in Rust's apartment in El Reno, Oklahoma, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City. Authorities believe Durcho killed Rust because she threatened to call the police on him, prosecutors said in court documents released Tuesday. He knew that likely would bring about his arrest, the documents said, because two outstanding bench warrants had been issued on him after he failed to appear in court in two criminal cases -- one on charges of driving under the influence and the second on charges of unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. Durcho had previously served time in prison after being convicted of unlawful possession of marijuana and ""vowed he would never go back to prison,"" the court documents said. Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty against Durcho, according to the documents, which note each victim suffered ""severe pain and anguish"" as they fought for their lives while being strangled with a ligature, which could include a string, cord or wire. In addition, the documents said, evidence indicates Durcho sexually abused both the 7-year-old girls at or near the time they died. In Tuesday's arraignment, Canadian County District Judge Edward Cunningham entered not guilty pleas on Durcho's behalf, according to The Oklahoman newspaper. An affidavit filed in the case, written by an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agent, said Durcho went to the home of an acquaintance January 12 and said he had ""choked"" Summer Rust -- identified in court papers as Summer Garas -- to death and was leaving Oklahoma. When the acquaintance, a women, asked Durcho about Rust's children, he ""told her that the children were at their grandmother's residence ... while he and Summer worked out their relationship problems,"" according to the affidavit. The acquaintance then called Durcho's mother, who drove to the apartment but received no answer at the door, the affidavit said. She asked her nephew, Durcho's cousin, to accompany her, leading to the discovery of Rust's body. The cousin notified police, and responding officers found the children's bodies in the apartment. According to the court documents released Tuesday, Durcho also told the female acquaintance that he killed Rust because she threatened to call the police on him. Durcho was arrested in Hamilton County, Texas, the day after the bodies were found. He has been appointed public defenders, according to Canadian County, Oklahoma, court records, and earlier waived his right to a preliminary hearing in the case.

"(CNN) -- A Mexican man who was allegedly killed on orders from his own cartel believed they were hunting for him after he began working as an informant and was fearful for his life, according to court documents. Police say soldier Michael Jackson Apodaca, 18, acted as the gunman. Jose Daniel Gonzalez Galeana began to worry after he began working as an informant for immigration officials in the United States. ""The victim was concerned for his own well-being and the safety of his family,"" the documents said, referencing statements the victim made to a witness. When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials gave Gonzalez a visa so he could live in El Paso, Texas, his fellow Juarez cartel members began to get suspicious, El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen said at a press conference. Allen said Gonzalez's exit from Mexico, combined with a raid on a cartel warehouse and the arrest of cartel lieutenant Pedro ""El Tigre"" Aranas Sanchez led cartel members to believe he might be working as an informant, Allen said. Then, a Mexican newspaper named Gonzalez as an informant in the arrest of the high-ranking cartel member, according to court documents. Police say Gonzales quickly became the target of his own cartel. Police said Gonzalez knew if his fellow cartel members found him, he would likely be killed, police said. On May 15, the cartel found him. He was shot eight times outside his home in El Paso, Texas, police said. Pfc. Michael Jackson Apodaca, 18, Ruben Rodriguez Dorado, 30, and Christopher Andrew Duran, 17, were each named as suspects Monday and each are facing one count of capital murder. The three men are being held on $1 million bond. Police said Apodaca was the shooter, Duran was the getaway car driver, and Rodriguez was the one who coordinated the murder. On Wednesday, police also arrested a 16-year-old who they said was involved in the surveillance and reconnaissance of the victim. The juvenile also faces one count of capital murder. Rodriguez and the victim were in the Juarez cartel, based across the border from El Paso, police spokesman Chris Mears said. He said police believe Apodaca and Duran were not cartel members. Apodaca joined the Army a year ago and worked as a crew member on a Patriot missile launcher, officials at Fort Bliss in El Paso said. ""He was in the top of his class,"" said Dave Jackson, his grandfather. ""You talk to all his sergeants. He's a good soldier. Now, before he went in [and joined the Army], he was in, he was in with a bad crowd."" Investigators said at the press conference they think the three suspects met through a relative of Rodriguez. ""He [Rodriguez] was the older guy, he provided the alcohol, the party locations,"" police Lt. Alfred Lowe said. ""And he recruited these people to do his bidding."" Once the three men were allegedly hired, they were ""told to find the victim in the United States,"" Allen said. Rodriguez paid the victim's cell phone bill hoping he would be able to learn where he lived, federal officials learned, according to court documents. Federal law enforcement was apparently concerned enough about the incident that officers told local law enforcement to signal Gonzalez's home could be at risk. Hours before the slaying, police said Rodriguez called a tactical supply store that exclusively sells the same brand of ammunition found at the scene. The suspects found Gonzalez at a relative's home in Canutillo, Texas, and followed him back to his home before shooting him, police said. The three arrested men's phone records showed their approximate locations on the night of the killing and corroborated that the suspects were tracking the victim, according to court documents. During an interrogation, Rodriguez told investigators he ordered Gonzalez's execution, police said. But Allen also said during the press conference that Rodriguez planned the killing and hired the other suspects after he was given the order by cartel lieutenant Jesus Aguayo Salas. Police said there was also a warrant out for his arrest. Rodriguez told police he paid the participants for their role in the killing, the affidavit said. It said he also noted that he was a midlevel member of the cartel, which he called the ""Compania,"" and said he was in charge of coordinating surveillance for the cartel, ""following intended victims up until their execution."" Duran and Rodriguez told police that Apodaca was paid to be the shooter and Duran to drive the getaway car, according to the affidavit. Allen said both men were each paid ""quite a robust amount of money ... under $10,000, in that area."" Police said more arrests could still come in the case. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Tracy Sabo, Mallory Simon and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","Police say victim believed if cartel found him, he would be killed .

"'SINDH KALAY', England (CNN) -- The aroma of freshly baking flatbread wafts through the air as a unit of British soldiers position themselves for a quick patrol around the village of Sindh Kalay. A British soldier on patrol in the mock Afghan village of Sindh Kalay. Market vendors hawk grapes and melons, as a group of village elders sit smoking water pipes and suspicious-looking men lurk beside battered motorcycles. What should the soldiers do? Conduct a weapons search? Approach the village elders first? In the complex political and cultural terrain of Afghanistan, what is the best course of action? Except this is not Afghanistan. It's Norfolk, England. Instead of the Hindu Kush mountains, it is the green ladscape and tidy farmhouses of the English countryside that stretch out behind them. Welcome to the British Army's state-of-the art training ground. It cost more than $20 million to build and every British soldier serving in Afghanistan will do his or her training here. ""I think it's the closest thing you are going to get short of being in Afghanistan itself,"" says Col. David Colthup of the 2nd Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment. His troops have already served one tour of duty in Afghanistan's Helmand province and are training for another. British troops serving in Helmand province are tasked with mentoring and training Afghan security forces. Not an easy job in a Taliban stronghold and Afghanistan's center of opium production. ""Ultimately, a soldier joins the army and trains to fight. That's what a soldier trains to do. But today, it's a much, much more complex environment,"" explains Colthup. ""The business of being able to interact either through an interpreter or through Afghan security forces, whether they are police or army. And to understand how the people operate and how we can interact better with them. Because ultimately, that's what it's about,"" he says. The most distinctive features of Sindh Kalay are the high three-meter walls that make up the village compound, creating narrow alleyways difficult for troops to patrol. The village is staffed with Afghan asylum-seekers, many of whom have fled the Taliban. They play the roles of market vendors, village elders and sometimes Afghan security forces. Several Afghan women are also on hand, useful for training British soldiers on the religious and cultural sensitivities of entering an Afghan home.  Watch British troops training in mock Afghan village » . The Taliban insurgents are played by Nepalese Ghurkha soldiers authorized to handle weapons. They play their roles silently, unable to partake in the Pashtun banter among the Afghans. Fazel Beria is also an asylum-seeker from Afghanistan. He is responsible for recruiting and for creating the sights and smells of Sindh Kalay and is easily identifiable as the only Afghan in the market in Western clothes. He beams with pride walking down the bazaar and clearly relishes his role in training the British Army. ""Everything with the culture comes up with the issue of hearts and minds,"" he explains. ""If you want to win that, you need to know about their culture. You need to respect their culture, their religion and their way of life."" He gives high marks to the soldiers training so far. After each exercise, the Afghan actors talk directly to the soldiers about what went wrong and what went right. Sometimes, it's the little things that count. ""Yes, there have been quite a lot of surprises,"" Beria says. Like Afghan will sit cross legged for hours. ""The British soldier cannot do that,"" he laughs. ""The Afghan will be sitting very comfortable and the British soldier is not. So, they have to get used to it.""  See photos of British troops on patrol in Sindh Kalay -- and for real in Afghanistan » . Previously, the army trained on farmhouses and in urban neighborhoods that resembled Northern Ireland more than Afghanistan. But Sindh Kalay does more than mimic the physical reality of Afghanistan. It also mirrors the changing tactics on the ground. Troops are grilled in IED training by amputees that act out the violence with latex wounds and fake blood. When a new IED tactic is discovered by troops in Afghanistan it is communicated to Sindh Kalay and put into practice immediately. ""Before we had this, it wasn't realistic enough,"" says Col. Richard Westley, head of training here. ""I think if you're going to be asking young men and women to go and risk their lives in someone else's country, then you have a moral obligation to prepare them for that environment. And that's what this village does. It gives them the isolation and complexity of an Afghan village. Which we can't do with farmhouses which represent Western Europe."" Some of the details in the Afghan village don't quite ring true. The slabs of lamb and beef hanging from the market stalls are plastic, as are the grapes and melons the vendors try and sell to the British soldiers. Still, Sindh Kalay is eerily effective. When soldiers sit down for a ""shura"" or meeting with village elders, helicopters buzz overhead and the soldiers seem surprised to be served a homemade yogurt and cucumber drink. But the unit commander can't help laughing when one of the Afghan village heads pulls out a ""list of damages"" by British troops. It turns out to be a receipt for the local supermarket.","British soldiers train in mock Afghan village before deployment to Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez continues to shuffle his top military commanders as he tries to make good on his recent promise to cleanse the government of corruption. Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez has faced political pressure to act on government corruption. After firing 700 police officers and forcing the retirement of 31 military and police generals Sunday, Fernandez on Monday removed more generals and reassigned others. The government also has announced that more than 535 members of the nation's 24,000-strong military have been forced out in the past six months due to their suspected involvement in the drug trade. Among the generals forced to retire was the former head of the nation's top anti-drug agency, the Dominican National Drug Control, known by its Spanish acronym DNCD. In his state-of-the-nation speech Friday, Fernandez said, ""In the Dominican Republic -- listen well -- narcotrafficking will not pass."" Despite the president's strong words, many Dominican citizens and outside analysts said narcotrafficking already has taken hold. ""The situation in the Dominican Republic is that organizations that are supposedly involved in fighting corruption and narcotrafficking are involved in it,"" said Tomas Castro Monegro, an anti-corruption attorney for 25 years in Santo Domingo, the capital. Tobias Friedl, a regional manager for Latin America at Washington-based iJET Intelligent Risk Systems, which helps companies assess and deal with dangers abroad, said, ""The security forces -- the army and the police -- have been corrupted."" The Dominican government generally carries out military promotions and retirements on February 27, the day in which the nation celebrates its 1844 declaration of independence from Haiti. But this year's numbers are unprecedented, Castro said. In 1978, he said, 48 generals were let go -- some for perceived corruption, others for political reasons. But Castro said he never has seen 700 police officers fired or more than 500 military personnel relieved of their duties. ""In the majority of cases,"" he said, ""there has to be something linking that person to narcotrafficking or corruption in general."" National police chief Rafael Guzman addressed his force Monday, admonishing them not to cave in to the many temptations they face. ""Today, more than ever, harassed by increasingly demanding challenges that jump out from all sides, just when drug trafficking persists in crippling society, it's time for all police agents and officers, the men and women of our dear institution ... to raise our chest, since this is the moment to define ourselves. We're with the nation or we're against it,"" he was quoted as saying in the Dominican Today and Listin Diario newspaper Web sites. Castro and others said police and the military have been involved in organized crime ""for a long time."" The evidence lies in the lavish lifestyles many of these officials are able to sustain on a public salary, they said. ""They live in contradiction with their salaries,"" Castro said. ""They live in houses that cost millions of pesos and drive big vehicles."" Corrupt officials prefer to work in customs, at the airport and the border and in anti-drug units, the lawyer said. They receive bribes from traffickers, Castro said, and also profit by arresting people involved in the drug trade and taking their possessions. Castro, a well-known attorney in a nation of less than 10 million, has represented drug suspects and has argued cases before the Dominican Supreme Court. In 2000, a published report said, he filed a suit against Fernandez alleging padded road-construction contracts. Friedl, the risk analyst, notes that Caribbean routes for drug shipments have diminished due to strong interdiction efforts by the U.S. Coast Guard. The majority of shipments now travel through Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama, he said. However, Friedl and others said, the drug trade still flourishes in the Dominican Republic. ""The Dominican Republic is not a major drug-producing country, but it acts as a transit point for cocaine, heroin, marijuana and ecstasy bound for the United States and Europe,"" said Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment, a publication that offers country-by-country risk analysis. ""The main trafficking routes are by sea from South America, and the drugs are then transferred by go-fast boats to islands such as Puerto Rico and St. Martin, on the way to the U.S."" The indexmundi Web site, which offers analyses on nations worldwide, said the Dominican Republic has become ""a trans-shipment point for ecstasy from the Netherlands and Belgium destined for the U.S. and Canada."" Jane's and indexmundi point out that substantial money-laundering also takes place in the Dominican Republic. Deteriorating conditions in Haiti, with which the Dominican Republic shares a 193-mile border, have led traffickers to go next door. ""Haiti was the place where drugs used to come through,"" Friedl said. ""Some of this now has shifted to the Dominican Republic."" Drug use in the Dominican Republic also has shifted. Ramon Cruz Benzan, a reporter for the Listin Diario newspaper who has been covering corruption cases, relates what many Dominicans say: ""Before, it used to come in and it would go. Now, it's not like that. It comes in and it stays."" Friedl points out that tourism creates a demand for drugs. ""Tourism is a huge thing in the Dominican Republic. Local consumption has definitely gone up."" And large Dominican communities in the United States and Puerto Rico ""create a natural connection"" for drug smuggling into those countries, Friedl said. Federal officials in New York have been battling -- and indicting -- Dominican natives on drug charges for years. Some observers see Fernandez's crackdown as a sign that he is getting serious. ""Fernandez is trying to weed out corruption,"" said Chris Kimble, a Latin America analyst also with iJET Intelligent Risk Systems. Others, such as the lawyer Castro, said Fernandez was forced to act after public outcry concerning the shootings deaths in August of seven Colombians in a drug-related case. A high-level commission appointed by Fernandez concluded that low- and midlevel officials from the national police were involved. But many Dominicans said they believe higher-ranking officers were responsible and the political pressure has been mounting on Fernandez to act. And many observers don't expect this will be the last of it.","President Leonel Fernandez fires 700 police officers in Dominican Republic .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Marine was killed in action and several others wounded Thursday in a major U.S.-led offensive in southern Afghanistan, the Marines said. U.S. Marines prepare for Operation Khanjar at Forward Operating Base Dwyer, Afghanistan, on Thursday. The push, called Operation Khanjar, is targeting militants in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region. The forces are attempting to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of national elections in August. Almost 4,000 Marines and sailors, along with several hundred Afghan security forces and British troops, worked to clear Taliban militants from population centers in the Helmand River valley. They have been operating in the districts of Nawa and Garmsir in central Helmand province and ""as far south as the vicinity of Khan Neshin, the capital of Rig district in the region of the Helmand River valley known as 'The Fishhook.' "" The Marines stressed the mission ""is to provide security for population centers"" and ""connect local citizens with their legitimate government while establishing stable and secure conditions for national elections."" Helmand's governor, Gulab Mangal, said he believes the operation will work and has assured the populace that it will provide security for them. His spokesman also confirmed that resistance had been minimal. The Marines said about 80 percent of the American troops are in direct combat, with the rest working in support. Taliban resistance has been light and sporadic, consisting of intermittent small arms fire, the Marines said on Thursday. The troops have encountered only relatively small groups of militants. ""Indications are the militants break away shortly after they make contact,"" Marine spokesman 1st Lt. Abe Sipe said, referring to what is regarded as the Taliban's habit of running and hiding after troops confront them. A Taliban spokesman said the group's fighters had killed 33 soldiers and destroyed several vehicles. CNN could not independently verify the Taliban claims because of safety and access issues. There has been an outcry in Afghanistan over civilian deaths in the Afghan war's crossfire, with much ire directed toward coalition air operations. But the Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan emphasized in a news release that the Marines have not ""received any confirmed reports of civilian casualties or damage to property."" They said they have not utilized ""artillery or other indirect fire weapons, and no bombs have been dropped from aircraft."" The brigade operates under NATO's International Security Assistance Force. The assault has prompted Pakistani authorities to redeploy troops along the Afghan border to stop Taliban from escaping the push in Helmand. More than 30 U.S., British and Danish troops have been killed there since January, with the latest being the Marine on Thursday and a pair of British soldiers slain in Helmand on Wednesday. The push is the largest since the Pentagon began moving additional troops into the conflict this year, and it comes after a British-led operation launched last week in the same region, the Marines said. When President Obama announced his strategy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan, he said American soldiers and Marines ""will take the fight to the Taliban in the south and the east, and give us a greater capacity to partner with Afghan security forces and to go after insurgents along the border."" He also said the bolstered deployment ""will also help provide security"" ahead of August presidential elections in Afghanistan. The Obama administration has moved about 21,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan, the original front in the war launched after the September 11 attacks. It is also the first big move since U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal took over as the allied commander in Afghanistan in mid-June. In Washington, a senior defense official said the size and scope of the new operation are ""very significant."" ""It's not common for forces to operate at the brigade level,"" the official said. ""In fact, they often only conduct missions at the platoon level. And they're going into the most troubled area of Afghanistan."" The defense official said the operation is a ""tangible indication"" of the new approach that McChrystal -- a former chief of the Pentagon's special operations command -- is bringing to the nearly eight-year war. ""They're not just doing an offensive push to get bad guys; they're going in to hold the area and stay there,"" the official said. ""This approach is indicative of McChrystal's philosophy: measuring success by the number of Afghans protected, not bad guys killed."" During his confirmation hearing in June, McChrystal told senators that the conflict requires a new focus on counterinsurgency to reduce violence and build support for the U.S.-led NATO alliance among Afghans. ""Although I expect stiff fighting ahead, the measure of success will not be enemy killed. It will be shielding the Afghan population from violence,"" he said. The Islamic fundamentalist Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan before its allies in al Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 11, 2001. Though quickly toppled after the attacks, its leaders escaped, and the movement regrouped in the Afghan countryside and across the border in Pakistan. Helmand was once known as the breadbasket of Afghanistan, but the fertile land is now used for growing poppies. Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent of the world's opium, with most of that coming from the poppies in Helmand. The drug trade is an import source of income for the Taliban and major supply routes run through the province. CNN's Atia Abawi in Afghanistan, Nic Robertson in Pakistan and Chris Lawrence and Barbara Starr at the Pentagon contributed to this report.","One Marine killed, others wounded; Taliban says 33 soldiers killed .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- A 12-mile oil slick near where an Air France jet crashed Monday into the Atlantic Ocean indicates the plane likely didn't break up until it hit the water, Brazil's defense minister said Wednesday. Image released by the Brazilian Air Force shows oil slicks in the water near a debris site. If true, that would argue against an in-flight explosion as the cause of the crash of Air France Flight 447, Defense Minister Nelson Jobim told reporters. But Robert Francis, former vice chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, said the question of determining where a plane broke up ""is a very difficult one to deal with."" He told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that ""there are lots of things that cause a plane to go out of control."" He added that extremely strong winds are not unusual near Brazil. Pilots who fly over that part of the world keep track of radar and ""are very, very wary about the weather as they go back and forth down in that area."" Jobim said currents had strewn the debris widely and that the search area had been expanded to 300 square miles. The Airbus A330, carrying 228 people, went down about three hours after beginning what was to have been an 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. No survivors have been found.  Map of Flight AF 447's flight path » . Investigators have not determined what caused the plane to crash. The flight data recorders have not been recovered, and the plane's crew did not send any messages indicating problems before the plane disappeared.  Watch as high seas hamper recovery » . The Brazilian Air Force said it found the oil slick and four debris fields Wednesday, but rain and rough seas kept searchers from plucking any of the debris from the water. Among Wednesday's finds were objects in a circular 5-kilometer (3-mile) area, including one object with a diameter of 7 meters (23 feet) and 10 other objects, some of which were metallic, Brazilian Air Force spokesman Jorge Amaral said. Searchers had found two debris fields Tuesday and identified the wreckage as coming from Flight 447. The debris was found about 650 kilometers (400 miles) northeast of the Fernando de Noronha Islands, an archipelago 355 kilometers (220 miles) off the northeast coast of Brazil. It included an airplane seat and an orange float. Wednesday's debris find was about 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of Tuesday's discoveries, Amaral said. Eleven aircraft and five ships are engaged in the search, including airplanes from France and the United States.  Watch as experts question whether recovery is possible » . The NTSB said Wednesday it has accepted an invitation from the French aviation accident investigation authority, the Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses, to aid in the investigation. NTSB Acting Chairman Mark V. Rosenker has designated senior air safety investigator Bill English as the U.S. accredited representative. The U.S. team will include technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration; General Electric, which made the plane's engines; and Honeywell, which made the plane's data recorders. The aircraft's computer system did send about four minutes of automated messages indicating a loss of cabin pressure and an electrical failure, officials have said. Some investigators have noted that the plane flew through a severe lightning storm. Foul play has not been ruled out. Air France had received a bomb threat May 27 for a flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Paris, sources in the Argentine military and police told CNN on Wednesday. According to the officials, who had been briefed on the incident and declined to be identified because of the ongoing investigation, the Air France office in Buenos Aires received the threat from a man speaking Spanish. Authorities checked the Boeing 777 and did not find anything. Security was tightened during check-in for Flight 415, which left on time and without incident, the officials said. Although officials have said the likelihood of finding survivors of Flight 447's crash is small, authorities have not closed the door on the possibility. ""Until the aircraft is identified, and the remains indicate that survival is technically impossible, we will maintain the possibility that there could be survivors,"" Amaral said. The majority of the people on the flight came from Brazil, France and Germany. The remaining victims were from 29 other countries, including three passengers from the United States. French officials said Wednesday they may never find the jet's flight data recorders. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates the ocean depth in the area at 3,000 meters (about 9,840 feet) to 7,500 meters (24,600 feet). Brazilian officials have said the sea depth in the area is around 2,000 to 3,000 meters (6,562 to 9,842 feet). ""We need time to reach the recorders,"" said Paul-Louis Arslanian, head of France's accident investigation bureau. The recorders are built to emit locator signals for up to 30 days. The French government has sent a research vessel carrying a deep-diving submersible to where the debris was found. ""Recorders from time to time were found after the 30 days, but I'm not so optimistic,"" Arslanian said. ""It's not only deep, it's also very mountainous at that place of the ocean."" But Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expressed optimism that the flight data recorders would be found. ""I think that a country with the ability to retrieve oil from 6,000 meters (3.7 miles) underwater can retrieve a plane from 2,000 meters (1.2 miles). The truth is, we are going to see -- I'm not a specialist and don't want to give predictions of what will happen,"" Lula said, according to the Brazilian state news agency.  A memorial for the victims of Flight AF 447, which included 61 people from France, 58 Brazilians, 26 Germans and people from 29 other countries, took place Wednesday at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Brazil has declared three days of mourning.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A rash of bank robberies in New York has the city's police commissioner worried that criminals have turned banks into ""virtual cash machines"" and some wondering whether tough economic times are fueling the trend. A surveillance camera captures a bank robbery suspect in New York on December 2. On Monday alone, robbers targeted five banks in the Big Apple, some striking in broad daylight and near famous landmarks. Police called the incidents unrelated, but they're just the latest examples of the growing tally of hold-ups. Bank robberies in New York have risen 54 percent compared with last year, with criminals committing more than 430  in the past 12 months, according to the New York police department. ""As it stands now, they've turned [banks] into virtual cash machines,"" New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. Bank robberies are also up in many areas across the country, including San Diego, California, and Houston, Texas, federal law enforcement experts told CNN. It's enough for some to link the trend to the rash of layoffs, the plummeting stock market and the bust in the real estate values, all of which have left many Americans in dire financial straits. ""It makes me think that the recession is making people go to extreme measures,"" a woman who frequents one of the banks robbed Monday told The New York Times.  Watch where the robbers struck » . But Kelly said it's not clear whether the bad economic times are fueling the unusual spike. ""People want to say... it's because of the economy. I think it's too early to make that statement,"" he said. CNN security analyst Mike Brooks agreed, adding that although there are typically many bank robberies during the holidays, there are no data to suggest that any recent spike was caused by the economy. Another expert said it's possible that the difficulty of finding a job right now may be a factor, but he doubted that law-abiding citizens are turning to crime to make ends meet. ""It's hard to attribute the bank robberies to people who were let go from Lehman Brothers or other organizations that are in trouble,"" said Alfred Blumstein, who has researched criminal justice for 20 years and is a professor of operations research at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. ""I would anticipate that people who rob banks have been involved with crime  before because that's not where one is likely to start,"" Blumstein said. A person who might turn to robbing banks is someone in their late teens or early 20s who has already broken the law and has decided to move on to a bigger target, he added. ""Bank robbery is a very high-risk activity, because most banks have various surveillance equipment in place, and it requires a degree of aggressiveness that otherwise law-abiding folks are not likely to take on,"" Blumstein said. Some officials say the modern, customer-friendly design of banks -- with easy access to tellers and cash -- is too tempting for robbers. ""We don't like the business plan that makes a bank look like a living room,"" Kelly said ""We [advise] just some common sense provisions, such as so-called bandit barriers, so that tellers have some option to act when somebody puts a note in front of them."" In fact, bank robbers have simply handed tellers a note in a vast majority of hold-ups in New York.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Fans wishing to attend singer Michael Jackson's memorial service next week will have to register for the 11,000 free tickets, organizers said Thursday. Michael Jackson is shown rehearsing at the Staples Center on June 23, two days before his death. Details on how to register for the 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) service at the 20,000-seat Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Tuesday are to be announced Friday. Jackson's family will hold a private ceremony before the public memorial service, his brother said Thursday. Speaking to CNN's Larry King, Jermaine Jackson said the ceremony will be held Tuesday morning, but he did not say where. Jackson rehearsed at Staples Center two nights before he died, and he appeared healthy in a video clip of the rehearsal obtained by CNN. Jackson died June 25 after collapsing at his rented home in Los Angeles. AEG, promoter of Jackson's planned London, England, shows, released the short video of Jackson rehearsing in the arena on June 23. Jackson sang ""They Don't Care About Us,"" a song from his ""HIStory"" album, as he danced along with eight male dancers.  Watch Jackson rehearse » . Jackson did not specify where he wished to be buried in a 2002 will, which was filed in court Wednesday.  Watch CNN's Anderson Cooper talk about his interview with AEG » . More information emerged Thursday about how Jackson's estate will be shared, which his will estimated in 2002 as being worth $500 million. The family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge of the contents of the trust. Mother Katherine Jackson's 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson's three children after her death, the source said. The children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- also will share 40 percent of the estate's assets, and the remaining 20 percent will benefit charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said. A judge has delayed for a week, until July 13, a hearing to decide whether Katherine Jackson will remain the temporary guardian of Jackson's children. At a brief talk with reporters Thursday, an attorney for Jackson's ex-wife Debbie Rowe said she ""has not reached a final decision"" on whether she will challenge Jackson's mother for custody of Jackson's two oldest children, according to her lawyer. A Los Angeles TV station quoted Rowe on Thursday morning saying, ""I want my children."" Except for the statement to the radio station, she has not publicly indicated whether she would seek custody now that Jackson is dead. Rowe was left out of the will. ""I have intentionally omitted to provide for my former wife, Deborah Rowe Jackson,"" the will said. The will nominated Katherine Jackson, now 79, as the guardian of his children. If Katherine Jackson were to die, ""I nominate Diana Ross as guardian,"" Jackson said in the will, written July 7, 2002. Singer Ross, 65, was a lifelong friend of Jackson's.  Watch how the two had a close relationship » . There's also a question on when the will's executors should take over control of the late entertainer's assets, which Judge Mitchell Beckloff temporarily placed under Katherine Jackson's control. One man named as executor is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer's death. He helped acquire Jackson's music catalog, which is worth millions. The other is music industry executive John McClain, a longtime Jackson friend who has worked with him and his sister Janet. DEA reportedly joins investigation . The Drug Enforcement Administration has joined the investigation into Jackson's death, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night. And the California State Attorney General's office said Thursday that it is helping the Los Angeles Police Department in its investigation. The attorney general's office said it will assist police in sifting through information in a state database that monitors controlled medication. Two law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA inquiry, saying agents would look at doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply. Neither official wanted to be identified because they could not comment publicly on the matter. Officially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles Police Department, which would not confirm the involvement. ""We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act,"" said Sarah Pullen of the DEA. ""However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson."" Speculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills. The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results. On Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They had impounded the vehicle Friday, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications. Police did not say whether they found anything. Murray's attorneys issued a statement, asking the public to reserve judgment about the cause of death until the coroner's tests are complete. ""Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson,"" the statement said. ""We will not be responding to rumors and innuendo."" No public showing planned for Neverland . Logistical and financial challenges derailed earlier plans for a public viewing and private memorial at Neverland Ranch. Planning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson's body from Los Angeles to the Santa Barbara County ranch, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly. Law enforcement sources had said a public viewing at the ranch was under consideration for Friday, but a spokesman for the family said that it would not happen. ""Plans are under way regarding a public memorial for Michael Jackson, and we will announce those plans shortly,"" said Ken Sunshine, whose public relations firm had been hired by the Jackson family. Despite the announcement, more than two dozen TV satellite trucks lined the narrow two-lane road leading to the ranch. For a time, the California Highway Patrol closed the road to clear up a small bottleneck of cars created by Jackson fans and the media. CNN's Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Michael Carey, Paul Vercammen, Carol Cratty and Kara Finnstrom contributed to this report.","NEW: 11,000 memorial service tickets will be made available .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The British are coming, the British are coming -- to Brooklyn? By subway? Barclays has paid $300 million for the naming rights to the New Jersey Nets arena. New York's struggling Metropolitan Transportation Authority has sold the naming rights to the second-busiest subway stop in Brooklyn. The Atlantic Avenue-Pacific Street Station will now have the name of a British bank, Barclays, added to it. Several subway riders are outraged that Barclays has purchased the naming rights to this subway stop, which sees about 10 million people go through it each day. One straphanger said, ""A London Bank shouldn't be the name of this train station; it's something that belongs to the public domain."" Another said, ""It's just everywhere we go, everything we do, it's just branding, branding, branding. It's America now."" Renaming the Atlantic-Pacific Station is tied to the construction of Barclays Center, the new sports arena for the National Basketball Association's New Jersey Nets. Barclays is paying developer Forest City Ratner $300 million for naming rights to this arena. Ratner, in a separate deal, will be paying the Metropolitan Transportation Authority $200,000 a year for the next 20 years to rename this commuter hub. Authority Press Secretary Jeremy Soffin said, ""Like transit systems all over the U.S. and around the world, we are facing budget deficits."" In an effort to bridge the authority's $1 billion deficit, the transit giant that oversees the operation of the city's subways, buses and rail lines wants to follow the Barclays example with stations throughout the system. Though the Atlantic-Pacific subway station is the first in New York for which naming rights have been sold, across the country, there have been several cases of public transportation systems using naming rights to increase revenue. In 2003, the Las Vegas monorail system signed a 12-year, $50 million deal with Nextel to put its name on the station in the Las Vegas Convention Center. The Cleveland Bus System sold station names to two hospitals for $1.1 million a year. Internationally, Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority has been selling the naming rights of 23 metro stations. However, not all naming rights deals are successful. In 2001, the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority tried to raise $22 million by auctioning the naming rights to four historic ""T"" stations. It received no bids. Reassuring the public that there are certain lines they won't cross when it comes to renaming stations of historical value, Soffin said, ""It's a very clear line there, and we want to be as open as possible, but we're not sort of selling the shop here.""","Basketball arena developer pays $200,000 a year for 20 years for rights .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Insurgents' use of roadside bombs has increased dramatically in Afghanistan this year, according to Pentagon statistics, and the United States' top military official is calling them the ""No. 1 threat"" to troops there. An IED is exploded by U.S. Marines near the remote village of Baqwa, Afghanistan, in March. In June there were 736 incidents in Afghanistan involving roadside bombs, called improvised explosive devices or IEDs, and 82 ""effective attacks,"" ones that caused casualties among coalition forces, the figures show. That was up from 263 incidents and 25 effective attacks in February, with the numbers increasing each month, said the Pentagon's Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, an agency dedicated to thwarting roadside bombs. The number of coalition forces killed and wounded by such bombs has climbed, though not steadily, from 18 killed and 33 wounded in February to 23 killed and 166 wounded in June, the agency said. No numbers were provided for July, but such attacks have continued this month. In the latest, roadside bombs killed two NATO-led troops on Thursday, one in eastern Afghanistan and the other in southern Afghanistan. The military has called IEDs the weapon of choice for insurgents in that country. And at the National Press Club on Wednesday, Adm.

"(CNN) -- David Letterman has been taking some heat and issuing some apologies for the off-color joke he made last week about Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's daughter, but he found a sympathetic critic in comedian Jeff Foxworthy on Monday. Jeff Foxworthy, the father of two teenage daughters, says David Letterman's joke was flawed. The best-selling comedy recording artist in history paid a visit to CNN's ""Larry King Live"" to talk about Letterman's gaffe. ""As a father of two teenage daughters, it was a flawed joke,"" Foxworthy said. Letterman joked last Tuesday that Palin's ""daughter was knocked up by Alex Rodriguez"" at a recent Yankees game, stirring up an angry reaction from the Palin family. Letterman has since apologized twice for what he called ""inappropriate"" humor. And Foxworthy agreed: ""I don't think any kind of joke about someone having sex with a teenage girl is funny.""  Watch Foxworthy comment on joke » . But Foxworthy's rebuke of the joke was gentle in tone, and he showed empathy for Letterman as well as the Palin family. ""As a comedian, you look at what Dave does,"" Foxworthy said. ""You're trying to do this night after night, year after year, decade after decade -- at some point in the road, are you going to throw one out there you shouldn't have? Yeah."" Foxworthy said it's probably time to forgive and forget. ""It's about forgiveness,"" Foxworthy said. ""He came back and apologized and said: 'Hey, the joke is flawed.' And to me you move on."" King asked what advice he'd give Sarah Palin if she received an invitation to appear on Letterman's ""Late Show."" Foxworthy said he'd encourage the Alaska governor to accept it. ""Life is about forgiveness. I think that makes her bigger to go on there and say 'I accept your apology'."" Letterman has insisted he was referring to Palin's 18-year-old, Bristol, who gave birth to a boy in December, and not her 14-year-old, Willow, in the joke. Palin has called that a ""weak, convenient excuse"" for a joke that was""inappropriate"" no matter which daughter was the target. Foxworthy, the author of ""How to Really Stink at Work,"" also made some ""confessions"" about his pre-comedy career in corporate America. ""I was at IBM for five years; I don't know how much work I did,"" Foxworthy said. The comedian, who said he used to make prank phone calls to his boss at work to lure him back and forth from his desk, had this tongue-in-cheek advice for people about how far to take things on the job: . ""You don't really want to get fired; you want to have a job. But you don't want to do it well, because you're going to be promoted, and that's a lot of pressure. Who can have any fun with that kind of anvil hanging over your head?"" Foxworthy is also the host of ""Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader"" and talked about the appeal of a game show that spotlights how much people tend to forget after all those years of cramming in facts at school. ""It's a strange thing why the brain keeps some things,"" Foxworthy said. ""Like I don't know why my brain has all the words to 'The Brady Bunch' theme song, but it deleted everything about triangles.""","David Letterman made off-color joke about Gov.

"(CNN) -- Big Ben, arguably the world's most famous clock, celebrates on Sunday 150 years of keeping London on time. The British landmark has lived through war, bad weather and disasters. Big Ben's distinctive bongs have been a part of the London scene for 150 years. Big Ben is the 14-ton bell inside the world's largest four-faced chiming clock, although most people use the name to describe the tower that houses it. The clock is perched on a 96-meter (310-foot) elegant tower at the Westminster Bridge end of the Palace of Westminster. The Victorian masterpiece, which provides distinctive chimes known as bongs, was voted Britain's favorite monument in 2008. It has been featured in films such as ""101 Dalmatians"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix."" Big Ben has been disrupted a few times over the years for various reasons, including weather and breakages. Its bongs went silent for about two months in August 2007 to allow a crew to repair its mechanism system. During that time, the rest of the clock was running on an electric system. It was fully restarted again October 1. The clock pays tribute to Britain's royal history: It has a Latin inscription of the phrase: ""O Lord, save our Queen Victoria the First."" The ornate masterpiece has some quirky features. The hour hand, which weighs 300 kilograms (661 pounds), is made of gun metal while the minute hands are made of copper sheet. The minute hands would not work when they were first made of cast iron because they were too heavy. The clock started working on May 31, 1859, after the lighter copper hands were installed. The origins of the landmark's name are obscure. Some say it was named after the 1850s heavyweight boxer Ben Caunt while others suggest it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, a former member of parliament. Hall, the commissioner of works in 1859, was responsible for ordering the bell. Alan Hughes, the director of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry that made the bell, prefers the latter. ""I suppose I like it chiefly because it was a nickname of a man who was big and loud and pompous, and never used one word if 27 would do,"" he said in a 2008 interview. Hughes' company also made America's Liberty Bell and a number of others for cathedrals and churches around the world.","London's Big Ben turns 150 years old on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The emergence of a purported statement from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden about U.S. policy in Pakistan as the U.S. president embarks on a major trip to Muslim countries is no coincidence, the White House spokesman and a counterterrorism official say. Osama bin Laden is seen in an image taken from a videotape that aired on Al-Jazeera in September 2003. ""I think the reports we've seen are consistent with messages we've seen in the past from al Qaeda threatening the U.S. and other countries that are involved in counter-terrorism efforts,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters Wednesday. ""But I don't think it's surprising that al Qaeda would want to shift attention away from the president's historic efforts and continued efforts to reach out and have an open dialogue with the Muslim world."" A U.S. counterterrorism official, asked about the statement, said bin Laden ""has timed the release of tapes to major events so it is not surprising that he picked this particular week."" Al Jazeera, the Arabic-language TV network that aired the message on Wednesday, said the statement was ""a voice recording by bin Laden."" As for the tape's authenticity, a CNN analysis said the voice does indeed sound like the leader of the terrorist network that attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. The counterterrorism official said ""there has never been a fake Bin Laden tape."" The message comes as Obama begins his trip to the Middle East, visiting Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and, in Egypt on Thursday, making a major speech to the Muslim world. Zeroing in on the conflict in Pakistan's Swat Valley, where Pakistan's troops are taking on Taliban militants, the message asserts that Obama is proving that he is ""walking the same road of his predecessors to build enmity against Muslims and increasing the number of fighters, and establishing more lasting wars."" The message said U.S. policy in Pakistan has generated ""new seeds of hatred and revenge against America."" The remarks -- which would be bin Laden's first assessment of Obama's policy -- were believed to have been recorded several weeks ago at the start of a mass civilian exodus because of fighting in northwestern Pakistan. The speaker cites strikes, destruction, and Obama's ""order"" to Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari ""to prevent the people of Swat from implementing sharia law."" ""All this led to the displacement of about a million Muslim elders, women and children from their villages and homes. They became refugees in tents after they were honored in their own homes,"" the message says. ""This basically means that Obama and his administration put new seeds of hatred and revenge against America. The number of these seeds is the same as the number of those victims and refugees in Swat and the tribal area in northern and southern Waziristan."" And, the message says, ""the American people need to prepare to only gain what those seeds bring up.""  Watch what the speaker says on the tape » . The speaker also says Zardari and Pakistan's military chief, Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, continue to divert the army's main role from protecting the nation to fighting Islam and its followers. He says the war is also hurting Pakistan's economy, endangering the country's religion and security and ""fulfilling an American, Jewish and Indian plot."" ""Most of the Pakistani people reject this unjust war. Zardari did this in response to the ones paying him in the White House -- not 10 percent but multiple folds of that,"" the message says. The message points to India's aspirations, saying it is ""easy for India to subject the disassembled territories of Pakistan, one after another, for its own benefit, like the case of eastern Pakistan before, or even worse."" ""This way, America eases its worry towards Pakistan's nuclear weapons,"" the message says. Eastern Pakistan is a reference to Bangladesh, which had been part of Pakistan until it became an independent country in 1971. Pakistan and India have also been at odds over the disputed territory of Kashmir, and pro-bin Laden jihadis have opposed Indian rule there. Richard Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special envoy to Pakistan and India, said he hadn't listened to the message but commented on what he had heard about it. ""The idea that anyone is responsible for the refugee crisis other than al Qaeda and the Taliban and the other people who have caused such tragedy in western Pakistan is ludicrous,"" he said. ""This entire problem begins with al Qaeda and its associates, and everybody in the world knows that, and it's silly to even respond to such a ludicrous charge."" Al Jazeera aired three separate segments totaling just over four minutes long from what it said is a new bin Laden audiotape aired over an old still picture of the terrorist leader. The network's anchors took part in describing each of the segments before they ran them. Since the message was not posted on the radical Islamist Web sites that usually carry statements from al Qaeda, it is believed that this latest message was hand-delivered to the TV network, based in Doha, Qatar. In other purported bin Laden messages issued in March, he called for Somalia's new president to be overthrown and called Israel's recent offensive in Gaza a ""holocaust."" Bin Laden has delivered many messages over the years, but the last video message from him was in early September 2007. In that video message, he criticized U.S. Democrats for failing to stop the war in Iraq; spoke of the anniversary of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II; the troop surge in Iraq; and world leaders such as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. On that tape, bin Laden's appearance was artificially changed for the first time. He dyed his beard from grayish white to black, leading analysts to believe that he has switched to sending only audio messages because he is altering his looks and doesn't want people to know what he looks like. Analysts also believe that bin Laden hasn't made videos lately because they are more labor-intensive to produce. There have been gaps between videos from bin Laden, with many audio messages in between, each time prompting analysts to theorize he might be dead. The last two videos of bin Laden himself delivering an address were the 2007 tape and another in 2004.  See a timeline of bin Laden messages » . The U.S. counterterrorism official said of the latest purported bin Laden tape that ""while the words are different"" from other messages, this statement ""recycles the broad themes of messages past."" ""While we are still looking at the message closely, there is no reason to believe any specific or credible threat is contained in it,"" the official said. Al Qaeda's second in command issued an audio statement Tuesday saying Obama is not welcome in Egypt. Ayman al-Zawahiri said relations with the United States cannot be mended so long as the administration maintains its alliance with Israel. In a message called ""Tyrants of Egypt and America's agents welcome Obama"" that was posted on Islamist Web sites, al-Zawahiri once again lashed out at the United States. Obama's message to the Muslim world, he said, has already been delivered with his support for ""Zionist aggression."" In the 10-minute audio message, al-Zawahiri said Obama had already made himself an enemy of Muslims by sending more soldiers to Afghanistan, ordering bombings in the tribal areas of Pakistan and administering a ""bloody campaign against Muslims"" in Pakistan's Swat Valley.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose re-election last month led to massive protests, on Tuesday called the balloting ""the most free election anywhere in the world."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected last month, setting off days of protests. ""It was a great event,"" he said in a nationally televised address. The election, which opponents charge was rigged, was followed by street demonstrations and civil unrest that led to the deaths of at least 20 protesters and the arrest of more than 1,000, according to Iranian state-run media. The numbers of casualties and arrests could not be independently verified by CNN because the Iranian government banned coverage by international journalists. The president, who said voter turnout was 85 percent, said opponents ""did not provide even one piece of document regarding irregularities or vote fraud."" Without specifically mentioning the post-election violence, Ahmadinejad said criticism of government ""is the key to the success of a nation."" Everyone has criticisms, he said. ""I have my own."" But he accused the ""arrogant powers"" and ""enemies"" of Iran of interfering in his country's affairs, including the post-election situation. Some Iranians collaborated with enemies, the president said. Ahmadinejad also said Tuesday he believes the government should be ""substantially"" reorganized. Although he didn't elaborate, he said the areas of employment, housing, development and civil rights were high on the agenda. ""[We] need to create newer capacities and prepare ourselves for this new period,"" he said, apparently referring to his upcoming second term in office. ""With this election, we have entered a new era ... in domestic spheres and on an international level,"" he added. He called it ""an era of solidarity."" ""The government is at the service of the entire people,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""Things will be done in a better way, more effective way, so we can reach higher aspirations."" He said experts have been invited to help the government achieve progress.","Iranian president calls recent vote ""most free election anywhere in the world""

"(Tribune Media Services) -- While most first-time visitors to Europe choo-choose to travel by train, consider the convenience of driving. Behind the wheel you're totally free, going where you want, when you want. When drivers come off a ferry in Great Britain or Ireland, they usually see a sign warning them to drive on the left. Driving in the British Isles is wonderful -- once you remember to stay on the left and after you've mastered the roundabouts. But be warned: Every year I get some emails from traveling readers advising me that, for them, trying to drive in Great Britain and Ireland was a nerve-wracking and regrettable mistake. Here's a tip: If you want to get a little slack on the roads, drop by a gas station or auto shop and buy a green ""P"" (probationary driver with license) sign to put in your car window. Of course, in Britain and Ireland you'll be driving on the left-hand side of the road. Why that side? Originally, it was in order for you to drive defensively ... with your ""sword hand"" on the inside to protect you against oncoming traffic. Many Yankee drivers find the hardest part isn't driving on the left, but steering from the right. Your instinct is to put yourself on the left side of your lane, which means you may spend your first day or two constantly drifting off the road to the left. It can help to remember that the driver always stays close to the center line. Not only will you be driving on the left, but you'll also be using roundabouts, where traffic continually flows in a circle around a center island. These work well if you follow the golden rule: Traffic in roundabouts always has the right-of-way, while entering vehicles yield. For some drivers, roundabouts are high-pressure traffic circles that require a snap decision about something you don't completely understand: your exit. To replace the stress with giggles, make it standard operating procedure to take a 360-degree, case-out-your-options exploratory circuit. Discuss the exits with your navigator, go around again if necessary, and then confidently wing off on the exit of your choice. Whenever possible, avoid driving in cities. London even assesses a congestion charge -- about $13 per day -- to drive in the city center (see www.cclondon.com). It's best and less stressful to begin your driving experience away from big cities, so try renting your car in a smaller town. A pleasant scenario for a Britain itinerary would be to start your trip in a small town such as Bath, rent a car when leaving Bath, explore Britain at your leisure by car, then drop off the car in York, and take the train into London, where you can rely on the excellent public transportation system. Outside of the big cities and the motorways (freeways), British and Irish roads tend to be narrow. Adjust your perceptions of personal space. It's not ""my side of the road"" or ""your side of the road."" It's just ""the road"" -- and it's shared as a cooperative adventure. In towns, you may have to cross over the center line just to get past parked cars. Sometimes both directions of traffic can pass parked cars simultaneously, but frequently you'll have to take turns -- follow the locals' lead and drive defensively. On rural roads, locals are usually courteous, pulling over against a hedgerow and blinking their headlights for you to pass while they wait. Return the favor when you are closer to a wide spot in the road than they are. Do some homework before getting behind the wheel; buy good maps and check various mapping Web sites, including Michelin's site and Google Maps. A GPS device can also be helpful. You'll notice some differences between driving in the Republic of Ireland versus the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland). In the Republic of Ireland, the speed limit is in kilometers per hour, road signs are usually bilingual (but not always -- ""geill sli"" means yield), and roads are more likely to be bumpy and poorly maintained. In the United Kingdom, the speed limit is in miles per hour, signs are in English (except in Wales, where they are bilingual), and roads are generally in better condition. Even if you don't drive, as a pedestrian you'll have to remember that among our British and Irish cousins' many unusual habits, traffic comes from the opposite direction -- look both ways before crossing any street. Horror stories about British and Irish traffic abound. They're fun to tell, but driving here is really only a problem for those who make it one. The most dangerous creature on the road is the panicked American. Drive defensively, observe, fit in, avoid big-city driving when you can and wear your seat belt.

"(CNN) -- A University of Memphis football player was shot and killed on campus Sunday night, prompting administration officials to cancel classes and plead for anyone with information to come forward. Police said defensive lineman Taylor Bradford, 21, apparently was shot around 9:45 p.m. (10:45 ET) Sunday. The 5-foot-11-inch, 300-pound junior apparently then got into his car, drove a short distance and hit a tree near the campus residence hall area. Bradford, of Nashville, Tennessee, was pronounced dead at Regional Medical Center. The university locked down the residence halls and canceled classes for Monday as an ""early precaution"" against the possibility there was an armed attacker on campus, university President Shirley Raines said. Raines said the school did not activate its newly installed emergency public address system because university police determined the campus was not in imminent danger. Witnesses told police they saw people they suspect were the assailants fleeing the scene, Raines said. University police said the Memphis Police Department's homicide bureau is assisting in the investigation. Officials said they hope that surveillance cameras in the area will yield clues. Memphis Director of Police Services Larry Godwin said that because such crimes are rare on the university campus Bradford ""may very well have been targeted."" ""We're looking at everything,"" he said. ""We're hoping that someone will step forward with some information to point us in the right direction."" Residence halls reopened early Monday, and classes are expected to resume Tuesday. On Monday, offices at the university were open so students could have access to counseling and talk with faculty and staff, said university spokesman Curt Guenther. Raines said she and head football coach Tommy West met with Bradford's parents and other family members to express their condolences.

"BUCHENWALD, Germany (CNN) -- President Barack Obama made an emotional visit to the former Nazi concentration camp at Buchenwald, Germany, Friday, saying that the camp should serve as a reminder of humanity's duty to fight the spread of evil. President Obama visits Buchenwald with Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, and survivor and activist Elie Wiesel. The visit had personal significance for the president, whose great-uncle helped liberate prisoners from the camp during World War II. ""I will not forget what I've seen here today,"" Obama said after touring the camp with German Chancellor Angela Merkel; Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, and survivor Bertrand Herz. ""These sites have not lose their horror with the passage of time,"" Obama said. ""This place teaches us that we must be ever vigilant about the spread of evil in our times. ... We have to guard against cruelty in ourselves ....""  Watch Obama honor Holocaust victims » . Wiesel, whose father died at Buchenwald, was imprisoned at the camp during the final months of the war in 1945. ""Every war is absurd and meaningless,"" Wiesel said. ""The world hasn't learned. ... Had the world learned, there would have been no Cambodia and no Rwanda and no Darfur and no Bosnia."" Like Obama, Wiesel stressed that the lessons of Buchenwald are that humanity must unite to keep such atrocities from happening again and work toward making the 21st century ""filled with promise and infinite hope."" ""Memory must bring people together, rather than set them apart. Memories here not to sow anger in our hearts, but on the contrary, a sense of solidarity with all those who need us,"" Wiesel said. Obama told reporters earlier in the day that his great-uncle, Charles Payne, had a ""very difficult time re-adjusting to civilian life"" after helping his Army division liberate the Ohrdruf forced labor camp, a subdivision of Buchenwald . ""And it is now up to us, the living, in our work, wherever we are, to resist injustice and intolerance and indifference in whatever forms they may take and ensure that those who were lost here did not go in vain."" Later Friday, the president traveled in Germany to Ramstein Air Base and visited with wounded American troops at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. He then moved on to Paris, France, ahead of D-Day commemoration services on Saturday. Obama began his tour of the Middle East and Europe in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, before moving on to Egypt, where on Thursday he delivered a key speech on American and Muslim relations. In the 55-minute address -- billed as a fence-mending effort between the United States and Islam -- the president urged those in the Cairo audience and the people across the globe viewing the speech on television to enter a new, productive and peaceful chapter of relations. CNN's Ed Henry contributed to this report.","Obama recalls great-uncle's role in liberation of Buchenwald as reason for tour .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Rob Thomas is a busy guy -- so busy, he apparently hasn't had much time to check in with his Matchbox Twenty bandmates. Rob Thomas prefers to focus on the ""musician"" side of his career, rather than ""celebrity."" We only know this because we ran into guitarist Paul Doucette at the BMI Pop Awards in Beverly Hills several weeks ago, where he was picking up a plaque for songwriter of the year. ""We're interviewing Rob about his solo album,"" I told him. ""Hey,"" Doucette exclaimed. ""Tell that guy to call me, would you? I didn't even know he was in L.A.!"" By the time we met up with Thomas the next day, he and Doucette had already connected over drinks somewhere between midnight and the morning -- musician's hours. Thomas recently released ""Cradlesong,"" his second solo CD. Even though he's clearly excited about it, he spends as much time talking about Matchbox Twenty as he does the solo album he's in town to promote. For the 37-year-old singer-songwriter, it's all interconnected. One has fed into the other since he gained household name status a decade ago, after scoring a massive, Grammy-winning hit with Carlos Santana on ""Smooth.""  Watch Thomas describe the difference between being a celebrity and a musician » . The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Who has given you the best piece of advice? Rob Thomas: Carlos [Santana] will constantly send you messages out of nowhere. Carlos will call me at 10 at night and be like, ""Listen, I had a dream about you, and so much good is happening, but there's dark forces at work, and when you get out of here, I have this woman who wants to cleanse you."" I think Carlos' most important piece of advice ever was that he taught me the difference between being a celebrity and being a famous musician. CNN: But some artists don't have that kind of success, and they try for celebrity instead. Thomas: Sure, and sometimes that works -- but none of my favorites have done that. I remember when Matchbox Twenty started years ago, and we had a lot of success, but nobody knew who we were. The first time we did an interview with MTV, it was about how no one knew who we were. We had sold 8 million records. I don't know if we were being naive at the time, but we thought we'd won because our songs were more famous than we were. I'm much more known for the music that I make than what I do with my life. It's never, ""Oh yeah, I've been seeing you in [the New York Post gossip column] Page Six at these clubs that you go to"" or ""I know who you're sleeping with."" CNN: When you became famous for being Rob Thomas the solo artist, did that cause problems within the band? Thomas: No. I think the guys would rather it be me than them. None of them want the job, and they realize that it's working now. They have a singer. I can go out and do it [publicity] for them, and they're fine with it. They can stay home. I think there's nothing more attractive than wealth and anonymity. If I'm not out supporting my work, I really don't want people to see me. I go to movie premieres -- my wife and I -- all the time, and nine out of 10 of those movie premieres, much to my publicist's dismay, I get there, but I sneak around the pictures and get into the party [using the back entrance]. If I have a record coming out, I'll go in front of the cameras, and I'll say, ""Hi! Hey, I'm at this movie premiere."" I liken it to being a switch that I can move on and off. CNN: What has doing a solo project enabled you to do that you can't do with a band? Thomas: I get to pick my own schedule, and that's nice. Matchbox Twenty -- it's four lead singers, there's four front men, and everybody's tastes, everybody's schedule, everybody's personal life comes into account when you're doing something like that. We all live [in four different cities] ... so we literally have to pull ourselves up from all over the country and go somewhere, just to get us into a room to write. And you have to not think you're so great so you don't get upset when somebody doesn't like your stuff. Like ""Her Diamonds"" -- one of the singles on this solo album -- is one of my favorite songs that I've ever written, and the guys loved the song, but didn't want to play it. [They said,] ""When you do a new solo record, you should put it on there. It doesn't sound like a song we would do right now."" And they were right. When we put together the last Matchbox record, it was much more of a rock record. CNN: What's the most surprising thing on your iPod? Thomas: Britney Spears. Come on! ""Toxic,"" man, is just one of the baddest tracks ever! I remember the first time we listened to ""... Baby One More Time."" ... We were like, ""Oh, let's go play Britney Spears on the piano!"" And we all come over drinking, and after a couple of minutes, we're like, ""This Britney Spears is a lot harder than we thought!"" CNN: Whose career would you like to emulate? Thomas: Tom Petty is a famous musician. He's not a music celebrity. When Tom Petty walks down the street, you know that it's Tom Petty, but it would be like, ""Oh my gosh, it's Tom Petty! I love Tom Petty, right on!"" It would never be like, ""Aaaaaaaah!"" -- and 3 million teenage girls follow him down the street.","Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty has new album out, ""Cradlesong""

"WICHITA, Kansas (CNN) -- An anti-abortion activist suspected in the death of Kansas doctor George Tiller told CNN on Tuesday the closing of Tiller's women's clinic is ""a victory for all the unborn children."" Scott Roeder, charged in the death of Dr. George Tiller, spoke to CNN on Tuesday. Scott Roeder, 51, would not admit to CNN's Ted Rowlands that he killed Tiller, who was gunned down at his church May 31. But he said if he is convicted in Tiller's slaying, ""the entire motive was the defense of the unborn."" Tiller's family said Tuesday the clinic he headed will permanently close, effective immediately, and they would issue no more statements. At the time Roeder was interviewed Tuesday, word of the permanent closure had not come out -- but when told the clinic had been shuttered since Tiller's death, he said, ""Good."" Roeder said the closure would mean ""no more slicing and dicing of the unborn child in the mother's womb and no more needles of poison into the baby's heart to stop the heart from beating, and no more partial-birth abortions.""  Watch Rowlands describe Roeder's mood during interview » . Dan Monnat, Tiller's attorney, declined to respond to Roeder's comments on the family's behalf. But in an e-mail, he added, ""Speaking for myself ... I am reluctant to in any way legitimize Mr. Roeder, or anything he stands for, by directly responding to his statements. ""I am content to let law enforcement determine whether anything he says merits attention. I do not encourage anyone else to give Mr. Roeder or his extremist views any additional attention as he awaits trial,"" Monnat wrote. Tiller, 67, was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions. He had already survived one attempt on his life before he was slain, and the announcement by Tiller's family dismayed supporters of abortion rights. Nancy Keenan, the president of Washington-based NARAL Pro-Choice America, called Tiller's killing ""part of an ongoing pattern of extreme anti-choice violence and intimidation"" aimed at depriving women of a legal medical option. ""It is a sad day for our country when family members who stood by their husband and father as he endured countless anti-choice attacks are forced as a result of his murder to make a decision like this one,"" Keenan said in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon. Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, expressed hope that other doctors ""will be brave enough to come forward and continue Dr. Tiller's critical work of providing services to women."" ""It is unacceptable that anti-abortion intimidation and violence has led to the closing of Dr. Tiller's clinic. It illustrates the ongoing harassment endured by abortion providers and the resulting disservice to women across this country,"" Northup said. Roeder is jailed on first-degree murder and aggravated assault charges in Tiller's death. A Kansas judge earlier this month set his bail at $5 million. Tiller's family said Tuesday it is ""proud of the service and courage shown by our husband and father,"" and that it would honor his memory ""through private charitable activities."" The statement promised his patients ""that the privacy of their medical histories and patient records will remain as fiercely protected now and in the future as they were during Dr. Tiller's lifetime."" Peter Brownlie, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri, said he and his staff ""fully respect and understand"" the family's decision. ""Their loss is immense -- they have lost a husband, father, grandfather and hero,"" Brownlie said in a statement. But the closure of Tiller's clinic ""creates a significant gap in access for women and families in Kansas,"" he continued. ""No one is providing that service between Kansas City and Denver."" Most of the leading U.S. anti-abortion groups have condemned Tiller's killing and disavowed Roeder, saying they wanted Tiller's clinic shut down, but through peaceful means. Troy Newman, the president of one of those organizations, Operation Rescue, said in a statement on the group's Web site Tuesday that his group is ""thankful that Tiller's clinic will not reopen and thankful that Wichita is now abortion-free."" But he added, ""This is a bittersweet moment for us at Operation Rescue. We have worked very hard for this day, but we wish it would have come through the peaceful, legal channels we were pursuing."" Operation Rescue and other Kansas anti-abortion activists had supported a criminal investigation by former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline, a petition drive to empanel a special grand jury to investigate the practice and efforts to get his medical license revoked. On its Web site, the group referred to Tiller as a ""monster"" who had ""been able to get away with murder."" But in a New York Times interview last week, Newman said closing the clinic because of the shooting would be cause for concern. ""Good God, do not close this abortion clinic for this reason,"" he said. ""Every kook in the world will get some notion."" Roeder met with Rowlands for a half-hour Tuesday, talking on a phone through security glass at the Sedgwick County jail where he is being held. He initially was reluctant to talk, as he said he had been misquoted in another interview. But he gradually opened up, noting that he was giving the interview against the advice of his defense attorney. Roeder told CNN he is ""feeling good,"" and getting encouraging letters from people around the country, many of whom he does not know. But he complained about conditions in the jail, saying he doesn't like being in solitary confinement and that the jail is ""freezing."" Associates have told CNN that Roeder was a regular among the protesters who routinely gathered at Tiller's clinic. Roeder's former roommate, Eddie Ebecher, has told CNN Roeder was ""obsessed"" with Tiller and in the past had debated whether to kill him. Relatives said Roeder had suffered from mental illness over the years and had refused treatment at times. He served prison time in Kansas in the late 1990s after being arrested with explosives in his car, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. But Roeder said Tuesday that reports he has mental illness or schizophrenia are ""totally wrong."" He acknowledged having a drug problem at one point, but said he has been off drugs since he was 28 years old and has no mental illness. Rowlands said he attempted to discuss Tiller's death with Roeder, pointing out that there were witnesses to the shooting and its aftermath who claim they saw Roeder leaving the scene and got a license plate from the car. Roeder nodded, Rowlands said, but still would not admit any culpability. But ""He didn't say, 'I didn't do it,' "" Rowlands said. ""He didn't say, 'Get me out of here, I'm the wrong guy.' "" Federal civil rights prosecutors have launched an investigation into Tiller's slaying, the Justice Department has said. The inquiry will focus on violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and other applicable federal laws. Roeder was concerned about the possibility of federal charges, saying his lawyer has warned him that he will be facing them if he doesn't stop talking. CNN's Michael Cary contributed to this report.","In jail interview with CNN, suspect Scott Roeder admits no guilt in Tiller slaying .

"Editor's note: Nancy Grace is the host of ""Nancy Grace"" on HLN nightly at 8 and 10 p.m. ET. Read an excerpt from her new novel ""The Eleventh Victim"" published by Hyperion. Nancy Grace found it challenging to complete her first novel, ""The Eleventh Victim."" (CNN) -- Readers of Nancy Grace's debut novel, ""The Eleventh Victim,"" would be forgiven if they assumed the main character is based on Grace. After all, the heroine of the novel becomes an Atlanta, Georgia, district attorney after her fiancé is murdered and later relocates to New York for a fresh start. But Grace said there are some differences between her and her protagonist. ""Hailey is a much better person than I am,"" Grace said. The tough-as-nails anchor of the HLN show that bears her name was driven to complete her first book of fiction, which she said has been in the works for almost a decade. The novel centers on the character of Hailey Dean, a psychology student who becomes a prosecutor after the tragic murder of her fiancé just weeks before their wedding. The mystery takes flight when Dean, having relocated to Manhattan and trained as a therapist, discovers that her patients are being murdered in a copycat style of an Atlanta serial killer from her past. Grace -- who is also the author of the nonfiction book ""Objection!"" -- recently spoke to CNN about the challenges of giving birth to both twins and a thriller, who might die in her next novel and what she thinks about television shows like ""Saturday Night Live"" parodying her. CNN: You are a working mother of two year-old twins. How in the world did you find time to write a book? Nancy Grace: It was hard work. I had done ""Objection"" and I had an idea for a second nonfiction. I went back to my editor and I said ""Here's an idea for another nonfiction."" She said ""Yeah, it's OK, you got anything else?"" I said ""No, but I do have an old manuscript I've been working on for a long time, a murder mystery."" I told her it's not finished yet, I have about 300 pages. I took it over that day and the next day they told me they wanted a two-book series on Hailey Dean. Then I thought ""Oh Lord, now I've got to finish it."" That happened around the time I got pregnant.  Watch Nancy discuss her new book » . I had a difficult pregnancy. I was in a wheelchair, I threw up every day, I broke my foot during the pregnancy, so a lot of crazy things happened. Finally, after the twins came, the deadline came. I literally had to sit in the bed with the computer and force myself to finish it. I knew what was going to happen in each of the four storylines, but I had to get there. I would be up sometimes until 3 or 4 in the morning. The twins, one would wake up, by the time I would get that one fed and down, the other one would wake up and then it was time to get up at 5:30. CNN: You said you knew who did it in terms of the mystery early on in the writing. So how did the book change during its development? Grace: The characters really developed. It's like getting to know a person. Read an excerpt from the novel . There are certain things Hailey simply would not do. You get to know your characters and they become richer and more intricate because you get to know the character. I would not do anything that was out of character for them. CNN: The plot and the settings sound very familiar to your own life. How much of you is in Hailey? Grace: Hailey is a much better person than I am, I can tell you that much. She's very brave. She thinks her way out of difficult and almost impossible situations, she's courageous and she's witty. I would say it's loosely based, but she's a much better heroine than I could ever be. CNN: What is more difficult, writing nonfiction or fiction? Grace: It is definitely harder to write fiction. With nonfiction you deal with facts already in existence, but with fiction you have to create everything. Details like what color somebody's hair was to how hot it was that day. A lot of ideas for the book would come to me in the middle of the night and I forgot some of them so often that I now sleep with my two BlackBerrys near the bed. I've learned my lesson the hard way, so I will now write myself my book notes in the middle of the night. CNN: Is there anything that didn't make it into this book that you wished had? Grace: Yes, but don't worry because I saved it for the next book, which will be set in the television industry. There's going to be a lot of dead TV executives (laughing). CNN: They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so what are your thoughts on having been parodied? Grace: It's funny to me. Everything from YouTube to ""Boston Legal"" and ""Saturday Night Live."" It's very flattering that they would think enough to make fun of me. I want [rapper] Eminem to make fun of me, but I don't think it would be very nice (laughing).","Nancy Grace's debut novel, ""The Eleventh Victim"" has a story similar to hers .

"(CNN) -- Britons, Germans and other tourists on the Spanish island of Mallorca ""can feel safe because they aren't targets of the ETA terrorist band,"" which recently bombed the popular resort, Spain's interior minister said Tuesday. Police cordon off the route leading to the location of the blasts in Palma de Mallorca. ""People should feel safe because security forces are on top of this,"" Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told a nationally-televised news conference in Madrid. Rubalcaba's comments followed the Sunday explosions on Mallorca of what he said were four small ETA bombs that caused no injuries, and two weeks after an ETA car bomb killed two Civil Guard officers on the same Mediterranean island. But Rubalcaba said police aren't sure if the ETA militants behind the bombings remain in hiding on the island or have left, and he warned repeatedly that the Basque separatist group could attack again. ""We are on maximum alert in Mallorca and the rest of Spain,"" Rubalcaba said. ""ETA, when it can, attacks, so you can't rule out that they won't attack again. We try to prevent them from doing so.""  Watch background behind ETA's decades-long struggle » . The island's regional government told CNN on Monday that since the bombings, there have been no ""significant"" tourist cancellations. Tens of thousands of Britons and Germans are vacationing on Mallorca, as is Spain's King Juan Carlos and the royal family. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence. Police initially attributed three small bombs on Sunday to ETA, which is listed as a terrorist group by Spain, the United States and the European Union. But Tuesday, Rubalcaba confirmed that police believe a fourth bomb also was ETA's work. Some local authorities initially thought it might have been just an accidental gas explosion. Three of the bombs exploded in the restrooms of restaurants and a bar in the main city, Palma de Mallorca, and the other was placed in the restroom of an underground commercial area beneath a main square. Rubalcaba revealed that at least one of the bombs was in a male lavatory; previously it was reported they were all in women's restrooms. Rubalcaba said one of the three warning calls on Sunday preceding the attacks came from near Bordeaux, France --- ETA's traditional rear-guard base. The warning calls, he added, provided only scant details about the bombs' locations to police. The four small bombs were activated by timers, and one of them was hidden in a bar that had been closed since Friday. Rubalcaba reiterated the government's position that ""these attacks don't do anything but strengthen our determination. Those who placed the bombs will spend long years in jail and recent experience says they will."" ETA has been battered over the past 16 months by arrests of four suspected top ETA military chiefs and dozens of militants. Hours before Sunday's bombs, ETA claimed responsibility for a series of bombings across Spain in June and July: the one that killed two Civil Guard officers, another that killed a police officer, and another that heavily damaged a Civil Guard barracks, slightly wounded dozens, including children. In a statement released to the Basque newspaper Gara, ETA said those attacks were in retaliation for the Socialist government's crackdown on its ranks. The group said, ""What ETA has been looking for during long decades is a negotiated political solution."" But Rubalcaba recently ruled out a resumption of negotiations that his government tried without success in 2006 during an ETA cease-fire. Spanish media last week cited numerous politicians and analysts who suggested that ETA's recent spate of violence might be trying to force the government back to the negotiating table.","Spanish officials say ETA not targeting tourists on island of Mallorca .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose re-election last month led to massive protests, on Tuesday called the balloting ""the most free election anywhere in the world."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected last month, setting off days of protests. ""It was a great event,"" he said in a nationally televised address. The election, which opponents charge was rigged, was followed by street demonstrations and civil unrest that led to the deaths of at least 20 protesters and the arrest of more than 1,000, according to Iranian state-run media. The numbers of casualties and arrests could not be independently verified by CNN because the Iranian government banned coverage by international journalists. The president, who said voter turnout was 85 percent, said opponents ""did not provide even one piece of document regarding irregularities or vote fraud."" Without specifically mentioning the post-election violence, Ahmadinejad said criticism of government ""is the key to the success of a nation."" Everyone has criticisms, he said. ""I have my own."" But he accused the ""arrogant powers"" and ""enemies"" of Iran of interfering in his country's affairs, including the post-election situation. Some Iranians collaborated with enemies, the president said. Ahmadinejad also said Tuesday he believes the government should be ""substantially"" reorganized. Although he didn't elaborate, he said the areas of employment, housing, development and civil rights were high on the agenda. ""[We] need to create newer capacities and prepare ourselves for this new period,"" he said, apparently referring to his upcoming second term in office. ""With this election, we have entered a new era ... in domestic spheres and on an international level,"" he added. He called it ""an era of solidarity."" ""The government is at the service of the entire people,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""Things will be done in a better way, more effective way, so we can reach higher aspirations."" He said experts have been invited to help the government achieve progress.","Iranian president calls recent vote ""most free election anywhere in the world""

"Editor's note: Jack D. Hidary co-founded a technology company, Earth Web/Dice, and a financial research company, Vista Research. He works currently in the fields of clean energy technology and policy and is chairman of SmartTransportation.org which successfully pushed for the use of hybrid cars as taxis in New York City. Jack Hidary says the Cash for Clunkers program promotes fuel economy and safety while boosting the economy. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Our country is facing a daunting economic challenge this year and we must take steps to pull ourselves out of this ditch. One such program that has hit the ground running is Cash for Clunkers. It's helping consumers move beyond these hard times and has reignited a whole industry. Cash for Clunkers is now working in more than 10 countries around the world. In Germany, consumers have junked more than 1.2 million guzzlers in the last five months and significantly boosted the economy there. So we know that Clunkers programs get the job done. How many other government programs can you say that about? The Senate has joined the House in passing an additional $2 billion for Cash for Clunkers, allowing the program to move forward. This will bring additional buyers to the showroom. One key feature of the Clunkers program is that it is not just $3 billion of new money into the economy. It is injecting $21 billion -- since consumers must bring the rest of the money to pay for the new car. That is a lot of stimulus for the dollar. Cash for Clunkers is saving jobs up and down the auto supply chain: from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers. Dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program. If you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program, 45 percent are from Detroit's Big Three automakers. That is a lot of new sales for Ford, GM and Chrysler. Cash for Clunkers also helps autoworkers across the country. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. They are in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. This program helps all American autoworkers, not just those up North. Some people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way. Cash for Clunkers actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry. First, the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate, finance, manufacturing and other industries, that is hard to separate it out. Second, one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance. We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators. Guess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles. Unless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption. Cash for Clunkers is a step in the right direction. It educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low-MPG car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle. A family can save $750-$1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency. Those savings will increase as gas prices go back up. Gas has already shot up from $1.50 a gallon to $2.60. Do you want to be stuck with a 10 mile-per-gallon guzzler when gas jumps back to $4 a gallon? Third, Cash for Clunkers saves lives. When you bring in a clunker that has no airbags, anti-lock brakes or other modern safety features and get a new car that does, you are protecting your family. Forty thousand people die every year on American highways and many more get serious injuries. You can reduce your chances of becoming a statistic by getting the most safety for your dollar -- and with the Clunkers program you can now do that more affordably. As a co-architect of the federal Cash for Clunkers program with the Center for American Progress and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and adviser to various congressional offices on the issue, it is gratifying to see how quickly it has been adopted by the American people. It achieves multiple goals -- it stimulates auto sales, increases the efficiency of the U.S. fleet and makes us safer. Let's support this program by encouraging our friends and neighbors to finally retire that guzzler and help the country with the purchase of a cleaner, lower maintenance car for the future.

"LEBANON, Tennessee (CNN)  -- A tumultuous home life forced country music star Gretchen Wilson to grow up quickly. Bernadine Nelson, left, and Gretchen Wilson want to raise awareness about the importance of adult education. ""I was one of those kids that was brought up in kind of a crazy environment in the home, and I just thought I'd be better off if I could get out there and start doing it my way,"" said Wilson, 35. So at 15, she quit school and became a bartender in her Illinois hometown. From that point on, Wilson focused her attention solely on surviving and making music. In 1996, she moved to Nashville to pursue her dream of being a country music singer. Despite setbacks along the way, she found success in 2004 with the release of her first single, ""Redneck Woman."" ""I had big dreams like most local musicians do, but the chances of this having happened for me were slim to none,"" said the Grammy Award winner. ""Without [an] education, I'd have been pouring drinks for the rest of my life."" Until earlier this year, Wilson was one of the millions of Americans who haven't finished their high school education. According to the U.S. Department of Education, 43 million people have dropped out of high school, and one in five Americans are functionally illiterate. Though she was a successful musician, Wilson said she became more determined than ever to finish her education. So, at age 34, she decided to get her GED -- and it was educator Bernadine Nelson who helped her. ""I didn't have to go back and get my GED, but it was something I really needed to complete me as a person,"" Wilson said. Wilson reached out to the local adult education center in Lebanon, Tennessee, where she met Nelson, the center's director. ""[She] greeted me with a huge smile on her face and welcome arms,"" Wilson said. ""She promised me above all that I'd be able to stand in that line and be proud of myself. She became an instant hero in my eyes."" Nelson held true to her word. A year later, Wilson received her GED, crediting the achievement to Nelson's support and encouragement. Together, they're now raising awareness about the importance of an education and encouraging people to say, ""I can do that too."" Though she had been a teacher for decades, Nelson, 62, didn't realize the scope of under-education in America until she began working in adult education roughly six years ago. ""It was an emotional thing to me because I kept thinking, 'What can I do? How can my little job help?' "" Nelson said. ""But I know it does, because every single person I've helped helps the big problem.""  Watch Wilson describe why Nelson is her hero » . In addition to overseeing the center, Nelson has become an outspoken advocate for adult education in Tennessee, speaking to community groups and holding a weekly guest spot on a local radio show. She believes the benefits of an education are priceless. ""Having a GED or high school diploma gives you more self-esteem and a better opportunity for a better job,"" Nelson said. Since 2002, Nelson has helped more than 1,050 students receive their GEDs. And she said she knows that many others will follow in Wilson's footsteps. ""Gretchen came to the program because she wanted to fulfill this void that had been missing for all these years for her,"" Nelson said. ""I don't think she realized how much this would speak to other people. Her fans are legion. If their role model, the Redneck Woman, could get her GED, then ... maybe they could too."" Since Wilson received her GED in May 2008, Nelson said, several people have already called her, citing the singer's achievement as inspiration for obtaining theirs. For Wilson, Nelson's dedication to bringing the importance of education to the forefront of people's lives is making a difference. ""She's bound and determined to put that sense of pride back into these people who felt that they've lost it,"" Wilson said. ""That's not only respectable, it's admirable.""","Country singer Gretchen Wilson earned her GED 20 years after quitting school .

"(CNN) -- The Irish government ordered a recall Saturday of all pork products linked to pigs slaughtered in Ireland, after laboratory tests found the presence of dioxins in animal feed and pork fat samples. Preliminary evidence gathered by Ireland's Food Safety Authority indicated that the contamination likely started in September, the government said in a statement. The Food Safety Authority advised consumers not to consume Irish pork and bacon products for the time being. The government is now trying to determine the scope of the contamination. Dioxins are environmental contaminants, often present in industrial waste. Most dioxin exposure occurs through diet, with more than 95 percent coming from the consumption of animal fats, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Dioxin levels in food are regulated. Dr Tony Holohan, Ireland's Chief Medical Officer, said that the dioxin usually impacts the nervous system and liver in comments reported by the UK Press Association. Holohan added that the dioxin would only be perilous through prolonged exposure. The agency reported that an animal feed ingredient supplied by one business to 40-plus farms is regarded as the likely cause of the dioxin by experts, and that tests revealed the dioxin polychlorinated biphenyls to be 80 to 200 times above the acceptable safety level.","Food scare in Ireland after dioxins found in animal feed and pork fat samples .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Bishop Earl Paulk, a charismatic preacher brought down by a series of sex scandals, has died. He was 81. Bishop Earl Paulk died this weekend at 81. Paulk died near midnight Saturday at the Atlanta Medical Center, a nursing supervisor confirmed to CNN. The bishop had been at the hospital for several days, she said. Paulk's death came after an ""extended and horrible battle with cancer,"" Paulk's nephew, Bishop Jim Swilley, wrote in a blog post. Paulk founded the Chapel Hill Harvester Church in Decatur, a suburb of Atlanta. It quickly grew to become one of the first megachurches in the country. Paulk also had his own television show. But his success as a preacher was overshadowed time and again by allegations of sexual impropriety. One allegation ended in a civil suit that was settled out of court in 2003. The accuser said Paulk molested her when she was a child. A second woman claimed the bishop forced her into a 14-year affair. She filed, withdrew and refiled a suit. Dennis Brewer, an attorney for Paulk, admitted to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Paulk had a brief adulterous relationship with the woman, but said she was the initiator. During a deposition in the case, the bishop said under oath the woman was the only one he slept with outside of marriage. But a court-ordered paternity test showed that he also fathered a child with his sister-in-law. Other allegations -- some true, some unfounded -- cost the church membership, as worshippers dwindled from 10,000 to about 1,000. ""As most of you know, my family has been walking through a very long nightmare season in connection with things concerning him,"" Swilley wrote in his blog post. ""Please pray for some much needed healing and closure for us all.""","Bishop Earl Paulk died near midnight Saturday at the Atlanta Medical Center .

"(WIRED) -- Say hello to your latest personal navigation device: a netbook. Dell plans to introduce a GPS and Wi-Fi card that can be integrated into the company's netbooks to turn them into gizmos that can offer turn-by-turn direction as well as any Garmin or TomTom. Dell will introduce a GPS and Wi-Fi card that can be added to its netbooks to offer turn-by-turn direction. ""Smartphones already have GPS capabilities,"" says Alan Sicher, senior wireless product manager at Dell. ""We are now bringing it to netbooks so the devices know where you are and can help you where you want to go."" Customers will have the option to buy the $69 card called the Wireless 700 when ordering their Dell Mini 10 netbook. Dell's move comes at a time when navigation devices makers are looking beyond the traditional standalone GPS gadget and are offering their software on other devices. Last month, TomTom announced that its turn-by-turn directions app would be available on the iPhone. TomTom will also offer accessories such as a car mounting dock and power charger. Meanwhile, Dell is hoping to capitalize on the explosive sales of netbooks. Dell netbooks with the integrated GPS cards will allow consumers to pop open a netbook and get directions and also also make their netbook location aware. For instance, buyers can geo-tag photos on Flickr or check weather information customized to their current location. The Wireless 700 card combines Broadcom's GPS technology and Skyhook Wireless' Wi-Fi positioning solutions. As for the navigation software, it offers 2D and 3D map views, save addresses for a trip and route optimization-- pretty much all the things that a standard GPS devices does. Netbooks are petite devices. Still, it is difficult to imagine consumers carrying it around as a GPS navigation device or using it their car to find their way around--especially when smaller-sized cellphones could do the job. Sicher says Dell's GPS-capable netbooks will come in handy for international travelers. ""If you are traveling to Europe roaming costs can be pretty pricey for your cellphone,"" he says. The GPS netbooks could also be handy in areas where cellphone coverage is weak, says Sicher. But there's fine print to the turn-by-turn directions navigation software on the netbook. Though it will be free for buyers of the card and the netbook, the maps will be updated yearly and customers could be charged for the updates. Dell plans to offer accessories such as car charger and a dock for the netbooks, but they won't be available until later this month. The GPS cards will be available starting July 7.

"(CNN) -- The text messages address various issues and come from all over the African continent. President Obama greets people Saturday during breakfast at Osu Castle in Accra, Ghana. From the personal: ""Obama, as a young lady I dream of being the president. U r a huge encouragement."" To cries for help: ""Dear president, Darfur firing again...waiting for peace through the change u promised."" To calls for intervention: ""Encourage African leaders to improve the quality and access to education for citizens."" The messages, from Ghana, Sudan and South Africa respectively, were among more than 5,000 sent to Barack Obama during his first visit as president to sub-Saharan Africa. Obama, accompanied by his wife, Michelle, and their two daughters arrived in Ghana on Friday night, sparking excitement in the west African nation.  Watch how Ghana is celebrating Obama's visit » . Despite being home to some of the world's poorest nations, Africa has a vibrant cell phone market, considered by industry analysts as among the fastest-growing worldwide. Administration officials said they set up different numbers across the continent for citizens to communicate with Obama, whose father was from the east African nation of Kenya. ""Over the past week, we have been collecting questions, comments and words of welcome for President Obama via SMS, Twitter, Facebook and from newspapers across Africa,"" the White House said on its Web site. Three journalists from South Africa, Senegal and Kenya will vet the questions and provide a few to Obama, who will address them on African radio stations and via a Web video Monday, the White House said. Peter Kimani, a senior associate editor for a Kenyan daily, The Standard, is one of the three. ""The U.S. Embassy picked and vetted the journalists, and we are getting the questions, then it is up to us to determine what questions we will forward to the president,"" Kimani said. ""It is our judgment call on what to pick."" Most of the text messages were coming from South Africa, according to a log on the White House Web site. Obama's one-nation visit has generated envy among Ghana's neighbors, who considered it a message from the White House to governments that have poor records of stability. Citizens of Nigeria, Africa's most populous nations, and Kenya were the most vocal in their concerns over the choice of Ghana. ""We r disappointed that you have not chosen Nigeria as your first African point of call,"" one text said.","More than 5,000 messages sent to Obama during his visit to Ghana .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A massive fire engulfed the four-story offices of a major film company in central London on Friday, sending clouds of white smoke over the city skyline, the London fire department said. Streets in London were cordoned off while firefighters tackled the blaze. Two firefighters were taken to the hospital with minor injuries as a result of the blaze in the Future Films building on Dean Street in the city's Soho district, London ambulance services said. The London Fire Brigade dispatched 12 engines and 55 firefighters to battle the fire, which began before 2 p.m. (9 a.m. ET). As a result, an adjacent street -- the W1 -- has been closed to traffic and pedestrians. When reached by CNN, Future Films founder and managing director Stephen Margolis had no comment about the fire. Future Films has been involved in the production of more than 120 films since Margolis created the company in 2000, including ""Bend it like Beckham"" (2002), ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" (2002), and ""Transsiberian"" (2008).

"(CNN) -- Venezuela has promised to give Nicaragua $50 million to replace money that the United States said this week it would withhold from the Central American country, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega Saavedra said Saturday. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega expressed disappointment in U.S. President Barack Obama's decision. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez promised the aid after Ortega learned that the United States was canceling $62 million of aid that was to have come from the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a U.S.-government-funded anti-poverty fund set up by former President George W. Bush. Ortega expressed disappointment in President Barack Obama for the decision. ""He expresses good will, but in practice, he has the same policies as President Reagan,"" Ortega told a crowd of supporters in Managua's Plaza of the Revolution. In 1982, then-President Reagan supported funding the contras, the forces opposed to Ortega and his socialist Sandinista Party, which had come to power after overthrowing the U.S.-backed Anastasio Somoza in 1979. Ortega called this week's decision not to follow through on the payment ""disrespectful."" ""The United States had given its word to the people of Nicaragua and in particular to the people of the cities involved in the program,"" he said. Wednesday's decision to cut the funds altogether came after the United States announced last November that it was suspending aid to Managua in the wake of what it said were fraudulent municipal elections. Ortega, whose party members won most of the mayoralties, disputed that. And he warned his U.S. counterpart that the world has changed since the United States funded the contras. ""He is the first to know that the United States of today is not the United States of 20, 30, 40 years ago,"" Ortega said. ""Today, the United States cannot do whatever it wants in the world. It doesn't have the moral force, even though it may have the material force to do it. They have even lost the support of the U.S. people."" Still chafing over his loss to Violeta Chamorro, who replaced him as president in 1990, Ortega said those were the elections that were fraudulent. He said President George H. W. Bush affected the outcome by telling the Nicaraguans, ""If you vote for the [Sandinista] front, the war is going to continue; if you vote for the enemies of the front, go in peace.' That was the promise that Bush made."" He described that pact as ""a big lie, since the peace was already coming. We, the Nicaraguans, were making peace."" What Bush then wanted, Ortega said, was war throughout Central America. ""He fed the war in Guatemala, he fed the war in El Salvador, he fed the war in Nicaragua,"" Ortega said. Ortega described the three U.S.-backed governments that ruled Nicaragua from 1990 until 2007 -- when he reclaimed power -- as anti-democratic. ""They robbed the people of the right to health, the right to education, the right to decent housing,"" he said. ""They privatized energy industry, the telecommunications industry, the businesses of the workers -- those were nothing more than acts of corruption."" And he said that the $62 million would have been used to build 12 highways, not to support his government. But work that has begun on two of the roads will be completed, said Rodney Bent, deputy CEO for the Millennium Challenge Corporation in an interview Friday with CNN en Espanol. He denied any suggestion that the money was being used for political ends rather than simply to alleviate poverty. ""That's totally false,"" Bent said, adding that his corporation's funds are doled out regardless of a government's leftist, centrist or conservative policies. ""We want a clean government,"" he said, adding that because the elections were not clean, ""we had to act.""","U.S. cancels $62 million of aid from the Millennium Challenge Corporation .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Rep. Charles Rangel said he is satisfied with the steps New York police are taking in response to the death of Officer Omar Edwards, but renewed his call for a federal investigation into instances of police friendly fire. Officer Omar Edwards was shot to death by another officer on May 28. Edwards, 25, a black officer, was shot to death May 28 by a fellow officer, Andrew Dunton, who is white. Edwards was off duty at the time. Edwards was in plainclothes and carrying a handgun as he chased a suspect past a police car, authorities said. Dunton shot him after Edwards failed to drop his weapon when ordered to, they said.  Officials said Dunton said he didn't realize Edwards was an officer. ""Every white cop that shot down a black cop, I would believe it was a mistake and not because of racism, but it takes special training for them to know,"" Rangel , D-New York, told CNN's Don Lemon on Saturday. In the wake of Edwards' death, the New York Police Department has implemented sensitivity training and provided guidance to officers on identifying themselves. In a statement, Rangel asked the Department of Justice to look into ""police department practices, training of police officers and whether and to what extent race was an issue in the tragedy."" The shooting prompted New York Gov. David Paterson to commission a task force to investigate shootings between police officers statewide, spokeswoman Marissa Shorenstein told CNN on Saturday. NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne pledged Saturday to assist Paterson's investigation. Also Saturday, the NYPD released a list of 10 New York City officers killed in cases of mistaken identity since 1930. Five of the officers were African-American or Hispanic; five were white. The list does not include officers who were injured by friendly fire, and does not specify whether the officers killed were on or off duty. The formation of the New York task force came after Paterson met with state officials, clergy members and civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, in a closed-door meeting Friday. The group called for an independent investigation and the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the NYPD incident. ""We are handling this sensitively,"" Paterson told reporters after the meeting. ""There may be issues that involve race, [but] we are not discussing any institutional or direct racism."" The governor spoke of what he described as a ""high percentage of African-American and Hispanic police officers who were shot either on or off duty by friendly fire."" However, the commission will examine friendly fire incidents between all officers regardless of race, according to Shorenstein. The task force will ask NYPD and police departments across the state to provide any data related to shootings where officers were either killed or injured by other officers. The governor said the task force will look at the statistics to ""determine if there's any disproportionate sense that any particular group has been victimized more than any other."" Paterson said that he would ""not close the door"" on an independent investigation or special prosecutor to look into the death of Edwards, but would rely for now on the investigation by the New York City district attorney and the NYPD. The focus of the task force, the governor said, would be to prevent friendly fire among all police officers, regardless of race, and to instill confidence in the state and community that such incidents are investigated properly .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- After arguing with her husband, Liza Murphy walked out of their home in Emerson, New Jersey, leaving behind her purse, her cigarettes, her cell phone and her three children, her husband told police. There has been no sign of her since August 19, 2007. Liza Murphy has been missing from her home in Emerson, New Jersey, since August 19, 2007. Murphy's friends and family reported her missing the next day. ""In my heart, I fear the worst, that my daughter is gone,"" said her mother, Sophia Stellatos. Police searched extensively for Murphy, especially around a reservoir not far from her home, but they found nothing. Cadaver dogs caught her scent near the George Washington Bridge, but the trail went cold, police told the family. Deepening the mystery, her husband, Joe Murphy, tried to take his own life a few days after his wife disappeared by walking into oncoming traffic and throwing himself in front of a fire truck, police say. He was hospitalized and recovered from his injuries, but police say he hired a lawyer and is no longer cooperating with investigators. His lawyer said Murphy, an Irish immigrant, has nothing to hide from the authorities. He said his client has no criminal record and no history of violence. Attorney Joseph Rem added that there was no physical violence in the marriage. According to her family, Liza Murphy, 42, was not the type of person to take off on her own without letting her family know.  Watch an update » . ""She would never leave her three children behind voluntarily,"" her mother insisted. ""What doesn't make sense is Liza leaving her house without her purse, cell phone, wallet, keys or cigarettes,"" she added. ""She was a heavy smoker, and if she took off after a fight for a walk to cool off, she definitely wouldn't leave without her cigarettes!"" Liza Murphy and her husband were having marital problems, her family said. Stellatos described Joe Murphy as possessive of his wife, never allowing her to go out with her friends. She said he was even jealous if she spent time with her parents. Rem pointed out that his client has not been named as a suspect or a person of interest in the case. He said police have not asked to speak to his client recently. Liza Murphy's children are 15, 13 and 10 years old now. Joe Murphy has full custody of them, and the Stellatoses have not seen their grandchildren since shortly before their daughter disappeared. Murphy and her children had spent the week before her disappearance visiting with her parents, who live about 125 miles away. They returned the Friday before Murphy's disappearance. Police say both the Murphy home and their vehicles have been processed for forensics, but they found no evidence of foul play or struggle. Liza Murphy had been suffering from depression and was on medication for fibromyalgia, a painful condition that affects the muscles and soft tissues. Police say she may have been accosted after she left home, still stewing over the argument. The police seek the public's help in this case. Anyone with information leading to the whereabouts of Liza Murphy or the arrest of the person responsible for her disappearance is asked to call the Emerson Police Department's tip line at 201-262-2800.","Woman disappeared after argument with husband .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A stolen Statue of Liberty replica has resurfaced in a disturbing video posted on YouTube that shows someone decapitating the blindfolded lady and smashing her head into pieces. The YouTube video shows a gloved hand sawing off Lady Liberty's head before smashing it. The 200-pound replica was stolen less than a month ago from Vox Pop, a coffee shop in Brooklyn. ""It's very disturbing,"" shop operator Debi Ryan told CNN, adding the video struck a chord similar to that of terrorist assassination videos. ""I don't know what it means. ... I don't know who would do this."" The YouTube video begins with a waving American flag, and then shows a gloved hand sawing off the head of the statue before crushing it. The slogans ""We don't want your freedom"" and ""Death to America"" flash across the screen during the one-minute video, which is dated July Fourth. It was anonymously e-mailed to the Daily News and Ryan earlier this week. Ryan said she's sure the statue in the video is the one stolen from her cafe. ""She's unique. I know my girl,"" she said of the statue. ""We just had her completely refurbished, outfitted with a solar torch and painted."" Authorities told CNN they are handling the case as a larceny rather than separately investigating the YouTube video. ""We want to verify who sent the e-mail with the video and see if they're responsible,"" police said. A sign on the store, located in Ditmas Park, reads, ""Books, Coffee, Democracy,"" near where the 8-foot replica of Lady Liberty used to stand outside. The self-described community coffee shop is also a bookstore and a spot for artists and performers. ""We've created a space here that's owned by the community,"" Ryan said. ""We're all about freedom of speech and freedom to be who you are and say whatever you think."" But Ryan doesn't consider the YouTube video featuring her stolen statue appropriate free speech. ""Vox Pop stands for freedom of speech. You don't get to steal somebody else's property to send that message. We have to respect each other,"" she said. Although the coffee shop recently faced economic problems and neighborhood tension, the motive behind the statue's theft remains unknown. As for whether there will be a replacement statue, Ryan said, ""I'm hoping. I think she belongs here. But she added, ""Whether we have a physical statue or not, what she stands for remains here.""","Video shows Statue of Liberty replica blindfolded before it's decapitated, smashed .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham is planning showdown talks with L.A. Galaxy teammate Landon Donovan, who questioned the English football star's commitment to the MLS team earlier this month. Landon Donovan, left, is unhappy with David Beckham's contribution at LA Galaxy. Beckham said the U.S. national captain was ""unprofessional"" for publicly voicing his opinions, which were reported worldwide from the soon-to-be-published book ""The Beckham Experiment"" by Sports Illustrated writer Grant Wahl. ""In every football player's eyes throughout the world, it would be unprofessional to speak out about a team-mate, especially in the press and not to your face,"" Beckham said before watching the Galaxy's 1-0 win over Chivas USA on Saturday night. What do you think? Was Donovan right? ""In 17 years, I have played with the biggest teams in the world and the biggest players, and not once have I been criticized for my professionalism. ""It's important to get this cleared up, and I will be speaking to Landon either this evening or over the next couple of days. Me and Landon will talk, but that will be a private conversation."" Donovan, who led the United States to the Confederations Cup final last month, said in the book that Beckham had been a negative influence since his high-profile move to the Major League Soccer outfit two years ago. He said Beckham, who brokered a loan move to AC Milan last season, had shown little interest in the Galaxy since coach Ruud Gullit resigned in August last year. Donovan, who leads the Galaxy in Beckham's absence, also cast doubt on the 34-year-old midfielder's leadership abilities. But last week he admitted that he should have brought up his grievances with Beckham earlier. ""I don't apologize for what I said,"" Donovan told MLSnet.com on Thursday. ""I just apologize for the way I did. I should have told him to his face. I've long told David since he's been gone and I've been gone that I want to sit down and talk with him about everything. ""It's fresh in everyone's minds now, and it appears like everything has gone on in a short period of time, but this has been a long time coming. The timing of it makes it a little awkward and seemingly uncomfortable, but we'll be fine. We'll get through it. ""I like David as a person and I think he's a very good player.

"(CNN) -- Woody Harrelson defended his clash with a photographer at a New York airport Wednesday night as a case of mistaken identity -- he says he mistook the cameraman for a zombie. Woody Harrelson says he got into a clash with a photographer because he mistook him for a zombie. The TMZ photographer filed a complaint with police claiming the actor damaged his camera and pushed him in the face at La Guardia Airport, according to an airport spokesman. ""We're looking into this allegation and if it's warranted, we'll turn it over to the proper authorities,"" said Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Ron Marsico. The photographer, who was not identified, captured the encounter on a small camera after his larger one was broken. Harrelson, who is being sued by another TMZ photographer for an alleged assault in 2006, did not deny his involvement. ""I wrapped a movie called 'Zombieland,' in which I was constantly under assault by zombies, then flew to New York, still very much in character,"" Harrelson said in a statement issued Friday by his publicist. ""With my daughter at the airport I was startled by a paparazzo, who I quite understandably mistook for a zombie,"" he said. TMZ.com posted two videos of the incident, including one recorded by the larger camera before it was damaged. The first video shows the photographer following Harrelson and his daughter down an escalator and out of the terminal. It ends with Harrelson apparently reaching for the lens. The second video begins with the photographer accusing Harrelson of breaking his camera. After Harrelson returns the camera to him, a scuffle appears to ensue. ""Woody, this is assault. Woody, this is assault,"" the photographer is heard saying. ""Woody, chill out. Would you please chill out?"" The photographer continues to follow Harrelson for another four minutes as the actor and his daughter walk to the airport parking lot. At one point, Harrelson again turns toward the cameraman. ""I'm being chased by Woody Harrelson while I'm talking to you,"" the photographer says as he talks to an unidentified person on a cell phone. ""He hit me in my face, he broke my friggin' camera, he broke the camera in pieces,"" he said. Harrelson, his daughter and a driver get inside an SUV and the encounter ends. In the movie ""Zombieland,"" Harrelson plays ""the most frightened person on Earth"" looking for refuge from zombies, according to the Internet Movie Database . Filming on the movie wrapped in Atlanta, Georgia, on Wednesday, according to director Ruben Fleischer's Web site. TMZ photographer Josh Levine filed a lawsuit against Harrelson last year for an alleged attack outside a Hollywood nightclub in 2006. Video of that incident, which is also posted on TMZ.com, also appeared to show Harrelson grabbing a camera and clashing with the photographer. Los Angeles prosecutors declined to press charges against the actor, but Levine filed a suit last summer asking for $2.5 million in damages. ""Woody Harrelson has a history of anger management issues with people and we intend to put a stop to this,"" Cyrus Nownejad, Levine's lawyer, said Friday.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pilot of a doomed plane that crashed, killing 50 people, said ""Jesus Christ"" and ""We're down,"" seconds before the plane hurtled from the night sky into a house outside Buffalo, New York, in February. An investigator walks past the wreckage from a plane crash in Clarence Center, New York, in February. The last sounds heard in the cockpit were First Officer Rebecca Shaw saying ""We're"" and then screaming at 10:16 p.m. on February 12, according to a transcript of the cockpit recording. Seconds earlier, the pilot, Capt. Marvin Renslow, said, ""Jesus Christ,"" as a sound ""similar to stick shaker"" was heard, the transcript said. Renslow said, ""We're down,"" and a thump was heard before Shaw said, ""We're"" and screamed. The National Transportation Safety Board released the transcript of the cockpit recording on Tuesday as it began a three-day hearing in Washington on the crash.  See how crash of Flight 3407 unfolded » . Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, killing all 49 people on board and one man in the house. About five minutes before the crash, Shaw had shared with Renslow her fear of flying in icy conditions, according to the transcript. ""I don't want to have to experience that and make those kinds of calls. You know I'dve freaked out. I'dve [sic] had like seen this much ice and thought, 'oh my gosh, we were going to crash,"" Shaw told Renslow. The NTSB's preliminary investigation determined there was some ice accumulation on the Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 aircraft, but that ""icing had a minimal impact on the stall speed of the airplane."" Watch more on the NTSB investigation » . In a story Monday, the Wall Street Journal cited investigators as saying the crash resulted from pilot Marvin Renslow's incorrect response to the plane's precarious drop in speed: He overrode an emergency system known as a ""stick pusher,"" which sends the plane into a dive so it can regain speed and avoid a stall. Colgan Air, the operator of Continental Connection flights, said Monday that Renslow had never trained in a flight simulator with the safety system that activated just before the plane went down. Colgan said there is no regulatory requirement that it provide hands-on training with the ""stick pusher."" ""A stick pusher demonstrated in an aircraft simulator is not required by the FAA,"" the airline said in a statement. ""And thus was not included in Colgan's Q400 training program."" The Federal Aviation Administration said its standards do not require hands-on practice with the safety system. ""That's a significant problem,"" veteran pilot Douglas Moss told CNN. Moss, an expert in stall recovery, believes flight simulator practice with a stick pusher should be mandatory for aspiring pilots. ""It's similar to picking up and throwing a groundball in baseball. You can study it academically all you want to but you really need to develop the proficiency, the skill, the muscle memory required to do that,"" said Moss. Renslow had failed five pilot tests, known as ""check rides,"" three of which occurred before he joined the airline, Colgan Air said. Renslow had revealed only one of those failures to the airline, according to Colgan. NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said Tuesday that the board's hearing will not address who is to blame for the accident. ""Over the course of this hearing, we will continue to collect information that will assist the safety board in its examination of safety issues arising from this accident,"" he said. He said those issues are: airplane performance, cold weather operations, a sterile cockpit, flight crew training and performance, and fatigue management.

"(Mental Floss) -- Since the dawn of time, people have found nifty ways to clean up after the bathroom act. The most common solution was simply to grab what was at hand: coconuts, shells, snow, moss, hay, leaves, grass, corncobs, sheep's wool -- and, later, thanks to the printing press -- newspapers, magazines, and pages of books. The average American uses 57 squares a day and 50 pounds of toilet paper per year. The ancient Greeks used clay and stone; the Romans, sponges and salt water. But the idea of a commercial product designed solely to wipe one's bum? That started about 150 years ago, right here in the U.S.A. In less than a century, Uncle Sam's marketing genius turned something disposable into something indispensable. Toilet paper gets on a roll . The first products designed specifically to wipe one's nethers were aloe-infused sheets of manila hemp dispensed from Kleenex-like boxes. They were invented in 1857 by a New York entrepreneur named Joseph Gayetty, who claimed his sheets prevented hemorrhoids. Gayetty was so proud of his therapeutic bathroom paper that he had his name printed on each sheet. But his success was limited. Americans soon grew accustomed to wiping with the Sears Roebuck catalog, and they saw no need to spend money on something that came in the mail for free. Toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890, when two brothers named Clarence and E. Irvin Scott popularized the concept of toilet paper on a roll. The Scotts' brand became more successful than Gayetty's medicated wipes, in part because they built a steady trade selling toilet paper to hotels and drugstores. But it was still an uphill battle to get the public to openly buy the product, largely because Americans remained embarrassed by bodily functions. In fact, the Scott brothers were so ashamed of the nature of their work that they didn't take proper credit for their innovation until 1902. ""No one wanted to ask for it by name,"" says Dave Praeger, author of ""Poop Culture: How America Is Shaped by Its Grossest National Product."" ""It was so taboo that you couldn't even talk about the product."" By 1930, the German paper company Hakle began using the tag line, ""Ask for a roll of Hakle and you won't have to say toilet paper!"" As time passed, toilet tissues slowly became an American staple. But widespread acceptance of the product didn't officially occur until a new technology demanded it. At the end of the 19th century, more and more homes were being built with sit-down flush toilets tied to indoor plumbing systems. And because people required a product that could be flushed away with minimal damage to the pipes, corncobs and moss no longer cut it. In no time, toilet paper ads boasted that the product was recommended by both doctors and plumbers. Mental Floss: 5 times drug companies promised too much . Strength of going soft . In the early 1900s, toilet paper was still being marketed as a medicinal item. But in 1928, the Hoberg Paper Company tried a different tack. On the advice of its ad men, the company introduced a brand called Charmin and fitted the product with a feminine logo that depicted a beautiful woman. The genius of the campaign was that by evincing softness and femininity, the company could avoid talking about toilet paper's actual purpose. Charmin was enormously successful, and the tactic helped the brand survive the Great Depression. (It also helped that, in 1932, Charmin began marketing economy-size packs of four rolls.) Decades later, the dainty ladies were replaced with babies and bear cubs -- advertising vehicles that still stock the aisles today. By the 1970s, America could no longer conceive of life without toilet paper. Case in point: In December 1973, Tonight Show host Johnny Carson joked about a toilet paper shortage during his opening monologue. But America didn't laugh. Instead, TV watchers across the country ran out to their local grocery stores and bought up as much of the stuff as they could. Also telling was that, in 1978, a TV Guide poll named Mr. Whipple --the affable grocer who implored customers, ""Please don't squeeze the Charmin"" -- the third best-known man in America, behind former President Richard Nixon and the Rev. Billy Graham. Mental Floss: Cheetos Lip Balm and other bizarre brand extensions . Rolling the world . Currently, the United States spends more than $6 billion a year on toilet tissue -- more than any other nation in the world. Americans, on average, use 57 squares a day and 50 pounds a year. Even still, the toilet paper market in the United States has largely plateaued. The real growth in the industry is happening in developing countries. There, it's booming. Toilet paper revenues in Brazil alone have more than doubled since 2004. The radical upswing in sales is believed to be driven by a combination of changing demographics, social expectations, and disposable income. ""The spread of globalization can kind of be measured by the spread of Western bathroom practices,"" says Praeger. When average citizens in a country start buying toilet paper, wealth and consumerism have arrived. It signifies that people not only have extra cash to spend, but they've also come under the influence of Western marketing. America without toilet paper? Even as the markets boom in developing nations, toilet paper manufacturers find themselves needing to charge more per roll to make a profit. That's because production costs are rising. During the past few years, pulp has become more expensive, energy costs are rising, and even water is becoming scarce. As the climate continues to change, toilet paper companies may need to keep hiking up their prices. The question is, if toilet paper becomes a luxury item, can Americans live without it? Mental Floss: Why does bottled water have an expiration date? The truth is that we did live without it, for a very long time. And even now, a lot of people do. In Japan, the Washlet -- a toilet that comes equipped with a bidet and an air-blower -- is growing increasingly popular. And all over the world, water remains one of the most common methods of self-cleaning. Many places in India, the Middle East, and Asia, for instance, still depend on a bucket and a spigot. But as our economy continues to circle the drain, will Americans part with their beloved toilet paper in order to adopt more money-saving measures? Or will we keep flushing our cash away? Praeger, for one, believes a toilet-paper apocalypse is hardly likely. After all, the American marketing machine is a powerful thing. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- At least 42 people were killed and 154 were wounded in five attacks on a religious holiday Friday, an Interior Ministry official said. Shiite Muslim women light candles early Friday at a shrine in the holy city of Karbala, Iraq. The first four attacks, which together killed 36 and wounded 124, targeted Shiites; the fifth attack was against a Sunni target. In the latest attack, a parked motorcycle bomb exploded in the marketplace of al-Khadra in a predominantly Sunni neighborhood of eastern Baghdad. Six people died, and 30 were wounded, the official said. The attack appeared to have targeted a police patrol; three of the fatalities were police, the official said. But most of the carnage was directed at Shiite targets, with the highest single toll exacted in the northern city of Mosul, where a suicide car bomb exploded near a Shiite mosque as a funeral was taking place, killing 30 people and wounding 100, the official said. In another attack, a roadside bomb exploded near a bus carrying pilgrims in the Sadr City neighborhood, killing three and wounding eight, the official said. Also in Sadr City, a roadside bomb exploded near a car, killing one person and wounding seven. And in eastern Baghdad, a car carrying pilgrims was targeted, killing two people and wounding nine. Friday was the end of a Shiite Muslim celebration in Karbala celebrating the birthday of Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi, the last of 12 historic imams revered by Shiites. Pilgrims participating in such celebrations have been the target of similar attacks by Sunni Muslims. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam, Imam Mohammed al-Mehdi ""is expected to return at the end of time as the messianic imam who will restore justice and equity on Earth."" Last Friday, bombs detonated after prayers near five Shiite mosques nearly simultaneously, killing 29 people as they were leaving the mosques. The attacks fueled fears that sectarian violence could be reigniting in the country and called into question the ability of security forces to safeguard the population as U.S. troops have taken a back seat to their Iraqi counterparts. Though the number of casualties has dropped over the past year, Friday's attacks show that an insurgency capable of wreaking havoc remains.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- All the news that's fit to print -- the motto of The New York Times -- does not necessarily apply to photos. The newspaper published an editor's note Thursday stating that pictures used in a photo essay in its most recent Sunday Magazine were digitally manipulated without the paper's knowledge. The Times commissioned Portuguese photographer Edgar Martins to shoot a Sunday magazine color photo essay titled ""Ruins of the Second Gilded Age"" to capture physical evidence of the real estate bust that took place across the United States. In the text that preceded the six photos that were published, the magazine stated that while the photographer ""creates images with long exposures,"" he does so without digital manipulation. ""A reader ... discovered upon close examination that one of the pictures was digitally altered, apparently for aesthetic reasons,"" the Times editors wrote. ""Editors later confronted the photographer and determined that most of the images did not wholly reflect the reality they purported to show. Had the editors known that the photographs had been digitally manipulated, they would not have published the picture essay, which has been removed from the NYTimes.com,"" the note concluded. Numerous attempts by CNN to reach Edgar Martins by phone and e-mail were unsuccessful. The newspaper's decision to withdraw the photos left a publisher of Martins' book ""Topologies"" released in 2008, intrigued and surprised. ""I think he's a great artist and we're very proud to have published his prior works,"" said Lesley Martin, publisher of Aperture books. She said that Martins' prior works frequently verge on abstract landscapes, including forests ravaged by fire and nighttime beaches. ""His work has a certain visual effect. A distinct look and feel to it."" However, Martin said she understands the newspaper's decision. Aperture books, which publishes a variety of photographic styles, including photojournalism, ""would not have published this work in a strict journalistic context had we known there would be manipulation used,"" she said.","New York Times admits pictures in recent photo essay were digitally manipulated .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut unseated the six-time defending champion in Nathan's Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest on Wednesday, eating 66 hot dogs and buns in 12 minutes. Chestnut -- veins throbbing in his forehead -- wolfs down a dog on his way to the title and a world record Wednesday. Six-time winner Takeru Kobayashi of Japan, nursing a sore jaw after wisdom tooth surgery, scarfed down 63 hot dogs. Last year, he edged out Chestnut by nearly two dogs, eating a then-record 53 and three-quarters to Chestnut's 52. Chestnut, who hails from San Jose, California, set a record with Wednesday's feat of eating 66 hot dogs, the event's organizers said. Not since Joe Frazier defeated Muhammad Ali in the 1971 bout coined the ""Fight of the Century"" have two contestants battled so hard. Perhaps. At one point, Kobayashi expelled some of his half-mashed hot dogs from his mouth; those did not count in his total. Chestnut toiled beside him, a vein throbbing in his forehead and his face bright red.  Watch how the wiener-off went down » . ""My body worked for me,"" Chestnut said in an interview after the contest. Kobayashi, 29 years old and weighing in at 154 pounds, was listed as questionable prior to the event. He was receiving acupuncture treatment Wednesday morning to relieve pain in his jaw after wisdom tooth surgery. Video from Tuesday's weigh-in showed that he could open his mouth only half way. Chestnut, 23, weighing 215 pounds, had broken Kobayashi's 2006 record by downing 59½ hot dogs at a qualifying contest in Phoenix last month. Chestnut claims the ""Coveted Mustard Yellow International Belt"" and wins a one-year supply of hot dogs from Nathan's, the sponsor of the annual event, which has been held on the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn since 1916. Organizers said 50,000 people attended Wednesday's contest. Chestnut is a civil engineering student at San Jose University.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- U.S. Marines on Friday kept up a major push against entrenched militants in southern Afghanistan in an attempt to rout the Taliban from their stronghold in Helmand province, Marine Capt. William Pelletier said. A U.S. Marine patrols Garmser district in Afghanistan's Helmand province on Friday. A Marine source described Thursday evening's fighting in the Helmand River Valley as ""our most significant encounter."" Sporadic fighting that began earlier Thursday stretched over several hours in the southeastern sector of Garmser district, said Pelletier, spokesman for the Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan. Helmand province, a poppy-growing region, is the focus of the U.S.-led Operation Khanjar. Afghanistan supplies 90 percent of the world's opium, which is used in the production of heroin. The forces are attempting to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of Afghan national elections in August. Almost 4,000 Marines and sailors from the expeditionary brigade, along with more than 600 Afghan national security forces, are operating in key population centers along the valley, Pelletier said. Their targets are Garmser and Nawa districts in central Helmand, and stretch to Rig district in the south, Pelletier said. Marines and Afghan forces have taken over the key town of Khan Neshin, the capital of Rig district, which had been under Taliban control, the Marine source said. The goal is to protect residents from the threat of Taliban and other insurgent intimidation and violence, Pelletier said. ""Our focus is now and will remain the Afghan people. We have worked closely with local Helmand government officials and many tribal and local leaders in the detailed planning of this major offensive,"" said Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson, commander of Task Force Leatherneck. Once security is established, civil affairs personnel and other nongovernmental groups and agencies can come in and establish programs. However, Taliban control of the countryside is so extensive in provinces such as Helmand and Kandahar to the east that security forces face a tough job, according to a report this week in The New York Times. The government has no involvement in five of Helmand's 13 districts, the report said. In the fighting that began Thursday, Marines fired 20 mm cannons from their Cobra helicopter gunships -- but dropped no bombs -- to avoid the higher risk of civilian casualties, the Marine source said. The source called resistance ""heavy"" and ""persistent"" but intermittent. Militants responded using small arms, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns. ""Last night, Marines bedded down in compounds within cities ... with permission from the people"" rather than sleep in a restricted area away from the local population, Pelletier said. He said military leaders also were holding talks with village leaders. In other developments .

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- A former hospital employee may have exposed hundreds, or even thousands, of surgical patients to hepatitis C after taking their fentanyl injections and replacing them with used syringes filled with saline solution, authorities say. A hospital worker has admitted to secretly injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients. Kristen Diane Parker, who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver, has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients, investigators said. She had hepatitis C, which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008, authorities said. She was a surgical technician at Rose from October 2008 to April 2009. Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker. According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration, Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C. She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients. Parker quit after she was found to be in an operating room where she was not allowed to be. She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl. Hospital officials then contacted the DEA. Parker is in federal custody facing three drug-related charges. If she is found to have done serious harm to a patient, she could face up to 20 years in prison. If a patient dies because of her actions, she could face life in prison. In a statement to police, Parker said, ""I can't take back what I did, but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, and so does everyone else."" Her attorney could not be reached Friday. Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there. However, hospital officials do not believe that many patients were exposed. ""We are taking a very conservative and cautious approach by contacting everyone who had surgery during this broad time period,"" a statement on the hospital's Web site said, adding, ""It is likely that most of the patients who receive letters will not have been exposed to hepatitis C."" An additional 1,200 patients may have been infected between May 4, 2009, and July 1, 2009, when Parker worked at Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs. Audubon is also contacting patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control, hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.","Kristen Diane Parker believes she contracted hepatitis C from sharing dirty needles .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British government is buying 10,000 Taser stun guns for police officers across England and Wales, Britain's Home Office said Monday. British police officers use a Taser gun to tackle a mock suspect in a training exercise. The move will expand the ranks of officers carrying the weapons from ""select firearms squads"" to ""thousands of trained frontline officers,"" according to the Home Office, which is responsible for domestic policing. Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Jacqui Smith said police ""deserve our support, so I want to give the police the tools they tell me they need to confront dangerous people. That is why I am giving the police 10,000 Tasers."" The guns fire barbed darts charged with enough electricity to stun a person, the Home Office said. But Amnesty International UK described them as ""potentially lethal electrical weapons"" that deliver ""50,000 volts of electricity into a person's body. The result is excruciatingly painful, causing a person to fall to the ground and, at times, lose control of their bodily functions."" The human rights group, however, expressed qualified support for the British government move, urging that the weapons be given only to officers specially trained to use them. ""We don't actually oppose the use of Tasers as long as it's by a limited number of highly trained specialist officers, responding to genuinely life-threatening or very dangerous situations,"" said Oliver Sprague, the organization's arms program director. But, he added: ""Tasers are potentially lethal weapons which are already linked to numerous deaths in North America and that's why wide deployment without adequate training is a dangerous step too far for British policing."" ""The home secretary should urgently review this decision and ensure that Tasers only end up in the hands of a small number of fully trained officers capable of making the potentially fatal decision over whether to fire 50,000 volts into a person's body."" Amnesty says more than 300 people have died after being shot with Tasers since 2001. The decision to introduce Tasers across England and Wales follows what the government called a successful pilot program with officers from 10 police forces, including London's Metropolitan Police and forces responsible for Liverpool and Bristol. The test ran for 12 months from September 2007 with constables who had not previously carried firearms, a Home Office spokesman said. Before the pilot program, approximately 6,000 specially trained firearms officers across the country had access to Tasers starting in 2004. Most British police officers do not carry any kind of firearm, Home Secretary Smith emphasized in her statement, a fact she said she was proud of.","Police officers across England and Wales to armed with Taser stun guns .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- One day while driving with her father, Hannah Salwen noticed a Mercedes stopped next to a homeless man sitting on the curb. The Salwen family of Atlanta, Georgia, has decided to sell this house and give half the proceeds to charity. ""I said to my dad, 'If that guy didn't have such a nice car, then that guy could have a nice meal,' "" the 15-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, recalled. And so began the tale of what the Salwen family calls ""Hannah's Lunchbox.""  Watch why family wants to give away $800K » . It started as family discussions about what they needed versus what was enough. Hannah's father Kevin, an entrepreneur, is on the board of the Atlanta Habitat for Humanity and is no stranger to community work, but he said this family conversation was life-changing. ""We stopped and paused and thought about what are the things in the world that could really make a difference, a little bit of difference in the world,"" he said. They talked about selling their cars or other things, but it was Hannah's mother, Joan, who came up with selling their 6,500-square-foot house, donating half the proceeds and then moving into a house half the size. For nine years, the family lived in a historic 1912 mansion near downtown Atlanta. It boasts five bedrooms, eight fireplaces, a kitchen that would make any cook jealous and even an elevator.  See the new and old houses, side by side » . When Hannah would bring friends over, she said, often their jaws would drop and they'd gasp, ""Wow, you live here?"" Like most teens, Hannah loves to shop, and she jammed every space of her massive walk-in closet full of clothes. But she also knows many people are less fortunate; she volunteers at a local community food bank and other relief agencies. Joan Salwen, a teacher, said the mansion was her dream home. ""It was a challenge,"" she said of giving up that house. ""It was a test, almost, to see: How committed are we? I mean, how serious are these kids about what we should do? And they all nodded and there we were."" So the Salwens put the house up for sale in May 2007 and started figuring out what they would do with half the proceeds, which would amount to more than $800,000. They spent six months researching charity organizations before deciding on the Hunger Project, an organization dedicated to helping end world hunger through people helping themselves. Hunger Project Vice President John Coonrod said the family met with organizers in New York and notified them months later that the charity was the winner. When the Salwen house sells, the money will be channeled through The Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta over a six-year period and end up in Ghana, Coonrod said. ""This will underwrite a process in more than 30 villages to enable people to meet all of their basic needs on a sustainable basis,"" he said. ""They will be able to grow enough food, to build clinics and schools, and the villagers will be doing the lion's share of the work."" Coonrod said he'd never heard of a family donating in this way. ""Hannah's awakening to social injustice, and her family's ability to make a difference in that issue will make a profound difference in the lives of tens of thousands of people,"" he said, estimating the money could affect more than 20,000 people in Ghana. Hannah's 13-year-old brother, Joseph, was so impressed with his big sister's ideas that he made a three-minute video of the family's project.  Watch Joseph's video . The video won the grand prize in the 2008 ""My Home: The American Dream"" contest, sponsored by Coldwell Banker and Scholastic Publishing. In the video, Joseph tells viewers, ""We're showing you can redefine the American dream."" But the Salwens' house has sat on the market for more than a year. It's a tough time to sell any house, let alone one with an asking price of nearly $1.8 million. Real estate agent Sally George said she's shown the house 40 or 50 times, and there have been nibbles but no buyers. See the house's real estate listing . Many people are interested in the house's rich history but often don't know anything about the philanthropic aspects of the family's project. ""I've never handled a house selling for this reason,"" George said. ""I didn't learn about what the family was doing until early this year."" Hannah and Joseph said most of their friends at school don't know about it. ""We didn't do it for the fame or the glory,"" said Joan Salwen. ""This was something Hannah sort of yanked us into."" Even though it was Joan Salwen's idea to sell the house, it has been tough for her to give it up. ""I have to admit,"" she said, ""I loved living in this house. Does that make me an evil person? I hope not because it's a beautiful place."" The family recently moved to a house less than half the size of their mansion four blocks away. While Hannah's friends called her old home the ""wow house,"" this one is more ordinary and that's fine with her. Lately the family has spent a lot of time around the kitchen table talking about an upcoming two-week trip to Ghana. The Salwens will spend six or seven hours a day visiting the villages where their money will be put to work. Kevin Salwen said the new house is great, it's just smaller. ""We as Americans have so much,"" said Salwen, a former Wall Street Journal writer. ""We love the concept of half. We are going from a house that's 6,000 square feet to a house that's half the size, and we're giving away half the money. ""And we do think everyone can do something if they think through half.""","Family tries to sell $1.8 million mansion and give half the proceeds to charity .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The rehearsals ended on a high note that night. Jackson, here at a June 23 rehearsal, ""was full of jokes, full of life,"" band vocal coach Dorian Holley said. Michael Jackson was energetic and excited. He popped his signature moonwalk and dance spins that gave chills to some of those watching. As he walked to his car, he put his arm around concert promoter Randy Phillips and -- as Phillips later recounted -- in his soft voice, whispered: ""Thank you, I know we're going to get it there together. I know I can do this."" That was late Wednesday night, June 24. A few hours later, Jackson was rushed to a hospital and pronounced dead. ""All I know is that the Michael Jackson that hugged me and said 'goodnight' was a healthy, vibrant human being about to undertake the greatest undertaking of his life,"" Phillips said Thursday. ""And something happened between 12:30 when he left us and the morning when I had to rush to the hospital when I got the first call.""  Watch Jackson rehearse for London shows » . The death of the pop icon shocked the music world, not only because many fans were looking forward to his 50 sold-out shows in London, England, beginning in mid-July, but also because the 50-year-old singer -- while a step slower than in his prime -- was apparently healthy and up to the task of what has been described as a grueling show. ""He was just like a kid in the candy store because he was seeing his vision come alive,"" said Dorian Holley, the vocal coach for Jackson's band, about the last rehearsal. ""He was just full of jokes, full of life,"" Holley said. He added that Jackson was due to be back at rehearsals again at 4:30 p.m. on the day of his death. On Thursday, Phillips' promotion company, AEG Live, released a 1½-minute rehearsal clip that was shot two nights before Jackson's death. In that clip, Jackson barreled through the song ""They Don't Care About Us."" As a guitarist played a riff, he danced next to her and then led eight backup dancers in a choreographed march, reminiscent of his breakthrough music video ""Thriller."" The clip -- shot at the Staples Center arena in Los Angeles, California, on June 23 -- ends with a voice off stage saying, ""Hold for applause, hold for applause ... fade out."" Two days later, Jackson was dead. Phillips said a doctor, hired by the tour's insurance carrier, examined Jackson before AEG proceeded with the rehearsals -- and gave the singer the green light to continue. ""He examined Michael for about five hours at his house and I think they went somewhere for some other tests,"" Phillips said. ""We are obviously not privy to the patient-doctor relationship with that information, but the insurance broker told us that he passed with flying colors."" The production pace in those final weeks was ferocious, some of the attendees said. Jackson's manager, Frank DiLeo, told a radio interviewer that he discussed tweaking the strenuous two-hour format of the shows. ""We were going to do one of two things,"" DiLeo told KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, last week. ""We were either going to do so much in the beginning, take a half-hour break, then come back and do the second half of the shows. Or we were going to cut it down to 90 minutes."" The exacting rehearsals may have been taking a toll on Jackson, his doctor's lawyer has said. ""Michael Jackson didn't eat very much,"" said Edward Chernoff, the lawyer for Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. ""He really didn't drink very much. He didn't hydrate very well. When he rehearsed, it was very strenuous exercise."" As authorities await toxicology reports to determine how Jackson died, fans around the world lamented the loss of a great performer whose ability to dazzle seemed intact, if inhibited, in the short video clip. ""He still moves better at 50 than I could at 15,"" said Stephanie Siek, a graduate student in Frankfurt, Germany. ""But he also seems to be holding back in a way he never did in his older videos or other footage I've seen. I think it would have been a great show, but I think that a lot of people would have been disappointed, because he was so iconic in his prime. That's a very, very hard standard to live up to.""

"ROME, Italy (CNN)  -- Amanda Knox will testify Friday in an Italian courtroom to defend herself against charges that she took part in the killing of her roommate two years ago, her lawyer said. American college student Amanda Knox, 21, is expected to take the witness stand Friday at her Italian murder trial. Knox, 21, an American college student from Seattle, Washington, will be questioned by her attorneys first and her testimony could continue Saturday, said Luciano Ghriga, one of her lawyers. The trial against Knox and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 24, began January 16 in Perugia, a university town about 185 kilometers (115 miles) north of Rome. They are charged with murder and sexual assault in the November 2007 slaying of Knox's roommate, British exchange student Meredith Kercher, who died in what prosecutors called a ""drug-fueled sex game"" with the couple. A third person, Rudy Hermann Guede, from the Ivory Coast, was convicted of murder in October and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Kercher was found dead in her bed, half-naked, with a knife wound to her neck. In court papers, prosecutors stated that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked at her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her. Prosecutors say they have physical evidence placing the defendants at the scene, and that they gave investigators confusing and contradictory statements about their whereabouts the night Kercher died. Knox first said she was at the house she shared with Kercher, then changed her story, according to court records. Sollecito, meanwhile, said he was never at the house, but was at his apartment, watching a movie on his computer with Knox. Later, he told investigators he did not remember whether Knox was with him the entire night. Defense lawyers are expected to argue that the physical evidence was tainted by sloppy police work. The case is being heard by a panel of eight judges. The trial has drawn more than 140 journalists from 86 news outlets to the courthouse in Perugia, Italy. The presiding judge in the case, Giancarlo Massei, has barred cameras from the courtroom and said he could completely close portions of the trial dealing with the most graphic sexual assault allegations.","Murder trial makes American student Amanda Knox well-known in Italy .

"(CNN) -- With Congress on its August recess, lawmakers are back in their home districts to meet with their constituents. Voters are confronting lawmakers with tough questions on health care at town hall meetings across the country. Across the country, members of Congress are holding town hall meetings where voters are encouraged to voice any questions or concerns about what's happening on Capitol Hill. Health care reform has dominated the conversation at the meetings. President Obama has called on Congress to pass legislation this year, but lawmakers are hearing from their constituents that they want more specifics on what reform will mean for them. In addition to taking questions, lawmakers are trying to set the record straight and put an end to the spread of misinformation. Many town hall meetings are open to anyone. If you're interested in attending one, you're not alone. More than 70 percent of people say they are either very likely or somewhat likely to attend a town hall on health care, according to a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey. To find a meeting near you, determine who your senators and representatives are. You can find this information on the House and Senate Web sites. Some lawmakers have information about their town hall meetings clearly listed on their Web sites. Democratic Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado, for example, has an ""events"" section detailing the time and location of his upcoming meetings. Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin has a section called ""listening sessions."" It links to a map that shows where the meetings are by county. Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa lists his August meetings under the ""latest headlines"" section of his Web site. Not all of the lawmakers keep their Web sites up to date, and some don't have their town hall meetings listed online. If that's the case, you also can call your senator or representative's office to get more information on upcoming events. It's a good idea to call their office to confirm the time and location, even if the details are online. Meetings are often rescheduled or relocated, and it never hurts to double-check. Find out what time the doors open, and ask whether registration is required. You can also keep track of your senators and representatives on Twitter. Some lawmakers send messages about their upcoming events.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britons including Prime Minister Gordon Brown have leapt to the defense of their creaking healthcare service after President Barack Obama's plans for a similar system in the United States were branded ""evil"" by Republicans. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a heartfelt message of support for the NHS via Twitter. Tens of thousands of people have joined a Twitter group expressing pride in the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which offers free taxpayer-funded medical care to all British residents, while leading politicians have spoken out in support. Republican former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin earlier this week condemned Obama's plans to introduce a public heath insurance scheme as an ""evil"" move that would result in ""death panels"" deciding who would live or die. Her criticism has been echoed by fellow Republicans in direct attacks on Britain's NHS. In an article, Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said British healthcare was run by ""Orwellian"" bureaucrats who put a price tag on life. Sound off: What do you think of the British healthcare model? The comments caused a storm of protest in the United Kingdom, with Prime Minister Brown wading into the argument via micro-blogging site Twitter, where a conversation chain, ""#welovetheNHS"", is generating huge online traffic.  Britons react to the U.S. healthcare debate » . A posting on the 10 Downing Street Twitter site on Wednesday read: ""PM: NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort, despair and hope, life and death. Thanks for always being there."" The message was followed by another, from Brown's wife Sarah, adding: ""#welovetheNHS -- more than words can say."" Professor Stephen Hawking, author of ""A Brief History of Time"", also spoke out in favor of the British system, telling the Guardian newspaper that he owes his life to NHS treatment for the neuro-muscular dystrophy he has suffered from for 40 years. ""I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the NHS,"" he said. ""I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived."" Despite the support, the 51-year-old NHS is regularly the target of criticism at home, with opposition politicians accusing Brown's government of mismanagement resulting in long waiting lists and a ""lottery"" in deciding who gets life-saving drugs and surgery. Nevertheless, opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron also added his voice to the defense campaign with a posting on his party's Web site. "" Millions of people are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS -- including my own family. ""One of the wonderful things about living in this country is that the moment you're injured or fall ill -- no matter who you are, where you are from, or how much money you've got -- you know that the NHS will look after you."" His statement followed comments from one of his own party members backing the Republican criticism of the NHS. Dan Hannan, a Conservative member of the European Parliament reportedly said in an interview that ""he wouldn't wish it on anyone.""","Britons leap to defend National Health Service after U.S. criticism .

"(CNN) -- You might think childbirth would be a topic too personal, too beautiful or way too graphic to write about on Twitter. Sara, the wife of Twitter's CEO, posted online from a hospital while she was in labor. But, as Sara Williams showed on Tuesday when she posted Twitter updates about giving birth to her child, online social networking has pushed its way into the delivery room. It's now a trend for expectant moms to post to sites such as Twitter from the time they conceive to the moment they deliver a baby into the world. Williams, wife of Twitter CEO Evan Williams, posted to her 14,000-plus Twitter followers when her water broke, when she arrived at the hospital, during contractions and when she decided to get an epidural. Her husband broke the news on his Twitter feed that their ""perfect baby boy"" was delivered on Tuesday afternoon. As if the real-time drama of her labor wasn't enough, Sara Williams managed to spice up her Twitter feed with humor along the way. ""Dear Twitter, My water broke. It wasn't like Charlotte in Sex and the City,"" she wrote at about midnight ET on Tuesday. ""Now, timing contractions on an iPhone app."" After noting later that contractions are painful, she wrote, ""Epidural, yes please."" Her childbirth drew widespread attention online, where people who have never met Williams eagerly awaited the birth of her baby. Some moms and dads cheered her on, saying that by posting through labor she lifted the veil on a period that can be terrifying for pregnant women who don't know what to expect when their baby is ready to leave the womb. Others cringed at the idea, saying childbirth posts are too much information. Williams' childbirth is among the first to be publicized though Twitter, but she's far from the only woman to have published thoughts about the birth of her child while the process was happening. Terra Carmichael, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, said she tweeted through her third childbirth in February to keep her loved ones up to date. ""At the moment nothing went through my head. It was just like, 'This is how I'm feeling and so this is going out there, and if you don't like it you don't have to read it,' "" said the 36-year-old. ""Afterwards, I was like 'I hope I wasn't too gross or graphic.'"" She said posting to Twitter helped relieve some of the pain. ""I would literally be coming down from a really painful contraction and I'd be saying, 'Give me my iPhone,' and [my husband] would be saying, 'You are weird. Why are you doing this,'"" she said. ""Some of it was for me. It just felt kinda good to get that out there, put that out to the universe so it wasn't just my pain, so other people could feel it for me and feel it with me a little bit."" Kyle Monson, a new dad in New York City, did the tweeting for his wife. While she was in labor, he was busy sending text messages. ""We were on our iPhone and Blackberry right up until the point when my wife started pushing, and then we had to put those phones down,"" he said. Monson posted updates about his wife's labor to Twitter by using code words only his friends could understand. Instead of posting ""my wife just gave birth,"" for instance, he wrote, ""Operation Bumblebee complete! Ada Elizabeth is 7lbs, 2oz, and is very happy to be here."" Ada, who is the couple's first child, was born on August 5. Monson has nearly 800 Twitter followers and didn't want everyone in the world to know about the ""blood and gore"" of the birthing process. Most of the couple's friends and family live further West, he said, so the online networks helped them keep their loved ones updated. The senior editor at PCMag.com said his wife was sending text messages to people throughout her 10-hour labor. ""She had an epidural so it was actually pretty easy for her,"" he said. Debora Robertson, group manager of the Expectant Mother's Guide, said she wouldn't feel comfortable sharing so many details on Twitter, but making such information public could be helpful for pregnant women who are anxious about childbirth. ""I think it's great that she [Sara Williams] can do that with family and friends, and I would imagine a lot of first time moms have curiosity,"" she said. ""They're peeking into the delivery rooms."" Monson also said Twitter posts from the delivery room can be informative. ""Going into it I had a lot of questions because no one really writes about this stuff"" online, he said. Many new sites are promoting ""mom-to-mom wisdom"" as a way for expecting parents to become educated about childbirth, said Dina Freeman, spokeswoman for the Baby Center, an online resource for moms. Freeman said one of her friends tweeted through childbirth. She had mixed feelings about the posts. ""Although I was happy for the updates, I was like, 'Are you sure you want that on Twitter?'"" New moms also are joining mom-specific social networks to get important questions answered, said Freeman, who manages the Baby Center's Facebook page. She said the wisdom of the crowd is useful, but sometimes she recommends pregnant women and new moms see physicians for potentially serious health issues. Moms are finding other ways to share their pregnancies online, too. A quick search on YouTube found more than 3,600 videos matching ""childbirth."" And a product called the Kickbee is a belt that wraps around a pregnant woman's stomach and automatically posts to a Twitter feed when the baby kicks. Some people say too much technology in the delivery room is a bad thing. ""I think it's terrible,"" Dr. Renana Brooks, a psychologist, told the Baltimore Sun in reference to people who post on Twitter during childbirth. ""One of the few rituals we have, in terms of giving each other undivided attention, is that time in a delivery room. To be spending time writing to someone else destroys the whole ritual. ""That's like Twittering on your wedding night. You can blog about it afterward."" The Twittering parents, however, said they're just trying to include as many friends and family members in their special moment as possible. ""I've got a lot of people in my life that I love,"" Carmichael said, ""and I want to keep up on their lives. This is one of the biggest events of my life, and so [writing on Twitter] was my way of keeping people posted on what was happening."" After his wife gave birth on Tuesday, Evan Williams beamed on his Twitter feed. ""Yes! @sara gave birth to a perfect baby boy,"" he wrote. ""Both are well. 8 pounds, 21 inches! Smiles all around."" Moments later, friends responded with encouragement. ""Yay! @ev and @sara just had their first baby and it's a boy -- can't wait to meet the mini CEO,"" Twitter co-founder Biz Stone wrote.","NEW: The wife of Twitter's CEO posted messages on Twitter during her labor .

"(CNN) -- I have vivid memories of childhood. The 5-year-old girl with endless questions; she wanted to discover the secrets of the entire world within minutes. She dreamed of being a doctor once, an engineer another time, and a mother of lovely kids. A dreamer, this is how I would describe the little girl Reem. Reem is a 22-year-old student living in Gaza City. Days passed fast. Reem couldn't remember a lot of them, but she had some moments left in her memory -- usually the happy moments of her life -- and those memories were the basis for today's Reem, the 22-year-old girl who is ME. I remember how happy I was when my teacher announced to the school that I was first in my class. I remember my mother's voice singing to me before I fell asleep; I remember my father running behind my kite when I lost it in the air, and I remember me asking my parents for a real monkey as a pet. I can't forget the day I finished high school; I felt so grown up. I remember the day when the school announced the exam results and the tears of happiness my mother shed when I received a grade of excellent, and then I decided to enroll in the college of Business Administration. I can call Gaza City the city of qualifications, where a lot of youth are qualified for good jobs. I am one of those youth who is volunteering in organizations, participating in community service activities, getting trained in various skills and getting more qualified day by day. But many young people like me cannot find jobs.  See perspectives from Palestinian youth » . Sometimes, I feel disconnected from Gaza, but whenever I see the photos of Jaffa, I realize that it's where I and a thousand refugees belong. I find myself crying, missing a place I have never been to, but it's where my parents and my grandparents lived. I remember all those bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me about the land, the fence of roses they had, and her climbing trees and cutting fruits. How I miss that place. But life must go on. My day starts with the smile of optimism and the plan of my day. Waking up early to go to my university; I have to attend all of my lectures even though some are boring. My friends are a big part of my day. We start with our updates and then go to courses where we can develop our skills. When I arrive home, I feel so exhausted, but still I continue working and studying hard. I am always looking for chances for personal development, whether through volunteer work or at school. I was offered a great opportunity to volunteer with the aid organization Mercy Corps as a founding member of the Why Not? youth program, and then I had the pleasure of seeing this program blossom into the Global Citizen Corps, or GCC, a cultural exchange between Palestinian and American students. I believe this program is deeply important because it changes the negative impression of Palestinian youth that is too often spread by media. All my friends and 1,000 others are engaged in this program, which develops our personalities, our skills and serves the community. We use digital media as a tool to express what we feel and what we do. We make changes in ourselves, in our community, and we pave the way for global change. We are thinking globally and acting locally. My ambition is to be a researcher in business studies all over the world. I finished my B.A. and a diploma of business studies, and I hope to obtain a scholarship to do graduate work in media and development. I am also interested in the field of project management and human interaction management. I know it is a good ambition to be Ph.D. holder and a worldwide researcher, but as Palestinian girl, I have fewer opportunities, not because I am not qualified or hard-working enough but because I am Palestinian. Usually Palestinian students have fewer opportunities than others to get scholarships, because it's hard for them to leave the Gaza Strip, as all of the borders are closed. But I have not lost hope, and I will not. I will keep trying to pursue my dream of being the researcher I want to be. It's true that I am a girl, and girls face some challenges in our society. For example, I can't stay a late hour at work. But I am so happy and honored to be a Muslim; putting the scarf on my head is something that I love. To many foreigners, it might seem to be against women's freedom, but I can tell that when a lady is convinced of it, it becomes part of her self-esteem, her self-confidence and her protection each day. I feel sad when the world gets angry at Muslim girls while they are peaceful and happy, enjoying their choices and freedom. I found that I'm not that different from Catherine, who lives in the United States and whom I contact through the Global Citizen Corps. I have realized how similar Palestinian youth are to youth all over the world. Catherine likes some of the food I like, and she loves swimming just like I do. There are also lovely differences between us: I tried to cook what she taught me once, and she is learning Arabic now. Maybe our lifestyle is different. I focus on my own development; I spend most of my time working to become a more qualified person with more knowledge and skills. I do not work hard because I am super girl or I aspire to be one but because I always want to be ready for the worst situation. In Palestine where I live, surprises can happen at any time, and I don't want to be caught off guard. I want to make my future secure by being a really good person. I deserve to live. I enjoy my life as it is now, but I hope that when I find a scholarship and live in the West, I will not be obliged to take off my scarf and won't hear negative comments about me because I am Muslim. I consider religion a personal freedom that is related to your beliefs and what you feel in your heart. I love letting others live in peace. ... Why can't we enjoy peace, too? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Reem calls Gaza City the city of qualifications, but many can't find jobs .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The much-maligned symbol of motoring in Communist East Germany, the Trabant, is set to make an unlikely comeback as a concept car at this year's International Motor Show in Frankfurt. The old-style Trabi is a common sight in Germany where tourist operators use the car for local tours. Designers have replaced the car's smoke-belching two-stroke engine with electric fuel cells and solar-powered air-conditioning. This, they promise, is not the four-wheeled object of ridicule that rolled off production lines in East Germany from 1957 until 1991. This is the new Trabant, or Trabi as they're known, an energy-efficient city car for modern drivers. ""I think the market will be people who say the old Trabant was a cool car, and people who want to have a stylish car, and want to have a green car,"" Daniel Stiegler, of Herpa Miniaturemodelle, told CNN. Herpa is not a carmaker, at least not in the traditional sense. It makes model cars and airplanes, of the type that sit in display cabinets, not garages. Two years ago, a member of its management team, Klaus Schindler, decided it was time to make a miniature model of the Trabant. Herpa took it to the International Motor Show in Frankfurt in 2007 and were stunned by the response. ""We had a special folder where people at the fair could fill out and give it back to use. We had about 14,000 reactions on that, and most of them, 90 percent, said 'Yes, the Trabant is a really cool car, let's bring it back,'"" Stiegler said. Herpa teamed up with German auto parts maker IndiKar, which has designed a prototype to be unveiled at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt in September. They hope to attract enough interest to put the car back into production. The early response of Trabi enthusiasts to an electric version of their much-loved cars has been encouraging. ""This will be an ideal vehicle to try it on,"" Geoff Armitage, who had been the president or chairman of the Wartburg Trabant IFA Club UK on and off for some 18 years. ""If they go for the same type of cladding of duroplast, or western-style glass fibre, you have a light body which obviously will be an advantage for an electric car."" The original exterior of the cars was made from duroplast, a blend of cast-off cotton fibers from Russia mixed with glue. Armitage bought his first Trabant in the Netherlands in 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Over the years, he's owned around 20 of the German cars, adding ""we have several restoration projects in the yard at the moment."" Like many admirers, he appreciates the Trabi's simplicity. ""They are basic technology. There is absolutely nothing that we can't repair ourselves. If we can't get the parts we can usually make them,"" he laughed. ""If they can do the electrical conversion, for want of a better term, in a relatively low-tech way so they keep it simple I think it could be a success,"" he said. German filmmaker Maximilian Spohr spent four years making a documentary about the Trabant. He became fascinated about the car's origins as a child growing up in the East where residents faced up to a fourteen-year wait for delivery of their vehicles. ""There was only a certain contingent, a certain amount, allowed every year, because they didn't have enough screws, they didn't have enough parts,"" he said. For his documentary, ""A Car For A Dollar,"" he interviewed former Trabant engineers and owners and found an abundance of nostalgia for the old-style vehicles, despite their association with Communist repression. ""People remember it as their only partner in crime,"" Spohr said. ""It was the one and only thing that brought them around the country. They weren't allowed to go far. This was the only vehicle they could use and it was always reliable, most times."" Many of the cars were dumped by their owners as soon as they'd driven them to freedom over the border from East to West. Spohr said it didn't take long for nostalgia to kick in and the first Trabi appreciation meeting was held in 1990, just one year after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Of plans for a new, eco-friendly Trabi, Spohr says, """"I think it's great. People would probably love it, I think it will sell. Big time."" If the modern Trabant fails to materialize, there's always the option to step back in time in the original version. Trabis can still be seen slowly weaving through traffic, particularly in Berlin and Dresden, where Trabi-Safari leads tourists in a procession of up to six cars to local points of interest.","Relic of Communist East Germany to be revived as eco-friendly city car .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- An illegal immigrant dishwasher who lost $49,000 to the U.S. government as he tried to take it home to Guatemala will get some of the money back, his attorney said Wednesday. Pedro Zapeta, an illegal immigrant, managed to save $59,000 while working as a dishwasher for 11 years. Pedro Zapeta was ""very, very happy"" when he learned about a federal appeals court ruling that says he is entitled to recover some of the money, said attorney Robert Gershman, who handled the financial end of Zapeta's case. Zapeta was carrying $59,000 in cash when he was stopped at a security checkpoint at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in 2005. He told authorities he was returning home to Guatemala with the money he had saved working illegally as a dishwasher over 11 years. But federal law requires that anyone leaving or entering the country with $10,000 or more must declare it. Because Zapeta had not done so, he was detained, and his money was seized. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that the judge who fined Zapeta applied an incorrect standard in determining the amount to be forfeited. The appeals court ordered a hearing to set a new fine. ""I am extremely happy,"" Gershman said. ""Even though he is not a citizen, it shows he has equal rights."" Gershman has said Zapeta, who does not speak English, was not trying to conceal the money but did not know the law. Zapeta had paid taxes on the earnings, he said, and under legal guidelines should be fined at most $5,000 for failing to report that he was traveling with the cash. Circuit Court Judge James Cohn instead fined Zapeta $49,000, all the money he was carrying over the $10,000 limit. ""The government always acted as if the money was their own,"" Gershman said. ""They acted almost entitled to it. But it's not their money. It was Pedro's, and the [appeals] court affirmed that."" Zapeta said last year that he had saved the money to build a house for himself and his family in his home village in the Guatemalan mountains. He returned to Guatemala this year under the threat of deportation, but his lawyers continued to argue that his fine was excessive. Federal prosecutors in Miami did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision or on whether they will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. As Zapeta's case was publicized, U.S. residents donated money to him, and Gershman set up a trust. It has received about $15,000 in donations, he said.","Pedro Zapeta was stopped in 2005 trying to take $59,000 home to Guatemala .

"FALLUJA, Iraq (CNN) -- Like many young boys, Khidir loves playing with toy cars and wants to be a policeman like his father when he grows up. But it was his father's very job that caused the tiny child to suffer the unimaginable. Khidir, now 8, was kidnapped and held hostage for two years by operatives with al Qaeda in Iraq. Khidir was just 6 years old when he was savagely ripped away from his family, kidnapped by al Qaeda operatives in Iraq. ""They beat me with a shovel, they pulled my teeth out with pliers, they would go like this and pull it,"" said Khidir, now 8, demonstrating with his hands. ""And they would make me work on the farm gathering carrots."" What followed was even more horrific, an ordeal that would last for two years in captivity. Khidir and his father spoke to CNN recently, more than half a year after his rescue by Iraqi police.  Watch boy describe torture » . ""This is where they hammered a nail into my leg and then they pulled it out,"" he says, lifting up his pant leg to show a tiny wound. He says his captors also pulled out each of his tiny fingernails, broke both his arms, and beat him repeatedly on the side of the head with a shovel. He still suffers chronic headaches. He remembers them laughing as they inflicted the pain. ""I would think about my mommy and daddy,"" he replies, when asked how he managed to get through the agony. His father, Abdul Qader, struggles for words. ""When he tells me about how they would torture him, I can't tolerate it. I start crying,"" he says. ""What hurts me the most is when they hammered a nail into his leg."" The father, a police officer, was sleeping at the police station in Falluja when his son was kidnapped. It was too dangerous to go home regularly. Although Falluja was no longer controlled by insurgents, assassinations against police were common. ""I woke up to the sound of a huge explosion ... and then I heard my name on the radio. I ran outside and they came to me saying your house was blown up,"" he says. ""When the police patrol came back, they all started kissing and comforting me,"" he continues. ""I was asking, 'What's going on? Where is my family?' They told me that they took my son. This was a disaster. I went mad that day, I wasn't normal, I was hysterical."" Khidir's grandmother was at home with the family at the time. ""The kidnappers climbed the fence and kicked in the door,"" she says.""They were screaming for Abdul Qader. I told them he's not here. They called me a liar and said we want his son. His son was hiding behind me, clutching my clothes. I said this is not his son. They hit me on the back with a rifle and ripped him out of my arms."" The last thing she remembers were his screams of ""Granny, Granny!"" The attackers rigged the house with explosives and demolished it before taking off with the 6-year-old. The boy's grandmother and seven other family members rushed out of the home before it exploded. ""The kidnappers called me on the phone and demanded that some prisoners that we had be released or they would slit his throat,"" Khidir's father says. ""But I said no to the release. I would not put killers back out on the street that would hurt other Muslims. So I thought to myself, 'Let my son be a martyr.' "" He even held a secret funeral for his little boy. He didn't want to tell the rest of the family that he had refused the kidnappers' ultimatum, allowing them to hope that he was still alive. Last December, nearly two years later, police in Taji, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) away, received a tip that terrorists were holding kidnapped children. ""We thought that it was just a tip to ambush us, but we considered the mission as a sacrifice,"" said Iraqi police Capt. Khalib Ali. ""Either we find the children and free them or face the danger and take the risk."" The tip led the Iraqi police to a rundown farm and a series of mud huts. Khidir's tiny body was twisted abnormally. And in another hut, they found another child. Two children are still believed to be with the kidnappers. Al Qaeda in Iraq has historically kidnapped children for money, to pressure officials, and even to use in terrorist attacks. For Khidir's father, it was as if his son had come back from the dead. ""He didn't recognize his mother or his grandmother,"" Abdul Qader says. ""But then he saw me in uniform and ran to me. I went flying toward him to hug him. People said be careful; both his arms are broken. So I held him from his waist, and he hugged me, kissed me, smelled me, and then broke into a smile."" The father flips through old family photos -- all they were able to salvage from their destroyed home -- and notes some of the kidnappers are still at large. He still fears for his son's safety, but says he won't quit the police force. ""Never, never,"" he says. ""If I leave the police force, if others leave the force, who will protect us from the terrorists? We are the only ones.""

"(CNN) -- Al-Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj arrived home in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum early Friday after nearly six years in the U.S. Navy prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Al-Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj at a hospital in Khartoum after his release from Guantanamo Bay. ""I was so happy that I cried,"" al-Hajj told the Qatar-based Arabic news network by phone from his hospital room, where he was taken after arriving at the airport. ""It is our right to be happy and to rejoice, but we also miss our brothers that we left behind and who live in very difficult conditions."" An official with the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said the transfer brought to an end a matter that the United States and Sudan considered to be ""of great mutual concern."" Al-Hajj, a Sudanese citizen in his late 30s, was captured in Afghanistan in December 2001 by Pakistani intelligence officers and handed over to the United States, which accused him of being an ""enemy combatant."" A senior Pentagon official confirmed the journalist's release. Al-Hajj was held without being charged or given a trial, Al-Jazeera reported. The cameraman was on a legitimate assignment and carried a work visa at the time of his capture, the network said. It also reported that the U.S. plane that carried al-Hajj had about 20 other former detainees aboard who also had been released from Guantanamo Bay. The plane dropped off a Moroccan national, identified as Al-Saeed Bou Jaadiya, the network said. Al-Jazeera aired video showing a bearded al-Hajj being carried from the plane in Khartoum by U.S. military personnel and laid on a stretcher. He was transported to Al-Amal Hospital. ""He was brought in here by ambulance and entered to the intensive care unit on a stretcher,"" said Al-Jazeera Director General Wadah Khanfar from the hospital. ""He was exhausted and very sick, and he's receiving the necessary care in the hospital."" Khanfar said he was awaiting word from doctors on his medical condition. In a statement, U.S. Charge D'Affaires Alberto Fernandez of the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said the transfer ""is a result of many factors and the work of many hands. An important one was the cooperation between the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum and the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Intelligence and Security Service."" Al-Hajj had been on a hunger strike for more than a year and was being force-fed, said Zachary Katznelson, a lawyer who has worked on al-Hajj's case since August 2005 and last visited him three weeks ago. ""Al-Hajj is remarkably thin,"" Katznelson said. ""He looks like an ill man."" The journalist was conscious, but did not appear to speak to anyone as paramedics rolled his stretcher inside. Family members stooped to kiss him as the gurney passed. ""I would have hoped they were here with me now. I look forward to the moment,"" al-Hajj said told Al-Jazeera before being reunited with his family. Earlier, al-Hajj's wife spoke to the network about his release. ""Now I can think differently,"" Asma Ismailov said. ""Now I can plan my life differently. Everything will be all right, God willing."" Al-Hajj's young son, Mohammed, said he would ""kiss his head"" when he sees his father. ""I'll tell him that I love him and I need him."" The Sudanese government told Al-Jazeera that al-Hajj faced no charges in Sudan and is a free man. The network also said the United States placed some conditions on al-Hajj's release, including one that prevents him from any political activity. Reporters Without Borders, which campaigned for al-Hajj's release, said in a statement that the cameraman ""never should have been held so long."" ""U.S. authorities never proved that he had been involved in any kind of criminal activity,"" the worldwide press freedom group said. The organization said al-Hajj was accused of gun-smuggling for al Qaeda and running an Islamist Web site, although no evidence supporting those charges was produced. ""We are delighted that Sami al-Hajj can finally be reunited with his family and friends,"" said Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""But his detention for six years, without the most basic due process, is a grave injustice and represents a threat to all journalists working in conflict areas.""

"(CNN) -- Driving over a pothole may not be a big deal for most people, but for Jeff Bell, it was a source of endless frustration. Jeff Bell found treatment for OCD very difficult, but says it helped him turn his life around. Afraid that he had injured a person, he would drive back to each pothole again and again to check, and he lost a lot of time in the process. ""I knew that my behaviors made no sense. I knew that my thoughts that were triggering these behaviors made no sense, and yet I felt so helpless to do anything about it,"" he said. Bell, a news anchor with KCBS Radio in San Francisco, California, now knows that his condition has a name: obsessive-compulsive disorder. He frequently speaks out about it and has written a memoir called ""Rewind, Replay, Repeat."" Psychologists are debating where OCD belongs in relation to other psychiatric disorders, and whether certain symptoms are actually part of other conditions. The condition affects as many as 4 million Americans, according to the International OCD Foundation, for which Bell is a spokesman. In a class of its own? Currently, OCD sits with anxiety disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association to help diagnose mental illness. The next edition will be released in 2012, according to the APA. Many experts, such as Jonathan Abramowitz, professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, believe OCD should stay with anxiety disorders. That's because people with the disorder tend to engage in repetitive behaviors to reduce anxiety.  Watch CNN's Elizabeth Landau talk more about OCD » . There is mixed evidence based on brain scans that OCD has a separate biological mechanism, leading some psychiatrists to favor classifying it separately, Abramowitz said. ""We haven't exactly pinned down what might be the problem,"" he said. Categorizing related symptoms . Checking for evidence of harm done, as in Bell's case, is one of many manifestations of OCD. Some people are overly afraid of germs, while others are overwhelmed by thoughts of violence or sex, or fear that they have ""sinned,"" and still others spend countless hours arranging objects, said Jeff Szymanski, executive director of the International OCD Foundation. There are also people with OCD who repeat behaviors a fixed number of times because ""it will undo the thought or image that came to mind that you didn't want,"" he said. Behaviors such as compulsive gambling are in a different category, Abramowitz said. A key difference is that  those people enjoy gambling, while a person with OCD does not get pleasure from the behaviors he or she repeats. There is also controversy over whether trichotillomania -- compulsive hair pulling -- falls under OCD, because it is characterized by a repetitive behavior, but not necessarily obsessive thoughts, Szymanski said. Tics and Tourette syndrome also are OCD-related. Most people with OCD realize that their compulsions are irrational, but about 4 percent do not, Abramowitz said. Hoarders, who compulsively acquire objects without throwing anything away, tend to have less ""insight into the senselessness of their symptoms"" than others with OCD, he said. This is one of the reasons that hoarding may be distinct from OCD altogether, he said. Hoarders also do not respond as well to traditional treatments. Randy Frost, psychologist at Smith College, said only 5 percent of hoarders have an OCD basis for it; the rest may have other OCD-related problems or none at all. Treating OCD and hoarding . Doctors may prescribe drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for OCD symptoms. But for some people this is only part of the solution, Szymanski said. The other first-line treatment is called exposure and response prevention, which forces people with the condition to confront their fears. This helps some people to stop engaging in behaviors, such as checking potholes, which would normally be their means of escaping those fears. Bell found this treatment so difficult that he initially lied to his therapist about doing the homework she assigned. But once he became serious about the therapy, he felt  as if he was turning his life around. He also learned to externalize the force behind intrusive thoughts -- he calls it the ""doubt bully."" ""The key is to find those things in life that motivate us to sit with the discomfort of our anxiety through this treatment process to get better,"" he said. Researchers at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut, and Smith College and Boston University in Massachusetts, are collaborating on a new treatment for hoarders. They've just finished collecting data from 46 participants, Frost said. The treatment targets acquisition, discarding, and disorganization, Frost said. That's because people who compulsively hoard tend to buy or pick up too many things, keep things rather than throw anything out, and create clutter. To help with ""acquisition,"" therapists try to help people understand their attachment to their possessions. For example, the therapist will ask the patient how upset he or she will be if a piece of paper is thrown away, and then test that prediction by throwing it away. Researchers have found that participants who hoard do not get as upset as they anticipated when they dispose of the paper, Frost said. OCD is sometimes as hard on loved ones as on the patients themselves, Bell said. Family members may even become enablers, unintentionally fueling the cycle, he said. ""Often times, it involves family members meeting with a trained therapist who can help give them guidelines as to what is helpful and what's counterproductive,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- New details have emerged about a Jewish immigrant who fled Austria as World War II was brewing, lived frugally in New York and left an estate whose size -- $300,000 -- astounded some. Ida Blumin fled Austria in 1938 for the U.S. and married Walter Fischer, who earned money performing odd jobs. In a story published Monday, CNN and other news organizations reported neither the woman's name nor much else about her, except for the fact that she had donated half of her estate to Hebrew University in Jerusalem, a school with which she had had no known contact. Since then, CNN has contacted two of her friends and a relative, who have identified her as Ida Fischer, who was born Ida Blumin in 1911 in Vienna. They said she was neither a concentration camp survivor nor had she ever been homeless, as the school originally reported. Her life story, however, was still remarkable. In 1938, she, her mother, her sister and her sister's husband fled Austria, said Peter Last, a Jewish collectible coin and banknote wholesaler who lived on East 32nd Street and befriended Fischer 20 years ago, when she lived a block away. The Blumins made their home in New York, where they had relatives. The 5-foot-2-inch immigrant married Walter Fischer, another Austrian, who earned money performing odd jobs. The couple lived with Fischer's mother; Ida Fischer earned money from a variety of office jobs. Fischer, who was in her mid-70s when Last met her in the late 1980s, gave the impression that she was just scraping by, he said. ""She hung around on the street and talked to everybody and people gave her food and clothes,"" he said. ""She was very thrifty."" She once traveled with her mother to Israel, but did not appear particularly religious, Last said. Gabor Szanto, who met Fischer nearly 40 years ago upon his arrival in the United States from Hungary by way of Italy, disagreed, saying his friend observed all the high holidays. ""I used to take her to the synagogue,"" said the hair colorist who has a shop on the Upper West Side and cut Fischer's hair for free. He received 25 percent of her estate. ""She was a great believer in God."" He described her as ""a free spirit."" ""She would say she liked weak men and strong coffee,"" he said. ""She was always being taken out to eat by one person or another; people bought her things, bought her food, bought her newspapers. But she wasn't a down-and-out bag lady with a pushcart like the people in the movie. She was very neat, clean and she was a decent person."" He said her penny pinching was understandable ""because she lived through the Depression."" Last said that, throughout the years he knew Fischer, she lived on East 31st Street in a 10th-floor, sparsely furnished one-bedroom apartment in a building for senior citizens. Her rent -- about $145 per month -- was even lower than it would have been because she reported housing code violations in her apartment to authorities, who then declined to approve rent hikes, Last said. But Fischer spent much of her time outside the building, where she sat on a bench dressed in old clothes and carried on a busy social life. ""Everyone knew her,"" he said. ""Everybody in the diner on the corner knew her."" Among her coterie was Rue McClanahan, who played Blanche Devereaux on ""The Golden Girls"" and lived on the block, he said. Neighbors would sometimes give her items they no longer wanted. Fischer's frugality was legend: She recycled greeting cards, crossing off the name of the original recipient and replacing it with the new one. ""She'd write on the top of it: 'From Ida,'"" Last said. Instead of paying extra to get an unlisted telephone number, she simply listed it under someone else's name, he said. Occasionally, Last, now 74, would treat his neighbor to a meal at the diner or a nearby delicatessen, where her favorite dishes included lox. Though she was not thin, she would rarely finish what was on her plate. ""A lot of it, she would take home,"" he said. ""She'd take all the sugar and all the napkins; she'd bring extra jars to take coffee home in."" He always picked up the tab. ""There was never any question,"" he said. ""I don't think she ever bought anything."" Last, who was also born in Austria, helped Fischer increase her monthly pension from the Austrian government. He also helped her augment her income, giving Fischer $5 to sit in his Peugeot on days when the street sweeper went by so that he would not get a parking ticket. One day, Fischer asked Last about a flier she had received offering to help residents write their will for free. ""I looked into it and I found that this was the Brooklyn Law School; they would send a lawyer who would take two students to people's houses and do their wills, so I said, 'It's OK.'"" Fischer asked Last to serve as executor and he agreed. She also told him that she would leave him money, but Last was unimpressed. ""I never thought she had any real money,"" he said. ""She was enough of a pest that I told her, 'No, I don't want it.'"" She took him at his word. Instead, she left a quarter of her $300,000 estate to Last's wife, Silvia, a quarter to Szanto and half to Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where a spokesman said the school was grateful for the donation, but had no idea what inspired it. Though Fischer remained alert until the end, she faltered physically during her final months, when she ""very reluctantly"" hired a woman to take care of her. ""She didn't want to pay for it,"" Last said. Fischer died in 2007 of heart failure, he said. Last said Fischer had told him she had no relatives, but he discovered after her death that she had not been truthful. ""It turned out there was a sister and a nephew that she wasn't on speaking terms with,"" he said. Even after Fischer died, Last continued to learn about his friend's penurious ways. When he went to a bank to carry out his duties as executor of the will, a vice president told him Fischer had taken advantage years before of a promotional offer of a year's free access to a safe deposit box, Last said. But after the year elapsed, she refused to pay the $100 annual fee, he said. So the banker told him he kept Fischer's Series E savings bonds for $60,000 in his desk drawer, Last said. Though the size of her total savings surprised him, Last said her dogged thrift could have explained it. He calculated that -- between her pension from Austria and her $800 monthly check from Social Security -- her monthly income was about $2,000, of which she spent only about $500. Fischer's sister -- from whom she had long been estranged -- died a few months ago, said Fischer's nephew, Peter Lynwander, who lives in Ridgewood, New Jersey. He said he last saw his aunt more than three decades ago at a family get-together. ""She was a live wire,"" quick to pound out a waltz on the piano or to dance. He was not surprised at the sum of her savings: ""She worked all her life and she didn't live high. So I don't think that's all that unusual."" CNN's story published Monday quoted a spokesman for the school as saying Fischer had survived a concentration camp and lived homeless on the streets of New York. Her friends and her nephew said neither was true. On Friday, school spokesman Richard Dukas said the discrepancies were the result of a miscommunication. Hebrew University ""regrets misinterpreting the facts about Ida's amazing and generous story,"" he said. ""What is clear is that Ida was a remarkable woman who has made a difference by supporting research and education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, something that will have an impact far beyond the borders of the state of Israel.""","Ida Fischer a Jewish immigrant who fled Europe before WWII .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The sleek, dark wood has all the characteristics of endangered mahogany from Peru's Amazon rainforest. Kebony is targeting decking manufacturers and boat builders as potential clients of its modified sustainable wood. In reality, it was manufactured in Norway, in a five-day process that instills all the qualities of rare, tropical hardwood into sustainable softwood. The company that makes it, Kebony, says it comes with none of the environmental cost. ""This is a mega turn, people have to act,"" Kebony CEO Christian Jebsen told CNN. ""We have a green solution for the tropical wood market and we are there to take that market or at least be part of it.""  Christian Jebsen talks to CNN » . The global market for wood products from tropical forests is estimated to be worth some $20 billion each year, according to the International Tropical Timber Organization. Most of the wood on the world market now comes from Southeast Asia and Africa, according to the Rainforest Foundation Norway. Tighter controls on logging in Brazil have reduced the amount of hardwood being shipped out of the Amazon, once a popular source for the finest quality mahogany, teak and cedar. ""Each tree is worth maybe $25,000-$40,000 on the international market. And there are lots of trees being taken out [worldwide] -- so this is a large business, a huge business,"" said Lars Løvold, director of the Rainforest Foundation Norway. The United Nations estimates some 13 million hectares of forest are lost worldwide each year, equivalent to an area the size of Greece or Nicaragua. Their absence is said to contribute more carbon emissions each year than the global transport sector. Demand for luxury hardwood is by no means the main cause of deforestation. Clearing land for agriculture and the collection of wood for fuel are the main drivers, but Løvold said the lucrative market for hardwood provides a compelling incentive for loggers to move into previously untouched areas. ""Almost all deforestation starts with the logging,"" Løvold told CNN. ""The logging doesn't necessarily end up in the total clearance of an area, it just opens up the area, it takes out all the valuable trees and makes it much easier."" Kebony's move into the global wood market follows more than a decade of research started in the late 1990s by Canadian scientist Marc Schneider of the University of New Brunswick. Rigorous testing took place before the first trial production in 2004. Strong demand for the product convinced the company to build a new plant with ten times the production capacity, which opened in January. ""What we are doing with our technology is to permanently transform the wood so it doesn't change. Our process is 100 percent environmentally friendly,"" Jebsen told CNN. The process involves injecting softwood with a patented formula which includes Furfuryl alcohol, a waste by-product of sugar cane production. The wood is then subjected to pressure, heated and dried before being cured at high temperatures to create a product that the company says is stronger, more stable than untreated softwood and weather-proof. Kebony's environmental credentials have been endorsed with the receipt of the Nordic region's eco-label, the Swan. It's also received Norway's national environmental prize, the ""Glass Bear."" On a cost basis, the company says it can compete with the price of authentic teak on the European market. ""You can buy a cubic meter of teak in Europe for anything between 3,000 euros ($4,000) up to 10,000 euros ($14,000), depending on the quality. I would say we are competitive with that,"" Jebsen said. Kebony is ""slightly more expensive"" when compared to pressure-treated wood, but it doesn't contain any of the potentially harmful metals or pesticides that are commonly used to improve the wood's durability. Jebsen sees some of the company's best opportunities in the boat-building industry, where rare teak from Myanmar is being used at the luxury end of the market. ""We believe multiple boat manufacturers will start to use Kebony very soon -- some have already started,"" he said. The company is also planning a move into the U.S. decking market where it's scouting for clients and recruiting distributors. ""The U.S. decking market, which is using toxic impregnated, metal-based wood modification methods, together with tropical wood, is [worth] about five billion dollars, so the market is obviously enormous,"" Jebsen said.","Norwegian company has developed eco-friendly way to simulate hardwood .
Kebony uses sustainable wood including maple, pine and beech .
Wood is treated to give it the same look, performance as tropical hardwood .
Product widely used in Norway, now the company is expanding internationally ."
"(CNN) -- What is it about Woodstock? Jimi Hendrix closed the Woodstock festival on Monday morning, August 18, 1969. The 1967 Monterey Pop Festival was arguably more influential and, like Woodstock, spawned a terrific film, D.A. Pennebaker's ""Monterey Pop."" The 1969 Isle of Wight Festival in England, two weeks after Woodstock, included the elusive Bob Dylan. And there were several other gatherings during the late-'60s and early-'70s festival frenzy, including the ill-fated Altamont festival in 1969 and the record-setting Watkins Glen festival in 1973. But nobody talked about a ""Monterey Nation"" or a ""Wight Nation"" or, God forbid, an ""Altamont Nation."" No other festival prompted Charles M. Schulz to name a ""Peanuts"" character after it. No other festival has maintained a viable name for four decades. And no other festival is still so present in the public and media consciousness. With Woodstock's 40th anniversary Saturday comes a plethora of releases, including CDs, DVDs, a VH1 documentary airing Friday, the new movie ""Taking Woodstock"" and several books.  Watch Woodstock co-founder Michael Lang talk about the festival » . ""There's a quality to Woodstock that has to do with the ... hugeness of it,"" said festival co-founder Joel Rosenman. ""We seem to remember that it involved the whole generation."" LIFE.com gallery: Chaos, nudity, spirit . Many members of that generation, he added, weren't aware there were so many others like themselves. ""They had ... been reading in the establishment media they were a splinter here and a fragment there,"" he said. ""And all of a sudden, they get to Woodstock ... and saw the entire world as [they] knew it was on [their] side instead of the side you thought it was on. ... It was pretty heady stuff."" iReport: Memories of Woodstock . By now, the basics of Woodstock have passed into legend. How four men -- Rosenman, his business partner John Roberts, entrepreneur Michael Lang and record executive Artie Kornfeld -- wanted to put on a concert for the counterculture. How their site choices fell through. How Max Yasgur rented his dairy farm with a month to go. How the event drew half a million people, more than twice what had been expected. How it caused a huge traffic jam. How it became a free concert. How it rained. And how everyone -- concertgoers and security, musicians and authorities, visitors and residents -- got along and made the most of the three days with minimal violence and lots of joy.  Watch why Woodstock made a difference » . As a resident of the Woodstock Nation might say, the vibes were good. But that doesn't explain how the event gave way to the myth. Elliott Landy, a photographer best known for his ""Music from Big Pink"" and ""Nashville Skyline"" portraits of The Band and Bob Dylan, respectively, believes part of Woodstock's aura came from its isolation. ""In the full Woodstock experience, you were cut off from the rest of ... everyday life,"" he said. ""It was kind of a magic land."" Rock critic Dave Marsh, who said he was offered a ticket but didn't go, puts it succinctly: ""Woodstock was an accident. God liked that one."" But Woodstock was also at the nexus of so many swirling currents of the '60s: the generation gap, the antiwar movement, the evolution of rock music, the growth of the youth culture. One person in Barbara Kopple's VH1 documentary said, with still-discernable anger, ""They [the establishment] were trying to kill us,"" and he wasn't kidding; the draft was ever-present, with the threat of Vietnam hanging over many heads. Music was just as divisive. Unlike today, when underground acts quickly become mainstream through word-of-Internet, the underground in 1969 was truly underground. Only the most popular rock acts appeared on prime time television, and a 1966 Harris poll reported a plurality of people over 21 disliked rock 'n' roll. ""Longhair"" and ""hippie"" weren't descriptions; they were epithets. Woodstock gave the baby boomers a rallying point. If the special editions of magazines trumpeting its success weren't enough, the movie and the soundtrack album were huge hits upon their 1970 release, bringing elements of the Woodstock experience to millions. Santana drummer Michael Shrieve, whose drum solo during the band's ""Soul Sacrifice"" became an indelible Woodstock moment, remembers how fame caught him by surprise. He was waiting in line to see ""Woodstock"" with other band members. As the previous show let out, ""We noticed that people were looking at us and pointing at us, and we didn't know what was going on."" The band found out soon enough: On a tour of Europe, Shrieve stopped at a newsstand to pick up a magazine, and he was on the cover. ""I realized this was taking off,"" he said. Though much is made of the Woodstock spirit -- the camaraderie, the cooperation through the rain and the mud and the traffic -- not everybody bought into it. The Who's Pete Townshend has often criticized Woodstock, disparaging The Who's performance and calling the audience ""a bunch of hypocrites""; he later plowed his Woodstock-era alienation into such songs as ""Won't Get Fooled Again."" (Townshend has also acknowledged that the Woodstock gig was ""important."") Marsh, who wrote a recent cover story on Woodstock for Relix magazine, admires the festival's optimism but not many of its realities: the poor sanitation, the hype, the idea that getting away from society was going to solve its problems. ""We were ambitious as people, and our ambition was to create a beautiful new society. ... And this seemed like a step on the road to a lot of people,"" he said. ""I never bought the thing that the artificial wilderness was a solution to our social problems. ... I think a lot of people thought if you got stoned and bonded together with a bunch of people to whom on Monday you didn't feel bonded at all, that that was a step on the journey."" For all of the good will Woodstock created, it's also blamed for what it didn't do. The war didn't end. Altamont, the hope for a West Coast Woodstock, culminated in an audience member's slaying. And members of the ""Woodstock Nation"" went their separate ways. Woodstock also was the beginning of a new era in the music business -- it became a ""music industry,"" Woodstock co-founder Lang noted. Producer-engineer Eddie Kramer, a Jimi Hendrix colleague who recorded the festival, agreed the music world changed after Woodstock. ""You have to realize that, in 1969, agents and managers were in the background,"" he said. ""And the musicians weren't really competing with each other. They were friendly to each other and were eager to help."" As much as ""getting back to the garden,"" in Joni Mitchell's words, Woodstock now also symbolizes baby boomer nostalgia. Among the related products and events are a 6-CD box set (Rhino); an ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" DVD reissue of director Michael Wadleigh's Oscar-winning documentary (Warner Home Video); the new Ang Lee film ""Taking Woodstock""; ""Woodstock Experience"" remastered CDs of complete live sets by such performers as Santana and Janis Joplin (Sony/Legacy); Friday's VH1 documentary by Oscar-winning filmmaker Barbara Kopple; a tour by the ""Heroes of Woodstock""; an anniversary concert at the Woodstock site in Bethel, New York; and several books, including works by Lang and Landy. That's a lot to pile on to what was, at its heart, a music festival, and perhaps people have expected too much from Woodstock. Just a year after the event, critic J.R. Young reviewed the soundtrack in Rolling Stone and gave voice to the disappointment and cynicism. ""That's why there will never really be a Woodstock Nation,"" said a character in the review, which was written as a short story. ""You won't let anybody live on your land."" And yet ""Woodstock"" remains a magic word -- one that, finally, refuses to reveal its secrets. Woodstock co-founder Rosenman ends up reaching for the elation of Keats' poem ""On First Looking into Chapman's Homer"" -- ""Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/ When a new planet swims into his ken"" -- when trying to describe the festival's thrill. But he stops short of adding up the details. It was the people, he said, who made Woodstock. ""That half a million-strong audience created something -- they created a legend,"" he said. ""I actually don't think it's possible to do the making of that legend and explain it to the satisfaction of almost anybody. I think you'd still come away wondering, 'What the heck made that happen?' "" And Shrieve, who's long since come to terms with being known as ""the guy who did the drum solo at Woodstock,"" is equally philosophical about how the festival is portrayed. ""It's interesting to observe history from the viewpoint of having been there. It also gives you some insight into everything else,"" he said. ""I mean, any historical moment, there are people that are there and people who are not there. And when it grows into something that becomes more mythological, you see people telling the story of how it happened, and you go, 'Wait a minute! That's not what happened!'

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is not often that football players are actively encouraged to play dirty -- unless of course they are taking part in a unique variant of the game called ""Swamp Soccer"" when it is virtually unavoidable. The competition is fierce in the 2009 Swamp Soccer World Championship held in Scotland . Originating from the bogs of Finland, the game was started by cross-country skiers who used the football matches in knee-deep mud to strengthen their leg muscles.  The first tournament took place in 1997 with 13 teams, but now annual events take place in Sweden, Iceland, Russia and Brazil which can often feature over 200 teams.  What do you think of Swamp Soccer? Do you prefer Beach Football of another form of the game? Let us know your thoughts on the 'Sound off' box below. Glasgow Rangers fan Stewart Miller imported the concept to the United Kingdom after a chance meeting with founder Jyrki Vaananen while on a business trip to Iceland. Miller launched the first UK tournament in 2005 and now teams travel from all over the globe to the Scottish village of Strachur to try and become the annual Swamp Soccer World Champions.  Watch the action from the bog ». ""We had teams coming from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand to take part in the tournament this year so there is an international flavor to the event,"" Miller told CNN. ""There is a huge appetite to try out new things and I think that's why Swamp Soccer is able to capture the imagination of people. ""The basic rules of football also apply to Swamp Soccer with the exception that matches are played in thick mud with six players on an oversized five-a-side pitch. ""It's probably one of the only sports in the world where the worse the conditions are the better the sporting spectacle!"" There is no offside in Swamp Soccer while kick-offs, throw-ins, corner kicks, free kicks and penalties are taken by using the hands to drop the ball onto a chosen foot. Teams are also allowed to make unlimited substitutions although no shoe changing is allowed for the match duration. Miller believes that the oft-used quote that the state of a pitch can bridge the gap between two unevenly match teams is even more applicable with Swamp Soccer. ""You could put the Brazilian national side up against an amateur team and you wouldn't know who would come out on top -- the pitch really does prove to be a leveler in this instance,"" he said. ""Although professional footballers are precious commodities these days -- I'm not sure we'll see any stars getting caked in mud too soon, most of them are far to pampered for that. ""Nobody's ever been injured seriously playing in the swamp, sometimes somebody's got a cut or two but nothing big -- so maybe when they retire from the game they might be prepared to give it a go."" The imaginatively titled Real Mudrid, Mudchesthair United and Cowdungbeath were unable to make it past the group stages in the 44-team event which was won by FC Full Gunge from Poole in England who retained their title with a 1-0 victory over The Chocolate Men. This year's Swamp Soccer tournament was held in a village in the Scottish countryside but Miller revealed that he intends to bring the mud game to metropolitan areas. He added: ""The future for Swamp Soccer is in the city and of course I'm certain we'll bring all the mud with us. It will certainly make a great spectacle if set up a swamp in the middle of Glasgow or Edinburgh, so watch this space.""

"(CNN) -- Cheryl Morse was 19 years old when she hitchhiked more than 700 miles from Chicago, Illinois, to Bethel, New York. She was determined to make it to the Woodstock music festival. An estimated 400,000 people attended the Woodstock music festival in Bethel, New York, in August 1969. Although Morse, now 59, no longer recalls details such as how long it took to get there or what food, if any, she ate, she still vividly remembers the music. When Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young opened their set with ""Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,"" she said the energy in the crowd was intoxicating. And she can still picture folk musicians Arlo Guthrie and Joan Baez performing in the rain Friday night. ""It was like being totally shut off from the rest of the world for three days, with nonstop music by world-class musicians playing their hearts out ... for our party,"" she said. Forty years later, the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair remains a major cultural touchstone. Held in Bethel on August 15, 16 and 17, 1969, the music festival welcomed some of the biggest musicians of the era and legions of fans from across the United States. Despite the concert's size -- an estimated 400,000 people attended the festival -- it seems the idea of Woodstock is bigger than the actual event was. It is remembered as a peace- and love-filled celebration, an out-of-this-world experience fueled by rock 'n' roll music and copious drugs.  See Woodstock 40 years ago, and what the site looks like today » . Like many others, it wasn't until Morse left the festival grounds and re-entered the outside world that she began to realize Woodstock's impact. She stopped at a local market on her way out of town and saw news coverage of the festival on television. ""Until [then], I had not thought about the outside world at all,"" Morse said. ""That was when I slowly began to comprehend the impact the gathering was having on the country."" Woodstock, Morse explained, ""came at a pivotal point in history,"" when the Vietnam War and subsequent anti-war movement were in full swing. The festival, a massive event that was largely peaceful and free of riots, was considered exceptional for the time. Years later, Morse realized that Woodstock ""would never be forgotten,"" she said. ""It took you 10 years to realize you were part of history,"" said Lenny Eisenberg, who made the journey to Bethel to see Jimi Hendrix perform. ""At the time, it was just another great show."" Part of the concert's lasting power was fueled by the Oscar-winning documentary ""Woodstock,"" which also led to a blurred perception of the festival, Eisenberg said. ""I have some distorted ideas of what happened,"" he said. Still, Eisenberg recalls Hendrix's performance that famously closed the festival on Monday morning. The aspiring photographer saved one of the three rolls of film he brought with him to document the guitarist's set. The wait was worth it, he said. Eisenberg captured several shots of Hendrix, including one of the guitarist with his middle finger in the air, seconds after he flashed a peace sign to the audience. iReport.com: See Eisenberg's photos . ""It's really hard to pin down a best memory,"" said Thomas Burke, who was 19 years old when he went to Woodstock. ""The whole place was a memory."" Burke still has his Woodstock tickets along with the check his mother wrote for them. His memories from the event are fond, but fuzzy. ""I remember some of the acts, but not the order or where I was when they played,"" he said. He recalls seeing Richie Havens and Jefferson Airplane, and can't forget Hendrix's legendary performance of ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" ""Woodstock marked a big turning point in my life,"" said Burke, who was drafted into the Army soon after returning home from the festival. ""It was a fitting end to the '60s."" ""It was the experience of a lifetime. I've always been proud of the fact that I was there,"" said Ralph Chin. He remembers the rain and mud, nonstop music, free-flowing drugs and conversations with strangers. For Chin, nothing can recapture Woodstock. ""I went to a couple other festivals after Woodstock, but they fell short on the overall feeling,"" he said. iReport.com: 'The experience of a lifetime' ""Woodstock was like a big party with all your friends there, whereas the festivals afterward felt more like you were an independent entity and had no connections to anyone else."" ""I think it was the ultimate spontaneous thing. It just happened,"" said John Laferlita, a photographer who attended Woodstock at 23. Laferlita heard about the festival on the radio and thought, ""Why not?"" He hopped on a bus from Manhattan, New York, on Saturday, with little more than his camera and tickets. Like many others, he slept on the ground that night. ""There hasn't been anything like it,"" added Laferlita. ""Everything else is planned to the minute, but this was spontaneous. That's what made it so special.""","As Woodstock celebrates 40 years, the music festival still looms large .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Officials in Mexico's Chiapas state postponed classes Friday for more than 1 million students in an effort to avoid a resurgence of H1N1 flu, which has sickened thousands throughout Mexico this year. After the first confirmed swine flu reports in April, Mexico shut down all of its schools and many public venues. Chiapas Education Secretary Javier Alvarez Ramos and state Health Secretary James Gomez Montes said classes will start August 31 for middle and high school students and September 7 for elementary pupils, the state-run Notimex news agency said. About 1.55 million students will be affected, 850,000 of them in elementary school, Notimex said. This is not the first instance of officials in Mexico altering schedules to combat the disease. The first cases of H1N1, also called swine flu, were confirmed in Mexico in April. Within days, the government closed all schools and most public venues. In Mexico City, officials shut down all bars, theaters and public gathering places and limited restaurants to take-out orders. About 35,000 businesses were affected. All non-essential federal government offices also were closed nationwide for several days. The World Health Organization declared a global pandemic in early June. As of August 6, the WHO reported more than 177,450 confirmed cases in 170 nations. The Western Hemisphere has the most cases, with nearly 103,000 confirmed instances of the disease and almost 1,300 deaths. The WHO is no longer providing a country-by-country breakdown, but the United States, Argentina and Mexico have had the most cases and fatalities. In the United States, federal officials released new guidelines this month for containing the spread of the virus across the nation's school system. Government officials have warned of a possible resurgence in the H1N1 virus this fall. Among other things, health officials urged local administrators to exercise caution and restraint when deciding whether to close a school in response to an outbreak, noting that the costs of shutting down institutions often outweigh the benefits. Officials also confirmed that a new vaccine to combat the virus is likely to be ready by October. The revised federal guidelines advise parents to keep children infected with the H1N1 virus out of school for 24 hours after the fever has gone away. Parents were previously advised to keep their children out of school for seven days after the end of a fever caused by H1N1. The virus has spread around the world with unprecedented speed, according to the WHO. Past influenza viruses have needed more than six months to spread as widely as the current H1N1 virus spread in less than six weeks, the WHO said.","Officials in Chiapas delay school in effort to avoid flu resurgence .

"(CNN) -- Preakness Stakes favorite Rachel Alexandra lived up to her billing Saturday, thundering past an all-male field of competitors and becoming the first filly to win the Triple-Crown's second jewel since 1924. Saturday's victory for Rachel Alexandra, who raced from the 13th and furthest stall, was the filly's fifth straight win. ""She's the greatest horse I've ever been on in my life,"" jockey Calvin Borel said after the race. ""She did not handle the track 110 percent and still won."" Long-shot Kentucky Derby winner Mine That Bird fell short in his improbable bid to compete for horse-racing's Triple Crown, but showed his Derby victory was no fluke -- charging hard to finish second. Musket Man finished third. Rachel Alexandra's win was historic for multiple reasons and capped a run of five straight victories that included a blowout of the field in the all-filly Kentucky Oaks. She became the first horse to win from the race's 13th stall -- the furthest from the inside of the track.

"(CNN) -- Three women who were seized along with six other foreign workers in Yemen have been killed, Yemeni government officials said Monday. South Korean officials discuss the kidnappings Monday. A South Korean woman reportedly was killed. ""It is with profound sorrow that the Yemeni government reports finding three bodies,"" according to a statement from Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for Yemen's Embassy in the United States. The statement said the dead were identified as a South Korean teacher and two German nurses in training, all in their 20s. They were found in the Noshour Valley in Safrah district in the province of Saada. The women were abducted Sunday along with five other Germans, including three children, and a Briton, according to Yemen's state-run SABA news agency. Earlier, the Yemen Post said seven of the nine hostages were killed, citing the country's interior ministry. But SABA reported later Monday the remaining six were believed to be alive, and security forces were searching for them . Albasha said the nine foreigners left the city of Saada without police escorts that are required due to the ""heightened security situation"" in the area. ""This event was a heinous crime and constitutes not only a violation against the peaceful principles of Islam, but also the precepts of humanity,"" the embassy spokesman said. ""Moreover, it does not reflect the good traditions and culture of Yemen."" The Germany Foreign Ministry said it is in close contact with the German Embassy in Yemen but couldn't confirm any details at this stage. Initial official statements said the group was apparently seized by Houthi rebels, Shiite militants who have been fighting the government for years, according to SABA. The militants are hoping to derail the peace and reconstruction process in Saada, which has been rocked by war in the past year, according to SABA. However, the news agency later reported Houthi rebels accused drug cartels of abducting the group and killing the three. In addition, SABA said a spokesman for the rebels accused regional tribes of being behind the kidnappings and slayings. Sunday's abduction was the latest in a string of kidnappings of foreign workers in Yemen this year. All the previous hostages had been released unharmed, including 24 medical workers whom armed tribesman seized last week in Yemen's Amran province. CNN's Caroline Faraj, Diana Magnay and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","South Korean teacher, two German nurses in training found dead, Yemen says .

"(CNN) -- Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was absent again Tuesday from his Senate impeachment trial, but state senators who will decide whether to remove him from office heard him loud and clear on FBI recordings of his phone calls. Gov. Rod Blagojevich talks to CNN's Campbell Brown Tuesday night about his impeachment trial. Only four snippets of conversations were played for senators in the second day of the impeachment trial, and all pertained to horse-racing legislation. Prosecutors said the brief recordings focused on the governor's efforts to apparently raise campaign contributions in exchange for signing a horse-racing bill. In one recording from December 3, a lobbyist assures the governor that a race-track owner has pledged his ""commitment."" ""He goes, 'I hope I'm gonna have it next week, but you have my commitment. I've always been there. I'm gonna be there,' "" the lobbyist told Blagojevich of the race track owner. None of the recordings mentions money specifically. Meanwhile, Blagojevich continued an ambitious media blitz, appearing in interviews with CBS, CNN, Fox and The Associated Press. A day earlier, he appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and ""The View.""  Watch Blagojevich on ""Larry King Live"" » . ""I hate all of this,"" Blagojevich told CNN's Campbell Brown in an interview Tuesday. ""This is a life-changing thing.

And that is I did nothing wrong and I'd like an opportunity to prove it."" The governor has railed against state Senate rules that restrict the calling of some witnesses and the presentation of some evidence. State Sen. Matt Murphy, part of the nine-member committee that put the Senate trial rules together, has said U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald asked both sides to ""defer to the criminal prosecution"" of Blagojevich and ""limit witnesses."" The House prosecution in the Senate trial is operating under the same restrictions, he said. Senators also heard testimony Tuesday from FBI Special Agent Daniel Cain, author of a 76-page affidavit released in December, when the governor was arrested on federal corruption charges.  Watch proceedings from Tuesday's trial » . Among other allegations, federal prosecutors said the governor tried to trade or sell the Senate seat that would become vacant after Barack Obama became president. Cain testified about transcripts of federal tapes in the affidavit, mostly replying in the affirmative when House prosecutor David Ellis asked whether the portions of the affidavit were accurate. ""In the end, we were very confident that it was the governor's voice in those conversations,"" Cain told House prosecutor David Ellis. Cain said FBI agents repeatedly listened to the governor's recorded conversations to make sure they were accurate. ""Agents would listen to the recordings repeatedly as many times as necessary to verify the accuracy and quote,"" he said. Later, as senators tried to ask Cain about the recordings, a representative from the U.S. attorney's office was on hand to block some answers. After Blagojevich's arrest, the state House impeached the two-term Democratic governor in two votes, with only one dissenting vote each time. The second vote was needed because of the seating of a new House. Blagojevich has said the House impeachment vote was politically motivated.","State senators heard recorded phone calls about horse-racing legislation .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Defying many predictions, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held a commanding lead in the presidential vote count early Saturday, election officials with Iran's Interior Ministry said. Men choose their candidates before voting Friday at a mosque in Tehran, Iran. With 72 percent of ballot boxes counted, Ahmedinejad had 65.7 percent of the vote while his chief rival Mir Hossein Moussavi had 31.4 percent, election officials said. Moussavi, widely regarded as a reformist, had been expected to do well as his campaign caught fire in recent days, triggering massive street rallies in Tehran. An ""unprecedented"" voter turnout at the polls Friday was also expected to boost Moussavi's chances of winning the presidency. Iran's Interior Minister Seyed Sadeq Mahsouli said 70 percent of 46 million eligible voters had gone to the polls Friday, according to Fars, another semi-official news agency. Both candidates claimed victory. Moussavi's camp accused the Iranian establishment of manipulating the vote.  Watch why each side is claiming victory » . Voting was supposed to end after 10 hours, but because of the massive turnout, officials initially said polling stations would remain open until everyone in line had a chance to vote. However, Moussavi alleged that doors were being closed with people still waiting outside. Some private news agencies reported many Iranians were milling about on the streets late into the night. Mehr reported that the chief of police declared public gatherings of candidate supporters illegal. Earlier in the day, voters crowded the steps of one polling place in Tehran, some waiting more than three hours underneath the hot sun to cast their ballots. Some were lining up even before the polls opened at 8 a.m. Moussavi is the main challenger among three candidates vying to replace Ahmadinejad. The other candidates are former parliament speaker and reformist Mehdi Karrubi, and Mohsen Rezaie, the former head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Mehr reported Rezaie had 1.72 percent of the vote and Karrubi had 0.87 percent. If no single candidate reaches a simple majority -- 50 percent plus one vote -- a runoff election will be held on Friday, June 19. It was unclear where the ballots that had been counted so far had been cast. Ahmadinejad still has staunch support in Iran's rural areas, but has been blamed for much of Iran's economic turmoil over the last four years. If he loses, it would be the first time a sitting Iranian president has not won re-election to a second term in office. Fawaz Gerges, an academic and author who studies the region, said Friday's vote is really ""a referendum on Ahmadinejad,"" who has been in office since 2005. ""The unemployment rate is 30 percent ... the largest in the third world, inflation is [in the] double digits in Iran,"" Gerges told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""We focus in the United States a great deal on his inflammatory rhetoric on the Holocaust, on nuclear weapons. We tend to forget that Ahmadinejad has basically done a great deal of damage to the Iranian economy, on social policy."" While Moussavi's campaign has energized key segments of Iranian voters -- particularly women -- Gerges noted that ""Iranians have surprised us many times."" Moussavi's supporters crowded the streets of Tehran this week, wearing the candidate's trademark color green. His campaign has also energized Iran's youth, many of whom did not take part in the 2005 election. Yasmin, a 21-year-old university student, said she cast her ballot on Friday for Moussavi.  CNN's Christiane Amanpour reports emotions on the street » . ""I've never even been interested in the politics of my country until today. It was my first time voting, and I am so excited about it,"" she said. ""We are all yearning for change, and I believe Moussavi will bring much more freedom to Iran and our lives. That is why I cast my ballot for him. There is so much anticipation in the air."" Moussavi's supporters hope that he follows in the same footsteps as Mohammed Khatami, a reformist candidate who overwhelmingly won the presidency in 1997, raising hopes that the reformist movement would bring religious and democratic freedoms to the Islamic republic. But the real power in Iran rests in the hands of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. By the time Khatami left office in 2005, he was unable to make major changes because of the opposition of hard-line elements in Iran's clerical establishment. ""The elected president is not the commander in chief, he does not make decisions of war and peace,"" Gerges noted. ""The major decision maker [in Iran] is the unelected supreme leader, that is Ali Khamenei, along with a National Security Council."" But Gerges noted that the ""the style of the president"" and his ""posture"" have a great deal of influence on Iran's relations with other countries, particularly the United States.  Watch CNN review the unprecedented online presence of candidates » . No matter who wins Friday's vote, analysts say it is unlikely any of the candidates would change Iran's position on its nuclear program, which the Islamic republic insists is for civilian purposes but the United States and other Western powers believe may be a cover for a weapons program. Iranian-American analyst and scholar Reza Aslan said that while Moussavi is ""a little bit more of a moderate when it comes to the nuclear issue ... all four candidates agreement with Iran's right to develop nuclear."" Nevertheless, Aslan said that all four candidates also ""recognize it's time to open up to America and to the international community because there's no other option with regard to the economy.""

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- When powerlifting coach Nicola Vaughan-Ellis wanted to create a winning formula for her athletes, she didn't head to the weight room. Instead, she found herself in the classroom. Coach Nicola Vaughan-Ellis with athletes from Great Britain's powerlifting team. Head coach of Great Britain's powerlifting squad, Vaughan-Ellis  participated in a course that's designed to boost the leadership and management skills of coaches. Vaughan-Ellis's responsibilities run the gamut from identifying up-and-coming talent to developing training programs. She had friends who were corporate performance directors, and realizing the skills they had were applicable to her own line of work, she decided to pursue a professional development course designed for coaches. ""We expect athletes to be the best they can be. Our responsibility as coaches is to be the best we can be,"" Vaughan-Ellis told CNN. In pursuit of becoming better managers and leaders, players in the business world have long turned to executive education programs. Elite coaches are taking a cue from business and turning to tailored programs too. In the run up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the desire to develop high caliber coaches is ramping up in the UK, said John Neal of Ashridge Business School, where Vaughan-Ellis took the coaching course. ""A lot of coach development work [in the UK] is ad hoc. It's becoming more clearly defined, but our vision is to establish a more development pathway for coaches,"" he told CNN. Vaughan-Ellis trains about 20 powerlifters as part of a program that was established to prepare athletes in Great Britain for major competitive events like the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. Nutritionists, psychologists, fitness coaches and sports scientists are all focused on a goal of helping athletes achieve a performance edge, she says. But coaches also need to make sure they make the best decisions for their athletes. That requires a broad range of skills, from understanding the athlete experience and identifying particular challenges they may encounter as well as having a firm understanding of where funding comes from and making sure it's spent wisely . ""We prepare our athletes to be the best in the world. But we also have to make sure that we are making the best choices for them,"" she said. Ashridge, which specializes in customized education programs, has been running sport coaching courses since 2001. Its core World Class Sport Coach Development program is endorsed by the British Olympic Association. The course is made up of 10 one-day master classes that are spread out over a period of about 10 months. In a typical meeting, coaches are given scenarios, break up into groups for discussion and then present their responses to the class. The program is flexible so coaches can focus on the skills they want to improve. A wide range of topics are covered, from communication, negotiation and team building skills to body language, motivation and development of young players. Neal estimates that about 160 coaches have completed the coaching program since it was launched. Most participants are UK-based, but coaches come from around the world and represent a long list of sports that includes diving, swimming, rugby, hockey, shooting and cricket. Coaches have few opportunities to share their knowledge. According to Neal, that's one reason why the course has been popular. One measure of its success: Many coaches, like Vaughan-Ellis, participate more than once. Due to a lack of funding, however, coaches oftentimes end up paying for the course themselves. Ashridge heavily subsidizes the program and charges £2,000, just about a quarter of what it actually costs to run it. But in return, the business school gets a unique perspective on decision making that is fed back into its executive education programs, Neal said. Elite coaches have a lot to offer companies, especially in the current economic downturn, Neal said. More businesses are under pressure to maximize efficiency, and many want to learn from the sport experience, since coaches are required to achieve results quickly. With 2012 less than three years away, Vaughan-Ellis is planning to return to Ashridge for a refresher. She says one of the advantages of the program is that it helps coaches deal with pressure by teaching them how to cope with and embrace change. That's an invaluable skill in athletics. ""Sport is change,"" she said. ""You're only as good as your last competition or as strong as your weakest link. You have to move forward and constantly evolve.""","With 2012 Games approaching, focus on coach development on the rise in UK .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday lifted sanctions placed on the Navy over its underwater sonar testing, a setback for environmental groups that claimed the warfare technology was harming whales and other marine mammals. An endangered blue whale surfaces off the coast of Southern California in July. At issue in the 5-4 ruling was whether the Navy's need to conduct exercises to protect the country from enemy submarines outweighed concerns raised by environmental groups. The case focused on whether the president had the power to issue executive waivers allowing such tests and whether federal judges can issue preliminary injunctions blocking them. The high court ultimately sided with claims of national security over environmental concerns. Those environmental interests, said Chief Justice John Roberts for the majority, ""are plainly outweighed by the Navy's need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines."" Roberts said a lower federal court ""abused its discretion"" by imposing a 2,200-yard perimeter for testing and ordering a shutdown of sonar use during surfacing exercises. But in dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned that the ecological damage was significant. ""This likely harm cannot be lightly dismissed,"" she said, ""even in the face of an alleged risk to the effectiveness of the Navy's 14 training exercises."" Justices David Souter, Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens also questioned the Navy's arguments. The exercises have continued while the case was under appeal. Environmentalists had sued the Pentagon over the practice, and a federal judge ordered major changes to the Navy's annual offshore training exercises in March. President Bush had issued an emergency waiver to allow the exercises to go on without the filing of an environmental impact study, but the lower court ruling blocked the use of sonar. That federal judge, in ruling against the government last March, said it was ""constitutionally suspect"" for Bush to issue the national security exemption to allow skipping the impact study. Military officials argued that the restrictions could hamper readiness in time of war, because new sonar technology is needed to detect increasingly sophisticated enemy submarines. ""This case was vital to our Navy and nation's security, and we are pleased with the Supreme Court's decision in this matter,"" Navy Secretary Donald Winter said. ""We can now continue to train our sailors effectively, under realistic combat conditions."" One of the environmental organizations that sued the Defense Department told the justices that the exercises had been planned in advance and that the Navy was required under law to conduct more extensive environmental tests than it had. The waters of southern California are home to dozens of species of whales, dolphins, seals and sea lions, nine of them federally listed as endangered or threatened. Federal courts have cited scientific studies and the Navy's own conclusions that high levels of sonar can cause hearing loss and disorientation in the animals. In February, the U.S. Navy demonstrated for CNN its onboard procedures for turning down mid-frequency sonar when whales come within 1,000 meters and shutting it off completely when they approach 200 meters. The sonar sounds like a ""ping, ping"" noise, and it can be reduced as necessary, officers said. But environmentalists say that the sonar can hurt whales much farther than 1,000 meters away and that the noise created by the sonar ""was like having a jet engine in the Supreme Court multiplied 2,000 times, compensating for water,"" attorney Richard Kendall told the justices. Reacting to the ruling, Kendall said, ""It is gratifying that the court did not accept the Navy's expansive claims of executive power and that two-thirds of the injunction remain in place."" In 2000, 16 whales beached themselves in the Bahamas, and the Navy concluded that too many sonar ships had been operating in a narrow underwater channel. The service says it is funding $16 million in independent research to minimize sonar's effect on marine mammals.","NEW: Navy secretary says ruling allows sailors to train under ""realistic"" conditions .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a new medal Wednesday to honor the families of British service personnel killed while serving their country. The Elizabeth Cross may be given to family members of service personnel who have died since 1948. The Elizabeth Cross will be given to the next of kin of armed forces personnel killed on operations or as a result of terrorism ""as a mark of national recognition for their loss,"" the Defense Ministry said. It is the first time the name of a reigning monarch has been given to a new award since the queen's father, King George VI, instituted the George Cross in 1940. That medal recognizes acts of bravery of both civilians and military personnel. The most prestigious medal, the Victoria Cross, was introduced by Queen Victoria in 1856 for acts of gallantry by the armed forces. ""This seems to me a right and proper way of showing our enduring debt to those who are killed while actively protecting what is most dear to us all,"" the queen said in a message to the armed forces. ""The solemn dignity which we attach to the names of those who have fallen is deeply ingrained in our national character. As a people, we accord this ultimate sacrifice the highest honor and respect."" The Elizabeth Cross is a sterling silver emblem in the shape of a cross over a wreath. In the center is the queen's monogram, EIIR, which stands for Elizabeth II Regina, or Queen Elizabeth II. At each of the four tips of the cross are floral symbols: a rose for England, a thistle for Scotland, a shamrock for Northern Ireland, and a daffodil for Wales. The reverse of the cross will be engraved with the name of the person who died. The name will also be written on a scroll signed by the queen, to be given to family members along with the medal, the Defense Ministry said. The award may be given to family members of all service personnel who have died since 1948. Charles Mosely, the former editor in chief of Debrett's, an authority on etiquette, said the Elizabeth Cross is a good way to recognize the sacrifice made by members of the military and their families. ""It seems very praiseworthy and very overdue,"" he said. It makes sense for the medal to be named after the reigning monarch, he said, because she is head of the armed forces. ""They have personal allegiance to the sovereign, a personal loyalty,"" he said.","Elizabeth Cross for next of kin of armed forces personnel killed on operations .

"(CNN) -- Achtung, baby! Sacha Baron Cohen stars as a flamboyant Austrian fashionista in ""Bruno."" There's a British theory that everything sounds funnier delivered with a Teutonic accent. That's tested to the limit in Sacha Baron Cohen's newest provocation, ""Bruno,"" but it's not what comes out of his mouth that makes the Austrian fashionista such a handful. The man in the tight yellow lederhosen knows that in our visually overstimulated culture, a picture is vorth a thousand vords. More if there's significant skin involved -- and he's happy to show us his wurst. Cohen seems to believe that prudery is the enemy. Certainly, bad taste is his Trojan horse. An early montage of romantic coupling, Bruno-style, is enough to get tongues wagging -- or clucking in disapproval. It's the closest thing to gay porn most heterosexuals will see this side of ""300."" Either way, Cohen's laughing: Properly managed, outrage is a useful marketing tool, as ""Borat"" showed. Apparently permanently airbrushed right down to his backside, Bruno looks nothing like his hirsute Kazakh cousin, but the men share an ego; they're equally insensitive to other people and oblivious to notions of social decorum and the politically correct. And they both invest heavily in the American Dream. Bruno hungers after fame as hungrily as Borat lusted for Pamela Anderson. After a brief prologue in Europe -- and the distressing revelation of the vacuity of the fashion scene -- he sets out for Los Angeles, determined to become Austria's ""biggest superstar since Hitler."" Perhaps inspired by another Cohen creation, Ali G, he sets out to make a celebrity interview show -- but sadly, the only dupes ignorant enough to participate are ""American Idol"" judges (Paula Abdul chats about her philanthropic pursuits while perched on the back of an immigrant laborer) and presidential candidates (take a bow, Ron Paul). It's not just about the scarcity of the guests, though. Bruno doesn't draw them out the way Borat did. Quite the opposite: Mostly they're wary and guarded, or downright hostile -- and understandably so, often enough, given Bruno's shock tactics. Yes, it's funny seeing him fire up a predominantly African-American TV studio audience by announcing that his ""adopted"" black baby is named O.J., but still, the scene tells us more about Cohen's need to provoke than about the crowd's supposed homophobia. The same goes for his brief stint in a U.S. Army training facility. The actor's quick wit and virtuoso physical comedy skills carry the day, but just as Bruno is forced to abandon one dead-end celebrity scheme after another, the movie too seems to be casting about haphazardly for some real comic traction. Evidently it's not easy testing taboos in 2009. Wherever Bruno turns, he seems to be following in someone else's footsteps. Peace talks in Israel (what Bruno calls ""Middle Earth"")? Morgan Spurlock has been there, done that. Camping out with the gun lobby? Michael Moore, ""Bowling for Columbine."" Gay conversion? Didn't director Larry Charles go there with Bill Maher just last year in ""Religulous""? Meanwhile, Bruno's love-hate relationship with his assistant, Lutz (Gustaf Hammarsten), only highlights how similar the new film's few narrative pegs are to ""Borat."" Some sketches do hit much closer to home. A series of interviews with stage moms and dads who eagerly sign up their infants to work with hornets, wasps, dead or dying animals, antiquated heavy machinery and sundry toxic substances is a real jaw-dropper, though the kicker is tempered by Bruno's behavior. And, to its credit, the film saves the best for last. In a show-stopping climax (which I don't propose to spoil here) Cohen puts it all on the line and definitively nails gay-bashers where it hurts: right between the eyes. iReport.com: ""Bruno"" vs. Borat"": Preview audience weighs in . It's an elaborate -- and brave -- stunt by which Bruno ultimately achieves the fame he craves. And it does more than enough to validate the film's fast and loose play with stereotypes and questionable undercover tactics. ""Bruno"" has its problems, but the finale makes it a winner.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The killer of ""Harry Potter"" actor Rob Knox has been given four life sentences and told he will be behind bars for at least 20 years. The parents of Robert Knox read a statement outside the Old Bailey after Karl Bishop was found guilty of his murder. A judge at the Old Bailey court in central London sentenced 22-year-old Karl Bishop on Thursday, the day after he was convicted of the attack on Rob Knox and four of his friends in southeast London last May. Bishop stabbed them 10 times in less than two minutes, the court heard. Knox, 18, had rushed out of the bar after he heard that Bishop had threatened his younger brother Jamie but he ended up being stabbed five times, once in a main artery. He died in hospital later that night. The judge, Mr Justice Bean, told Bishop: ""You are at present a highly dangerous man,"" the Press Association reported. ""There is plainly a very significant risk to the public of serious harm caused by your committing further offences of violence. ""Because you had threatened his younger brother, Rob Knox was among those who tried to disarm you. He paid for his bravery with his life. ""The truth is that you simply could not care less whether you killed him or not. When you learned that you had killed Rob your only response was to say 'Yeah, sweet.'"" Days before the attack, the actor had finished filming on ""Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince,"" due for international release in July, in which he played the role of Marcus Belby. He was set to reprise the part in future ""Harry Potter"" films. Knox's father Colin told mourners at his funeral, including co-star Rupert Grint, that his son had been ""living the dream,"" PA said. The Knox family left the court without commenting, but earlier Rob's mother Sally said of Bishop: ""Once he's got his sentence and he's gone, I will not waste my time thinking about him. ""I just think maybe somebody like him may have some kind of disturbed mind, which may not be due to the life he's had, it just may be something in him."" Knife crime in Britain is a political hot topic due to a spate of recent killings of mainly young people in major cities. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has urged tougher sentences for those caught carrying knives. He told the Daily Telegraph last month: ""By carrying a knife you are not only endangering the lives of others, but you are more likely to be killed, or end up in jail. ""We need to change the way young people think about knives, we need families and communities working together ... to get this message across and help stamp out knife crime and get weapons off our streets.""","The killer of ""Harry Potter"" actor jailed for life, must serve at least 20 years .

"(CNN) -- Les Paul never stopped tinkering, said Henry Juszkiewicz. Les Paul was constantly making recommendations on how to improve guitars, says the CEO of Gibson. Juszkiewicz, the chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitars, remembers getting calls from his company's partner (and famed client), offering recommendations on how to change or market his eponymous Gibson guitars. Sometimes, Juszkiewicz recalls, the two would go out for Chinese food. Paul was very particular, desiring a dish called Chicken Subgum. The two would have to search Chinatown for a restaurant that knew how to cook it, he says with a chuckle. Les Paul died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 94. Juszkiewicz talked about his friend and colleague Thursday afternoon. The following is an edited version of the interview.  Watch how Les Paul helped invent modern music » . CNN: Tell me about working with Les Paul. Henry Juszkiewicz: I've been with Gibson about 25 years and known Les pretty much through that entire period. ... Les was a very kind person. He was a visionary. In the early days, Gibson was doing very poorly as a company, and I got involved essentially to turn the company around. ... We had many, many conversations about the guitar business and what to do. ... A lot of the things we talked about and implemented were very successful. CNN: What was distinctive about the Gibson Les Paul when it came out, and what remains distinctive about it?  Gallery: Guitarists pay tribute to Les Paul » . Juszkiewicz: When it first came out, it was extremely controversial, and it was not really successful. It took years for Gibson to actually come to terms with Les. He had been pitching the head of what was Gibson's parent company, CMI, for three or four years until they finally decided to give it a try -- and only then when he became very famous and a television personality. And they were right, actually, because a solid-body guitar was considered silly. ... It really wasn't until 1965, '66 that the guitar took off and became popular. In fact, in the early '60s, the guitar was discontinued for several years. One of the [prized] Les Pauls was the 1959 Les Paul -- that's sort of the holy grail of Les Pauls -- and one of the reasons is there were only 300 units made in 1959. And 300 units was not really that successful for Gibson; it was a powerhouse guitar builder in 1959. So Les was always ahead of his time. He was someone who could see what was going to happen 50 years in advance, and very often, he was able to bring his vision to reality and share it with the entire musical community. ... The [Les Paul] guitar shines in modern music. ... In the '50s and before the '50s, the [standard] guitar was amplified, but it was just louder. In other words, it still sounded just like an acoustic guitar, but you could turn it up. What Les did was turn it into a whole new instrument. When he was playing ... you will hear this rich context that's kind of normal today. ... CNN: Les Paul being Les Paul, I assumed he continue to play with things over the years. Juszkiewicz: Yeah, he would call me all the time and give me suggestions. It's really hard to answer your original question, what makes it [distinctive]. ... As a guitar player, when I pick it up, I know it's a Les Paul. I can feel the sustain. It's got a certain feeling. ... There's a lot of things in it. But it's the package that's kind of magic. In the modern world, working with modern equipment, it's incomparable. CNN: How many Les Pauls do you sell nowadays? Juszkiewicz: A lot. Many, many thousands. I'll share with you: We had a big debate when we first got involved in the business. When I was a young guitar player, Les Pauls were always very expensive ... and they're very expensive today. [Paul] said, ""You know, Henry, you really have to make a less expensive Les Paul."" ... We argued about it for a year and a half, and finally I gave in. I said, ""OK, Les, it's your guitar."" ... And it was an instant success. And all of a sudden, people that couldn't touch that magic got a shot at it, and he was pleased as punch, and we were as well. He was a renaissance man. ... What a life. And what a wonderful, warm gentleman.","Gibson CEO: Les Paul made frequent recommendations on how to improve guitars .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British lawmakers demanded answers Thursday after a newspaper reported that a UK tabloid illegally hacked the phones of thousands of public figures including Gwyneth Paltrow, George Michael and Elle MacPherson. Britain's News of the World tabloid is at the center of the phone-hacking allegations. Prosecutors said they would look again at claims of alleged phone hacking by the News of the World. However police said they would not conduct a new investigation into the claims by the Guardian newspaper. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner John Yates said officers had seen no additional evidence since its last investigation. Earlier Thursday the Guardian reported the cell phones of ""several thousand public figures"" were hacked into by reporters and staff of the News of the World tabloid during one month in 2006. The public figures named by the Guardian as victims of the phone hackings include lawmaker John Prescott, who was then the deputy prime minister; Tessa Jowell, who was the secretary of state for culture, responsible for the media; and London Mayor Boris Johnson, who at the time was the Conservative Party spokesman on higher education. The Guardian said actress Gwyneth Paltrow, model Elle MacPherson, actor Jude Law, singer George Michael, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, celebrity PR agent Max Clifford, and actors union Equity were also victims of the hacking. ""The allegations -- the enormity of it -- is just unbelievable,"" Prescott told the BBC on Thursday morning. ""I think it is outrageous,"" former Home Secretary Charles Clarke, who was not named among the alleged victims, told the BBC. ""I think we do need action immediately."" Thursday's revelations in the Guardian come from a case last year in which Gordon Taylor, the head of the Professional Footballers' Association, was suing the News of the World for illegally intercepting messages on his cell phone. The tabloid paid Taylor more than £400,000 ($800,000 at the time) to settle the case, the Guardian said. The case file was sealed, but the newspaper said it obtained the suppressed evidence. That evidence, the Guardian said, shows that journalists working for the News of the World paid private investigators to illegally hack the cell phones of several thousand public figures. The staff then paid for the information the investigators obtained, the Guardian said. News International, the parent company of the News of the World defended its journalists and said it would not ""shirk from vigorously defending our right and proper role to expose wrongdoing."" In a statement News International, the UK subsidiary of News Corporation, said it was prevented by ""confidentiality obligations from discussing certain allegations made in the Guardian newspaper today."" But the statement stressed its staff have been told they must operate within the law and the industry's code of conduct. Police and prosecutors also came under scrutiny in the Guardian's report. It said the Metropolitan Police were aware of the hackings and raided the offices of some of the private investigators but did not inform those whose phones allegedly were targeted. The paper also said prosecutors decided not to take any legal action over the claims. Prescott demanded to know why -- if those allegations are true -- he wasn't told that his phone had been allegedly been hacked. ""I am writing to the chief of police to ask him and the Met authorities, did you know that many of our phones were being tapped? Did you tell the public prosecutor? Did the prosecutor then say 'no further action'?"" Prescott told the BBC. ""I can't believe that such legal authorities -- on such serious charges, if these allegations are right -- did nothing, and I want to know from them."" A spokeswoman for Jude Law said the actor was not commenting on the Guardian's report. Other celebrities contacted by CNN had no immediate comment. A spokesman for Equity said the union was writing to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to ask for evidence accompanying the claims. The Guardian reported that Equity was targeted as a way to get actors' addresses. ""We have no evidence to support the claims in today's Guardian story that Equity was conned into giving out information and we have received no complaints from any of our members that the details we hold on their behalf have been improperly accessed,"" Equity's letter states. ""We do, however, take the claims very seriously. We will be investigating the alleged breach in our security.""","Guardian newspaper: Cell phones of ""several thousand public figures"" hacked .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  --   Dry conditions and strong winds in California left much of the state vulnerable to massive fires, with blaze-starters ranging from a cooking fire at a drug trafficking operation to a bird flying into a power line. Drop in humidity, high temperatures could hamper efforts to contain the Lockheed Fire in Santa Cruz County. ""It really goes to show you that it doesn't take much with these dry conditions to start a fire,"" CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant told CNN Sunday. The fire sparked by a bird hitting a power line ignited a series of blazes in Yuba County, forcing some 1,300 firefighters to the scene and officials to declare evacuations in the town of Dobbins, he said. Authorities have battled the Yuba fire since Friday and expect containment by Thursday. In Southern California's Santa Barbara County, a weeklong blaze has charred more than 84,000 acres, investigators said. The fire originated at an illegal marijuana camp believed to be run by a Mexican drug organization, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Narcotics Unit said in a news release Saturday night. ""I haven't heard of any other fire starting that way,"" said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Carol Underhill, referring to the so-called La Brea Fire. More than 2,000 firefighters are fighting the blaze, which is 35 percent contained, authorities said. Some homes around the Los Padres National Forest have been evacuated. Narcotics investigators have secured the area after working for the past month to eradicate marijuana operations in the remote and steep terrain, the release said. ""It is also believed that the suspects are still within the San Rafael wilderness trying to leave the area on foot,"" officials said. Twenty firefighters sustained minor injuries while trying to contain a complex of smaller fires in Northern California's Shasta County that have burned nearly at least 17,623 acres, authorities said.  Watch fire in Santa Cruz Mountains » . CalFire spokesman Brent Saulsbury said 37 of the 40 fires -- known as the Shasta Lightning Complex -- are under control. The area is dense with timber, giving the fires serious fuel. Rugged terrain, limited access to fire trucks and the length of time it takes to reach wildfires have hindered firefighters in recent days, he said. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Blaze-starters include cooking fire at drug trafficking camp, bird flying into power line .

"(CNN) -- West Indies cricket coach John Dyson has been dismissed from his job with immediate effect. Australian John Dyson had been in charge of the West Indies cricket side since 2007. The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said they were terminating the contract of the Australian, according to a statement on the cricket board's Web site. The decision comes after recent Test and one-day series losses to Bangladesh, although in both defeats the West Indies were forced to put out weakened sides because of a dispute between players and the cricket board over contracts. Dyson, a former opening batsman who played 30 Tests for Australia, took charge of the West Indies in 2007. He enjoyed early Test series wins over South Africa and England but was heavily criticized for misreading the rain regulations in a one-day event with England in Guyana in March, an error that ultimately handed England the series. Earlier in his career he was appointed Sri Lanka coach in 2003 despite having only limited coaching experience at higher levels. The 55-year-old was due to lead the West Indies into next month's International Cricket Council Champions Trophy. The WICB offered no reason for Dyson's sacking but in a statement on their Web site confirmed that the assistant coach David Williams would take over as coach on a temporary basis for the upcoming tournament, which gets started in South Africa on September 22. The contract dispute means the West Indies will be forced to take a second-string side to South Africa. The statement added that ""in view of the special circumstances pertaining to this tour"" the former West Indies vice-captain and off-spin bowler Lance Gibbs had been appointed team manager.","Former Australian batsman John Dyson sacked as coach of the West Indies .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- They poured in to Los Angeles from places far-flung, an army of Michael Jackson fans hoping to collectively mourn their idol in a massive ceremony at the Staples Center downtown Tuesday. A fan leaves a note on a Michael Jackson memorial outside the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The singer's memorial service Tuesday will be a star-studded affair, with singers Mariah Carey, Usher and Stevie Wonder among the participants, according to an announcement released on behalf of the Jackson family. Also participating in the event will be basketball stars Kobe Bryant and Magic Johnson, and singers Jennifer Hudson, John Mayer and Smokey Robinson, the family said. The Rev. Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King III will be among others taking part. Ken Ehrlich, known for producing the Grammy Awards, is producing the memorial show, his company said. Kenny Ortega, who was to have co-directed Jackson's series of concerts in London, England, this summer, will direct it. Mayer posted on Twitter on Monday afternoon saying ""I'm going not to 'perform' but to contribute."" ""I'm honored to have been asked to play at MJ's memorial service. I will be representing all of us who can't be there,"" Mayer tweeted. ""Going to say goodbye from all us kids."" One notable who won't be attending: longtime Jackson friend Elizabeth Taylor, who put out a message on Twitter that she ""cannot be part of the public whoopla."" ""I just don't believe that Michael would want me to share my grief with millions of others,"" Taylor tweeted. ""How I feel is between us. Not a public event."" ""I love him too much,"" she added, ""and I cannot guarantee that I would be coherent to say a word."" Debbie Rowe, Jackson's former wife and the mother of his two oldest children, will not attend the memorial service, her lawyer Marta Almli said Monday. ""Although Debbie had originally planned to attend tomorrow's Staples Center memorial service, we have concluded with Debbie that she will not be attending,"" a statement from Almli said. ""The onslaught of media attention has made it clear her attendance would be an unnecessary distraction to an event that should focus exclusively on Michael's legacy. Debbie will continue to celebrate Michael's memory privately."" Fans without tickets to the memorial are being asked to stay away from downtown Los Angeles and watch the service on television.   Details: See who will be there, map of area » . The family decided to provide a free live video feed to networks so it would be televised everywhere. ""Everything about the memorial has to do with accommodating as many fans as possible,"" Ken Sunshine, the Jackson family spokesman, said. While Jackson's family remains tight-lipped about the singer's burial arrangements, sources told CNN that relatives will hold a private gathering at the Forest Lawn cemetery in Los Angeles Tuesday morning ahead of the public service. The California Highway Patrol will escort their motorcade, the sources said. The gathering is scheduled for 8 a.m. (11 a.m. ET) -- two hours before the service at the Staples Center arena. Cemetery officials have not commented on the matter. While there are five Forest Lawn cemeteries in the Los Angeles area, media trucks and crews have been parked at the gate of the Hollywood Hills facility for several days in anticipation of Jackson's possible interment there. Fans claim tickets . On Monday, fans chosen by random lottery for Jackson's memorial began arriving at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles to pick up their tickets. Full story . Los Angeles Police Capt. Bill Murphy said the distribution process was going smoothly. One person tried to pass off a photocopied voucher; he was ejected, Murphy said.

Deka Motanya, 27, who works in a doctor's office in San Francisco, scrambled Sunday night to line up plane tickets so she and her boyfriend could fly to Los Angeles on Monday. ""Oh, yeah, I'm going,"" she said. ""I'm e-mailing my boss saying I've got to leave early because I'm going to L.A."" Executors control Jackson's assets . A Los Angeles Superior Court judge granted control of Jackson's assets to the executors of his will Monday. The executors -- John Branca, Jackson's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend -- had sought immediate control of the entertainer's assets at a hearing before Judge Mitchell Beckloff. The judge appointed the men as special administrators until another hearing August 3. He said they will be responsible for protecting the estate from immediate losses. The men can enter into new ventures only with court approval, Beckloff said. Jackson died June 25. Since the next day, his mother, Katherine, has been administering the assets. Lawyers for Jackson's mother objected to Beckloff's decision, saying that ""irreparable damage"" could be done to the estate if Branca is allowed to take control. ""To award unfettered control to the other side would not serve justice,"" said attorney Burt Levitch. Katherine Jackson's lawyers argued that Branca was removed from several critical roles by Jackson after the signing of the will. They argued that the removal from those business roles should also exclude Branca as executor. ""Quite frankly, Mrs. Jackson has concerns about handing over the keys to the kingdom,"" Levitch said. But Branca's lawyer, Paul Hoffman, said Branca had represented Jackson off and on since he was 21, that he was his lawyer at the time the will was written and that he was rehired in mid-June. Branca represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer's death. He helped acquire Jackson's music catalog, which is worth millions. McClain is a longtime Jackson friend who has worked with him and his sister Janet. The judge ruled that Michael Jackson felt strongly enough about these executors to name them in his will. He required the two men to acquire a $1 million bond to insure their work as executors. The judge said he hopes the two sides can come to an agreement -- a ""free flow of information"" -- by August 3. Hoffman said the two sides met for four hours over the weekend but were unable to reach ""an acceptable accommodation."" In their filing for control of the estate, the men said it would allow them to tend to Jackson's numerous outstanding debts, legal cases and business obligations. At a hearing Wednesday, Beckloff had appointed Katherine Jackson the temporary administrator. Levitch said Monday that a second will has surfaced and that it was written in 1997. The lawyer said that he hasn't looked at it and that it was given to the court for safekeeping. However, the 1997 document will have no bearing unless the later one is discredited, which the lawyers don't expect.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- After a town hall meeting on health-care reform in Belgrade, Montana, President Obama will escape to Big Sky country on Friday evening where he'll spend time with family and go fly-fishing for the first time. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel carries fly-fishing tackle  to Marine One on Friday. Fly-fishing requires a singular focus, much like golf. Having newly discovered the sport myself, it occurred to me as I watched Marine One lift off the South Lawn on Friday that there are probably some lessons on the river that could apply to Obama's presidency. Thinking like a producer, I called an expert -- fly-fishing instructor Tony Derosier, who described the evolution most fishermen go through. ""Usually, when you first go fishing, all you want to do is catch a fish, and then all you want to do is catch a lot of fish, and then you just want to catch the larger fish. After you've caught a lot of large fish, you kind of go back to square one and catch just one fish,"" said Derosier, manager at Taylor Creek Fly Shop in Aspen, Colorado. ""You basically just want to go fishing -- the numbers, the size, it doesn't matter any more."" Obama is in the ""big fish"" stage of his presidency: He's trying to get health-care reform legislation passed hook, line, and sinker. If he's successful, anything else he gets passed will be icing on the cake. Learning the fundamentals of fly-fishing can serve as a metaphor for health care reform. Obama just needs to look at hooking and landing Blue Dog Democrats and Republicans like he would trout. The first step -- learn how to cast. ""Fly-casting is all about maximizing the energy you put in your rod and you lose energy if you wait too long,"" Derosier said. ""And conversely, if you don't wait long enough, your line will crack like a whip."" Obama has to strike the right balance between rushing things through and losing momentum; and maintaining support while bringing others over to his side. The second step -- reading the water: ""Instead of blindly casting anywhere in the river you want to understand where you might find fish,"" Derosier explained. Obama zeroed in on a fairly conservative state, Montana, where he faces a land full of skeptics about his health care reform plan. Third -- hook and land the fish: Derosier said once you hook the fish you have to know how to play the fish, which is a delicate balance between applying pressure but not so much that the line breaks -- much like the delicate balance of Obama's courting members of Congress. ""The ultimate goal is to gain an advantage over the fish so that you can land him,"" he said. ""It's the hardest thing to teach when it comes to fly-fishing,"" he said. Out in Montana, the game is catch-and-release trout. But in Washington, Obama is trying to hook Congress and take home health care reform, or risk it being the big one that got away.","CNN White House producer: Fly-fishing is a metaphor that fits Obama's presidency .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Financing for DreamWorks Studios' partnership with one of India's richest men was finalized Monday, giving Steven Spielberg and partner Stacey Snider money to resume making movies. From left to right, Steven Spielberg, Anil Ambani, Stacey Snider and Amitahb Jhunjhunwala. The deal with Anil Ambani, chairman of India's Reliance BIG Entertainment, provides Spielberg's DreamWorks Studios with $875 million, coming from Ambani, the Walt Disney Co. and loans made by a syndicate of banks. Disney will distribute and market about six DreamWorks Studios films around the world each year, with the exception of India, where Reliance will have those rights. Spielberg and Snider found themselves in need of financial partners last year when he cut ties with Paramount Pictures and began rebuilding DreamWorks into an independent studio. Although the deal, which was announced last year, has been characterized in some reports as ""Hollywood meets Bollywood,"" Spielberg and partner Stacey Snider will have creative control over productions. ""This will allow us to move ahead quickly into production with our first group of films,"" Snider and Spielberg said in a joint statement. Reliance BIG Entertainment is part of the Reliance group controlled by billionaire Ambani. ""Our partnership with Stacey and Steven is the cornerstone of our Hollywood strategy as we grow our film interests across the globe,"" Ambani said. ""Given our faith in the business plan that they presented to us and despite the current economic climate, we were always confident that this day would come. Now Stacey and Steven can focus on producing more of the great films for which they are renowned."" Ambani, whose company owns hundreds of theater screens across South Asia, has also invested development money this year with other Hollywood production companies, including those owned by actors Nicolas Cage, Tom Hanks, George Clooney and Jim Carrey. A DreamWorks announcement said that J.P. Morgan brought together the syndicate of banks to provide about $325 million in funding. The banks include Bank of America, City National Bank, Wells Fargo, Comerica, Union Bank of California, SunTrust, California Bank & Trust, and Israel Discount Bank. One of the first movies to go into production will be ""Harvey,"" an adaptation of the play that won a Pulitzer for playwright Mary Chase. The tale about a man and his invisible bunny friend was first made into a movie, starring Jimmy Stewart, in 1950. Spielberg's long career as a screenwriter, director and producer has included classic blockbusters ""E.T.: The Extraterrestrial,"" the ""Indiana Jones"" series and ""Saving Private Ryan.""","Steven Spielberg finalizes partnership with Indian tycoon, gets cash infusion .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran has released a French academic from prison, though it's not clear when Clotilde Reiss can return home, French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office announced Sunday. French national Clotilde Reiss, right, and British embassy worker Hossein Rassam, far left, in court. Reiss, 24, is the second French woman facing charges as part of mass trials in Iran who was released on bond. French authorities are now demanding that Iran drop all charges against Reiss and Nazak Afshar -- an employee of the French embassy in Tehran who was released August 8, the statement from Sarkozy's office said. They were arrested in connection with protests after the June 12 presidential election. Reiss will stay at the French embassy in Tehran while she awaits her return to France, the statement said. She has spoken with her father and is good health and spirits, it said. Iranian media reported Reiss admitted to crimes in court Saturday in connection with protests after the presidential election, and asked for clemency. ""I shouldn't have participated in the illegal demonstration and shouldn't have sent the pictures, I am regretful,"" the semi-official Fars news agency has quoted her as saying. ""I apologize to the Iranian people and court and I hope the people and the court forgive me."" Human rights groups and Iran's opposition leaders have accused the government of forcing people to make such confessions. Iranian authorities arrested about 4,000 people amid protests against the controversial election, judiciary spokesman Ali Reza Jamshidi has said, according to the Iran Labor News Agency. He said 3,700 were released in the first week. But 100 defendants, including Afshar, Reiss, and an Iranian employee of the British embassy, appeared this month in Tehran's Revolutionary Court at a mass trial on charges related to recent post-election violence. Thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the official result of the vote -- the re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The government said he won by a landslide, but his opponents accused officials of rigging the results. A crackdown by security forces followed, and at least 30 people died in the violence.","Not clear when Clotilde Reiss can return home, French officials said .

"(CNN)  -- Inside a freezer in a research laboratory at the University of Washington are blood and blood plasma samples from 92 people who suffer from mysterious illnesses, including tremors, memory loss and severe migraine headaches. Terry Williams hugs her two boys -- Jake, left, and Zack -- in 2006, before she says toxic cabin air made her sick. They are mostly pilots and flight attendants who suspect they've been poisoned in their workplace -- on board the aircraft they fly. Clement Furlong, University of Washington professor of medicine and genome sciences, leads a team of scientists who have been collecting the samples for 2 ½ years. Furlong said his team is a few months away from finalizing a blood analysis test that will be able to definitely confirm whether the study participants were indeed poisoned by toxic fumes. Results of Furlong's research could expand recognition of what a select group of researchers believes is a largely unrecognized risk of flying: the chance that poisonous fumes enter the cabin. ""There's a danger of inhaling compounds that are coming out of the engine,"" said Furlong in his laboratory.  See a diagram of how the air is circulated » . The air we breathe on board a plane is a 50-50 mix of filtered, recirculated air and so-called ""bleed air"" -- which bleeds off the engines, and then is pressurized and cooled before being sent into the cabin through vents. If an engine oil seal leaks, aviation engineers and scientists say, the bleed air can become contaminated with toxins. In 2002 the National Academies of Sciences' National Research Council reported ""contaminant exposures result from the intake of chemical contaminants (e.g., engine lubricating oils, hydraulic fluids, deicing fluids and their degradation products) into the Environmental Control System and then into the cabin."" Of particular concern are toxic anti-wear agents in the oil, designed to prolong an engine's life, called tricresyl phosphates. ""The engine seals fail and there's very potent toxins that can come on board,"" said Furlong. Neuropsychologist Sarah Mackenzie Ross of University College London studied 27 British pilots who claimed they had inhaled contaminated air and subsequently had difficulty processing information and slowed reaction times. Her testing confirmed their symptoms. ""They did appear to underperform on tasks that required attention, processing speed, reaction time, and what we call executive functioning, which is high-level decision making,"" said Ross. Former flight attendant Terry Williams believes she is a victim of such a ""fume event."" She complains of debilitating migraine headaches, tremors, and blind spots in her field of vision. ""It's been so constant and just continues to worsen so it's extremely frustrating,"" said Williams, who is suing Boeing, the owner of McDonnell Douglas, which made the MD-82 aircraft on which she worked. ""I'm frustrated that I don't feel any better and it's over two years after the exposure."" Boeing told CNN, ""It is our belief that air quality on airplanes is healthy and safe."" In its response to Williams' suit, the company said: ""The potential for bleed air contamination has been known through the aviation industry for many years."" But Boeing denies any responsibility for Terry Williams' illness. While Williams' symptoms appear to be quite rare, it appears that fume events occur with regularity. A British study for the House of Lords found fume events in 1 of every 2,000 flights. In the U.S., airlines are required to report ""fume events"" to the Federal Aviation Administration. There were 108 such reports last year. So why wouldn't more flight attendants, pilots and passengers suffer symptoms? Furlong said a small percentage of people (how small is not known) appear to be highly sensitive to the most toxic chemicals. They may be genetically disposed to a strong reaction, possessing multiple genes of metabolizing proteins in their livers, or temporarily have high enzyme levels (which can be triggered by prescription drugs) that will act on the inhaled chemicals to magnify their toxicity. ""If you happen to be taking a medication that turns on the protein that converts pre-toxin to very potent toxin, you've got an issue,"" said Furlong. As a result, someone sitting next to a victim may have inhaled the same contaminated fumes, but not suffer the same reaction. How might you know that you may have been exposed to a ""fume event"" while flying? Experts say the telltale sign is a ""dirty sock"" smell. That's butyric acid from engine oil, which itself is not highly toxic. But along with it comes the deadly nonodorous compounds tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate and mono-ortho-cresyl phosphate. Boeing's new plane, the 787 Dreamliner, has been designed so that air entering the cabin from outside will not ""bleed"" off the engines. The company says that's only for fuel efficiency purposes, not because of any concern about the quality of bleed air in its current fleet of aircraft. Indeed, Boeing and the FAA say the air quality on airplanes is as good or better than that of the average office building or home. CNN's Jessica Ravitz contributed to this report.","Results of scientist's research could expand recognition of ""bleed air""

"(CNN) -- Anita Davenport's curiosity about her family's past began with the photographs that surrounded her. She said she wanted to know the stories behind the images of her parents and uncles. Anita Davenport's grandfather, Walter, was stationed in Battle Creek, Michigan, during World War I. The stories she found -- and shared during several phone conversations from her home in Culver City, California -- parallel the African-American journey during the past century. The search took her to 1894, when her grandfather, Walter, was born in Stone Mountain, Georgia. Walter Davenport moved to Wedowee, Alabama. During World War I, Davenport was stationed at Fort Custer in Battle Creek, Michigan, Anita said. Thousands of other African-Americans were also on the move, mainly to the Northeast and the Midwest, eager for opportunities related to the war and industrialization, according to Howard Dodson, a historian and the director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Walter Davenport later returned to Alabama, married and had nine children, one of whom was Anita's father, Frank. Walter was fond of Battle Creek and regaled his family with stories, Anita said. The stories must have been convincing. The eldest of his nine children, also named Walter, moved north to Battle Creek in 1951. Frank Davenport, Anita's father, later joined his older brother in Michigan. Anita was born in Battle Creek. Between 1940 and 1970, more than 5 million African-Americans left the South, migrating to cities like Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan, and New York. ""You have this incredible movement of black people across the width and breadth of this land and [they] establish themselves as a national presence, rather than a regional one [based] in the South,"" Dodson said. Interactive: Explore the African-American journey . That movement of African-Americans -- called ""the Great Migration"" -- had a clear and direct impact on the country. ""It made race a national issue,"" said Nicholas Lemann, author of ""The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How It Changed America."" ""You could say it was always a national issue and have a very powerful case ... but it was possible to say, 'It's a Southern issue,'"" he said. ""After the Great Migration, it was no longer possible."" African-American culture was interacting with other cultures across the whole of American society, Lemann said, ""affecting everything from government policy and music to sports and everything in between."" The return South . Civil rights legislation passed during the 1960s helped set the stage for the next era of African-American migration: A return to the South. Around 1970, many African-Americans began moving back to the South, historians and demographers say. The trend accelerated during the 1990s and this decade, according to William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think-tank. From 1965 through 1970, the South experienced a net migration loss -- the number of people who moved into the region compared to the number of people who moved out -- of more than 287,000 African-Americans. Thirty years later, the numbers were nearly the opposite. From 1995 through 2000, the South saw a gain of nearly 350,000 African-Americans. iReport.com: Share your family's story . The statistics come from an analysis of census data conducted by Frey in 2004. The numbers of African-Americans returning to the South are not as large as those seen during the Great Migration, but the trend has resonance because of the place the region occupies in black history and mythology. The ascendance of the South's economy was a key factor behind the return migration, Frey said. ""I think there's a push and a pull involved with the movement,"" he said. ""A lot of it had to do with the decline of heavy industry, which employed a lot of blacks and blue-collar whites, in a whole set of Rust Belt states,"" he said. Meanwhile, states like Georgia, Florida, Texas, and increasingly the Carolinas, Virginia and Tennessee were booming, Frey said. Civil rights legislation and a more educated society made the South more tolerant and hospitable. The booming economy provided jobs and opportunity. But there is also an emotional element for many African-Americans when it comes to the region. ""I think a big part, aside from the economy, is the kind of historic roots that blacks have had there,"" Frey said. ""There is something culturally attractive about the South to the African-American population even though they spent many decades surviving brutal treatment during the Jim Crow period and a lot of the racial discrimination that occurred."" Dodson, the historian, said many people, especially retirees, made decisions to return out of a desire to connect with ancestral homes, churches and communities. Anita's parents still live in Battle Creek, though they spend the winters in the South. Her uncle, Walter Davenport, moved to Stone Mountain, the place of his father's birth, in 1998. When asked for the reasons behind her uncle's move, Anita said it was a love of the land, the slower pace and something almost ""mysterious."" ""They wanted to get out of the South, but it still calls them,"" she said of her family's journey during the past few decades. There's ""something about the land and it just calls them back like a song.""

"(CNN)  -- A former high school cheerleader who sued over injuries caused when a teammate failed to catch her during a routine, lost her appeal before the Wisconsin Supreme Court on Tuesday. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Tuesday a cheerleader couldn't sue her teammate. The seven state justices unanimously concluded cheerleading is a ""contact"" sport, and therefore neither the male student cited nor the school district was liable for damages. The opinion also said the stunt in question did not create a ""compelling danger"" to students. It is the first legal decision of its kind, according to the National Cheer Safety Foundation, a group founded by parents. The case was closely watched by school districts and parents around the country concerned about whether they would have immunity from lawsuits involving unintentional injuries from certain extracurricular activities. Brittany Noffke was a varsity cheerleader at Holmen High School, about 14 miles from La Crosse, in western Wisconsin. Her team was practicing a ""post to hands"" stunt before a basketball game in 2004, and after being lifted up to stand on the shoulders of a fellow student, Noffke fell backward, striking her head on the floor. The 16-year-old male cheerleader who lifted her, and then was supposed to be a spotter, failed to catch her. The girl's family sued the boy and the school district, claiming the coach was negligent by not having a second spotter and not providing safety mats. State law does not specifically spell out which high school activities involve ""contact,"" but they typically involve sports such as football or lacrosse in which opposing teams compete against each other. But the Wisconsin high court concluded that ""cheerleading involves a significant amount of physical contact between cheerleaders that at times results in a forceful interaction between the participants."" Justice Annette Ziegler cited the ""spirit rules"" of the National Federation of State High School Association's handbook, which contained pictures illustrating various cheerleading stunts. She said all but one photo showed at least two cheerleaders in contact with one another. Because the male cheerleader just made a mistake by being out of place when Noffke fell, the court found he did not act ""recklessly,"" the only legal standard that would have permitted a lawsuit to proceed. Although it is not considered a sport at many high schools and colleges, cheerleading has grown increasingly popular over the years, and the stunts have become more complex and dangerous, sports injury experts say. A University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill study found cheerleading accounted for about two-thirds of some 93 ""catastrophic"" sports injuries -- including head and neck damage -- among high school girls in the past 26 years. But the study noted that other sports such as football produce far more devastating injuries, though fewer in number. Cheerleading advocates say the activity has become much safer in the past 15 years, following greater awareness of the risks and better coordination among state and national groups. The American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators estimates about 4 million people are involved in the activity.","Justices rule cheerleading is ""contact"" sport, therefore teammates, school not liable .

"(CNN) -- When pro quarterback Michael Vick pleaded guilty to bankrolling a dogfighting operation in 2007, there was a spike in reports of dogfighting in the United States. One of six dogs recovered from a Sumter County, South Carolina, dogfight waits in a kennel last week. But when the headlines faded, the blood sport grew stronger and went even more underground, with thugs taking inventive precautions to keep police at bay, animal cruelty experts say. ""They know it's just not smart to have large crowds anymore, so we've seen fights where you've got the two handlers, a referee and Web cams everywhere broadcasting the fight on the Internet,"" said Mark Kumpf, an investigator based in Ohio who directs the National Animal Control Association. Fights are also being staged on the move -- in 18-wheelers. ""These guys are very sophisticated,"" Kumpf said. ""If you're driving down the road, there could be dogs in that truck driving next to you that are dying."" Dozens more dogfighting cases have been investigated and prosecuted since the Vick case, said Alison Gianotto, who runs the database PetAbuse.com. The computer programmer,  horrified when a neighbor's cat was set on fire eight years ago, created the California-based organization to track animal cruelty cases and animal abusers. The database, which logs media stories, has also become a popular place for law enforcement to send reports. ""There's not a central body keeping track of what's happening nationally, which is unfortunate when you consider that a lot of these cases cross state lines,"" she said. Still, detectives, animal welfare professionals and prosecutors agree that the attention the Vick case has brought to dogfighting has been positive because more people are inclined to report their suspicions. Dogfighting is illegal in all states; penalties vary but usually include heavy jail time or steep fines. The National Football League suspended Vick indefinitely in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in Virginia. Vick, 29, was freed from federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, on May 20 and returned to Virginia to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. ""At the height of attention on the Vick case, things quieted down across the country with some of these dogfighters getting out of the business,"" veteran animal abuse investigator Tim Rickey said. ""But then, the headlines went away, and people thought the attention was off. It just started right back up, almost stronger than before."" ""Every Saturday night in every county in Missouri, there is a dogfight going on,"" Rickey said. While the Vick case was making its way through the court system, Rickey, who directs the animal cruelty task force at the Humane Society of Missouri, was initiating what would become an 18-month investigation linking dogfighting rings in eight states. That probe led to the July 8 arrest of 28 people from eight states. As many as 400 dogs were confiscated in raids coordinated by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, Rickey said. He said it was the largest such case involving dogfighting in the U.S. While those involved with the national case declined Monday to give details about that investigation, CNN spoke with several detectives across America who have worked other dogfighting cases. Among the abuses they've uncovered: . • Dogs with missing ears and patches of skin . • Animals with teeth shaved down to the bone . • ""Vets"" who have used leg splints that are to tight to ""treat"" animals in dogfighting rings . •  Contraptions, usually fashioned out of wood, much like a treadmill, that force chained dogs to run or be choked. Detective Keith Coberly of the police vice squad in Dayton, Ohio, described a case he recently investigated that resulted in the convictions of three men. A neighbor called police when she saw a mangled dog that had apparently escaped from a home where investigators found 60 chained pit bull terriers, many being starved and wallowing in their own waste. There were thousands of hypodermic needles scattered across the ground. ""They were using steroids on the animals,"" he said. ""There was one dog -- in such bad shape, man -- tethered to a logging chain, and another was kept in a two-foot shed without ventilation or food."" The suffering is incalculable, and the cost of caring for the animals is steep. Because the national investigation originated in Missouri, the state is harboring about 400 of the rescued dogs, some that have had puppies recently. ""These dogs are bred to attack each other, so just caring for them is a tremendous job. You have to keep them separate, and you have to protect volunteers who are devoting 12, 14 hours of their day,"" Rickey said. ""And we're doing all of that in this economy."" Investigating dogfighting is dangerous -- and hugely popular in Russian mafia circles and with drug traffickers in Mexico, experts say. Dogfighting is reliant on word of mouth, and on what one undercover officer described as ""bad character"" references. ""If you can get someone to vouch for you, a match is set up,"" Kumpf said. ""They'll have everyone go to a hotel and come pick you up and drive you around in an unmarked van."" Driving around town helps shake any police tail, he said. Those betting on fights aren't likely to get paid on site any more. Money is often kept at another location, making it more difficult to make arrests. In late July, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell conditionally reinstated Vick, who said on ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday night that he cried in prison because of the guilt he felt about dogfighting. Vick's agent announced Thursday that the former Atlanta Falcon signed a two-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, which reportedly could be worth more than $6 million. ""I hope people realize [dogfighting] is not just about Michael Vick,"" Rickey said. ""It's a lot bigger than him.""","Dogfighters are using Web cams, staging fights in 18-wheelers to avoid police .

"Melissa Harris-Lacewell is associate professor of politics and African-American studies at Princeton University. She is the author of the award-winning book ""Barbershops, Bibles, and BET: Everyday Talk and Black Political Thought"" and writes a daily blog titled The Kitchen Table. Melissa Harris-Lacewell says African-Americans remain skeptical about racial progress in the U.S. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- America was proud of itself for electing Barack Obama. The pride was not just partisan and ideological; it was also specifically and clearly racial. The morning after Obama's win, The New York Times declared ""Racial Barrier Falls in Decisive Victory."" The Los Angeles Times asserted that ""for the first time in human history, a largely white nation has elected a black man to be its paramount leader."" Some black commentators openly wept on election night, thrilled with witnessing the election of our first black president. Even Sen. John McCain, conceding defeat, pointed to the greatness of the American promise fulfilled in the election of his opponent. Obama's victory offered the possibility that the scars of America's racial legacy were healed or, at least, that they were less raw. For many African-American citizens, the election of the first black U.S. president was cause for celebration and open-mouthed wonder about an outcome that seemed so unlikely just two years earlier, when Obama announced his bid. Despite this joy, many black citizens were dubious that his victory represented the destruction of any particular racial barrier. African-Americans were both proud of and excited about Obama, but in the 45 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act, black Americans had seen doors to power, influence and wealth open just enough to admit just a few without fundamentally altering opportunities for the majority. Indeed, responses to a recent CNN/Essence Magazine/Opinion Research Corp. survey indicate that black enthusiasm about Obama exists side-by-by side with deep skepticism about America's racial progress. This atmosphere of both enthusiasm and doubt has sparked discussion about whether we have entered a post-racial era in American politics. It is a difficult debate, because the term ""post-racial"" is not clearly defined. Race itself is a slippery idea. Typically, we treat race like a fixed, unchanging, biological category. But race is none of these things. Race is a social construct. Though it is based in physical traits, race is a category developed through social practice, law and history. As a nation, we made blackness through our politics, developing a category of people who could be enslaved and later segregated. So when we talk of a post-racial America, we are not pointing to the massive demographic shifts that are unalterably changing the racial, ethnic and linguistic landscape of America. Instead, ""post-racial"" is an expression of social and political longing. For most, this means an America free of racism and discrimination, but others seem to hint at a society entirely free of racial identity or recognition. The idea of a post-racial America has been upheld as an achievable ideal where people would receive equal treatment and fair outcomes regardless of their race. It has been critiqued as an impossible dream unlikely to exist in a nation with a history of slavery and legal discrimination. It has been denounced as an unworthy goal that would require black Americans to reject their cultural specificity and unique social and political concerns. Undoubtedly, the 2008 election broke formerly entrenched racial trends. Obama was elected just as the depth and breadth of the American economic crisis was becoming clear. Some suggested that his victory could be explained by the nation's fiscal difficulties because he was the candidate of the out-party, which often wins when times are hard. But this analysis forgets the cross-cutting history of race. When the economic pie shrinks, Americans rarely form multiracial political coalitions led by minority candidates. Obama's victory countered the trend toward racial balkanization more typical in tough economic times. The changing dynamics of racial politics were further evidenced when Obama won both Virginia and North Carolina. In these Southern states and in many blue states throughout the country, Obama shattered the ""Bradley Effect,"" often getting a higher percentage of the white vote than polls predicted. There was little evidence that white voters rejected Obama based on his race, and few white Democrats crossed party lines to vote for McCain. For these reasons, Obama's win offers evidence of a post-racial American electoral politics. And if not post-racial, these data at least point to a much less racist American voting public than what existed 40 years ago. Still, the election of a black president has not changed the material realities of racial inequality. African-Americans are significantly more distressed than their white counterparts on every meaningful economic indicator: income, unemployment, wealth, education, home ownership and home foreclosures. African-American social realities are equally grim. Blacks are far more likely to be arrested and more harshly sentenced than whites. African-Americans are less likely to marry, more likely to divorce and more likely to live in single- parent households. Compared with whites, blacks are more likely to suffer infant mortality, cancer, diabetes and premature death. Substantial evidence shows that the economic, social and even political gains made by African-Americans in the 1960s and 1970s have leveled off or reversed in the past decade in areas such as urban education, the number of black elected officials and the racial wealth gap. The murder of a security guard at the national Holocaust museum by a racist anti-Semite reminded the nation that old-fashioned, violent bigotry still has life in America. These sobering realities indicate that race still vastly over-determines the life chances of Americans. These differences cannot be explained away by class alone, because most of these inequalities persist even when controlling for income. To be born black in America is still a tremendous disadvantage compared with being born white in this country. Herein lies the challenge facing Americans in this new racial era. For much of the 20th century, the battle for civil rights rested on a belief that political equality would translate into social and economic justice. There can be little doubt that many of the substantive battles for political power and representation have been won. In that sense, Obama's election is the fulfillment of a post-racial political promise. It is equally clear that this political arrival has not ushered in the other substantive racial changes that the civil rights movement hoped to achieve. In many ways, political equality is just the beginning of the process. The work of politics is to collectively craft the nation we want to have. The election of Obama does not indicate the realization of post-racial America, but it does allow us the opportunity to engage in renewed, collective questioning of what a racially just nation is like. Having achieved so much politically, there is still real debate about how to end overt racism, structural discrimination and persistent inequality. Some want a country where the black kids don't sit together in the cafeteria, while others hope black kids being together will provoke neither comment nor anxiety. Some want a nation where no one notices race, while others hope that their racial identity can be both recognized and appreciated. Some worry that eliminating racial barriers will only solidify economic differences, while others suspect that economic justice cannot be achieved without grappling with race. Some want the end of all inequality, while others simply hope disparities will be based on ""merit"" rather than race. As citizens in a democracy, we can choose the future of our racial politics. Not all at once and not without struggle, but we can make new choices . And this time, African-Americans participate in the process of remaking America's racial story from a very different position than we have occupied in the past. Rather than being solely on the margins of national power, black Americans, through the person of Obama, have achieved a new kind of citizenship more empowered to recreate American race. This does not mean black people have equal political or economic power, but it does mean that the election of Obama encourages black Americans to even more loudly and clearly articulate our varied aspirations for our country. In November, we did a marvelous thing. Now, the work begins.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- A leading human rights activist was abducted and killed in Russia Wednesday, the organization she worked for told CNN. Estemirova, pictured in 2007, had been openly critical of Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov. Natalya Estemirova, of the Russian human rights group Memorial, was kidnapped outside her home in Grozny, Chechnya, Oleg Orlov said, citing eyewitness reports. She was later found dead in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia, said Orlov, the head of the organization's Moscow office. Estemirova, 50, was a leading human rights activist in the North Caucasus area who had been openly criticizing Chechnya's authoritarian president, Ramzan Kadyrov, and his methods. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed indignation at the murder and said her killers should be punished to the full extent of the law, his office said. He expressed his condolences to her family, press secretary Natalya Timakova said. Estemirova shouted that she was being kidnapped as she was forced into a white Lada automobile that had stopped on the road in front of her house at 8:30 a.m. (12:30 a.m. ET), Orlov said. An unidentified man grabbed her and shoved her into the car, he told CNN. ""This is a kidnapping,"" she yelled, he said. Estemirova studied history at Grozny University, then taught history before turning to journalism and human rights in 1998, Memorial said. She joined the organization in March 2000. In a written statement, U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the United States is ""deeply saddened"" by the report of Estemirova's death. ""We call upon the Russian government to bring those responsible to justice,"" he said. He described Estemirova as ""uncompromising in her willingness to reveal the truth regardless of where that might lead. She was devoted to shining a light on human rights abuses, particularly in Chechnya."" The Committee to Protect Journalists, in a written statement, demanded that the killing be thoroughly investigated immediately. ""As she uncovered massive, ongoing human rights violations in Chechnya by the federal and regional authorities, Estemirova was often at odds with Chechen authorities, according to her colleagues,"" the advocacy group said. She won three international awards for human rights activities -- including the inaugural Anna Politkovskaya Award, named for the Russian investigative journalist who was herself murdered almost three years ago. Estemirova was Politkovskaya's ""most frequent companion during travel and investigations in Chechnya,"" the organization Reach All Women in War said in announcing the prize for Estemirova. ""They investigated a number of cases together -- about which Anna wrote for (the newspaper) Novaya Gazeta and Natalya wrote for Memorial's Web site and for local newspapers."" ""President Medvedev must make good on his promise to investigate this shocking killing by ensuring that the inquiry is thorough and transparent,"" said CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney. ""The killers of this courageous reporter, one of the few left in Chechnya, must not be allowed to walk free like so many before them."" CNN's Maxim Tkachenko in Moscow, Russia, contributed to this report.","Natalya Estemirova abducted outside her home in Grozny, Chechnya .

"(CNN) -- The City of Brotherly Love isn't exactly embracing the news that one-time quarterback phenom and convicted dogfighter Michael Vick is joining their Philadelphia Eagles. Former Atlanta Falcon Michael Vick, right, was known more for his elusiveness than his throwing prowess. Vick's agent announced Thursday that the former Atlanta Falcon signed a two-year deal with the Eagles, which reportedly could be worth more than $6 million. He won't be able to play a regular season game until week six in October, and then, only if the National Football League fully reinstates him. ""Too bad they don't have him for the whole year,"" Eagles fan Charles James told CNN affiliate philly.com. The NFL indefinitely suspended Vick in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation in Virginia. Vick, 29, left a Kansas prison in May to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. Some Eagles fans don't think Vick's punishment was sufficient and were trying to unload their game and season tickets on craigslist.com, making it clear they were less than eager to see Vick in Philly green. iReport.com: What do you think of Vick's return? A post from one irked fan looking to peddle two lower-level season tickets said: ""The last thing my son and I want to see is Michael Vick in an Eagles jersey. We made up our mind to sell the tickets ... $3000 cash gets the tickets. Any info feel free to ask, serious buyers only, I want the deal done fast."" Lower-level season tickets were selling on an unrelated auction site for as much as $10,000 a pair. Bob Jenkins of northeast Philadelphia predicted most Eagles fans -- known to be some of the nation's most demanding -- won't be badmouthing the decision. ""The only people who won't be quiet are the people who don't like the Eagles,"" Jenkins told philly.com. ""Of course, they're going to be talking because he's going to be throwing some touchdowns."" Despite Jenkins' assumption, it's unclear what role Vick will play on the team. A gifted athlete known more for his dazzling runs than his pinpoint throws, Vick's last season in 2006 was a bit of a disappointment to Atlanta fans. The Falcons finished 7-9, and Vick had a completion percentage of 52.6. He also threw for 2,474 yards, more than 1,000 fewer yards than the Patriots' Tom Brady, who completed 62 percent of his passes, and almost 2,000 yards behind the Colts' Peyton Manning, who completed 65 percent of his tosses. However, Vick also ran for 1,039 yards, the most ever by a quarterback. Mike Giunta of Tabernacle, New Jersey, told CNN affiliate WPVI-TV in Philadelphia that signing Vick would spawn ""dissension"" among the Eagles, who made it to their conference championship last season, losing to the Arizona Cardinals. Giunta  predicted the move would create consternation between Vick and five-time Pro Bowl quarterback Donovan McNabb. ""McNabb's going to be looking over his shoulder constantly now,"" Giunta said. McNabb said in a Thursday news conference that he welcomed the addition of Vick and he ""pretty much lobbied to get him here because everybody deserves a second chance."" Several Eagles fans concur. One of them, Leroy Emerson of north Philadelphia, told philly.com, ""That was the best move the Eagles ever made, one of the best."" Some fans, however, were licking their wounds and pointing to the most severe dogfighting allegations leveled against Vick: that he hanged dogs from trees, electrocuted and drowned them. The Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have both skewered Vick. The latter alluded to Vick being a ""psychopath"" earlier this year and released a statement Friday saying, ""Millions of decent football fans around the world are disappointed"" in the Eagles. ""PETA certainly hopes that Vick has learned his lesson and feels truly remorseful for his crimes -- but since he's given no public indication that that's the case, only time will tell,"" the statement said. Upon being conditionally reinstated to the NFL last month, Vick acknowledged making ""terrible mistakes"" and said he had used the past two years to re-evaluate his life. The Humane Society of the United States has said Vick also offered to work with the organization on its anti-dogfighting campaign. To some Eagles fans, though, the nature of Vick's crimes is too much to forgive. ""I'm just a little upset with it because I'm such an animal lover,"" Susan Wilson of Pitman, New Jersey, told WPVI. Kelley Williams of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, told the station that she, too, had trouble accepting Vick's signing. ""I think he should be out of the NFL altogether,"" she said. Sports talk shows already are predicting that Vick can redeem himself only by making big plays, and at least some of the Philadelphia faithful concur he can shut up his critics on the field. ""If they keep him,"" fan James told philly.com, ""he'll be the man.""","Michael Vick signs deal with Philadelphia Eagles, could play in October .

"(CNN)  -- He burst on the music scene in the 1970s with the Commodores and then went on to a major solo career with hits such as ""All Night Long"" and ""Hello."" Lionel Richie and his daughter, Nicole, gave their first joint TV interview in six years to CNN's Larry King. She made a name for herself on the TV series ""The Simple Life,"" which followed the exploits of her and fellow socialite Paris Hilton, and in the tabloids. Father-and-daughter Lionel and Nicole Richie have been making news for decades, but rarely together. In their first TV interview together in six years, they talked with CNN's Larry King about their relationship; her time in rehab; Lionel's first grandchild, Harlow; their growing family; and more. The following interview, scheduled to air Thursday night, has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: You did ""American Idol."" A European tour. A new CD. You ever give thoughts of just cooling it? Lionel Richie: My answer to that is very simple. I don't like fishing. I'm pretty much like you. This is my hobby. King: What's the new album [""Just Go""] about? Lionel Richie: You know what I decided to do on this album? Something different. Instead of controlling, which is what I love to do -- I'm the writer, I'm the arranger, I'm the producer, I'm the singer -- I decided [to] start another way. I just gave up the power completely. There is only one song on this album that I actually wrote, called ""Eternity."" King: The ""American Idol"" thing. Was that fun? Why did you do it? Lionel Richie: It's the best fun in the world. Danny [Gokey] was so wonderful. He kept saying, ""Suppose I mess up or suppose I sing your line instead of my line,"" and I said, ""You can't mess this one up. And if you feel like you want to sing my part, sing it loud and strong."" And of course he nailed it. It was so much fun to watch everybody backstage. The tension of what goes through that show, I don't think I [could] do it. [Nicole Richie joins the interview] . King: What is it like to be with her in this setting? Lionel Richie: I'm so proud of her right now. There is such a pride that she has turned this corner. She is an amazing mother. I want the world to know where she is. King: Now you're pregnant with a second child, right? Nicole Richie: Yes, yes I am. King: And the father [Joel Madden] is the same? Nicole Richie: Yes. King: You going to get married? Nicole Richie: Eventually, yes. King: But that's not important or paramount? Nicole Richie: I think for both of us, we are going to do it because we want to, not because that's what you do. King: What kind of grandfather is he? Nicole Richie: Well, he's very animated. He smiles like this all the time, and so he's nothing but fun for Harlow. She absolutely loves him.  Watch Nicole Richie talk about her daughter » . King: Nicole, you've been through some turbulent times. You've had drug abuse, wild-child behavior. Entered rehab in 2003. How have you come through all of that? Nicole Richie: With the support of my family, really. I've always stayed really close with my mother [Brenda] and my father. I have really great friends. And I just have a really great circle around me who support me no matter what, don't judge me no matter how low I've ever gotten. King: How did you deal with it, Lionel? Lionel Richie: It gave me an amazing opportunity to step up to the plate. I said to her one day: I have some good news and I have some bad news. I said the bad news is that Nicole is going to die. The good news is, she doesn't have to. I remember that look on her face of sheer panic. And I said the only person who is going to be able to save Nicole is Nicole. And she went away and about three weeks later I got a phone saying, 'Dad, I want to go into rehab.' And when she checked into rehab, her mother and I checked into rehab with her. King: What was the toughest part about rehab? Nicole Richie: It was right before ""The Simple Life"" came out. Just the fact that I couldn't do it in private really was unfortunate. But we didn't watch TV there or [had no] connection to the outside world, which I thought was really great. So I just focused on being positive there and focused on myself. And my parents were there with me. They came for family week. And so I just focused on that and everything just kind of fell in place.  Watch Nicole Richie talk about rehab » . King: When all of those troubles were going on, didn't it affect [your] performance? Lionel Richie: Thank God for the stage. What the stage was for me was an outlet. It gave me a chance to kind of get away from it for a moment. King: You said that you were not a good dad to Nicole growing up ... wasn't there for her. Do you regret that? Lionel Richie: I was trying to be Lionel Richie. There is a part of [me] that's guilty because I wish I could have been there more for her, but I was trying to make it as the solo guy at that time. King: What kind of dad was he? Nicole Richie: I really hate when he says that. I hate when he says that he wasn't a good dad because my memory of my childhood was nothing but good memories. I remember him coming down in the kitchen in the morning and singing songs and us playing. Was he gone a lot? Yeah. But he also toured a lot. Even when he and my mom divorced, it was kind of like he was on tour, so I was kind of OK with it. And he's not perfect, he's a human and we went through phases of not speaking. I could sit here and I could say that I was a terrible daughter, too, but I am not going to say that. King: How do you like her boyfriend [Joel Madden]? Lionel Richie: Love him. Love him. King: Don't you want them to get married? Lionel Richie: I want them to take their time. I'm more interested in whether they like each other and whether they're best friends. Because that means they'll be great parents forever. King [to Nicole]: You were adopted. Nicole Richie: Yes. Lionel Richie: When we adopted, [she] was 8, yes. When we first met her, she was 3 1/2. King: Took five years? Lionel Richie: She stayed with us for two years before we even thought about legal guardianship. King: Was there a doubt about doing it? Lionel Richie: It was a tremendous responsibility, but I fell in love. Brenda fell in love. And once you fall in love, you don't know anything else.","Lionel Richie likes father of his grandchild; says Nicole shouldn't rush marriage .

"(CNN) -- Launched in 1995, the Airbus A330-200 is the newest member of the European aircraft manufacturer's twinjet family. The incident involves an Air France Airbus A330-200. With a range of 12,500 km (6,750 nautical miles) and the capacity to carry 253 passengers, the A330-200 is extremely well-regarded as a medium to long-range airliner. There are 600 currently in service with 82 airlines, including Air France, worldwide. Airbus has a further 300 orders for the aircraft. According to aviation expert Kieran Daly, the A330-200 is a ""reliable, ultra-modern, state-of-the-art airplane,"" with an impeccable safety record. He told CNN that there has only been one reported incident when an aircraft of this type has crashed. ""The incident took place in 1994 before the aircraft came into service,"" he said. ""It was being flown in test-mode by pilots who were putting it through some extreme maneuvers before it came down. ""Therefore the crash was not caused by the plane itself. ""It is very well-designed and well-equipped, with equally modern and reliable General Electric CF-6 engines."" Air France has said that Flight AF 447 sent an automatic signal indicating electrical problems while going through strong turbulence early in its 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.  Why it took so long to report the aircraft missing » . However, Daly said that it would take extremely violent weather conditions to cause the catastrophic failure of an aircraft of this size. ""These planes are extremely robust and widely used on transatlantic routes and across Asia,"" he said. ""They are equipped with an array of sophisticated communication equipment, so it must have been something extremely sudden to cause the loss of contact."" There has also been speculation that the Paris-bound flight was struck by lightning, but that should not bring down a modern airliner, former Airbus pilot John Wiley told CNN. According to Air France, the captain of Flight AF 447 had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330/A340 aircraft. Of the two first officers, one had flown 3,000 flight hours (800 of which on the Airbus A330/A340) and the other 6,600 (2,600 on the Airbus A330/A340). The aircraft had totaled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005. Its last maintenance check in the hangar took place on 16 April 2009. The larger A330-300 aircraft from Airbus entered service in 1993 and has a capacity of up to 335 passengers. It too has an impressive safety record, despite a couple of incidents in the last 10 years. In August 2001, a Canadian airliner operated by Air Transat experienced double engine failure while traveling to Portugal. Miraculously the captain was able to perform an emergency landing in the Azores by gliding the powerless plane for almost 18 minutes. Last year, an A330-303 was forced to make an emergency landing in Australia after a sudden change in altitude injured 74 passengers. Qantas Flight 72 was flying from Singapore to the western Australian city of Perth when a sudden change of altitude caused abrasions, contusions, fractures and other injuries. The cause of the sudden drop remains under investigation.","The Airbus A330-200 was launched in 1995 .

"Editor's note: Abigail Thernstrom is the author of ""Voting Rights -- and Wrongs: The Elusive Quest for Racially Fair Elections,"" published last month by AEI Press. She is the vice-chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Her writing can be found at http://www.thernstrom.com/. Abigail Thernstrom says an impressive biography isn't a qualification for the Supreme Court. (CNN) -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor is all but certain to be confirmed as an associate justice on the Supreme Court. It is close to unimaginable that the Republicans will peel off enough Democratic votes to stop Senate confirmation. She's a first: a Latina. And she has an impressive life history: Raised in a housing project by a single mother, she went to Princeton and then to Yale Law School. It's a classic American overcoming-the-odds story, but, while admirable, it is not a qualification for the highest court in the land. Democrats themselves have often implicitly made the same point -- about other minority appointees, in fact. They never saw the much humbler origins of Justice Clarence Thomas as an argument for his elevation to the Court. And they used a filibuster to stop Bush appointee Miguel Estrada from getting a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which they feared would be a springboard to the Supreme Court. Estrada is a Honduran who arrived in America at age 17 with only limited command of English; he was also raised by a single mother and made it to Harvard Law School, where he was editor of the law review. Supporters of Sotomayor argue that she will add needed ""diversity"" to the Court. Yet, with her confirmation, there will be six Catholics, two Jews and one Protestant. For many Americans, religious affiliation is more important in defining an individual than race or ethnicity. But no one is complaining about ""too many"" Catholics or Jews -- thankfully. America is supposed to be a land in which individuals are seen as ... individuals. Too many, too few: that is the language of un-American quotas. Sotomayor has suggested that race and ethnicity, to a substantial degree, define individuals. ""Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences ... our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging,"" she said in a 2001 speech. At her confirmation hearings, she will undoubtedly dance away from such ethnic determinism. But it would appear to be what she believes, since she has reiterated the point several times in different venues. Her supporters also emphasize the ""empathy"" she would bring to the court. It is a quality the president promised he would look for in making court appointments. In a July 2007 campaign speech, he said, ""We need somebody who's got the heart -- the empathy -- to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old, and that's the criteria by which I'll be selecting my judges."" Evidently, however, not all impoverished backgrounds leave you empathetic. The proof is in the pudding, and the pudding appears to be party membership. By definition, conservatives are assumed to lack empathy. As Berkeley professor George Lakoff has argued, ""Empathy is at the heart of progressive thought. ... Progressives care about others as well as themselves."" And, by implication, conservatives don't. Empathy has thus become a code word for progressive politics -- the likelihood that, as a justice, the nominee will take politically liberal positions. Public policy preferences driving Supreme Court decisions? What a shock. Some justices have much more respect for the law than others, but if the opinions were not often judgments driven by political values as well, they would be less predictable. Most court-watchers thought (correctly, as it turned out) that the recent New Haven firefighters' case would come down four-four, with only Justice Anthony Kennedy's vote hard to call. The results of an exam for promotion within the New Haven fire department had been thrown out because, with one exception, all of the successful candidates were white -- the ""wrong"" color, according to the reasoning of the city and Sotomayor. One can argue that race discrimination decisions do not involve ideology and are based on strictly legal grounds, but if so, it is passing strange that in busing, affirmative action and other race-related cases, even before the oral argument is heard we almost always know which justices will take what positions. Liberals still support busing, for instance; conservatives oppose it. Sotomayor will replace another reliable liberal, Justice David Souter, and so the ideological balance on the court will not change. And yet, perhaps as a consequence of her implicit embrace of quotas and identity politics, she has come to the Senate hearings with public support that is unusually low; only 47 percent of Americans say they want her confirmed, a recent CNN poll found. Nevertheless, Republicans are likely to tread softly in the hearings. Race-related issues make them nervous, and Latinos are a fast-growing group with increasing political clout, especially in such swing states as Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Virginia. Barring the totally unexpected, Sotomayor's confirmation will thus be a cakewalk. Let us hope that the public's pessimism proves to be misguided and she turns out to be a lawyer's lawyer and not an ethnic activist who tends to let the usual political definition of ""empathy"" drive her opinions. There is reason to worry: She will have lifetime tenure on an institution with enormous power. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Abigail Thernstrom.","Abigail Thernstrom: Sonia Sotomayor's life story is a compelling one .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan have swooped to sign Standard Liege defender Oguchi Onyewu on a three-year contract -- making him the first American to appear in Serie A since Alexi Lalas in 1996. Onyewu will become the first American since Alexi Lalas to appear in Italian Serie A after joining AC Milan. Onyewu, who has also played in the English Premier League with Newcastle United, has moved to the San Siro on a free transfer after impressing with some superb displays during the United States' run to the Confederations Cup final. The 27-year-old has played 38 times for his country, scoring five goals.Latest transfer gossip and rumors . ""This transaction shows once again the excellent friendly relationship between our club and Belgian club Standard Liege, particularly their executive vice-president Luciano D'Onofrio,"" said a statement on Milan's official Web site. The six-foot four-inch player was born in Washington DC to Nigerian parents but began his club career at Metz in France in 2002. He was loaned out to La Louviere in Belgium in 2003 and his form there earnt him a move to Liege, where he won two Belgian titles. He then joined Newcastle on loan, playing 11 league matches. However, the  transfer is unlikely to appease the Milan supporters who are unhappy with the summer sale of Brazilian superstar Kaka to Real Madrid -- and the departure of coach Carlo Ancelotti to Chelsea. About 300 fans protested outside the club's Milanello base on the first day of pre-season training on Monday, complaining at the lack of big name signings.","AC Milan swoop to sign up American international defender Oguchi Onyewu .

"(CNN) -- Renee Pernice, a 35-year-old mother of two young children, vanished from her home in Kansas City, Missouri, shortly after New Year's this year. She hasn't been heard from since. Renee Pernice is pictured here with her two sons and husband, Shon. Police believe foul play is involved, yet they have not found her body. No one has been arrested in the case. Police have not named her husband, Shon Pernice, as a person of interest or a suspect in the case. However, ""he's the last known person to see her alive,"" said Doug Niemeier, a sergeant with the Kansas City Police Department. Six months after Renee Pernice disappeared, police say they still have questions about her husband in the days after her disappearance, including why he allegedly accessed a local fire department's hazardous materials building around 4:30 a.m. January 3. ""It should be noted that multiple types of cleaners, solvents and cleaning supplies are stored at Station #5,"" a police affidavit says. Attorneys for Shon Pernice declined to comment for this story. Police and family say Renee was pursuing a divorce around the time she disappeared. A local firefighter, Shon Pernice has said he was not involved in her disappearance. He told a local activist in March that ""I didn't harm my wife one bit. Not at all."" In that interview, one of the few in which he's referenced his wife's disappearance, he added, ""It's gut-wrenching thinking that either she's got a rich-ass doctor boyfriend somewhere and she's happy, or she's dead."" Since his wife disappeared, Shon Pernice has been arrested twice on unrelated charges: once for allegedly stealing a neighbor's gun and another time for disturbing the peace in an incident with that same neighbor this past July Fourth weekend. ""As everybody knows, my wife has been missing since January 2,"" he told CNN affiliate KCTV5. ""This is what it stems from. Basically what the media ... has portrayed of me -- of the whole situation. There's a lot of people that don't like me."" The couple's two sons, ages 6 and 9, remain in the care of the father, although Renee Pernice's mother has sought custody of them. ""There is a lot that just isn't right,"" said Rick Pretz, the missing woman's father. ""It's not a stable environment for the children."" Renee Pernice was known for being a caring mother, a talented nurse at St. Luke's Hospital and a gentle animal lover always surrounded by dogs. Neighbors say they last saw her in her backyard with her dogs the morning of Friday, January 2, 2009. When police searched the home, they say they found her purse, coat and other items still in the house. Her car was in the garage. Police say her cell phone was missing from the house. A homeless man found the phone in grass about 15 miles from her home, in an area Renee Pernice was not known to frequent, police say. It was found around midnight January 3, the affidavit says. Since then, police and volunteer teams have searched the area extensively, but they have found nothing. ""Family members and common friends of both Shon and Renee told police that Renee was not the kind of mother who would separate herself from her children for any reason,"" the affidavit says. ""Family members advised that finding Renee's purse at the residence was highly unusual as she never went anywhere without her purse."" According to the affidavit, investigators watched Shon Pernice drive away from the home with his wife's dog and drop it off at a park a few days after he reported his wife missing. The affidavit also alleges that a drop of blood was found in the garage. However, authorities have not released whether it matched Renee Pernice or her husband. According to Renee Pernice's family, she was not the kind of person to take off on her own without letting her family know where she was. ""I spoke to her just the night before at 7 p.m. on the phone,"" her father told CNN. ""She would never leave her two sons like this."" The family is offering a $25,000 reward for any information leading to the whereabouts of Renee Pernice. A white truck that could be related to her disappearance was captured on a surveillance tape in the area where her cell phone was found, and police have released a photo of it. Anyone who may have lent such a truck at the time the surveillance image was taken is being asked to come forward. Renee Pernice is white, stands 5 feet, 7 inches tall, and has brown hair and blue eyes. Anyone with information is urged to call the Kansas City Police Department at 1-816-474-TIPS.

"(CNN) -- A woman and three children were killed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when a suspected robber fleeing in a car jumped a curb and struck them, police said Thursday. Four people were killed after a car fleeing police struck a home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday. ""He literally cut a tree in half,"" Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey said, ""then hit the 1-year-old, [who] was in a stroller. The other individuals were on the front porch of their own home. He struck with such force that it knocked the concrete steps loose."" Latoya Smith, 22, died Thursday from injuries in the crash, which occurred shortly after 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in the Fentonville area of north Philadelphia, police Capt. James Clark said. Smith's daughter, Remedy Smith -- who would have turned 1 on Friday -- died at the scene, as did Alicia Griffin, 6, and Gina Rosario, 7, Clark said. Video of the scene showed a crumpled silver Pontiac on the sidewalk, pushed up against the front steps of a house and wedged against a tree.  Watch police commissioner describe carnage » . Donta Cradock, 18, the alleged driver of the gray Pontiac, faces charges for theft of a motorcycle, the crime that allegedly triggered his flight, police said. Other charges are pending approval from the district attorney's office, police said. ""We're hopeful that it will be four counts of murder,"" Clark said. Cradock and an alleged accomplice, Ivan Rodriguez, 20, stole a motorcycle at gunpoint around 7:30 p.m., he said. Rodriguez fled the scene on the motorcycle, while Cradock drove away in the Pontiac, Clark said. An unidentified person told a traffic police officer in the area about the alleged robbery and pointed out the Pontiac, he said. The police officer followed the car and tried to stop it at a traffic light, Clark said. ""At that point the Pontiac fled at a high rate of speed,"" he said. The officer followed the vehicle, but lost sight of it, Clark said. The officer was not close enough to chase the car, police said, but eventually came across what Clark called a ""horrific accident."" Cradock was thrown from the Pontiac and is in the hospital, Clark said. He said a gun was recovered on the suspect. Rodriguez was arrested at his home, Clark said, and faces a theft charge. Both men have ""very extensive criminal histories,"" Ramsey said. Bench warrants were out on them at the time of their arrest, Clark said.

"(CNN) -- Agents arrested 20 out of 42 people accused in a California Medicaid fraud ring that allegedly bilked the state out of nearly $4.6 million and put the lives of disabled children at risk, a prosecutor said. The defendants are accused of either posing as licensed nurses or organizing a scheme to send unlicensed nurses to provide home- or school-based care to disabled patients, many of them children with cerebral palsy or other developmental disabilities, the office of the U.S. attorney for central California said in a written statement. The long defendant's list makes the case the largest of Medicaid fraud in California, U.S. Attorney Thomas O'Brien said in the statement. Each defendant has been charged with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and at least one count of health care fraud, according to the statement. Some parents and patients became suspicious of the nurses when they noticed their lack of skills. ""In one case, a 'nurse' was unable to replace a tracheotomy tube that had fallen out of a young patient's neck. In another case, an impostor nurse simply fled a medical situation when she apparently was unable to provide assistance,"" according to the statement. Some of the unlicensed nurses had foreign training, but never passed a U.S. qualifying nursing exam, the attorney's office said, while others had no medical training at all. Two defendants -- Susan Bendigo and Priscilla Villabroza, the accused ringleaders -- were charged separately. Bendigo and Villabroza instructed the workers to lie about their status and used the names of licensed nurses on documents, the indictment says. Villabroza operated a home health agency -- the Santa Fe Springs company Medicare Plus Home Health Providers -- the indictment said. Villabroza, a registered nurse, knowingly hired unlicensed nurses and billed Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, for the work of licensed vocational nurses from August 2004 through 2007, the indictment alleges. Villabroza pleaded guilty last year to five federal counts of health care fraud, the attorney's office said. Bendigo, a registered nurse, was also director of Santa Fe Springs' Excel Plus Home Health Services, which provided nurses to home health agencies, according to the indictment. Bendigo also was charged last year but fled the country, the statement said. Officials think she is hiding in the Philippines, said U.S. attorney's spokesman Thom Mrozek. Villabroza is awaiting sentencing, and could be sent to prison for up to 50 years, Mrozek said. Each of the 42 new defendants faces a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison for each charge if convicted, according to the statement.","Prosecutor: Long defendants list makes case the largest Medicaid fraud in California .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hope was 14 years old when her uncle raped her. Betty Makoni founded the Girl Child Network to help Zimbabwe's young sexual abuse victims. ""He trapped me to the ground and covered my mouth with his hand,"" said the 18-year-old from Zimbabwe. ""He threatened to kill me if I ever told anybody."" So, she kept quiet. ""After a while people around the villages started saying that I looked pregnant,"" she said. Hope was not only pregnant, but her uncle had infected her with HIV. Like many young girls in Zimbabwe, Hope was the victim of a widely held belief that if a man with HIV or AIDS rapes a virgin he will be cured of his disease. This so-called virgin myth, perpetuated by Zimbabwe's traditional healers, has led to the rape of hundreds of girls, according to UNICEF. Some of those victims are too young to walk, much less protect themselves. Betty Makoni has fought for nearly a decade to protect her country's young girls from sexual abuse. And she's witnessed some of the worst cases of the myth in action. ""The youngest girl I ever came across was a day-old baby who was raped,"" said Makoni, 37. Through her Girl Child Network (GCN), Makoni has helped rescue 35,000 girls from abuse -- including Hope; thousands more have found an empowering community and a public forum in which to speak out. ""Ten girls per day report rape cases,"" she said. ""It means if we keep quiet, at least 3,600 girls per year may just be contracting HIV and AIDS."" Makoni's own tragic experiences fuel her fierce determination. ""I was raped when I was 6 years old,"" she recalled. Her attacker was a local shopkeeper. Makoni said her mother would not allow her to report the abuse. ""She said, 'Shh, we don't say that in public,' "" Makoni remembered. ""I had no shoulder to cry on."" Three years later, she witnessed her father murder her mother. In that moment, Makoni said she realized the potentially deadly consequence of a woman's silence. ""I told myself that no girl or woman will suffer the same again,"" she said. Believing an education would provide her the best opportunity and means to speak out, Makoni earned two university degrees and became a teacher. While teaching, she noticed that girls were dropping out of school at an alarming rate. She approached her students with an idea. ""I [said] to girls, 'Let's have our own space where we talk and find solutions,' "" Makoni said. Girl Child Network was born.  Watch Makoni help young girls find safety and empowerment in Zimbabwe » . By the end of the first year, there were 100 GCN clubs throughout Zimbabwe where girls could find support. Makoni said she was not surprised: ""Every woman and girl identified with the issues that we were raising,"" she said. In 2000, she quit her teaching job to volunteer with GCN full time. ""I decided to become an advocate because I walked my own journey to survival,"" she said. The following year Makoni successfully procured a piece of land and opened the organization's first empowerment village, designed to provide a haven for girls who have been abused. Girls are either rescued or referred to the village by social services, the police and the community. The healing begins as soon as a girl arrives. ""In the first 72 hours, a girl is provided with emergency medication, reinstatement in school, as well as counseling,"" said Makoni. It is important to her that the girls are in charge of their own healing. ""It gives them the confidence to transform from victims to leaders,"" she explained. The process helped Hope work through the times when she said ""I thought my life had come to end."" ""They offered all they could ... as I was in a traumatized state,"" she said. ""I really appreciate what [Betty Makoni] has done and is doing in my life."" Today, GCN has grown to 700 girls' clubs and three empowerment villages across Zimbabwe. An estimated 300,000 girls have received assistance. For those who were at greatest risk, Makoni believes that help was especially critical. ""If my organization didn't exist, the 35,000 girls I've saved from rape and abuse could have died by now,"" she said. But for Makoni, speaking out came with a high personal cost. In 2008, she was forced to flee her native country. ""I left Zimbabwe because my life was in danger as a result of my project being interpreted politically.""  Watch Makoni describe her reasons for leaving her homeland » . Today, she lives with her family in the United Kingdom. She still serves as executive director of her organization and shows no signs of slowing down. GCN has partnered with the DOVE project, a group based in Essex, England, that deals with domestic violence. ""We are now bringing the girls from a local community to the international scene,"" she said. Her efforts in Zimbabwe will also be highlighted in an upcoming documentary, Tapestries of Hope. Makoni says nothing will end her fight for the rights of women and girls. ""This is the job I have always wanted to do, because it gives me fulfillment. And in girls I see myself every day.""

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono held a commanding lead in national elections Wednesday, according to the latest exit polls. A woman votes at a polling station in Indonesia. An average of six exit polls showed the incumbent holding about 60 percent of the vote compared to 27 percent for former President Megawati Sukarnoputri and 12 percent for Yudhoyono's vice president, Yusuf Kalla. Official results are expected no sooner than next week. Indonesia has 175 million registered voters spread over 17,000 islands. It was the country's second direct election since the authoritarian regime of dictator Suharto fell in 1998, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. Analysts and polls, ahead of the vote, predicted Yudhoyono -- riding high on the country's economic strength -- would win a second term.  Watch as incumbent expected to win election » . In 2004, Yudhoyono defeated then-incumbent Megawati in a runoff election.  Watch more on the election » . Yudhoyono ""has positive global image; relations with the American government have been the best in all the time that I have been here, the last 30 years,"" said James Castle, who analyzes Indonesia's politics and economy. ""He's very popular in the foreign community and, to be honest, if he's not re-elected, the markets will react negatively for a month or so."" Yudhoyono's Democratic Party was the only single party to get enough votes in April's legislative elections to nominate a candidate on its own. Kalla's Golkar Party came in second and Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, or PDI-P, placed third. Kalla and Megawati had to form coalitions with other parties to run for president. Kalla had hoped voters would give him some of the credit for Indonesia's economic successes which occurred under his term as vice president. Kalla and Megawati had to form coalitions with other parties to run for president.  See a photo slideshow of Indonesians talking about who they will vote for » . Yudhoyono is known as ""Mr. Clean"" because of his anti-corruption efforts. He has gained popularity for his handling of the 2004 tsunami recovery and the country's battle against terrorism. Indonesia has had impressive economic growth over the past five years, though how much direct credit Yudhoyono can take for that is questionable. And despite Indonesia posting an average of 5.9 percent annual growth during his presidency, little of that has trickled down to the country's poor. Yudhoyono's opponents say he is too liberal, is too skewed toward the west, and doesn't pay enough attention to the 40 million Indonesians living below the poverty line. Still, the country is exhibiting surprising resilience in the face of the global economic downturn. Growth topped 6 percent last year, and Indonesia was the fastest-growing economy in southeast Asia in the first quarter of this year.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A leader of the conservative ""Blue Dog"" Democrats told CNN Wednesday he and other group members may vote to block House Democrats' health care bill from passing a key committee if they don't get some of the changes they want. Rep. Mike Ross, D-Arkansas, is a leading negotiator for the Blue Dog Democrats on health care. ""We remain opposed to the current bill, and we continue to meet several times a day to decide how we're going to proceed and what amendments we will be offering as Blue Dogs on the committees,"" said Rep. Mike Ross, D-Arkansas. Ross said the bill unveiled Tuesday by House Democratic leaders did not address concerns he and other conservative Democrats outlined in a letter late last week to Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The conservative Democrats don't believe the legislation contains sufficient reforms to control costs in the health care system and believe additional savings can be found. Their letter to leaders raised concerns about new mandates on small businesses. Blue Dogs also say the bill fails to fix the inequities in the current system for health care costs for rural doctors and hospitals. The Energy and Commerce committee, along with two other House committees, is scheduled to take up the bill Thursday. Democrats outnumber Republicans 36-23 on the Energy and Commerce committee, which contains eight Blue Dogs, including Ross. If seven Democrats vote with Republicans against the bill, it would fail to advance to the House floor. Asked whether the Blue Dogs on Energy and Commerce are considering voting as a group against the bill if it remains unchanged, Ross replied, ""absolutely."" He didn't give details on changes the Blue Dogs want. But he did say he wasn't satisfied with the penalty exemption for small businesses that don't provide health insurance for employees. An earlier draft of the Democrats' bill exempted businesses from paying a penalty if their payrolls were less than $100,000. Democratic leaders raised that payroll amount to $250,000.","Rep.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Hundreds of gay men have been tortured and killed in Iraq in recent months, some by the nation's security forces, Human Rights Watch said Monday. Iraqi clerics say homosexuality must be eradicated but warn against anti-gay violence. Interviews with doctors indicate hundreds of men had been killed, but the exact number was unclear because of the stigma associated with homosexuality in Iraq, the New York-based watchdog group said in its report. ""Iraq's leaders are supposed to defend all Iraqis, not abandon them to armed agents of hate,"" said Scott Long, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. ""Turning a blind eye to torture and murder threatens the rights and life of every Iraqi."" Four victims who spoke to CNN gave accounts of the attacks, which they say have intensified in the past few months. ""In 2004, militias and unknown groups started to go after the gays ... but the peak was six months ago,"" said Qaisar, who uses a pseudonym for fear of reprisal. ""It has become wide scale war against gays in Iraq."" Iraqi officials acknowledged that the nation's culture stigmatizes homosexuality, but said the government does not condone such attacks. Authorities are unable to provide homosexuals with special protection, said government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. According to Human Rights Watch, which is urging a government crackdown, attackers target people on the streets or storm homes, where they conduct interrogations and demand names of suspected gay men. Many end up in hospitals and morgues, the organization said, basing its conclusion on reports from doctors. Men have been threatened with ""honor killings"" by relatives worried that their ""unmanly behavior"" will ruin the family's reputation, Human Rights Watch said.  Watch Iraqi men discuss attacks » . Killings, kidnappings and torture of those suspected of homosexual conduct have intensified in areas such as the Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City, the watchdog said. ""The Shiite people started this war and especially what happened in Sadr City,"" Qaisar said, adding that his sister-in-law had warned him against going to the area. Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army militia, which is active in Sadr City, has joined in the attacks and defends its actions as a way to stop the ""feminization"" of Iraqi men, the report said. ""We have testimony that indicates that the nation's security forces are taking part in the attacks,"" Long said. The group interviewed more than 50 people who gave accounts of abuses, beatings and stops at security checkpoints, he said. ""When the gay killings started and when they started go(ing) after them at checkpoints ... we started to change our look,"" said Basim, who also used a pseudonym. ""These killings point to the continuing and lethal failure of Iraq's post-occupation authorities to establish the rule of law and protect their citizens,"" said Rasha Moumneh, Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch. A provision from the Saddam Hussein era endorses crimes committed ""with honorable motives,"" according to the organization. The government spokesman said the provision was popular during the Saddam era, but is not used today. He added that there is a push to educate police about human rights. Attacks against civilians, including homosexuals, are not allowed, al-Dabbagh said.","Human Rights Watch says people are targeted on the streets and interrogated .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A drunk passenger who tried to set the curtains of a Boeing 767 on fire during a trans-Atlantic flight is in custody in Vienna, Austria, the Transportation Security Administration said Thursday. A drunk Delta passenger was placed in custody after he tried to light curtains on fire during a flight. There was no apparent connection to terrorism, officials said. Zoltan Lensky, 25, a Slovakian citizen, was on Delta Flight 40 from Atlanta, Georgia, to Vienna Wednesday night when flight attendants refused his request for more liquor. According to TSA spokesman Christopher White, Lensky slapped a flight attendant on the hand, moved forward in the cabin, pulled out a lighter and tried to ignite the curtains around the flight attendants' rest area. A federal air marshal on the flight arrested Lensky and put him in handcuffs, White said. Lensky was handed over to authorities in Vienna when the flight landed. It is policy for air marshals never to fly alone. According to White, the other air marshal, or marshals, on the Delta flight remained undercover in case Lensky was being used as a diversion. However, ""he was nothing but an intoxicated passenger,"" said White.","A drunk passenger tried to set the curtains of a Boeing 767 on fire .

"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida (CNN) -- Just after midnight on July 16, 1969, Jack King kissed his wife goodbye at their Cocoa Beach, Florida home, jumped in his car, and drove to Dunkin' Donuts for a doughnut and a cup of coffee. Jack King became the voice of the Apollo 11 launch. ""It was quite a thrilling time,"" he says. It was the start of a big day: the launch of a Saturn V rocket, lifting man from the face of the Earth to the face of the moon. King, the chief of public information at Kennedy Space Center, would become known that day as the voice of Apollo 11. In the wee hours of the morning, he followed his launch-day routine. But as he headed across the causeway to the space center, King lost sight of the lagoon he normally passed -- the view obstructed by RVs and trailers that had secured their spots for a view of the moon launch. ""The town was very much alive; the vibrancy was entirely different. Three-quarters of a million people had come into the area to view the launch, so it was quite a thrilling time,"" says King, now 78. ""When I'd cross the bridge over the Banana River heading to the Space Center, I'd pull off onto the side of the road, get out of the car, and there was the Saturn V, bathed in the floodlights, just glowing.""  Hear the voice of King, watch as Apollo took off for moon » . ""It was a just a very impressive, majestic rocket."" Launch manager Paul Donnelly recalls, ""We launched at 9:32 that morning."" He reported for work the night before to oversee the hazardous and delicate operation of fueling the three-stage rocket. ""Everything on Apollo 11 went just beautiful, no real problems."" He says he always told the astronauts, ""The launch crew wishes you good luck and Godspeed."" As the hatch closed that day, he says he was thinking, ""Go! Go! Go! Let's do it.""  See the men who've walked the moon » . Forty years after America's launch of Apollo 11, the U.S. space program is at a different crossroads, challenged in recent years to return to the moon and to recapture the ambition that launched the space race in 1961. Back then, a dazzled nation heard the big dreams of a youthful Ivy League-educated, senator-turned president. ""I believe,"" President John F. Kennedy told Congress, ""that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth."" That was the same year Barack Obama was born. Forty-eight years later, Obama, a similarly youthful Ivy League-educated former senator, is now in charge, and the nation wonders what his vision is for the U.S. space program.  Watch Buzz Aldrin: U.S. should go to Mars » . Donnelly, now 86, says he recalls the launch of Apollo 11 as if it were yesterday. He also says he believes President Obama could re-energize the space program. Donnelly believed the moon mission would ultimately come to pass, even after Kennedy had been assassinated. ""It didn't distract me or the people here,"" Donnelly said referring to the launch team. The pressure was on for the United States to get to that fateful launch day, especially given the intense competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. ""It was a missile race before it was a space race,"" said King, a former reporter for The Associated Press. By the time Alan Shepard became the first American in space in 1961, the Russians had already flown two cosmonauts. The Russians, backed by Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev, were also working with a much more powerful rocket. ""The challenges were tremendous. Khruschev appeared at the U.N., slammed his shoe and said -- 'We're going to bury you,' "" King recalls. ""Looking back it was a critical decade, the '60s."" John Logsdon, who holds the Charles A. Lindbergh chair in aerospace history at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum, says for the Kennedy administration, the moon mission was about more than the space race itself. It was also an exercise in soft power -- ""an attempt to show the world the technological strength of the United States in a very visible but peaceful way."" In striking out for the moon, the United States started on fairly equal footing with the Soviets because at that time, neither had a rocket large enough for a moon mission. One advantage for the United States was the expertise of rocket scientist Werner Von Braun. In 1945, Von Braun and his team of engineers were brought from Nazi Germany, where during World War II they advanced the science of rocket propulsion for military applications. ""Von Braun and his rocket team had plans for space exploration for a long time, and they had designed increasingly larger rockets,"" Logsdon says. ""Their first thought was to build a really large rocket called 'Nova' that would be 50 percent bigger than the Saturn V that we used to go to the moon. It would have been a gigantic rocket."" In the launch control center at what was then known as Cape Kennedy, on July 16, 1969, there were about 400 engineers and technicians who had worked together to this point, for years. ""We were close,"" says Donnelly. Were there nerves and emotions inside Mission Control? Donnelly says there was a sense of confidence, but beyond that, the team worked methodically through the hundreds of steps involved in the moon launch. Once the astronauts were in the space capsule and the hatch closed, Donnelly says, emotions picked up. Jack King recalls that day as ""one of the smoothest Saturn V countdowns that I ever went through. For most of the count, we were probably 10 or 15 minutes ahead."" Then, with the launch seconds away, ""We'd go, 'Guidance is internal 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9; ignition sequence start, 6, 5,4,3, 2; all engines running, commit, liftoff.'"" King recalls looking over his shoulder and seeing the 365-foot rocket glowing in the morning sun. ""I see this magnificent thing is sitting in a bed of flames there on the launch pad,"" he says. Unlike the jackrabbit-launch of a space shuttle, King says the moon rocket lumbered away. ""The Saturn V took close to seven seconds just to clear the tower."" Forty years later, ""the future is under review,"" says Logsdon. A blue-ribbon panel, led by former Lockheed Martin chief Norm Augustine, is taking stock of the nation's human space flight program, with a report to President Obama due by the end of this summer. ""There is a high degree of uncertainty right now,"" says Logsdon. Among the biggest questions: Will the United States return to the moon by 2020, as envisioned by former President George W. Bush, or will they lead a coalition of countries into space in the same way the international space station has operated?

"Editor's Note: This is the fourth in a five-part series exploring Judge Sonia Sotomayor's background and life with those who know her, revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a Supreme Court justice. Sonia Sotomayor is flanked by her supervisor, Warren Murray, and D.A. Robert Morgenthau, right, in 1983. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor graduated with honors from Ivy League schools. But she may have learned some of her most memorable lessons as a young prosecutor, following police into abandoned tenements and tracking down witnesses on the grimy streets of New York. Sotomayor joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office in 1979 during an epic crime wave. Muggings, burglaries and assaults were rampant; homicides topped 1,800 a year. She was recruited from Yale Law School by Robert M. Morgenthau, Manhattan's district attorney. She was 25, and her starting salary was $17,000. The cases in Trial Bureau 50 seasoned the idealistic young lawyer and honed her trial skills. She could shred a witness on cross-examination and move a jury to tears, former colleagues recalled. New York City was awash in heroin, street crime and gun violence. To prepare for trials, she followed police into tenement shooting galleries, scaled rickety staircases in dilapidated buildings and fought off the stench of squalor to talk to reluctant witnesses. Sotomayor's former colleagues and her legal foes describe her as intense, driven and politically astute. As a prosecutor, she had a commanding presence and put in long hours, chugging several cans a day of the diet soft drink Tab and chain-smoking cigarettes. (She no longer smokes.)  Watch how she made an impression on fellow prosecutors » . Trial Bureau 50, with its crowded cubicles and walls painted the color of putty, has sent many lawyers onto distinguished careers in public service, including the late Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and John Kennedy Jr. Sotomayor's five years there, say Manhattan prosecutors past and present, make her uniquely qualified for the nation's highest court. If confirmed, she would be the only justice who prosecuted criminal cases, presided over them and handled criminal appeals.  See what would set Sotomayor apart on the court » . ""If you can handle a felony case load in New York County, you can run a small country,"" said Warren Murray, who ran the bureau when Sotomayor worked there, and still does. ""I think Sonia's most interesting days were in the district attorney's office,"" said Hugh H. Mo, a former homicide prosecutor who supervised Sotomayor and tried cases with her. ""You can grow up in the projects and still be very sheltered. She got her education on the streets of Harlem."" Like most rookies, Sotomayor started with misdemeanors, juggling 60 to 80 cases at a time, working 12-hour days in the 1930s-era building on the tip of Manhattan, and pulling an occasional shift in night court. ""Some of the judges liked to use the new assistants to clear their calendars,"" Morgenthau recalled. ""She quickly established herself as somebody the judges couldn't push around."" On her second trial, Sotomayor met Dawn Cardi, a rookie Legal Aid lawyer who was trying her first case. They became best friends. ""We were both baby attorneys,"" Cardi said. ""She's really, really smart and very well-prepared. She was an excellent trial attorney. She had a talent for it."" Another defense attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, recalled Sotomayor as ""a very zealous prosecutor,"" adding, ""She didn't see gray. She only saw black and white."" Sotomayor moved up quickly in the D.A.'s office. It wasn't long before she was prosecuting murder cases. To prepare for trials, she hit the streets, working junkies and street characters for information and comforting grieving families. The work was sometimes unnerving, but it could also provide an adrenalin rush. ""You could feel the violence. It was palpable,"" said Mo, who with Sotomayor accompanied detectives of Harlem's 28th precinct into top-floor apartments in six-story tenements to prepare for what became known as the ""Tarzan Burglar"" case. ""Normal people do not walk into these buildings,"" he recalled. ""They were hangouts for drug addicts."" Robert M. Morgenthau remembers Sotomayor for her role in both the Tarzan Burglar case and in winning the office's first conviction under a rewritten child pornography law. Sotomayor mentioned the lessons of the Tarzan case during her confirmation hearings. She said the case taught her ""the tragic consequences of needless deaths."" A family was destroyed after one of the siblings was killed by a bullet in the head, she said. ""They scattered to the four winds, and only one brother remained in New York who could testify,"" she said Tuesday. The Tarzan case was Sotomayor's rite of passage as a prosecutor. She sat second chair, meaning she assisted Mo, the lead prosecutor, at the murder trial of Richard Maddicks. Read the complaint (pdf) Maddicks earned his nickname by swinging from building to building with rope and cables, Mo said. Along his route, he burglarized top-floor apartments, robbed residents and shot people who got in his way. Sotomayor convinced Maddicks' girlfriend, Mabel Ivey, to testify, pointing out that she could shave years off her sentence in another case if she cooperated. They linked the murder weapon to Maddicks through a neighbor who sold liquor after-hours through a hole cut in the door of his basement apartment. Sotomayor questioned the man, Charles ""Wirdell"" Brown, in court, Mo recalled. It was a high point in the colorful trial. She had the jury in tears as she questioned the girlfriend of a man fatally shot by the Tarzan Burglar. Sotomayor impressed Mo with her organizational skills and ability to boil a complicated case into the essential elements that resonate with jurors. She helped write his opening statement for the five-week trial and -- long before computers and PowerPoint -- crafted People's Exhibit One, a large poster-board chart illustrating the pattern linking the Tarzan Burglar to his crimes. The chart somehow survived nearly three decades in Mo's basement laundry room. During the trial, Sotomayor handled the questioning of half the 40 witnesses. Maddicks was convicted of murder, robbery and related crimes and sentenced to 62½ years to life in prison. He's still serving time ""upstate,"" as Manhattan's prosecutors say. Even 30 years ago, it was obvious Sotomayor was going places.  See her life story told in pictures » . ""Did anybody think she was going to the Supreme Court? Of course not,"" said Cardi. ""But when you look back, you see she always stood out. She was always really a cut above."" ""She was very focused, very ambitious, very competent, very hardworking,"" Mo recalled. What struck him most, he said, was her confidence. ""She wanted to reach the highest pinnacle of the profession and didn't think that was far-fetched. You could see it. She wanted to make history,"" Mo said.","Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor began her legal career as a prosecutor .

"(CNN)  -- The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America will decide this week whether to allow gays and lesbians who are not celibate to serve as clergy members and lay leaders, a spokesman said Tuesday. Current Evangelical Lutheran Church policy allows gay and lesbian clergy, lay people to serve only if celibate. Spokesman John Brooks said the church's 1,045 voting members, who are at a weeklong Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis, Minnesota, will vote Friday on whether to change its policy regarding gay clergy members. The policy allows gays and lesbians to serve as clergy members and lay leaders if they are celibate, Brooks said. Heterosexual clergy are allowed to have sex within marriage. The new policy would allow gays and lesbians in ""publicly accountable, lifelong, monogamous, same-gender relationships,"" to serve as clergy and lay leaders, according to the proposal. Lay leaders are people other than clergy members who are on the professional rosters of the church. A simple majority will decide the vote, Brooks said. He said there is a ""wide range of opinions"" on changing the policy. The body is also scheduled to vote Wednesday on a social statement on sexuality that has been eight years in the making, he said. ""It's important for us because it informs the basis for policy,"" he said. According to its Web site, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has 4.6 million members. The church is not the only denomination that has dealt with the issue of gay clergy. Last month, the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops voted by a wide margin to allow gays and lesbians to become bishops, Episcopal Life reported. In April, the Presbyterian Church (USA) voted against allowing openly gay pastors to serve, according to the Presbyterian News Service.","Evangelical Lutheran Church in America meeting in Minneapolis this week .

"(CNN) -- Undercover officers rescued a baby gorilla from suspected animal traffickers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a national park in the country announced Tuesday. This baby gorilla was rescued from a suspected trafficker in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The gorilla, thought to be about two years old, was hidden at the bottom of a bag and covered with clothes when Congolese Wildlife Authority officers arrested the suspected trafficker on Sunday, Virunga National Park said. The gorilla, a female, was overheated and dehydrated after six hours in transit. She also had a puncture wound on her right leg, among other injuries, and is malnourished, but is responding to treatment, the park said in a statement. It is not clear if the young gorilla's mother is alive or dead, park spokeswoman Samantha Newport said. ""You can assume that a gorilla family was attacked in order for the traffickers to obtain a baby -- but it is impossible to know if a whole family was wiped out, just a few individuals, or none at all,"" she said. ""In most cases gorillas have to die to get a baby -- but we cannot know specifically for this case."" The animal is now being looked after by specially trained carers, Newport said. ""This is of course not an ideal replacement for a mother -- but the best option we have,"" she told CNN via e-mail. Carers often have some veterinary training, but are not fully fledged vets, she added. But gorillas do not do well in situations like this, she warned. ""Gorillas, it is worth noting, are notoriously difficult to keep alive,"" she said. ""Chimps are fighters, as are bonobos. But gorillas -- when the going gets tough -- tend to just shut down. So it really is a critical time right now to ensure she gets the veterinary attention and human warmth that she needs to get through this."" The suspect was getting off a plane from the interior of the country, near the gorillas' habitat, the park said. One person has been charged under the country's law forbidding the destruction of flora and fauna, Newport told CNN. The park did not name the suspect. Gorillas can fetch up to $20,000 on the black market, the head of Virunga National Park said. ""Investigations have yet to reveal where these animals are being sent and who is buying them, but on the ground sources tell us that a baby gorilla can fetch up to $20,000,"" said Emmanuel de Merode, the director. ""We must remember that for each trafficked baby gorilla, several gorillas have probably been killed in the wild."" He led the three-month undercover operation that netted the suspect and the gorilla, the park said. The gorilla is a lowland eastern gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri), also known as the Grauer's Gorilla, a subspecies of Eastern Gorilla only found in the forests of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the park. Virunga National Park calls itself the oldest national park in Africa, established in 1925. It lies in a region that has been badly affected by the long-running war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The gorilla section is in a strategically important area near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. A ranger was killed earlier this year, and rangers lost control of a large part of the park to rebels for over a year. But a census earlier this year suggests mountain gorillas are surviving despite poaching and war. Officials have long said that the 250-square kilometer gorilla reserve in the southern part of Virunga National Park is where around 200 of the world's 700 mountain gorillas live.","Undercover officers rescue a baby gorilla from suspected animal traffickers .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician under investigation in the death of singer Michael Jackson, said in a video posted online Tuesday that he has ""faith the truth will prevail."" In Dr. Conrad Murray's video, posted on YouTube, he tells supporters he has been receiving their messages. Murray, who was with Jackson when he died, recorded the one-minute video in Houston, Texas, on Wednesday and it posted on YouTube Tuesday, the spokeswoman for his lawyer said. ""I have done all I could do,"" Murray said. ""I told the truth, and I have faith the truth will prevail."" The video is the first public comment by Murray since Jackson's June 25 death.

Investigators have searched Murray's home and clinics for evidence related to the anesthetic propofol, according to documents filed in court. A source close to the investigation told CNN that Murray is believed to have administered the drug -- also known by the brand name Diprivan -- to Jackson within 24 hours of his death. Murray has been ""under siege"" by the media and targeted by death threats in recent weeks, according to the spokeswoman. ""I have not been able to thank you personally, which, as you know, is not normal for me,"" Murray said in the video. ""Your messages give me strength and courage and keep me going.

"(CNN) -- Ancient man may have started global warming through massive deforestation and burning that could have permanently altered the Earth's climate, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Virginia and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. Primitive slash-and-burn agriculture permanently changed Earth's climate, according to a new study. The study, published in the scientific journal Quaternary Science Reviews and reported on the University of Virginia's Web site, says over thousands of years, farmers burned down so many forests on such a large scale that huge amounts of carbon dioxide were pumped into the atmosphere. That possibly caused the Earth to warm up and forever changed the climate. Lead study author William Ruddiman is a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a climate scientist. ""It seems like a common-sense idea that there weren't enough people around 5, 6, 7,000 years ago to have any significant impact on climate. But if you allow for the fact that those people, person by person, had something like 10 times as much of an effect or cleared 10 times as much land as people do today on average, that bumps up the effect of those earlier farmers considerably, and it does make them a factor in contributing to the rise of greenhouse gasses,"" Ruddiman said. Ruddiman said that starting thousands of years ago, people would burn down a forest, poke a hole in the soil between the stumps, drop seeds in the holes and grow a crop on that land until the nutrients were tapped out of the soil. Then they would move on. ""And they'd burn down another patch of forest and another and another. They might do that five times in a 20-year period,"" he said. That slashing and burning on such a large scale spewed enormous amounts of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere and warmed the planet, the study says. Ruddiman has studied and researched the idea of ancient man contributing to climate change for years now. And he's endured plenty of criticism over his theories. Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology in Stanford, California, is among those who disagree with Ruddiman. He said Ruddiman is ""exaggerating the importance of early man."" Caldeira told CNN that while ancient farmers may have played a tiny role in climate change, ""it just wasn't a significant factor."" He added, ""There are actually studies showing if you cut down forests for farmland, you actually cool the planet, because of the glare from the cleared land."" Ruddiman and study co-author Erle Ellis, an ecologist with UMBC, acknowledge that some models of past land use show it's only been in the past 150 years -- with a huge population explosion, the onset of the Industrial Age and the rise of fossil-fuel burning -- that global warming has accelerated. But Ruddiman said, ""My argument is that even at the beginning, they just used much more land per person, so even though there weren't that many people, they used enough to start to push these greenhouse gas concentrations up."" Ruddiman's research also argues that the Earth was on its way to another ice age 10,000 years ago and that ice sheets were already forming in northern latitudes when ancient man started his slashing and burning method of farming.","Study: Ancient people were fewer in number, but burned 10 times as much land .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- The largest mass transit project in the country got under way Monday with the help of federal stimulus dollars, as public officials broke ground on a second passenger rail tunnel beneath the Hudson River. Work on the country's largest mass transit project began Monday. The new tunnel will link New Jersey with New York and eventually will double capacity on the nation's busiest rail corridor, running from Washington to Boston, Massachusetts, officials said. Officials participated in the groundbreaking for the $8.7 billion project as commuter trains passed behind them in North Bergen, New Jersey, before entering the existing train tunnel, which went into operation in 1908. ""As we start digging this tunnel, I think that what really it means, we are digging our way out of an economic crisis,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey. ""As we're getting under way, we're seeing the dividends of the Recovery Act being paid right now."" The Department of Transportation announced Monday that it will commit $3 billion to the project over its lifespan. Of that, $130 million is coming from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the department said.. It is the largest commitment to any transportation project anywhere in the United States in the history of the Department of Transportation, according to administrator Peter Rogoff of the Federal Transportation Administration. ""This is what President Obama means by recovery. It means putting people back to work now to improve the lives of so many others for years to come,"" Rogoff said. The project -- known as ARC, for Access to the Region's Core -- is expected to create 6,000 design and construction jobs. ""This is going to promote mobility, reduce commuter congestion, staunch carbon emissions, enhance regional competitiveness and lay a foundation for an extraordinary expansion of mass transit in the most densely populate state in the nation, New Jersey,"" New Jersey Gov. John Corzine said. New Jersey Transit says 170,000 passengers now travel through the existing train tunnel beneath the Hudson River to New York each day. When completed, the second tunnel will enable that figure to increase to 255,000 passenger trips. The additional passengers will disembark at a new concourse to be built at Penn Station in New York, 150 feet below street level.","Tunnel will link New Jersey with New York, doubles commuter rail capacity .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Samina Rajput speaks in hushed tones about her husband, Asif, who was killed alongside former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in the December 27 attack that convulsed the nation. Suicide bombings have killed 400 people and wounded nearly 1,000 others in the last three months. ""He always used to say ... 'I am ready to sacrifice my life for the party and my country,'"" Rajput says. She clings to a weathered book with newspaper clippings of her husband, a 28-year-old Bhutto supporter who had great political ambitions. He wanted a brighter and freer Pakistan, Rajput says, as she turns the delicate pages of the scrapbook. The clippings on the faded pages offer little comfort. But a picture of their wedding day less than two years ago, buried among the pages, makes her face light up somewhat. ""As the widow of a martyr, one has to keep dignity, and I will do this up to my last breath,"" Rajput says, clasping her hands and rubbing them together. Suicide bombings like the attack that killed Bhutto and more than 20 of her supporters, including Asif, have intensified in recent months in Pakistan.  Watch the devastating effects of bombings » . On Thursday, a suicide bomber killed at least 23 people and injured more than 58 others outside a court in Lahore, police said. The attack brought to 20 the number of suicide attacks in Pakistan in the last three months, including a failed attack on Bhutto's life in October.  The bombings have killed close to 400 people and wounded nearly 1,000 others in the last three months, according to government officials. Pro-Taliban militants with ties to al Qaeda are carrying out the attacks, according to analysts and government officials. CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen says the number of suicide bombings in Pakistan has ""reached unprecedented levels in the past year."" Previously, Bergen says, such attacks were rare. ""The reason for this rise is because al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban have morphed together ideologically and tactically, and both see themselves at war with the Pakistani state,"" Bergen says. ""Many of the suicide attacks have been aimed at Pakistani politicians, officials and soldiers."" Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has vowed to fight militancy and religious extremism, going after Taliban and al Qaeda within the country. Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Mahmud Ali Durrani, recently told CNN that the Pakistani military is ""totally focused on destroying al Qaeda and the Taliban network and not just one person."" Still, the suicide bombers are succeeding, targeting political parties, rallies, military installations and anyone seen as a threat. Meanwhile, civilians are caught in the crossfire. ""They would like to destabilize our country,"" Azhar Hamdani, who survived a July attack, says of suicide bombers. Clutching a walker, Hamdani recalls the blast that changed his life. On July 17, 2007, a suicide bomber targeted a rally for Pakistani Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, who was stripped of power by Musharraf. The explosion killed at least 12 people and wounded 35 others in the capital, Islamabad. Hamdani remembers a strong blast throwing him several yards. When he regained consciousness, he was missing his left eye and his right leg was severely injured. ""My leg was totally damaged,"" he says. ""My one left eye was damaged and I have several other injuries on my body."" But at the time of the blast, Hamdani was not focused on his own pain, he says, because he was surrounded by the bodies of his dead friends lying in pools of blood. The bombings, he says, must be stopped. ""I hope that we will succeed and, God willing, we will try to stop these bloody cowards,"" he says. ""I don't think they are Muslim.""

"(CNN)  -- A Texas agency is installing videocameras and hiring security officers at a state school for mentally handicapped adults after allegations emerged that workers there staged ""fight club"" battles among residents. Admissions to the Corpus Christi State School in Corpus Christi, Texas have been suspended. The Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services also announced Tuesday that it is suspending admissions to the Corpus Christi State School in Corpus Christi. A cell phone containing videos of the alleged abuse at the school was turned over to police last week, and authorities are expecting to file arrest warrants this week, Corpus Christi Police Capt. Tim Wilson said Tuesday. The incidents are believed to have taken place in a school dormitory, Wilson said, adding, ""this has been going on for some time.""  Watch how the 'fight club' scandal unfolded » . The school's workers ""are charged with the care and custody of these clients, and they are exploiting [them],"" he said. In addition to the videocameras, the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services said it is increasing supervision of night shifts at the school. It also said state school representatives would be making random, unannounced inspections during evening and overnight shifts. Seven school employees have been placed on paid leave by the agency, according to department spokeswoman Cecilia Fedorov. Those employees are barred from coming onto the campus but must sign in at the gate every day they are on leave, she said. State officials are awaiting the outcome of the investigation to determine whether they should take further action, she said. Some former workers also will be interviewed, authorities said. Fedorov said the Department of Aging and Disability Services was told Friday by the state Department of Family and Protective Services that it was opening an investigation into possible abuse or neglect after being alerted to the situation by police. Wilson said those involved are likely to face charges of injury of a disabled person, which can range up to a third-class felony, depending on the extent of a person's involvement. The actual charges, however, will be left up to the Nueces County district attorney, who is participating in the investigation along with the Texas Inspector General's Office, he said. Corpus Christi police received the cell phone a week ago, Wilson said, after someone found it and gave it to an officer working security at a hospital. The officer looked at several of the videos and then gave the phone to the police's forensic unit for analysis. More videos were found in the phone's memory. ""It appears it was some sort of a fight club,"" Wilson said. Twenty videos were found on the phone, with dates going back about a year. All the videos featured the school's ""clients,"" who are severely mentally handicapped, he said. On the videos, the clients ""are not upset like they are being forced,"" Wilson said. ""They are being more goaded into it. There's a lot of voices on there from workers ... saying, 'Look at that, ha ha' ... laughing, stuff like that."" No clients are seen crying, upset or injured on the videos, he said, but none of the workers is seen stopping the fighting. ""The fighting entails pushing, wrestling and some shoving,"" Wilson said. The Department of Aging and Disability Services said Tuesday that the residents in the images had been assessed and were found to be free of injuries. They are receiving additional counseling, the agency said. Wilson said that four or five clients had been identified, as well as at least five workers, possibly as many as 10. The clients are all adult males, ranging in age from their late teens into their 30s, he said, and as part of the investigation, the inspector general's office has interviewed some of them. Police believe, based on the videos, that the ""fight club"" was confined to one dormitory, Wilson said.

Scotland's Justice Minister Frank MacAskill is weighing up whether to release him on compassionate grounds so he can die at home; to transfer him to a Libyan jail under a prisoner transfer agreement drawn up between Libya and the UK; or whether to keep him in a Scottish jail for the rest of his days. That is certainly the preferred option of the U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who last week wrote to Mr MacAskill urging him not to send Al Megrahi home. In Lockerbie itself, matters of politics seem far removed. George Stobbs was one of the first policemen on the scene when the Boeing 747 crashed into Sherwood Crescent. ""I've never talked about the politics of the thing because I had no interest,"" he says. ""People here aren't interested in the politics, they just want to carry on with their lives."" Stobbs has vivid memories of the night of December 21, 1988 -- the ""shortest and darkest night of the year,"" he says. ""The houses were just slowly burning and more houses were catching fire. The windows were popping, the gutters were burning, everything was burning. It was like hell. I remember seeing a wrought iron gate in the distance and I remember it was dripping like molten butter, drip drip dripping away."" At first Stobbs thought it was a military aircraft which had crashed into the town. Then he heard that the nose cone of a 747 had landed in a field three miles from Lockerbie and he knew that he was dealing with far greater numbers of dead. ""We were told about the 747,"" he says, ""and we realized we weren't looking for twenty people but for 300. But where were they?"" There is a small memorial room beside the little church of Tundergarth, across the road from where the nose cone landed. Inside are inscriptions from visitors commemorating the huge loss of life and photographs of each of the 270 people who died in the Lockerbie bombing. ""Gentle Lockerbie"" reads one of the inscriptions from a family member who lost a loved one. ""Some say the land there is now tainted, I say it is blessed."" In the field itself there are no marks to suggest where the nose cone landed. The local farmer points to the horizon across the rolling Scottish hills. ""Between here and the top of the hill, here on my father's farm, we found 120 bodies,"" he says. The force of the explosion and the wind that night blew bits of the plane, personal possessions and body parts across a vast area. Stobbs, and hundreds of policemen and other volunteers combed 845 square meters of land looking for clues as to what brought the plane down. Documents from the plane were even discovered in the North Sea, 60 miles away. The crucial piece of evidence that implicated Al Megrahi was a scrap of clothing wrapped around a part of the device used to detonate the suitcase bomb. It was traced back to a Maltese boutique whose shop-owner recognized Al Megrahi. Lockerbie local John Gair said he was never entirely convinced of Al Megrahi's guilt. ""I did feel that some of the evidence was circumstantial,"" he says. ""I think partly out of compassion and partly out of a possible element of doubt, he should be allowed out."" As he looks down Sherwood Crescent at the neat rows of houses, not yet twenty years old, he says: ""Life goes on and once a tragedy like this is over people pick up the threads of their lives. And they don't forget but they don't dwell on it. Because there's no earthly point in dwelling on any of this."" 270 people from 21 nations lost their lives in the beautiful hills around Lockerbie. Some of them had been so badly incinerated no trace of them was ever found, just their personal belongings and the Pan Am passenger list which proved they'd been on board. Twenty years later in the town of Lockerbie, the streets have been rebuilt, the past buried, but not forgotten.","CNN's Diana Magnay travels to Lockerbie, Scotland 20 years on from the air tragedy .

"LEXINGTON, Georgia (CNN) -- A pack of dogs brought down and killed an animal-loving couple last weekend in rural northeastern Georgia, and a similar tragedy could occur anywhere dogs roam freely, authorities say. Two dogs from the pack that killed two people await euthanasia Tuesday at a shelter in northeast Georgia. Sheriff's deputies, code enforcement officers and other officials spent most of Monday and Tuesday rounding up 11 adult dogs and five puppies, Oglethorpe County Sheriff's Capt. Shalon Huff said. One more was trapped Wednesday morning, leaving one still to be captured, she said. ""We're just lucky this hasn't happened before,"" said Susan Fornash, director of the Madison Oglethorpe Animal Shelter in Danielsville, where the captured dogs were held before being euthanized Tuesday under orders from a local judge. ""We've had people bring in a dog because it killed a goat or chased their horses or something like that. And to me, that was just the forerunner of something like this."" Investigators say they believe that University of Georgia librarian Sherry Schweder, 65, went for her usual morning walk Saturday down Howard Thaxton Road, the narrow dirt lane that runs alongside the couple's property. The dogs were familiar in the area, investigators say, having been left behind when the person who had been caring for some of them moved out of a home at the end of the lane. Authorities theorize that halfway down the lane, about a quarter-mile from her home, Sherry Schweder was confronted by the dogs, which knocked her down and killed her. Her husband, retired UGA language professor Lothar Schweder, became concerned when she didn't return and went out in their Honda CRX to look for her. When he found her lying in the lane and got out to shoo away the dogs, they attacked and killed him too, investigators believe. Although no blood was seen on the dogs, other evidence and autopsy results convince authorities that the pack killed the Schweders, said Jim Fullington, special agent in charge of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's office in nearby Athens.  Watch what investigators learned » . Black bears occasionally pass through the area, but none have been reported recently, said Sgt. Doyte Chaffin, a wildlife officer with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. Investigators found no prints other than those of dogs and humans, Fullington added. Humans can appear threatening to dogs that run in packs, said Bonnie Beaver, a professor in the department of small animal clinical sciences at Texas A&M University and an expert in pack behavior. ""From their perspective, a person is an alien, if you will,"" Beaver said. ""It would be the same as we would relate to a grizzly bear."" Dogs kill an average of 10 to 20 people each year in the United States, Beaver said. The vast majority of those cases involve a single dog attacking a small child, she said. As few as two or three dogs, whether urban, suburban or rural, can behave like a pack, Beaver said. And when pack mentality takes over, ""they do insane things that they would not do"" under normal circumstances, she said. ""My bet is there was one ringleader who kind of started it"" in the Georgia case, Beaver said. Something as simple as making eye contact may have made one dog in the group feel threatened, and its body language put the other dogs on edge, triggering an ""escalation,"" she said. Even though none of the dogs weighed more than about 40 pounds, their numbers would have overwhelmed the victims. Screaming, flailing or trying to run would only make things worse, Beaver said. ""To be slight people, as I'm told they both were, and the ages that they were, I don't know what they could have done. I don't know what I would do,"" Fornash said. Jehovah's Witnesses walking up the lane to visit the lone house found the Schweders' mutilated bodies lying next to the car and called 911, Fullington said. He added that a sheriff's deputy had to fire a shot in the air to scare the dogs away. The house the evangelists had intended to visit was unoccupied, but it was home to at least some of the dogs, Fullington said. The owner, Howard Thaxton, had moved out some months earlier because of health and financial problems but had someone drive him every other day to leave food for the dogs, said GBI Special Agent Christopher Bish. Several empty 40-pound bags of Ol' Roy dog food were strewn about the property Tuesday. Thaxton, an amputee who Bish said was recently released from a hospital, has been cooperating with authorities. Thaxton doesn't believe that those animals were capable of killing people, law enforcement officials said. He has not been charged. ""We are still in discussions with the district attorney about culpability and what have you, but no decisions have been reached yet,"" Bish said. Bish said it took 14 visits to Thaxton's house to make initial contact with him. CNN's efforts to find Thaxton for comment were unsuccessful. Stopping the dogs from reproducing might have prevented the tragedy, Fornash said. Just a few dogs can multiply rapidly into a menace, she added.  Watch how dog bites might be prevented » . ""In the blink of an eye, we have a pack of 50 dogs because people don't spay and neuter,"" she said. It took about 90 minutes to euthanize all 16 dogs, several of which were maggot-infested, Fornash said. No one asked that they be checked for rabies, and the sheriff directed that the carcasses be cremated immediately, she said. ""I'm heartbroken for the family,"" Fornash said. ""I can't even imagine how they must feel. And I'm also very sad for those animals, because if they had been cared for the way they should have been, this wouldn't have happened. It's not their fault."" The Schweders' seven dogs and four of their cats were to be brought to the shelter Wednesday and eventually adopted out, she said. Thaxton's wood frame house that served as the dogs' home sits at the edge of a forest dotted with hunting campers and abandoned 1950s vehicles. Empty 5-gallon water bottles fill a ravine behind the house, and a derelict 1980s Chevy Caprice crouches next to a rusting John Deere tractor under a shade tree. After all the sheriff's deputies and trappers had left Tuesday afternoon, a scruffy red dog appeared, ears up, next to the tractor. The animal, alone, scampered off into the woods.","Dogs attacked woman, husband who tried to help her, Georgia authorities say .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The newly named lawyer for Michael Jackson's children makes her first court appearance Monday as a judge decides if he'll approve a contract between Jackson's estate and concert promoter AEG Live. Michael Jackson's estate will be the subject of a court hearing today. Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, who has custody of the three children, objected to provisions of the deal that would give AEG Live a share of rights to video of her son's final rehearsals. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff appointed estate law expert Margaret Lodise last week to represent the children after he decided their interests might sometimes conflict with their grandmother's. Despite warnings by estate lawyers that a delay could cost millions of dollars, Beckloff delayed his decision on the AEG Live contract one week to give the children's new lawyer time to weigh in on the deal. The contract would provide for an exhibition of Jackson memorabilia that would travel to at least three cities, according to Kathy Jorrie, a lawyer for concert promoter AEG Live. ""The longer we wait, the more time passes, frankly, the less interest there will be on the part of the public to come see it,"" Jorrie said. The judge has already approved a contract to allow Columbia Pictures to use video that AEG Live shot of Jackson's last rehearsals for a documentary due out this fall. Columbia is a division of Sony Pictures. Sony Pictures said it would deliver the movie -- ""This Is It"" -- to theaters starting October 30 ""with the full support of the estate of Michael Jackson."" Court papers filed last week revealed that Columbia Pictures would pay a minimum of $60 million for the rights to make the Jackson movie. Katherine Jackson's lawyers, while endorsing the movie deal, have objected to terms given to AEG, saying they are too generous to the company. Jackson's lawyers objected to the estate's agreement to let AEG recover all its expenses from that money, then take 10 percent of the remainder. It also gives the company a perpetual share of the profits from the video rights. AEG Live's lawyer said the company had made many concessions to the estate and could not make more. The judge previously has said he might approve the contracts even over Katherine Jackson's objection. Jermaine Jackson, Michael Jackson's older brother, told CNN's Larry King recently that he likes the deals, which he said could bring in nearly $100 million into the estate. Katherine Jackson and Michael Jackson's three children are the main beneficiaries of the estate, which is controlled by Jackson's former lawyer, John Branca, and longtime Jackson friend and music executive John McClain. Branca and McClain were named in Jackson's will as executors. Katherine Jackson is considering a challenge of their control of the estate.","Judge appointed attorney for interests of Michael Jackson's children .

"(CNN) -- The gunman who opened fire at Washington's U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum this week is no better than a suicide bomber, a survivor of the Holocaust said. Sel Hubert, seen here with his wife, says education is the best weapon against bigotry. Sel Hubert, 83, of Rye Brook, New York, said he also fears that through the shooter's ""ultimate act of Holocaust denial,"" he has invigorated others who embrace hate and who might wish to exact violence against others. ""By doing this, he gives worldwide notoriety to himself and his ideals of hatred,"" said Hubert, who at 13 escaped Germany on a transport to England just weeks before World War II erupted. ""He chooses martyrdom to glorify his hatred similar to a suicide bomber."" Authorities have charged James von Brunn with murdering Stephen Tyrone Johns, 39, a security officer who opened a museum door Wednesday for the 88-year-old reputed white supremacist.  Watch more on who von Brunn is » . Authorities say von Brunn acted alone, but Hubert says he represents all those who share his views. ""This empowers these people to think that this is how you get to be famous, gain notoriety, and they hope other people will mimic him -- and that's scary,"" he said. Eva Rich Blumberg, 85, of Rockville, Maryland, also worries that the shooting may have emboldened others to attack Jews and symbols of Jewish culture, she said.

Watch author discuss importance of combating Holocaust denial » . ""I lost everyone in the Holocaust. This incident just shook me up so that I don't know what to say,"" she said. Anytime a group asks Blumberg to speak about the Holocaust, she obliges, she said, out of a sense of duty to educate people so that the atrocities perpetrated by Nazi Germany are never repeated. However, she said Thursday, the shooting at the museum leaves her wrestling with the decision on whether to deliver her speech this weekend. ""I'm frightened. I don't know what to do,"" she said. ""I couldn't sleep all night because things keep coming back."" Regina Spiegel, 83, also of Rockville, believes education is one of the best weapons against bigotry. She volunteers at the museum on Wednesdays and was there when von Brunn allegedly opened fire with a .22-caliber rifle.  See photos from the museum » . Fortunately, Spiegel was downstairs and didn't hear the shots, but that did not dampen her anger and disgust over the incident. Spiegel, who met her husband of more than 60 years, Samuel, at a slave labor camp in Auschwitz, teaches children to shun hate in hopes they will blossom into productive adults unfettered by ignorance and prejudices -- ""just the opposite of what he is,"" she said, referring to the museum shooter. ""We don't teach hate,"" she said firmly. ""This guy, every time I think about it, it makes me sick that there are such people around."" Hubert, who is a board member of the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center, said the Holocaust museum stands as an important educational tool, particularly to young Americans, for providing lessons on the follies of hatred and genocide.

""To attack that symbol is striking at the very heart of what the museum is trying to do, what America stands for -- the fight against bigotry and hatred."" The Southern Poverty Law Center has described von Brunn as a ""hardcore neo-Nazi"" and Internet postings attributed to von Brunn allege that the Holocaust and Christianity are hoaxes. The postings further state that President Obama is a tool of ""Jew owners"" and that Adolf Hitler's worst mistake was ""he didn't gas the Jews.""  Watch debate on free speech, hate crimes » . Hubert and Blumberg both expressed concern that von Brunn was able to express his hateful views on Jews and minorities via the Internet. Neither is impressed with the freedom-of-speech defense.

Added Hubert, ""It's the uncontrolled Internet which provides the tools and means for this scourge to spread, and it's a very dangerous thing that's happening."" While Hubert believes the United States should strengthen its laws to prevent these types of incidents from occurring again, he also concurs with Blumberg and Spiegel that the best way to counter bigotry is ""by placing greater emphasis on prejudice and hatred for next generation,"" he said.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Welcome to democracy, Afghan-style. An Afghan woman in a burqa veil holds up a photograph of President Hamid Karzai. An incumbent president and 38 challengers, including two women, are vying for the votes of 17 million registered Afghans against a backdrop of war, graft, poverty and illiteracy. More than 3,000 donkeys, 3,000 cars and three helicopters will traverse harsh terrain to carry voting materials to remote polling stations. And 30 observer groups, domestic and international, will be on hand to help guard against fraud. This Thursday, Afghanistan holds its second-ever popular election, the results of which will put into office a new president and 420 provincial council winners. Preliminary results are scheduled September 3, with final results expected two weeks later. At the heart of every vote will be the two biggest impediments to progress for one of the poorest nations in the world: stifling corruption and an increasingly bloody Taliban resurgence. The number of Afghan civilians killed increased 24 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the United Nations. NATO and U.S. forces have suffered record losses this summer, with 75 troops killed in the month of July alone. Amid the violence, the candidates continued their last-minute campaigning, with the hope that the elections can showcase Afghanistan's fledgling democracy. ""We hope that this election will go ahead in accordance with the constitution of this country and the rightful freedoms of our people, in the best manner possible, so that the Afghan nation can determine its future,"" said historian Omar Khan Massoudi, director of the National Museum in Kabul.  Watch young Afghans talk about their hopes » . International donors are helping pay for the $223 million undertaking, and hundreds of U.S. Marines and Afghan soldiers have moved into southern Afghanistan to protect voters against possible Taliban attacks. The top U.S. envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, expressed optimism that Thursday's vote would be Afghanistan's moment to shine. It's tough to organize elections during a war, he said, but the reality is that violence during elections is common place in many parts of the world. ""Afghanistan has never had a contested election,"" Holbrooke said. ""So this is a remarkable experiment in democracy and something that Afghanistan needs to give legitimacy to the new government."" That legitimacy has become a key issue in the campaign. Frontrunner President Hamid Karzai's chief challengers -- former finance minister Ashraf Ghani and former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah -- have both lashed out at the incumbent for failing to rein in corruption. In its annual global corruption perception index in 2008, Transparency International ranked Afghanistan 176 out of 180 countries and said graft was ""a major factor impeding the country's stability and future growth."" Ghani told CNN the most significant challenge Afghanistan's next president faces is earning back the trust of the people. ""This government has lost it,"" he said in a recent interview. ""There is no sense of trust, not only in the current leadership, but in the political class as such. And in the capacity of the state or the international community to improve the lot of our people."" Ghani characterized Karzai as a ""very poor manager"" who failed to deal with pressing issues and create any sense of momentum for the nation moving forward. As a guest on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS earlier this month, Ghani said Afghanistan's corruption had become a cancer that was ""eating through the society."" Babrak Babarkhale, a former journalist and Mujahadeen fighter in the war to end Soviet occupation in the 1980s, said he planned to vote for Abdullah because he was fed up with corruption. ""We want to support Dr. Abdullah Abdullah to be our future president, to take all Afghans out of this corruption, away from this weak government,"" he said. Abdullah argued that people's dissatisfaction with the Karzai government has helped strengthen the insurgency. ""There is no doubt there is a hardcore element in it,"" he told CNN. ""But there are thousands of people under the same brand, Taliban, [who] have joined the insurgency because of other reasons."" The insurgents are filling a vacuum left by Afghanistan's Western-backed government, which foreign diplomats and military commanders concede now suffers from nepotism, corruption and predatory practices. During a political debate Sunday, Karzai admitted that corruption was a problem but offered no specific cures. He also has been blamed for what has become the bloodiest summer since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Abdullah said last week that Karzai's government had failed to capitalize on the opportunities presented by international aid and troops. The government, Abdullah said, had failed to ""stabilize Afghanistan to the extent that eight years down the road, we would have been able to say less troops rather than more."" Most polls, however, show Karzai with a commanding lead. Latifa, a Kabul housewife, said she was pleased with Karzai's stewardship and would vote for him. ""Like raising a child for seven years, in seven years he has helped our Kabul, our Afghanistan, stand on its own two feet,"" she said. ""We didn't know an election before, we hadn't seen a parliament."" But can a nation as troubled as Afghanistan carry out fair and free elections? Some observers of Afghanistan and human rights activists have voiced their doubts. Kai Eide, the United Nations special representative in Afghanistan, said Thursday's election will be the most difficult he has encountered in his life. Besides the violence and corruption, weak infrastructure and a high illiteracy rate will add to election woes, he said. A new Gallup Poll found that fewer than one in four voting-age Afghans are confident the election will be fair and transparent. Voting in Afghanistan, Eide said, is not yet the kind of democratic expression understood in the West. ""If you look at the well-established democracies in the West, for instance, that's not possible under these circumstances,"" he said. ""But ... my objective is that we have credible, inclusive elections where the result will be accepted by the people. That is our level of ambition, and I think we will achieve that."" Eide said a significant number of polling stations in strife-torn Helmand, Kandahar, Ghazni and Wardak provinces will not be able to open due to security reasons. He said ballots ought to be counted at the polling center itself instead of transporting them elsewhere and increasing the possibility of fraud, encountered in the last election in 2004. Eide said 3,000 donkeys were ""mobilized"" to carry ballots to remote mountainous regions. Of the 4.6 million new registered voters, 39 percent are women. So thousands of women had to be employed to search burqa-clad female voters. Human Rights Watch, however, said Tuesday that the recruitment drive for women began too late, and as a result, not enough women will be available for security checks. ""Women voters have been badly let down by their government and its international backers,"" said Brad Adams, the organization's Asia director. Women's votes are key in Afghanistan, where the Taliban stripped women of equal rights and education. Human Rights Watch also said Tuesday that election-related violence was a serious impediment. Between April 25 and August 1, the rights group documented at least 13 political killings and at least 10 abductions of electoral commission officials, candidates and campaign workers. It said provincial council candidates had withdrawn after receiving death threats. The overall security situation is ""considerably worse than during the last elections,"" Human Rights Watch concluded. But despite the violence, despite the threats from the Taliban to disrupt the voting, enthusiasm filled the air Monday as the presidential candidates wrapped up their campaigns. A campaign rally resembled more a rock concert than a political event in Afghanistan, as Kabul stadium transformed into a sea of blue, Abdullah's campaign color. Supporters hoisted banners and sported T-shirts emblazoned with Abdullah's face. ""I believe there is a dire need for a change of course in Afghanistan, irrespective of who becomes the president,"" said Rauf Roashan of the Institute for Afghan Studies, a scholarly center founded by Afghans living abroad. Not yet old enough to vote, Ferishta, 15, a beauty school student, echoed Roashan's sentiments. If she could, she'd cast a ballot for Ghani. ""We want a president who is peaceful and caring,"" she said. ""We don't want any more bombs. In these bombs, so many Afghans have died, one person's son, one person's child."" No one can say with any certainty whether abounding energy will translate into high turnout. Not in a war-ravaged nation. As though to serve reminder of the high stakes, Kabul came under attack again on Tuesday -- just two days before the polls open. CNN's Ivan Watson, Kevin Flower and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","More than 17 million Afghans are registered to vote .

"(CNN) -- From Yellowstone National Park to the Everglades, America's 391 national parks are in need of repair -- and thanks to the economic stimulus signed into law, help is now underway. President Obama and his family visit the Grand Canyon in Arizona, a national park. President Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus plan passed in February and designated $750 million dollars to the national parks. But not all of the stimulus money is being used -- and the parks are facing a $9 billion backlog in maintenance projects. So far, nearly 10 percent is in the pipeline. ""We are picking away at it as much as we can and we've been fortunate to have the recovery act money,"" said Jeffrey Olson of the National Park Service. Olson said half of the $9 billion is slated to go for road repairs. ""Half of that [$9 billion] is roads and about $2 billion of that are the most pressing needs -- those we get some help from the stimulus. The president's budget proposal is calling for more maintenance and construction money,"" Olsen said. Dan Wenk, the acting director of the National Park Service says most of those pressing needs include, ""camp grounds, camp sites, it's amphitheaters for evening programs. It's the bathrooms. It's literally everything we have to make our visits enjoyable."" And those needs, Ranger Rocky Schroeder hopes, will be fulfilled soon.  Watch more on the national parks facelift » . Schroeder patrols Prince William Park, about 35 miles outside the nation's capital. It has more than a dozen historic cabins slated for repair and is just one of the 250 national parks getting a face lift because of the stimulus package. ""The stimulus will help keep our visitors here, keep them happy and keep them coming back,"" Schroeder added. And the numbers are good for national parks. As of the end of July, attendance at the parks is up roughly 3 percent from the same time last year, according to the parks service. In 2008, nearly 275 million people visited the national parks compared to 272 million in 2006. At Prince William Forest park, officials are hoping to start putting the money to use next month -- and said they've had overwhelming interest. For these stimulus projects, they need to hire six additional people. So far, they've received nearly 200 applications. The Interior Department estimates the stimulus allocation will create around 8,000 jobs over two years -- though many will be temporary. ""It's stimulus because we are putting people to work ... but it's also stimulus because we're creating a better place ... increasing the visitor experience,"" Wenk said. Some Republicans, however, are skeptical. ""Clearly we need to improve our national parks ... but nobody should confuse that with economic stimulus. I mean frankly that's just false advertising,"" Rep. Jeb Hensarlin, R-Texas, says. For Ron Tipton of the National Parks Conservation Association, the funding is vital. ""We must ensure our national parks are well funded to address the parks' crumbling historic buildings and trails, enhance the Park Service's ability to protect wildlife, and provide needed public education and services,"" he said on the association's Web site. Olson believes that when economic times are tough -- especially during the current recession -- parks are an economically friendly alternative to more expensive getaways. ""We rise above other things like theme parks,"" he says. ""When times are tough economically, people turn inward and ask some really basic questions and there is nothing like being in a national park to ask those questions."" Olson adds that 147 parks in the United States and in the nation's territories have an entry fee, which ranges from $5 to $25; 244 do not have an entry fee. But when it comes to this money, the key question being asked: How is the stimulus money being used? Nearly $56 million is for Washington landmarks, which some say are in dire need of repair. More than $14.5 million is going to Mesa Verde National Park and nearly $11 million has been allocated for the Grand Canyon. Schroeder said he is confident the infusion of stimulus dollars is a worthwhile investment. ""The national parks are our past, our history.""","Obama plan designated $750M stimulus dollars to the national parks .

"(CNN) -- For many graduate students seeking an advanced education degree, obstacles abound. Issues of finance, time management and family logistics often get in the way of students furthering their education and their dreams. Palestinian Sawsan Salameh is attending an Israeli university after years of negotiations and court proceedings. For Sawsan Salameh, the obstacles also involved politics. Several years ago, Salameh, a 31-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Anata, was granted a scholarship to study at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Although her town is only a few miles from the university, access to the school was out of reach because of an Israeli military ban that limited Palestinian students' access to Israeli universities, on security grounds. But she was far from giving up on her goal of pursuing her education. ""When I was in high school, it was a dream that I should finish my Ph.D.,"" Salameh said. After obtaining a master's degree at Al Quds University, a Palestinian school in the West Bank, Salameh was granted full scholarships at several international schools, including Hebrew University. With the military ban in place, Salameh considered studying at a university abroad. ""I started to think I should get up and take this offer to leave, but it's not easy to go abroad, and the only chance is for me to study in Israel, because it's important for me to stay close to my family,"" Salameh said. Salameh sought the support of the Israeli human rights organization Gisha, which submitted a petition to Israel's Supreme Court on her behalf in 2006. The Supreme Court responded by asking the military to lift the ban and allow Salameh to study at Hebrew University, where she is pursuing a Ph.D. in pharmacology. ""We argued Sawsan's case for 2½ years, and at the end of the day, the military agreed to let Sawsan study,"" said Sari Bashi, director of Gisha. ""It was impossible to deny her incredible talents and the example she set for women and girls throughout the West Bank,"" Bashi says. The Israeli military agreed to review all future requests for Palestinians in the West Bank wishing to pursue a degree at an Israeli university on a case-by-case basis, based on specific criteria. The criteria include that the potential student clear all necessary internal security checks, that the student pursue a degree in a discipline that would encourage regional cooperation and develop area coexistence, and that the area of study not have the potential to cause damage to Israel, says Maj. Guy Inbar, spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. The area of study must be supported by an international organization (such as the U.N. or the Red Cross) and approved by the Ministry of Education and must also be a degree unique to an Israeli university (not offered at a Palestinian university). The request must come with a recommendation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to Inbar. After Salameh's victory, Gisha, with the support of a number of Israeli academics, further appealed to the court to push the military to ease these limitations. The Israeli military's heightened security concerns reflect heightened tensions in the region due to the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In July 2002, a bomb exploded in the student cafeteria of Hebrew University, killing seven people. The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas claimed responsibility for the explosion, according to Palestinian sources. Still, some academics at Hebrew University believe qualified students like Salameh pose no security risk, and their acceptance to Israeli universities could even foster better relations in the region. Professor Alon Harel, a law professor at Hebrew University, pushed for the appeal to lift the military's criteria on Palestinian students. He believes that the admission of Palestinian students from the West Bank would enrich the academic environment at the university, particularly in the study of law. ""It's particularly important for classes to be diverse, for people to have familiarity with Arabic studies and Islamic law,"" he said. Other academics agree that qualified students such as Salameh can only add to the diversity of the campus, where thousands of Israeli Arab students are enrolled. ""My personal feeling is that we should do everything we can to allow Palestinian students to study at Hebrew University,"" said Yaacov Schul, vice rector at Hebrew University. Salameh is a devout Muslim with a traditional background yet shirks pressure from family members to focus on marriage and motherhood. ""Everyday I have to hear something about [not being married] from relatives and aunts,"" she says. ""It's become [the] usual."" Salameh, who also provides valuable resources for young women at a women's center she opened in her community, says she hopes her pursuit of higher education will open even more doors for young women also wishing to pursue a higher education and achieve their academic goals. ""I get lots of phone calls every day from girls in the West Bank who ask me how to apply to universities in Israel,"" Salameh said. ""Maybe they can become more than just a wife and mother and at least finish their first degree,"" she said. Salameh says she enjoys the collegial atmosphere at Hebrew University, where she studies among Israeli Arab, international and Israeli students. She is considering pursuing another degree after completing her Ph.D. in two years. ""I would like to help other people, and I hope the political situation will become better and things will become easier,"" she said.","Palestinian Sawsan Salameh faced many obstacles before attending Israeli school .
She hopes she can open doors for other students to study where they want .
She also has become a role model for girls in the West Bank to pursue education ."
"Editor's note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He was a co-host of ""Crossfire"" on CNN with Robert Novak from 2002 to 2005. Paul Begala says he admired Robert Novak for his skepticism about authority, work ethic and faith in his beliefs. (CNN) -- In our innumerable debates, I delighted in calling Bob Novak ""the finest mind of the 12th century."" One time, though, he scowled and growled, ""I prefer the 15th century. Spanish Inquisition. Those were the days."" Novak left this world on Tuesday, but he also left his mark. Needless to say I disagreed with Bob about virtually every political issue, and sometimes our on-air debates continued as profanity-laced shouting matches after the show ended. Despite our profound differences, though, we were friends. Here's why: . Bob was an iconoclast. He loved poking conventional wisdom in the eye. If all the media elite were perched on the same wire, Bob would land on the opposite wire and gleefully squawk at them. Bob was an ideologue more than a partisan. One of the many sources of tension between us was the fact that I am a partisan Democrat who believes that, from time to time, my personal ideological agenda must take a backseat to advancing a broader progressive agenda carried by my party. Not Bob. He was a conservative first, last and always, and when he felt the Republican Party had strayed from his hard-core anti-tax, anti-government ideology he would hammer the GOP with the same withering ridicule he usually dispensed to Democrats. Bob was deeply skeptical of authority. He was a lowly lieutenant in the United States Army, and he instinctively distrusted big shots -- a rarity in a town that is often dazzled by rank. For a guy who said he preferred business to government, he was not afraid to show his contempt for network executives with whom he disagreed. Bob had a remarkable work ethic. In the predawn hours after the 2004 presidential debate in Miami, Bob slipped in the shower, breaking his hip. The injury was terribly painful, and Bob was rushed to the hospital. Within 24 hours he was propped up in bed, working the phones and banging out a column on his laptop. Bob was an old-school reporter. Most pundits (your humble author included) devour the reporting of others and regurgitate our opinions. While strongly opinionated, Bob also reported. His sources, especially in the GOP, were wide and deep. When I was a White House official, one of my most dreaded responsibilities was dealing with Bob. He didn't support much of anything we were trying to do, but he never lied to me, never broke his word, and tried his hardest to get things right. Accuracy mattered enormously. Bob could be civil. This will astonish some, because Bob could also be rude. But he taught me at least one lesson in civility. On ""Crossfire,"" I carried a debate over into the commercial break. I badgered and hectored and attacked the guest who was on the right. I was angry and I let him have it. ""Wait just a #*& $@#^ minute,"" Bob screamed at me. ""You're out of line. You're being rude. Get off his back. He's come here on our show to make his case and you're abusing him. We call them 'guests' for a reason, Paul."" He was right. Bob loved sports. One tiny island of common ground Bob and I could share was a love of sports. When James Carville and I joined ""Crossfire"" in 2002, CNN had a much-hyped debut planned for April 1. Bob didn't care. Maryland was playing for the NCAA basketball championship and he was going to be there. Producers pleaded, but Bob was unmoved. He did the show via satellite from Atlanta, Georgia, and when Coach Gary Williams cut down the net for the Terps, Bob was courtside. Bob became a Catholic. My brand of Catholicism and Bob's were as different as our brands of politics, but as a cradle Catholic I admire anyone who, at age 67, is still seeking the divine, still questioning, still open to a new faith. We spoke about faith often, and I'm sure his Catholic faith gave him great comfort as he battled the disease that claimed his life. Requiem in pace, friend. Or, as Bob might prefer: Goodnight, sweet Prince of Darkness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala.","Paul Begala: Bob Novak was a friend even though we differed on many issues .
He says Novak was true to his conservative beliefs even when GOP strayed .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A newspaper aligned with Iranian reformist Mehdi Karrubi, who recently made headlines for claims that post-election detainees in Iran were raped behind bars, was shut down for running ""unlawful"" material, state-run media reported Monday. Mehdi Karrubi says an ""impartial committee"" is needed to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees. An investigating judge said the popular newspaper, Etemad-e Melli, was ordered closed for what has been described as ""publishing unlawful and criminal material,"" state-run Press TV reported. Protesters outside the newspaper offices clashed with police Monday, the network also reported. On Sunday Masih Alinejad, a reporter and columnist with the paper, told CNN that officers from Iran's judiciary confronted employees of Etemad-e Melli after hours as they were getting the Monday's edition to print. She and Karrubi's son, Hossein, said the newspaper had planned to run a firm response from Karrubi to his opponents, who have dismissed the allegations of detainee rapes. The officials told the employees that they ""were not allowed to come to the newspaper tomorrow,"" Alinejad, who is temporarily in the United States for a reporting assignment, told CNN. In a statement on Saham News, the official Web site of his father's party, Etemad-e Melli, or the National Trust party, Hossein Karrubi said that the paper was forced to temporarily shut down. He cited the pending publication of his father's response to ""the insults"" recently hurled at him for the shutdown. Early Monday, Etemad-e Melli's Web site was still up with a report about a ban on the newspaper. It was not printed, and its offices were closed, Alinejad said. Hardliners have criticized Karrubi for openly describing the mistreatment of detainees arrested in the aftermath of the Islamic republic's disputed June 12 election and calling for an investigation into prison conditions. Karrubi and fellow reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi ran against hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was declared the overwhelming winner and was recently sworn in for his second term. The treatment of detainees at Iran's prisons has increasingly become a high-profile issue, with human-rights groups accusing guards of conducting harsh interrogations, beatings, sleep deprivation, and threats of torture to coerce false confessions. In an August 8 posting on the Etemad-e Melli party's Web site, Karrubi said he had heard descriptions of torture and violence that made his ""body shake."" ""Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent, repeated rapes of the young women [in detention] that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems,"" Karrubi said. ""Others have raped our detained young men with such brutality that they [the victims] have been afflicted by depression and are no longer speaking with anyone and refuse to leave the dark corners of their houses."" He added that an investigation would ""teach a lesson to the thugs and criminals in the future and prevent the smearing of the reputation of the Islamic Republic."" Iran's influential parliament speaker dismissed the allegations, calling them ""sheer lies,"" state-run media reported last week. Ali Larijani said a special panel of Iran's parliament, or Majlis, conducted a ""precise and comprehensive inquiry"" into the treatment at Tehran's Evin and Kahrizak prisons, and found ""no cases of rape or sexual abuse,"" Press TV reported. He challenged Karrubi to ""present evidence of such outrages"" for the Majlis to investigate, according to Press TV. Earlier Sunday, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Karrubi had backed off the statements, quoting him as saying, ""I did not say that such things have certainly occurred, rather I said that there are rumors of such ugliness having taken place and I reiterated that God willing it is a lie and nothing but rumors."" Alinejad questioned the legitimacy of the report, saying Karrubi's real response would have been in Monday's edition of Etemad-e Melli.","Karrubi was to run response to opponents in Monday edition, son and reporter say .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson will be buried Saturday, August 29, on what would have been the singer's 51st birthday, according to a statement from publicist Ken Sunshine. Katherine Jackson has proposed she or one of her children be added as an executor to Michael's will. The private ceremony will take place at Holly Terrace in The Great Mausoleum at Glendale Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, and ""will be limited to family and close friends,"" the statement said. Jackson died June 25 of cardiac arrest. The famed entertainer was 50. Other Jackson plans have moved sluggishly. Monday, a judge delayed his approval of the exhibition agreement between concert promoter AEG Live and the Jackson estate until Friday, when he will hear testimony about why Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, thinks it should be renegotiated. The three-city exhibition of Jackson memorabilia could be derailed, as relations between Jackson's mother, the men Jackson named as executors of his will and the promoter of his planned comeback concerts have been challenging. Questions surrounding Michael Jackson's death and AEG Live's role in his last days are an ""obvious source of tension"" as Katherine Jackson objects to the agreement, Jackson attorney Burt Levitch said. Michael Jackson's family has ""floated"" the possibility of filing a wrongful-death lawsuit against AEG Live because of its ""very, very active role in Michael's life during the last six months,"" Levitch said Monday. Levitch said AEG Live ""apparently paid for the services of Dr. Conrad Murray, who we're told is under criminal investigation in connection with the decedent's death."" Warrants used to search Murray's home and clinics indicated police were investigating his role in Jackson's June 25 death. A source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Murray gave the anesthetic propofol to Jackson in the 24 hours before he died. ""There's an obvious link between AEG and concerns that we have about the decedent's demise,"" Levitch said. ""So, that's one obvious source of tension right now."" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff set a November trial date to hear Katherine Jackson's potential challenge of John Branca and John McClain, who were named as executors in Michael Jackson's 2002 will. Katherine Jackson has proposed that she or one of her children be added as an executor. ""We think it's important for the family to have a seat at the table,"" Levitch said. ""It's not just a matter of making a quick buck here."" A Jackson family member would be in the best position to guide Michael Jackson's legacy, he said. Beckloff delayed a decision until Friday on Katherine Jackson's objection to the agreement made by Branca and McClain, who are serving for now as special administrators of the estate, to allow AEG Live to produce a Michael Jackson exhibition. Jackson lawyers argued in Monday's hearing that the 50-50 split of profits for the exhibition was too generous to AEG Live, but estate lawyers said they negotiated the best terms possible. AEG Live lawyer Kathy Jorrie said any further delay in approval would cause the company to abandon the deal and the company would not renegotiate. AEG Live would hold the exhibition just as a documentary about Jackson's last months hits theaters at the end of October. ""It's important to the world that we present them with the memorabilia at the time the movie is released,"" Jorrie said. The judge has approved a merchandising agreement and the movie deal, both of which were adjustments to the contract Jackson signed with AEG Live earlier this year for a string of 50 comeback concerts that were to start last month in London, England. Estate lawyer Howard Weitzman said canceling the exhibition deal could cost the Jackson estate $5 million.","NEW: Michael Jackson to be buried Saturday, August 29 .

"(CNN) -- South African teenager Caster Semenya won the women's 800 meters gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin, just hours after the sport's governing body asked for the 18-year-old's gender to be verified. Semenya celebrates her gold, which came just hours after the IAAF called for a gender test on the athlete. Semenya crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in a time of one minute 55.45 seconds -- the best time in the world this year. Defending champion Janeth Jepkosgei of Kenya took the silver with Briton Jennifer Meadows claiming bronze. However, the race was run amid controversy following the announcement by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF).  Watch outrage over allegations » . ""The gender verification test is an extremely complex procedure,"" said IAAF spokesman Nick Davies -- who revealed the question of Semenya's gender was first raised after her astonishing African junior championship displays. ""In the case of this athlete, following her breakthrough in the African junior championships, the rumors, the gossip were starting to build-up,"" Davies added to reporters. There have been precedents in such cases, the most famous being that of Polish athletics great Stella Walsh, who won Olympic gold in the 100 yards at the 1932 Olympics and silver in the same event in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. However, after she was shot dead during an armed robbery in 1980, the subsequent autopsy revealed she possessed male genitalia, although she also had female characteristics as well. Meanwhile, Yusuf Saad Kamel secured Bahrain's first-ever medal with a superb late surge to claim gold in the men's 1,500 meters. Kamel, who until 2003 competed for Kenya as Gregory Konchellah and is the son of former two-time world 800m champion Billy, won in a time of three minutes 35.93 seconds. Ethiopia's world indoor champion Deresse Mekonnen claimed a surprise silver with defending champion Bernard Lagat, also Kenyan-born but now competing for the United States, in bronze. """"It's amazing to win a world title just like my father. The only thing left for me to do is to beat his times and win more medals and get to the front of my family,"" Kamel told reporters. Olympic silver medallist Asbel Kiprop of Kenya could only finish fourth after leaving himself too much to do down the home straight. Elsewhere, sprint king Usain Bolt produced an effortless run to coast into the men's 200m final and remain on course to claim a world sprint double to add to his Olympic sprint double from Beijing. The 22-year-old Jamaican, who set a new world record of 9.58 seconds in winning the 100m on Sunday eased home to win his semifinal in 20.08 seconds and only injury looks like depriving him of gold. ""I just try and get through and make it as easy as possible,"" Bolt told reporters. ""I've been training for this for a long time now. I know what I have to do."" There was more sprint joy for Jamaica when Bolt's compatriot Brigitte Foster-Hylton ran a season's best time of 12.51 seconds to finally claim gold in the women's 100m hurdles. The 34-year-old, who won world bronze in Helsinki in 2005 and silver in Paris in 2003, secured her first global title by edging out Canada's Olympic bronze medallist Priscilla Lopes-Schliep. Another Jamaican, Delloreen Ennis-London, took the bronze medal. However, the biggest cheer of the night at an electric Olympic Stadium was reserved for Germany's Robert Harting, who dramatically won the men's discus gold with his sixth and final throw of 69.43 meters. Poland's long-time leader Piotr Malachowski won silver with a throw of 69.15m with defending world and Olympic champion Gerd Kanter of Estonia claiming the bronze with 66.88m. The victory was host nations Germany's second of the championships after Steffi Nerius claimed gold in the women's javelin on Tuesday.","Caster Semenya wins women's 800m gold at World Athletics Championships .

"Editor's note: Rep. Jared Polis, a Democrat, represents Colorado's 2nd Congressional District and is appearing in CNN.com's ""Freshman Year"" series along with Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah. Jared Polis says America's immigration system is broken and urgently needs reform. (CNN) -- Twelve-year-old Josh Garcia courageously took the stage. Fighting back tears, he told how he came home from school one day to find that his father had been taken into an immigration detention facility. His father, an entrepreneur who had created dozens of jobs, was ""exactly the kind of person we want in this country."" And there wasn't a dry eye in the place as this young American boy told the audience how the next time he saw his father, he was traumatized to find him ""in a prison"" surrounded by men with guns. On June 13, I sponsored an immigration town hall in my home state of Colorado to discuss the harm our broken immigration system is causing American families and the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform. More than 1,600 attendees, including representatives from Protestant, Catholic, Jewish and Muslim faiths, filled the Immaculate Heart of Mary Parish Center in Northglenn and spilled outside onto the lawn in the hot June sun. Catholic Archbishop Charles Chaput -- despite our many differences -- joined me onstage to urge people of faith to stand up for immigration reform. The audience listened with rapt attention as Josh and several other Americans directly impacted by our broken immigration laws recounted their haunting tales. Our current immigration system is broken and greatly in need of reform. In order to create real, long-lasting reform, we must create a pathway to legal status for the millions of undocumented immigrants who have made lives for themselves and their families in the United States. It is essential for our national security to know who resides within our borders. And this phenomenon is not unique to Colorado; throughout the country, Americans agree that it is time to reform our broken immigration system. According to a recent poll of 1,000 voters by the Benenson Strategy Group, more than eight in 10 Democratic, Republican and independent voters support Congress passing comprehensive reform, as do 86 percent of voters who are undecided on the 2010 congressional race. Only 14 percent oppose the reform. Americans agree that comprehensive immigration reform is fair to both taxpayers (81 percent agree) and illegal immigrants (79 percent agree), and 91 percent agree that the comprehensive proposal would help taxpayers by making illegal immigrants pay taxes. If we secure our borders and crack down on employers who illegally hire, and deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes, nearly seven in 10 (68 percent) voters argue that the remaining 12 million illegal immigrants should be required to register, meet conditions and eventually be allowed to apply for citizenship. A whopping 62 percent of self-identified Republicans say they should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship. Clearly, Americans agree that the economic and national security burdens placed on state and local governments -- not to mention the incredible hardships placed on immigrant families -- because of the failures of federal immigration policy are unfair and that we desperately need meaningful reform. It is rare to find this kind of across-the-board consensus, and it indicates that rather than demagoguery, the American people want action. Our town hall's other special guest, my colleague Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, formed the United Families movement. It works to bring diverse groups to the table from faith-based organizations, civil rights groups, unions and businesses to demand comprehensive immigration reform. Thanks to their leadership, progressives and conservatives in Colorado and across the country are working to urge President Obama and Congress to take it up this year. Amnesty alone is not the solution. We need real reform. We tried amnesty in the late 1980s, and because we never took serious steps at enforcement, we wound up in precisely the same predicament 20 years later. If all we do is pass amnesty, we will likely be having the same debate again a few years. Likewise, the ""enforcement-only"" policies of the past few years have failed and have resulted only in even more illegal immigration and the separation of American families. Trying to enforce our out-of-touch laws is as foolish and impossible as trying to enforce a law requiring that water flow uphill. The good news is that we can solve this issue. We can pass practical comprehensive immigration reform. Crafting a solution to this complex problem will require a debate, which should begin without delay. Citizens and elected leaders of this great nation must realize our common goal of putting an end to illegal immigration and demand immigration reform now. We are a nation of immigrants. Our diversity has always been our strength. We should be thankful that we have even have this problem to consider, thankful that America continues to be a beacon of hope and liberty, and thankful that the best and brightest from across the globe are fighting to start a better life in our country and take part in the American dream. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jared Polis.","Jared Polis: America urgently needs to reform broken immigration system .

"(CNN) -- A United Nations court convicted a former governor of Rwanda to life in prison for his role in a 1994 genocide that left about 800,000 dead in the central African country. An estimated 800,000 people -- mainly Tutsis -- were killed in Rwanda in 1994. Tharcisse Renzaho was found guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The verdict, delivered Tuesday, is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). The U.N. court is holding hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, where it is based. Renzaho was governor of the capital, Kigali, and a colonel in the Rwandan Armed Forces in 1994 during the country's genocide, when extremist militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis across Rwanda. It began in April of that year and within 100 days, an estimated 800,000 people were killed. The court found that Renzaho ordered soldiers, police and militias to set up roadblocks to identify Tutsi civilians to be executed. It found he ordered the distribution of weapons to people who then killed Tutsis. Renzaho also supervised a selection process at a refugee site where about 40 Tutsis were abducted and killed, the court found. Renzaho participated in an attack at the Sainte Famille church in which more than 100 Tutsis were killed. People across Rwanda sought refuge in churches all over the country as the genocide unfolded. He also made remarks encouraging the sexual abuse of women, according to the court, and was found criminally liable for the rapes that followed. The genocide ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Rwandan President Paul Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre. Renzaho was arrested in September 2002 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. His trial began in January 2007 and closed in September that year after hearing from 53 witnesses, including Renzaho. Throughout the trial, Renzaho maintained his innocence and said he had no association with the militia. Renzaho's lawyer blamed the case on political interference by the Rwandan government. Renzaho has the right to appeal the verdict. The decision is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the tribunal. Emmanuel Rukundo, a former military chaplain, was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The court found Rukundo had a history of contempt for Tutsis and his fellow clergymen, and that he ordered the killings of Tutsi civilians. Callixte Kalimanzira was sentenced to 30 years in prison for genocide and incitement to commit genocide. The court found that Kalimanzira, a senior civil servant who at one point worked with the Interior Ministry, participated in various massacres of Tutsi civilians and actively encouraged other crimes against them. Prosecutors at his trial said he beat some Tutsis to death and called for the elimination of all Tutsis, including pregnant women and their babies.","Tharcisse Renzaho guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes .

Renzaho has the right to appeal the verdict. The decision is the third judgment on charges of genocide delivered this year by the tribunal. Emmanuel Rukundo, a former military chaplain, was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The court found Rukundo had a history of contempt for Tutsis and his fellow clergymen, and that he ordered the killings of Tutsi civilians. Callixte Kalimanzira was sentenced to 30 years in prison for genocide and incitement to commit genocide. The court found that Kalimanzira, a senior civil servant who at one point worked with the Interior Ministry, participated in various massacres of Tutsi civilians and actively encouraged other crimes against them. Prosecutors at his trial said he beat some Tutsis to death and called for the elimination of all Tutsis, including pregnant women and their babies.","Tharcisse Renzaho guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes .

"SOWETO, South Africa (CNN) -- It's late Sunday morning inside a cavernous Salvation Army Church in Soweto, South Africa. Services, complete with African and traditional music, have just finished and a catchy drum beat with a distinctly American hip-hop sound is coming from the stage. Laura DiFilippi, 12, gets ready to board the bus in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to go to the airport. The group of teenagers dancing around the drums is 8,000 miles and an 18-hour plane ride from their New York home. They are mostly from Bushwick, Brooklyn -- a community of about 109,000 people only five miles from Manhattan. For some of these kids, it's their first time away from home. Unfamiliar with Bushwick? It's mostly a working class neighborhood where families have often struggled. For years it was a community with a thriving drug trade, severely under-achieving schools, extreme poverty and a staggering rate of teenage pregnancy. It was ravaged by fires and looting during the summer of 1977 and hit hard by the crack epidemic in the 1980s. Bushwick is recovering now, but half of the children under age 18 still live below the poverty line. A quarter of the adults never make it past the ninth grade and more than half never graduate from high school. The children on this trip to South Africa are what educators and social workers call ""at-risk"" -- at risk of having babies as teenagers; at risk of never finishing high school or achieving their dreams; at risk of never knowing the world beyond their neighborhood. Thirty of these children, between the ages of 12 to 16, have been paired up with college-aged mentors and brought to South Africa by Malaak Compton-Rock, the wife of comedian Chris Rock. She brought them to volunteer -- to serve the impoverished and the AIDS orphans in this country with the highest HIV-infected population in the world. Watch the kids' video diaries from South Africa » . Compton-Rock has carved her own niche in espousing service -- giving back. She often quotes her mentor Marian Wright Edelman, founder of the Children's Defense Fund: ""Service is the rent we pay for living."" The South Africa trip is Compton-Rock's brainchild -- to broaden the horizons of young teens and give them perspective on their own lives.  Watch: The kids witness devastating effect of AIDS in South Africa » . ""I believe by traveling you open up your life,"" Compton-Rock tells a crowd gathered for a press conference the morning after the group has arrived. ""You don't think locally, you start to think globally and internationally and I think it gives you a sense of confidence."" She also wants the children to know, ""that in the United States of America, even in Bushwick, we have certain services that I want the children to understand that they need to take advantage of."" Compton-Rock is talking about access to free public education, food, knowledge and social mobility -- elusive things for South Africa's impoverished and particularly so for 1.4 million AIDS orphans there. One of the mentors on this trip is 20-year-old Alicia Gerald. ""I know that in my own experience,"" Alicia says. ""Just having someone put their hand out and say 'I believe that you can be great,' has really helped me rise to those expectations.""  Photos: Meet some of the kids » . Alicia is from Bedford-Stuyvesant, a troubled community just blocks away from Bushwick. It's also where Compton-Rock's husband grew up. Compton-Rock has required all of the children selected for the trip to sign one-year contracts to become ""global ambassadors."" As ambassadors they are required to tell their friends and neighbors about their experiences -- through writing, blogging, photographs and speeches. The idea, Compton-Rock explains, is that if a child is given a unique opportunity, she or he, is ""obligated to bore a hole and take someone through with you."" Among the children on Compton-Rock's ""Journey for Change"" mission is Laura DiFilippi, a quiet girl who's overcome a lot of challenges in her 12 years. Constant moving and instability in her family life meant it was tough to find the documents needed for travel. For a while, it seemed as thought she wouldn't be able to get her U.S. passport. With the help of Compton-Rock's assistant, Cece Falls, Laura got the paperwork done and her passport was issued just 24 hours before the kids piled onto the bus for the airport. There is also 15-year-old Jeremy Baker, with a broad smile and slight frame. He is growing up in the projects with four siblings and hits the basketball courts every morning before breakfast during the summer. His dream? ""Senior year I'd get a scholarship to Connecticut, UConn, play there,"" says Jeremy. ""Then, like after my sophomore year in college, go to the NBA, get drafted by Detroit."" It's a dream of many young black men, but a recent study suggests only .03 percent of the youngsters playing ball as seniors in high school actually make it to the NBA. Another young man, who makes magic with the drums and also smiles broadly, is 14-year-old Jonathan Severe. Compton-Rock snaps pictures while dancing to the beat and tapping on a nearby African drum. She is shaking her head in both joy and disbelief, clearly thrilled by what she sees. It's been less than 48 hours since the group has arrived; they haven't even begun their service yet, and already the young man is opening up in a way she had never expected. Jonathan said maybe six words during his interview for entry to the program, and despite Compton-Rock's best mothering skills he never lifted his eyes from the floor. His grandmother came with him to the interview and kicked his leg under the table to get him to speak. It didn't work. He barely spoke and when he did, you could hardly hear him. It wasn't easy for Compton-Rock to decide to take him to Africa. Her selection committee feared he didn't have the communication skills needed to be an ambassador. Two days into the trip and Jonathan is effusive. I literally have to cut him off in interviews to get a word in. To see that, so early on, has been one of the thrills of this trip for me. Two days in and I can already tell this experience will be life-changing for all of us. What will they learn and discover about themselves, and the world? I'll let them tell you. All the kids have been asked to blog about the joys and the challenges, the things they're learning and the disappointments. We're taking photos and documenting every step they take in South Africa. The Bushwick kids came to make a difference in the lives of these vulnerable kids in South Africa. It will be equally interesting to see how South Africa's children make a difference in the lives of these children from Bushwick.","Thirty kids from Bushwick, Brooklyn, took part in ""Journey for Change""

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A Web designer in London was amazed to discover that Iranian election protesters are attacking the Iranian president's Web site using software he developed in his spare time, he told CNN Wednesday. Ryan Kelly: ""I suppose I am taking sides but I have no problems with it being used in this way."" With anti-government activists in Iran sidestepping official attempts to silence them on the Internet by posting photos, videos and blogs on sites like Facebook and Twitter, others are using a site that automatically refreshes a Web page every few seconds, potentially overloading the host server. The page reboot software means that dissidents can ""attack"" sites with a barrage of hits -- known as a denial of service attack -- causing them to appear to users as ""unobtainable."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Web sites was one of those displaying this message on Monday, according to Britain's Channel 4 News, although on Tuesday it was loading correctly. The freely available page refresh site was partly developed by Ryan Kelly for use with sports results sites and eBay. He said he was unaware it was being used by Iranian protesters to stop the government from getting out its message until Tuesday when he received an email from an unknown source asking him to take the site down. ""Can you please shout (sic) down the website for few weeks. Currently they are using that website to attack other websites,"" stated the anonymous e-mail seen by CNN. Kelly, who works for contract publisher Wardour, then discovered that hits on his own site had risen from 700 on a normal day to 41,000 on Monday. ""I was shocked when I heard my site was being used in this way,"" the 25-year-old told CNN. ""This exemplifies the power of the Internet that something happening in London can affect events thousands of miles away in Tehran. It's great it's being used in this way."" The heavy traffic forced Kelly to temporarily suspend his site, but only because it was exceeding the volume of traffic on his server. He said he later received dozens of e-mails requesting him to restore the site, and he did so. One message seen by CNN said: ""Please bring your site back up as fast as you can. We need your help in Iran against Ahmadinejad."" Kelly said he supported the protesters in their battle to have the results of the disputed presidential election overturned. ""I suppose I am taking sides because I've put the site back up, but I have no problems with it being used in this way.""","Iranian protesters use site that refreshes Web page to hack official sites .

"(WIRED) -- The wind blowing through the streets of Manhattan couldn't power the city, but wind machines placed thousands of feet above the city theoretically could. A prototype of a high-altitude wind turbine made by Magenn Power. The first rigorous, worldwide study of high-altitude wind power estimates that there is enough wind energy at altitudes of about 1,600 to 40,000 feet to meet global electricity demand a hundred times over. The very best ground-based wind sites have a wind-power density of less than 1 kilowatt per square meter of area swept. Up near the jet stream above New York, the wind power density can reach 16 kilowatts per square meter. The air up there is a vast potential reservoir of energy, if its intermittency can be overcome. Even better, the best high-altitude wind-power resources match up with highly populated areas including North America's Eastern Seaboard and China's coastline. ""The resource is really, really phenomenal,"" said Christine Archer of Cal State University-Chico, who co-authored a paper on the work published in the open-access journal Energies.""There is a lot of energy up there, but it's not as steady as we thought. It's not going to be the silver bullet that will solve all of our energy problems, but it will have a role."" For centuries, we've been using high-density fossil fuels, but peaking oil supplies and climate concerns have given new life to green technologies. Unfortunately, renewable energy is generally diffuse, meaning you need to cover a lot of area to get the energy you want. So engineers look for renewable resources that are as dense as possible. On that score, high-altitude wind looks very promising. Wind's power -- energy which can be used to do work like spinning magnets to generate electricity -- varies with the cube of its speed. So, a small increase in wind speed can lead to a big increase in the amount of mechanical energy you can harvest. High-altitude wind blows fast, is spread nicely across the globe, and is easier to predict than terrestrial wind. These properties have led inventors and scientists to cast their hopes upward, where strong winds have long been known to blow, as Etzler's dreamy quote shows. During the energy shocks of the 1970s, when new energy ideas of all kinds were bursting forth, engineers and schemers patented several designs for harnessing wind thousands of feet in the air. The two main design frameworks they came up with are still with us today. The first is essentially a power plant in the sky, generating electricity aloft and sending it down to Earth via a conductive tether. The second is more like a kite, transmitting mechanical energy to the ground, where generators turn it into electricity. Theoretically, both approaches could work, but nothing approaching a rigorous evaluation of the technologies has been conducted. The Department of Energy had a very small high-altitude wind program, which produced some of the first good data about the qualities of the wind up there, but it got axed as energy prices dropped in the 1980s and Reagan-era DOE officials directed funds elsewhere. The program hasn't been restarted, despite growing attention to renewables, but that's not because it's considered a bad idea. Rather, it is seen as just a little too far out on the horizon. ""We're very much aimed these days at things that we can fairly quickly commercialize, like in the next 10 years or so,"" said National Renewable Energy Laboratory spokesperson George Douglas. Startups like KiteGen, Sky Windpower, Magenn, and Makani (Google's secretive fundee) have come into the space over the last several years, and they seem to be working on much shorter timelines. ""We are not that far from working prototypes,"" Archer said, though she noted that the companies are all incredibly secretive about the data from their testing. Magenn CFO Barry Monette said he expects ""first revenue"" next year when they sell ""two to four"" working prototypes of their blimpy machine, which will operate at much lower altitudes. ""We do think that we're going to be first [to market], unless something happens,"" Monette said. In the long term, trying to power entire cities with machines like this would be difficult, largely because even in the best locations, the wind will fail at least 5 percent of the time. ""This means that you either need backup power, massive amounts of energy storage, or a continental- or even global-scale electricity grid to assure power availability,"" said co-author Ken Caldeira, an ecologist at Stanford University. ""So, while high-altitude wind may ultimately prove to be a major energy source, it requires substantial infrastructure."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A former motor-racing engineer has unveiled a prototype of a new hydrogen-powered city car which claims to emit less than one third of the carbon emissions produced by its nearest rival. The Riversimple Urban Car has been nine years in the making and needs further funding for city trials. The creators of the 'Urban Car,' UK-based company Riversimple, say the vehicle emits less than 30 grams per kilometer of carbon dioxide, less than one third of the carbon produced by the Polo Bluemotion. Riversimple founder Hugo Spowers has spent nine years researching and developing the prototype car. ""I think that the auto industry is focusing a lot of money on research and development at a basic science level on hydrogen storage and fuel cell technology. We don't think it's necessary to do that,"" Spowers told CNN. ""We can use existing technology and integrate it into a whole system design approach -- that is where the breakthrough has come."" Spowers is searching for extra funding to put the 'Urban Car' on the streets, but he says at this stage they won't be for sale. Riversimple plans to lease the car to customers for a monthly fee of £200 ($330). Hydrogen fuel for the cars will cost just 15 pence (25 cents) per mile. It's a long way from the fuel-guzzling world Spowers used to inhabit as a designer and developer of high-powered racing cars. It was the industry's appalling environmental record that encouraged him to leave to try to find a way to make driving greener. ""Certainly the first five or six years were hard work because I did have an awful lot of people telling me I was mad,"" Spowers told CNN, at the launch of the Riversimple Urban Car in London. ""Gradually it all sort of gathered steam,"" he said, adding ""I'm absolutely convinced that we're offering a better solution for a segment of the transport problem and we'd be crazy not to pursue it."" The Urban Car's power comes from hydrogen fuel cells which are linked to four electric motors situated over each of the car's wheels. Almost all of the braking is done by the electric motors, which then capture the energy of the car in motion and store it in a bank of ultracapacitors. In conventional cars, the energy generated through braking is lost as heat. The energy stored in the Urban Car's electric motors is enough to power 80 percent of the car's acceleration. That reduces the energy demands on the hydrogen fuel cell, meaning it can be one fifth of the size of one used in a normal car. The lighter fuel cell also makes it more energy efficient. A large part of the funding for the car's development came from the family of Ernst Piëch, the eldest grandson of Ferdinand Porsche who founded the motor company of the same name in 1931. Ferdinand Porsche's great-grandson Sebastien Piëch is a partner in Riversimple. He says the company's nimble size has given it an advantage over larger car manufacturers whose future he says concerns him. ""It concerns me massively, because I don't see that the model they have now is very relevant to where consumers are going. Consumers are looking for a different solution. I'm not sure if what they're producing is working,"" he said. Riversimple plans to share the designs for its car through open-source licence agreements, a system more commonly used in the software industry. Designers and manufacturers will be invited to make improvements so the car evolves into the most efficient vehicle it can be. ""We don't believe that making money on IP (intellectual property) is really what's actually happening even now. We believe that service and providing the solution for customers will be where we make money,"" Piëch told CNN. The next step now is to find further financing, another £20 million ($33 million), to build and test ten cars. Fifty prototypes will then be built for a pilot project in a small city. The location is still to be confirmed, but Riversimple has narrowed down its options to small towns in the United Kingdom, perhaps Oxford or Peterborough. ""I'm very confident we'll get it to market,"" Spowers said. ""I couldn't say hand on heart that I'm confident that we'll achieve what I think technically can be done. That's a bit in the lap of the gods and it's all to do with people, politics and business -- all a bit more unpredictable.""","Riversimple launches car prototype with lowest level of carbon emissions .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Marching in dramatic silence, many with tape over their mouths, hundreds of thousands of Iranians kept alive public support for opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi Wednesday even as the government stepped up efforts to thwart daily protests calling for a new presidential election. Supporters of defeated reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi line the streets of Tehran Wednesday. Large crowds gathered in Haft-e-Tir Square in central Tehran Wednesday evening for a fifth day of protests, according to witnesses. The demonstrators are demanding that officials throw out the results of the balloting Friday that kept hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in power. More protests are expected Thursday after Moussavi, in a message on his Web site, called for an afternoon ""ceremony of mourning,"" which he planned to attend. Referring to those who have died or been wounded ""as a result of illegal and violent clashes"" with his opponents, Moussavi urged people to gather in mosques and holy sites and wear ""mourning symbols"" in a show of sympathy and support for the families. The protests have claimed at least eight lives, according to Iran's government-funded Press TV. The eighth death was included in a report the Intelligence Ministry provided to parliament Wednesday, the network said.  View a map of major rallies in Tehran » . The National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of the Iranian Majlis briefed lawmakers ""about the current situation in the country,"" Press TV reported. No details of the report have been made public. Iran is also investigating reports of violence at a Tehran University dormitory in the wake of rallies sparked by last week's disputed election. Moussavi and former President Mohammad Khatami sent a joint letter asking Iran's courts to quell post-election violence and release protesters who have been arrested. The letter, posted on Moussavi's Web site, said, ""the use of violence against ordinary people, raiding people's residences just because they chant the sacred phrase of Allh-o-akbar (Allah is great), beating up women and men, destroying buildings"" is not in line with the standards of the Islamic Republic. For a second day Wednesday, pro-Moussavi marchers urged their peers to march silently -- perhaps as a way of keeping a low profile in the face of riot police, witnesses told CNN. Protesters held placards and posters reading, ""Where is my vote?"" and ""Freedom,"" the witnesses said. Some held signs that said ""Silence"" and put their finger to their lips. Several business owners reported that they closed up shop early so their employees could attend Wednesday's rally. The government cracked down by banning international media from covering the protests and blocking access to Web sites.  Watch Christiane Amanpour on media restrictions » . A CNN iReporter who is not being identified said Wednesday's rally ended without incident. ""The people of Iran are finally fed up with the lies, the temperament, the foolish actions of Ahmadinejad,"" a 20-year-old Iranian man told CNN. Authorities in Tehran transported dozens of protesters to jail Tuesday and blocked access to social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. The government accused international reporters of being the ""mouthpiece"" of ""hooligans"" who have created unrest, and said it could not guarantee the safety of those reporters. (Full story) ""I do believe them because the militia, they don't care who you are. If they see a camera, you will be a target,"" said a CNN producer who is not being identified for his safety. He was referring to the Basij, a volunteer paramilitary force that takes its orders from the Revolutionary Guard and is suspected of being behind most of the violent acts. Citizens were barred from using typical means of getting Iran's stories to the outside world, but amateur videos and photos blossomed on sites such as YouTube and CNN's iReport. The content was impossible to verify in most cases, and much of it was posted anonymously or through third parties, some with little information. iReport.com: On the ground in Iran . Iran's Revolutionary Guard corps said it will pursue legal action against Web sites that it said were inciting people to riot. The Guard, a military unit that enforces the government's Islamic codes and morality, blamed U.S., British and Canadian companies, including American intelligence agencies, for financially and technically supporting the Web sites. Despite the Guard's threats, defiant Moussavi backers stood firm. ""We are fighting with our lives and the world is just watching,"" said Ali, a Tehran University student who requested his last name not be used. ""They see how the government is trying to silence us, how they are beating us -- but they don't come to our help. It's OK. We will succeed, even if we have to fight alone."" Though the focus of demonstrations has been in Tehran, reports of protests and violence sprouted in all corners of Iran. Human rights group Amnesty International, which is monitoring the situation through media reports and a network of local correspondents, said people had protested in Tabriz and Bobol in the north, Shiraz in the south and Mashad and Zahedan in the east. It reported several deaths in Oroumiye and Shiraz as well as beatings by police, use of tear gas and the detention of hundreds of protesters. A video on CNN's iReport site by a third party showed several people who apparently had been shot, purportedly in the city of Esfahan, about 200 miles south of Tehran, and others attempting to treat them without medical supplies. In Shiraz, 28-year-old Najmeh said she has taken to the streets every day since Saturday -- much to the chagrin of her worried parents. But Wednesday, the hospital nurse said no more. ""The police are everywhere you look,"" she said. ""They hurt and arrested so many people last night that no one wants to go out."" Thousands of miles away, members of Iran's national soccer team sported green arm and wrist bands Wednesday during their World Cup qualifying match against South Korea. The team does not normally wear bands of green, the venerated color of Islam that has been adopted by Moussavi supporters, and many Iranians viewed the gesture as a sign of support, although that has not been confirmed. (Full story) Meanwhile, the Swiss ambassador to Iran -- the protecting power of the U.S. in Iran -- was called into the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday to hear Iranian complaints regarding U.S. interference in Iran's election process, P.J. Crowley, assistant secretary of state for public affairs, told reporters in Washington. U.S. President Barack Obama has voiced ""deep concerns"" about the elections, as has the European Union. But neither has dismissed the election results outright. Counter-demonstrations by Ahmadinejad backers have also drawn thousands, reflecting a deep fissure in the country. Iran's all-powerful leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appealed to the citizenry to stand behind the Islamic republic. He is to deliver a sermon Friday that will be closely watched for a sign of how the government plans to resolve the stalemate. On Tuesday, Khamenei -- who has given his blessing to the election results -- asked the country's election authority, the Guardian Council, to recount some of the votes. But Moussavi is asking for fresh elections.

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN)  -- A federal grand jury has indicted two Minnesota men in connection with the recruitment of Somali immigrants to fight with Islamic insurgents in their home country. Jamal Bana is one of several missing Somali-Americans believed to have fought with an Islamist insurgency. Salah Osman Ahmed and Abdifatah Yusuf Isse are charged with one count each of providing material support to terrorists and conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure people overseas, the indictment states. The recruiting effort took place between September 2007 and December 2008, according to the charges. Ahmed also is charged with two counts of making false statements to investigators. According to the indictment, he told FBI agents that he had traveled alone on a flight to Somalia when, in fact, he and another person were going together ""so that they could fight jihad in Somalia."" Ahmed was arrested Saturday, FBI Special Agent E.K. Wilson told CNN. Isse had been in custody for some time, said Omar Jamal, the head of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis. Both were from Minnesota and in their 20s, Jamal said. Jamal said Ahmed and Isse were ""foot soldiers"" carrying out the work of others, and that he expected more indictments ""in a week or two."" The FBI has been investigating what appears to be a massive recruiting effort by the al Qaeda-linked Somali insurgent group al-Shabaab in immigrant communities in the United States. More than a dozen young men of Somali descent have disappeared from the Minneapolis area in recent months, and at least three have been killed in Somalia, community leaders have said. The latest, Jamal Bana, was confirmed dead over the weekend, his family said Sunday. The same day, Somalia's president -- a former member of the Islamist movement himself -- issued a plea to Somali-Americans not to join the fight in his country. ""I am saying to those young men from abroad: 'Your families fled your home to America because of insecurity. You should not return here to foment violence against your people,' "" President Sheik Sharif Ahmed said. Al-Shabaab has ties to al Qaeda and has recruited foreign fighters to join its battle to overthrow the Somali government, U.S. officials said. It remains entrenched in the northeast and in sections south of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, after fighting that has uprooted more than 200,000 people since early May, according to the United Nations. Wilson said the number of missing men believed to be in Somalia is ""in the 10s,"" but their recruitment is ""a significant concern and one that we're giving our highest priority."" In October, Shirwa Ahmed, 27, a Somali-American believed to have been radicalized by al-Shabaab, traveled from Minneapolis to Somalia and blew up himself and 29 others. It was the first suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen, and it raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community and sparked an investigation by the FBI. Burhan Hassan, a 17-year-old Somali-American high school student in Minneapolis, went missing eight months ago, around the same time as Bana. Last month, his family learned that he was killed in Somalia. Neither family has any idea why the young males left the United States, where they came as young boys, and Bana's family believes he was being held against his will, said Omar Jamal, head of the Somali Justice Advocacy Center in Minneapolis. ""Only one time he placed a phone call [in mid-November], he didn't say much,"" Jamal said. ""He spoke as if he was being held hostage. He couldn't be speak freely. They asked him to cut the conversation short."" Hassan's uncle, Abdirizak Bihi, said a fourth man -- 30-year-old Zakariya Maruf -- was killed Friday, but Jamal said Maruf may only be injured. Maruf was the first of the missing Somalis to head overseas, said Bihi, who has become a spokesman for the families of the missing men. Bihi called him a ""leader"" whom the others consulted on travel plans. Many of the missing Somali-Americans are believed to have left for Somalia when Ethiopian forces were still on the ground. Ethiopia invaded Somalia to push the Islamists out of Mogadishu in December 2006, but their presence in the country was an outrage to most Somalis and became a rallying cry for al-Shabaab. Ethiopian troops left Somalia this year, leaving Ahmed's weak transitional government to battle the insurgents.

"(CNN) -- Pet owners know that their furry friends can add a little something extra to the spring cleaning chores. CNN spoke with ""the Queen of Clean,"" Linda Cobb, a New York Times best-selling author and television personality. Cobb, who owns three cats, knows a thing or two about getting the best of pet messes. CNN: What can pet owners do about pet hair? Cobb: You can use what's called a soot and dirt removal sponge. You simply run it over a lampshade [or the] upholstery on your furniture, and it actually pulls the hair right off. You can also use a damp sponge. Another good thing to use is rubber gloves. Dip them into water -- keep a bucket of water near you -- shake off the excess water and rub that over the upholstery, and the hair will collect on the rubber gloves. It does a great, great job. The other thing you need is a really good vacuum cleaner. I have found that I prefer one that has a bag in it. I use an Oreck XL. If you're using a canister vacuum, you have to take it out and then shake it into the trash, which puts all of that dust and that dander and that cat hair and everything else back up into the air. Another good vacuum that is newer to the market is the Halo [UXV Ultraviolet Vacuum Cleaner]. That's the one with the ultraviolet light that kills germs and bacteria as you vacuum. Now, you have to vacuum correctly and go back over the area of the carpet enough times, but that's a very good vacuum too. If you have someone in the house that is sensitive to cats, has an allergy from them or something like that, there is a product called Allerpet that you can actually just spray on to your pet, and it neutralizes the enzymes in the saliva, which is what people are usually allergic to. This is something that even if the cat licks itself, it won't hurt it. CNN: What about pet accidents? Cobb: If you've got a hairball, or spaghetti didn't agree with the dog, accident on the carpet, the first thing you do is scream and run to get the paper towels and start trying to pick it up, which drives it down into the carpet fibers. Instead, reach for your baking soda. Sprinkle on a really heavy coat, and I mean heavy, so that it's completely covering it totally. Walk away. The baking soda will pull the liquid, the bile, the acids from the accident up into it away from the carpet. Once it's dry, you take the suction hose from your vacuum and simply vacuum that up, and many times you can't even tell there was an accident there. For pet urine, the first thing you want to do is put a very heavy, heavy pile of paper towels on it, stand on it, draw all the urine you can away from the carpet. Then pour on club soda and do the same thing. Then you can go in to neutralize it with about a half a cup of water quarter cup of white vinegar. [Then] blot that dry. If you have any odor, you want to use an odor eliminator to remove that. Now, that's not a spray that smells like lavender or oranges or flowers. An odor eliminator has no odor. A really, really fine one is Odorzout. It's all-natural, so it can't hurt the pet. The man who invented it powdered his grandson's little butt with it when he changed his diaper, that's how natural it is. If there's a larger accident and you have a bowel movement on the floor, as long as it's not diarrhea-like, you can pick that up with a paper towel. I recommend that you immediately treat that with Odorzout, because if your pets can smell what they've done, they'll go back to that area because they think it's OK. CNN: What about the litter box? Cobb: Cats like to be very, very clean, so to avoid having accidents in other areas because their litter's dirty, you want to clean every day. If you're using a regular litter box, there is a product called a Litter Locker; it's a little sanitary container for the [waste] removal. It's a fantastic product. I use it for my cats, and I just love it. Now, if you're using [an automatic cleaner], every few days, you need to make sure that the catch basin is cleaned out. If it overfills and the cat smells that, they don't want to go in, and then they're going to start using corners of your house. And you know what? That's not their fault. That's our fault if we don't keep their litter clean. CNN: How do you keep your pets safe when you're doing a big spring cleaning? Cobb: Well, you look for natural products. Don't use harsh chemicals; it's not necessary. Disinfectants have to stay wet on the surfaces for five to 10 minutes to work; then they have to be rinsed off. They're not safe for food surfaces. You know what that says? They're not safe for your pets to walk on, either. Read when you go to the grocery store. If there's a natural seal or if they have a green cross on it, they're a natural, safe, organic product. I recommend so highly the ACT Natural microfiber products from Sweden, the cloths and the mops. Because with nothing but water, they remove 99.9 percent of germs and bacteria and soiling from surfaces. You're not getting any residue on surfaces, and you're not spending any money on chemicals, and you're saving the environment and your health too.","Use rubber gloves to attack pet hair on furniture .

"Editor's note: Wendell Potter has served since May 2009 as senior fellow on health care at the Center for Media and Democracy, a nonprofit organization that says it seeks to expose ""corporate spin and government propaganda."" After a 20-year career as a corporate public relations executive, Potter left his job last year as head of communications for one of the nation's largest health insurers, CIGNA Corporation. Ex-insurance company spokesman Wendell Potter says the industry seeks to drive the health care debate. (CNN) -- Having grown up in one of the most conservative and Republican places in the country -- East Tennessee -- I understand why many of the people who are showing up at town hall meetings this month are reacting, sometimes violently, when members of Congress try to explain the need for an expanded government role in our health care system. I also have a lot of conservative friends, including one former co-worker who was laid off by CIGNA several years ago but who nonetheless worries about a ""government takeover"" of health care. The most vocal folks at the town hall meetings seem to share the same ideology as my kinfolks in East Tennessee and my former CIGNA buddy: the less government involvement in our lives, the better. That point couldn't have been made clearer than by the man standing in line to get free care at Remote Area Medical's recent health care ""expedition"" at the Wise County, Virginia, fairgrounds, who told a reporter he was dead set against President Obama's reform proposal. Even though he didn't have health insurance, and could see the desperation in the faces of thousands of others all around him who were in similar straits, he was more worried about the possibility of having to pay more taxes than he was eager to make sure he and his neighbors wouldn't have to wait in line to get care provided by volunteer doctors in animal stalls.  Watch Potter interview with Sanjay Gupta » . Friday morning my former CIGNA buddy sent me an e-mail challenging something he said his wife heard me say in a radio report about my press conference in the Capitol on Wednesday with Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York, chairwoman of the House Rules Committee. ""She heard you say that these protestors are funded by the insurance companies. Frankly, nothing would surprise me, but certainly not each and every person,"" he wrote. ""If there was a meeting near me, I certainly would tell my local representative how I feel about this entire subject (and it wouldn't be pretty), and I certainly am not funded by anyone. So I am ultimately wondering what proof there is that seemingly ordinary Americans are finally protesting what is going in Washington and there are all of these suggestions of a greater conspiracy."" If the radio report had carried more of my remarks, he might have a better understanding of how the health insurance and its army of PR people are influencing his opinions and actions without his even knowing it. Until I quit my job last year, I was one of the leaders of that army. I had a very successful career and was my company's voice to the media and the public for several years. It was my job to ""promote and defend"" the company's reputation and to try to persuade reporters to write positive stories about the industry's ideas on reform. During the last couple of years of my career, however, I became increasingly worried that the high-deductible plans insurers were beginning to push Americans into would force more and more of us into bankruptcy. The higher I rose in the company, the more I learned about the tactics insurers use to dump policyholders when they get sick, in order to increase profits and to reward their Wall Street investors. I could not in good conscience continue serving as an industry mouthpiece. And I did not want to be part of yet another industry effort to kill meaningful reform. I explained during the press conference with Rep. Slaughter how the industry funnels millions of its policyholders' premiums to big public relations firms that provide talking points to conservative talk show hosts, business groups and politicians. I also described how the PR firms set up front groups, again using your premium dollars and mine, to scare people away from reform. What I'm trying to do as I write and speak out against the insurance industry I was a part of for nearly two decades is to inform Americans that when they hear isolated stories of long waiting times to see doctors in Canada and allegations that care in other systems is rationed by ""government bureaucrats,"" someone associated with the insurance industry wrote the original script. The industry has been engaging in these kinds of tactics for many years, going back to its successful behind-the-scenes campaign to kill the Clinton reform plan. A story in Friday's New York Times about the origin of the absurdly false rumor that President Obama's health care proposal would create government-sponsored ""death panels"" bears out what I have been saying. The story notes that the rumor emanated ""from many of the same pundits and conservative media outlets that were central in defeating Bill Clinton's health care proposal 16 years ago, including the editorial board of The Washington Times, the American Spectator magazine and Betsy McCaughey, whose 1994 health care critique made her a star of the conservative movement (and ultimately, the lieutenant governor of New York)."" The big PR firms that work for the industry have close connections with those media outlets and stars in the conservative movement. One of their PR firms, which created and staffed a front group in the late '90s to kill the proposed ""Patients' Bill of Rights,"" launched a PR and advertising campaign in conservative media outlets to drum up opposition to the bill. The message: President Clinton ""owed a debt to the liberal base of the Democrat Party and would try to pay back that debt by advancing the type of big government agenda on health care that he failed to get in 1994."" The industry goes to great lengths to keep its involvement in these campaigns hidden from public view. I know from having served on numerous trade group committees and industry-funded front groups, however, that industry leaders are always full partners in developing strategies to derail any reform that might interfere with insurers' ability to increase profits. So the next time you hear someone warning against a ""government takeover"" of our health care system, or that the creation of a public health insurance option would send us down the ""slippery slope toward socialism,"" know that someone like I used to be wrote those terms, knowing it might turn many of the very people who would benefit most from meaningful reform into unwitting spokespeople for the industry. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wendell Potter.","Wendell Potter: In my former job, I helped shape public opinion on health care .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Forecasters issued a tropical storm warning Thursday for the Atlantic island of Bermuda as Category 3 Hurricane Bill neared. Hurricane Bill's projected path shows it moving north toward New England and then Canada. The warning from the National Hurricane Center means tropical storm conditions, including winds of at least 39 mph (63 kph), are expected on the island within 24 hours. A hurricane watch was also in effect, meaning hurricane conditions, including winds of at least 74 mph (119 kph), are possible within 36 hours. As of 11 p.m. ET Thursday, Bill's center was about 510 miles (825 kilometers) south of Bermuda, and about 975 miles (1,570 kilometers) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, the hurricane center said. The storm was moving northwest at near 18 mph (30 kph), and is expected to continue that motion overnight, with a gradual turn to the north-northwest on Friday followed by a turn toward the north on Saturday. ""The core of the hurricane is expected to pass between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States on Saturday,"" forecasters said.  See Bill's projected path » . However, Bill is considered a large hurricane, with hurricane-force winds extending out 115 miles (185 kilometers) from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending out 260 miles (418 kilometers), so Bermuda is likely to feel its effects as it brushes by. Bill's maximum sustained winds had increased slightly to 125 mph (205 kph), with higher gusts, the hurricane center said. It was downgraded to a Category 3 storm from Category 4 status early Thursday, after its top sustained winds slipped below 131 mph (211 kph). Fluctuations in intensity are likely over the next 12 to 24 hours, however, and Bill could regain Category 4 strength Friday, forecasters said. Large swells generated by Bill were affecting the northern Leeward Islands on Thursday, along with Puerto Rico and the island of Hispaniola, shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The East Coast of the United States should start seeing large swells during the next few days, along with the Bahamas, Bermuda and the eastern coast of Canada, the hurricane center said. ""These swells will cause extremely dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents."" Bill is forecast to diminish into a Category 1 hurricane by Sunday evening, when it could make landfall near Nova Scotia or Newfoundland, Canada.","Bermuda on alert as Hurricane Bill gets closer .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghanistan officials said 26 people across the country were killed in election day violence, although they hailed Thursday's vote as a success. A woman dips her finger in ink to show she voted in Bamiyan, one of Afghanistan's more peaceful provinces. Nearly 95 percent of the more than 6,000 polling stations across Afghanistan opened on Thursday, according to government and electoral officials. Counting is under way but initial results are not expected for another 36 to 48 hours, while final results will not be certified until mid-September. Officials extended voting until everyone waiting in line had a chance to cast their ballots. ""At some [polling stations] there is a very large line,"" said Azizullah Ludin of Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission. ""We have to complete all these people that are coming here."" It is the nation's second presidential election since the 2001 fall of the Taliban. Ludin said the decision to add more time to vote was because of a large turnout at some stations and technical issues that delayed voting for others. There were no official details on voter turnout and it has been difficult to get an accurate count of how many Afghans voted in defiance of threats of violence from the Taliban. CNN's Atia Abawi said election officials at one polling station in Kabul had already begun counting ballots after a low turnout when the order to extend voting reached them. Afghan voter turnout low as presidential election nears end » . When asked how many ballots had been counted, an election official said 1,000 -- which seemed high to the CNN crew that had been at the polling station all day. ""We were there all day and we did not see 1,000 people,"" CNN's Kevin Flower said. Election workers in central Bamiyan province immediately began reopening the polls after the order to extend voting. ""Election workers had put up security tape barriers and even tied down the flaps to their voting tents shortly after 4 p.m. local time,"" CNN's Ivan Watson reported from the province. ""The security tape has been removed and voters are straggling in again."" Election observers from 30 groups -- both domestic and international -- said voting in Kabul province was fairly smooth, though a few reports surfaced of irregularities at various polling stations. Afghans were electing a president from 40 hopefuls and 420 members of the provincial council in what was seen in the international community as a high-stakes test for the fledgling South Asian democracy. The Taliban had vowed to disrupt the voting and the risk factor in some areas may have been too high for some Afghans to venture out to vote.  Watch an election monitor in Kabul discuss what's being examined » . The government ordered a ban on media coverage of incidents of violence in an effort to ""ensure the wide participation of the Afghan people"" as 300,000 NATO and Afghan soldiers were out in force to safeguard voters. The independent Pajhwok Afghan News, which had announced it would not heed the media ban, posted online reports of deadly attacks across Afghanistan. CNN has not confirmed those incidents. Afghan security officials said voting day violence claimed the lives of 17 Afghan policemen and soldiers, and another nine civilians. An American service member was killed in a mortar strike in eastern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. It did not say where the attack took place. Major fighting continued for a second day in the city of Baghlan, north of Kabul, security sources said. Rockets were fired at the town throughout the day, a day after heavy fighting that claimed the life of the city's police chief, the sources said. Afghans in Baghlan are afraid to leave their homes to cast their ballots, Afghan security officials said. In the eastern city of Gardez, four rockets pounded the outskirts of the city, while a roadside bomb struck in another area, the local security chief said. There were no casualties from either incident. But other parts of Afghanistan have been largely spared the daily drumbeat of car bombs, assassinations and whizzing rockets. Enthusiasm filled the air as voters lined up to have their say. Pajhwok reported brisk turnout in western Herat province, which borders Iran. Khwaja Mahboob told Pajhwok that he voted for a woman for a provincial council seat because he believed women should have a stronger say in Afghanistan.  Watch what ranks high among Afghan concerns » . In central Bamiyan province, where predominantly ethnic Hazaras suffered under Taliban rule, thousands of voters cast their ballots behind cardboard screens inside dust-caked tents. Police struggled to hold back and search the crowd and at one point, people pushed through, breaking off one of the gates to the polling center. After voting, one elderly man admitted he wasn't sure who he voted for. ""Whoever God wants will be king,"" he said. Many Afghans are illiterate and rely on symbols like light bulbs and books to identify their candidates on the ballot paper. Organizers from Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission said 11 polling centers in Daikundi province were closed because of security concerns. Some polling stations in eastern Kunar and Nuristan provinces did not open and others, including 100 in Ghor, opened without a security presence, according to Pajhwok. Afghanistan observers and experts said a high turnout would help marginalize the Taliban which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. Incumbent President Hamid Karzai, dressed in his traditional purple and green striped robe, cast his vote shortly after the polls opened and had his finger stained with ink that is supposed to last for two weeks, a measure intended to thwart fraud by preventing people from voting multiple times. ""I'm sure this will be for peace, for progress and for the well-being of the Afghan people,"" Karzai said. But at some Kabul polling stations, the ink apparently was not potent enough, according to Damaso Magbual, an observer from the Asian Network for Free Elections. At another station, a boy who successfully voted with a fraudulent registration card, admitted to being only 13, Magbual said. Karzai's top rival was his former finance minister Abdullah Abdullah, who once served as a confidante of Ahmed Shah Massoud, the charismatic leader of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance killed by al Qaeda.  Who are the candidates? How does the voting work? Read here » . The other candidate who gathered steam in the campaign was former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani, a Western-educated man who served as a World Bank analyst. Karzai was named interim leader after the fall of the Taliban regime and won the 2004 election by a significant margin. His popularity, however, has waned in recent months as Afghanistan has been crippled by corruption and increasing bloodshed. Both Abdullah and Ghani hailed anti-corruption measures and government transparency as centerpieces of their campaign platforms. Women's votes were seen as crucial after an especially repressive period for women under the Taliban when they were stripped of rights. But in some polling stations Thursday, women voters were greatly outnumbered by men.  What do Afghans want? See in photos here » . Habiba Surobi, the female governor of Bamiyan, said women who live in remote Afghan villages are still not aware of their rights. ""This is something to be concerned about,"" she said, adding that it was the responsibility of Afghanistan's women leaders to ensure better awareness and education. About 15 million of Afghanistan's 33 million people are registered to vote. Earlier, officials had estimated that number as 17 million.

"(CNN) -- Ten climbers have died on two mountains in northern Japan, police said Friday. Hokkaido's mountains and scenery are a big drawcard for climbers and tourists. Eight of the climbers who died on Mount Tomuraushi were in a group organized by a tourist company, according to Yuji Kikuchi, a spokesman for Hokkaido police. A ninth man was climbing alone. One more climber died on Mount Biei, Kikuchi said. Another 10 people survived on both mountains in Hokkaido, according to Kikuchi. Except for a 32-year-old survivor, all the climbers were in their late 60s, the spokesman said. The cause of their deaths was not available. The area has experienced heavy rain and gusty winds in the past two weeks due to a persistent area of low pressure, CNN's meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said. The storm system has also brought flooding to North and South Korea, she added.

"(CNN) -- Kids dig in the sand at the beach all the time, but the fun nearly turned fatal for an 11-year-old Pennsylvania boy this week. The 11-year-old was given CPR and revived before being taken to a local hospital. The boy was digging a tunnel with friends on a beach in Ocean City, Maryland, on Tuesday when part of it collapsed on top of him, authorities said. Lifeguards rushed to pull him out, but it first appeared that they were too late. The boy was not breathing, and he had no pulse, Beach Patrol Capt. Butch Arbin told CNN on Wednesday. But rescue crews revived the boy by performing CPR, said Arbin, who was at the scene. There was a lot of emotion on the beach when the boy's pulse came back, he said. ""He basically went from dead to life,"" Arbin said, adding that the boy's mother called the rescue a ""miracle."" As he was being rolled into an ambulance on a stretcher, the boy -- perhaps not realizing the trauma he had just survived -- complained to his mother that he had sand in his eyes, Arbin said. The child, whose family did not want to be identified, was initially taken to Atlantic General Hospital and later flown to the A.I. DuPont Hospital for Children in Delaware, he said. He's recovering there and probably will be released later Wednesday, Arbin said.","Boy, 11, was digging a tunnel with friends on a beach in Ocean City, Maryland .

"(CNN) -- Eight-time gold medal winner at the Beijing Olympics and multiple world-record holder Michael Phelps warmed up for the Swimming World Championships in Rome by setting a new men's world record in the 100 meters butterfly. Michael Phelps attacks the pool in Indianapolis to set a new world mark in the 100m fly. The 24-year-old American shaved 18-hundredths of a second from the previous mark set by compatriot Ian Crocker in 2005, with a time of 50.22 on the third day of competition at the U.S. National Championships in the Indianapolis. ""I was pretty happy with my swim. I really wanted to break 50 seconds, but that is something to shoot for,"" Phelps told the event's official Web site. ""Ian Crocker texted me after prelims. He wished me all the luck. That really meant a lot to me as a competitor and as a friend,"" he added. The new time takes Phelps's personal tally of individual world records to five, to add to the three he can claim from relay events, and means he has qualified for three events at the upcoming World Championships in Rome thus far. Places were booked with wins in the 200m freestyle and 200m butterfly on Wednesday while a further slot could be confirmed via the 100m freestyle. Phelps, who was banned for three months when he was pictured smoking drugs at a party after returning from Beijing, has been eager to regain his Olympic form after his enforced exile from the pool. ""This is something that I really, really wanted to accomplish,"" Phelps told the LA Times. ""Crock and I had a lot of great history, a lot of great races with one another. I've wanted that record ever since he took it in '03 worlds. . . . After the race, you could tell I was pretty fired up and excited."" Elsewhere, twelve-time Olympic medallist Dara Torres qualified for the World Championships team in the 50m freestyle. The American told the LA Times there was still work to do despite the result: ""My coach was telling me I probably lost four or five tenths [of a second] on the start,"" said Torres. ""The adrenaline kind of took over so I didn't really feel (my knee injury). It's a great feeling to be able to be out there and still race [at age 42], but that time won't medal at the world championships,"" Torres added.

"(CNN) -- The Tennessee man accused of selling the gun used to kill former NFL quarterback Steve McNair is in custody facing a federal charge of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, authorities said Friday. Police say Adrian Gilliam admitted he sold Sahel Kazemi the gun she used to kill NFL quarterback Steve McNair. ""This is another example of what can happen with a gun when a felon is selling it on the street with little to no interest other than just selling it for 100 bucks,"" said Nashville, Tennessee, Police Chief Ronal Serpas. Authorities said federal agents traced the gun used in the Fourth of July murder-suicide to Household Pawn in Nashville, which sold it in January 2002. ""Further investigation revealed the 9 mm pistol was later sold for approximately $100 to Adrian Gilliam approximately one to one and a half years ago,"" Nashville police said in a news release. Gilliam, 33, of LaVergne, Tennessee, told detectives that on July 2 he sold the gun for about the same price to Sahel Kazemi outside a shopping mall. Police said Kazemi, McNair's 20-year-old girlfriend, used the gun two days later to fatally shoot McNair -- a former Tennessee Titans quarterback and married father of four -- and herself in McNair's condominium in downtown Nashville. Gilliam had been convicted of second-degree murder and attempted armed robbery in Florida in 1993, according to the new release, and those felony convictions meant that he could not legally be in possession of a firearm. Along with Serpas, the announcement of the arrest was made by Edward M. Yarbrough, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee; James M. Cavanaugh, the Special Agent in Charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives' Nashville Division; and Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Debris from Air France 447, which crashed en route from Brazil to France last month, killing 228 people, has arrived in France, the French air accident investigation agency BEA said Wednesday. Searchers have discovered hundreds of pieces of wreckage from Air France Flight 447. ""The debris ... will be sent to Toulouse where they will be examined at the Center of Aeronautics Tests of Toulouse (a branch of the Defense Ministry) under the control of the police and the BEA investigators,"" said the French air accident investigation agency BEA. The wreckage was transported to France from Brazil by the ship ""La Ville de Bordeaux,"" according to the plane's manufacturer Airbus. It will be taken overland to Toulouse by truck. Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in stormy weather as if flew from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France on June 1. Only 51 bodies were recovered, and the search is ongoing for the cause of the crash. The search for the data and voice recorders from the plane entered a second phase last week, according to France's accident investigation agency. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- commonly known as ""black boxes"" -- stop giving out acoustic broadcasts after 30 days. But investigators decided to continue listening for the ""pings"" for another 10 days after that. On July 10, two U.S. naval vessels and the French Navy submarine called off their search for the recorders, which investigators hope will shed light on exactly how and why the plane crashed. The second phase of the search will involve France's oceanographic ship ""Pourquoi Pas?"" which carries specialized exploration and intervention vehicles, according to the BEA. The French vessel will conduct new searches using diving equipment and towed sonar, the BEA said. Finding the recorders is of ""capital importance"" and ""no effort must be spared in achieving this end,"" Air France has said. ""We want to stress that for the sake of the families, we hope that the search for the black boxes will be successful,"" an Air France representative told CNN. The crash was the worst in Air France's 75-year history. Earlier this month, investigators revealed that the plane bellyflopped intact into the Atlantic Ocean. Investigator Alain Bouillard said it was still not clear what caused the crash. The mountainous ocean floor in the search area ranges from 3,280 to 15,091 feet, BEA officials have said in the past, making the search for the recorders -- and the rest of the plane's debris -- difficult. ""It is as if it fell in the Andes (mountains),"" Olivier Ferrante, chief of the BEA search mission said. Brazil called off the search for bodies on June 27, having found 51 of the 228 people who died, according to the military. Investigators have also found more than 600 parts and structural components of the plane, along with luggage, Bouillard said.","Debris from Air France 447, which crashed last month, has arrived in France .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House did not intend to show any disrespect toward Nancy Reagan when it failed to invite the former first lady -- a vigorous supporter of stem-cell research -- to a bill-signing ceremony on the subject, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday. Nancy Reagan watches President Obama sign the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act Tuesday. ""I think she speaks in real personal terms about the issue,"" Gibbs told reporters. ""And I think her candor and her courage have been heartening, and we certainly meant no slight to her whatsoever."" On Monday, Vanity Fair published an interview with Nancy Reagan on its Web site in which she suggested the Obama administration missed an opportunity by not inviting her to witness President Obama signing a measure in March expanding federal support for stem-cell research. The former first lady has long promoted such steps despite objections from many in the GOP. She has argued that expanded stem-cell research could have helped her husband, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. ""I would have gone, and you know I don't like to travel,"" she told the magazine.  Watch more on Gibbs' reaction to the controversy » . ""Politically, it would have been a good thing for (Obama) to do. Oh well, nobody's perfect. He called and thanked me for working on it. But he could have gotten more mileage out of it,"" she said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Events commemorating the bombing of an American airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie were taking place Sunday in both the UK and the U.S. to mark the 20th anniversary of the attack which killed 270 people. Mourners gathered at a wreath-laying ceremony Sunday to mark the Lockerbie bombing. All 259 people on board Pan Am flight 103 from London to New York were killed when the plane exploded in midair on December 21, 1988. A further 11 people died on the ground as debris rained down on Lockerbie. In Scotland, mourners watched as a commemorative wreath was laid at Dryfesdale Cemetery, the site of a permanent memorial and remembrance garden to the victims of the attack. Canon Michael Bands, who led the service, said that the disaster had ""long ceased to be a Lockerbie event and become a world event."" ""It is awful that we should gather today on this stormy sort of day to feel the sadness again of the tragedy that took place here 20 years ago,"" Bands said, according to the UK's Press Association. Services marking the exact time of the attack at 1903 GMT were also due to take place later in local churches. A private service for relatives of victims and former Pan Am employees will also take place at London's Heathrow airport, where the airliner began its final flight. In the U.S., remembrance services were scheduled to take place at Arlington National Cemetery and at New York's Syracuse University, which lost 35 students in the bombing. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said the anniversary marked an opportunity to reflect on ""the lasting links that have been established with those in other nations who were touched by the disaster."" ""I know that through the events being organised in Lockerbie, at Syracuse University, and at other locations in the UK and the U.S., that fitting tribute will be paid to those who so tragically lost their lives and those, in the south of Scotland and beyond, whose lives have been affected by the atrocity."" A former Libyan intelligence officer, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi, was convicted of the bombing in 2001. Al Megrahi, who is serving a life sentence in Scotland's Greenock Prison, last month lost an appeal to be released because he is suffering from advanced prostate cancer. Al Megrahi has always denied any involvement in the bombing. He was convicted after prosecutors argued he had placed the bomb, hidden in a suitcase, on a flight from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany. There, prosecutors said, the bomb was transferred onto the Pan Am jet that went first to London's Heathrow Airport and then was to continue to New York. The prosecution maintained that Megrahi, who worked at Malta's Luqa Airport, was an agent for the Libyan intelligence services and had been seen buying clothes that were in the suitcase that contained the bomb. In 2007 Scottish judges granted Megrahi the right to make a second appeal against his conviction on grounds that he may have suffered a miscarriage of justice. That process is ongoing. Another man -- Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima -- was also tried in the bombing but was acquitted. Libya has formally accepted responsibility for the bombing, though Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi later denied any culpability. The north African country has paid out more than $500 million to the families of victims of the attack as part of a wider $1.5 billion settlement to end its legal liability in U.S. terrorism cases and restore diplomatic full relations with Washington.","Events marking 20th anniversary of Lockerbie airliner bombing to be held Sunday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States on Tuesday imposed financial sanctions on an Iran-based company that it said is a cover for North Korea's missile proliferation network, the Department of the Treasury announced. Hong Kong Electronics in Kish Island, Iran, was added to the list of ""designated proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their supporters"" for working with two others already on the list: North Korea's Tanchon Commercial Bank and the Korea Mining Development Trading Corp. (KOMID), according to a Treasury news release. The designation under Executive Order 13382 freezes any U.S. assets of Hong Kong Electronics and prohibits any transactions with the company by U.S. individuals, companies or financial institutions, the statement said. ""North Korea uses front companies like Hong Kong Electronics and a range of other deceptive practices to obscure the true nature of its financial dealings, making it nearly impossible for responsible banks and governments to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate North Korean transactions,"" said Stuart Levey, the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the Treasury. ""Today's action is a part of our overall effort to prevent North Korea from misusing the international financial system to advance its nuclear and missile programs and to sell dangerous technology around the world."" The Treasury statement alleged that Hong Kong Electronics has transferred millions of dollars of proliferation-related funds on behalf of Tanchon and KOMID since 2007. It also accused Hong Kong Electronics of facilitating the movement of money from Iran to North Korea on behalf of KOMID. Tanchon, a commercial bank based in Pyongyang, North Korea, is the financial arm for KOMID, which the Treasury statement described as North Korea's premier arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons. Both Tanchon and KOMID were previously subjected to sanctions under Executive Order 13382 and sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, according to the Treasury statement. It said both also had ties with other sanctioned entities, including Iran's Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, which it called the Iranian organization responsible for developing liquid-fueled missiles.","Hong Kong Electronics called a cover for North Korea's missile proliferation network .

"Men who are circumcised are less likely to get sexually transmitted infections such as genital herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), but not syphilis, according to a study of adult African men published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. Circumcision rates have traditionally been higher in the U.S. than in Europe, but they've been on the decline. The finding adds to the evidence that there are health benefits to circumcision. It was already known that circumcision can reduce the risk of penile cancer, a relatively rare disease. In a previous study, the same research team found that adult circumcision could reduce the risk of HIV infection. Efforts to increase the practice of male circumcision in areas with high rates of sexually transmitted infections, including Africa, could have a tremendous benefit, say the study's authors. Genital herpes has been associated with an increased risk of HIV, and HPV can cause genital warts as well as a higher risk of anal, cervical (in women), and penile cancers. Health.com: Is your partner cheating? How to protect yourself . In the United States, infant circumcision is declining. About 64 percent of American male infants were circumcised in 1995, down from more than 90 percent in the 1970s. Rates tend to be higher in whites (81percent) than in blacks (65 percent) or Hispanics (54 percent). Some opponents say the removal of the foreskin is an unnecessary surgical procedure that may reduce sexual sensitivity in adulthood. In Jewish and Muslim cultures, young or infant boys are routinely circumcised for religious reasons. Circumcision rates have traditionally been higher in the U.S. than in Europe, but the American Academy of Pediatrics currently says that the medical benefits are insufficient to recommend circumcision for all baby boys. In the new study, a research team at the Rakai Health Sciences Program in Uganda -- in collaboration with researchers from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, and Makerere University in Uganda -- conducted two clinical trials involving 3,393 uncircumcised men ages 15 to 49. All the men were negative for HIV and genital herpes (also known as herpes simplex virus type 2); a subgroup of men also tested negative for HPV. Roughly half of the men underwent medically supervised circumcision at the start of the trial, while the other half were circumcised two years later. Overall, circumcision reduced the men's risk of genital herpes by 28 percent (10.3 percent of uncircumcised men developed genital herpes compared with 7.8 percent of circumcised men) and HPV infection by 35 percent (27.8 percent of uncircumcised men were infected with HPV compared with 18 percent of circumcised men). Circumcision did not, however, protect against syphilis. (About 2 percent of men in both groups contracted syphilis.) Health.com: A sexual risk taker comes to terms with drinking, depression, and STDs . Study coauthor Thomas C. Quinn, M.D., professor of global health at Johns Hopkins University, says that choosing circumcision, whether it's the parents of an infant or an adult male for himself, is and should remain an individual decision. ""But the critics need to really look at the benefits versus the risks,"" he adds. ""By now a large body of evidence has shown that the health benefits clearly outweigh the minor risk associated with the surgery. In our study, we didn't see any adverse effects or mutilation. We're recommending supervised, safe, sterile environments -- not circumcision out in an open field with rusty instruments."" Increasing circumcision rates in Africa may not only help men, but would likely protect women too, possibly lowering the rates of female cervical cancer, the authors say. Ronald H. Gray, M.D., professor of public health at Johns Hopkins University and study coauthor, says that the researchers plan to look at whether male circumcision reduces the transmission of HPV to female sexual partners. Health.com: 10 questions to ask a new partner before having sex . Even in the United States, this study has relevance, says Anthony Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which funded one of the trials). ""In this country, circumcision for infant boys remains a personal decision for the parents,"" he says. ""This makes us rethink whether doctors should be more aggressive in recommending that it at least be considered. If parents say no just because generations before them have said no, they should learn more about the significant health benefits before making that choice."" Roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults have had at least one HPV infection, according to an editorial by Matthew R. Golden, M.D., and Judith N. Wasserheit, M.D., both of the University of Washington. Although vaccines against some of the most dangerous HPV strains have been approved for girls ages 13 to 26, the vaccines are expensive and routine Pap tests are still necessary to pick up cervical cancers. Health.com: How to tell your ex you have an STD . Golden and Wasserheit note that ""rates of circumcision are declining and are lowest among black and Hispanic patients, groups in whom rates of HIV, herpes, and cervical cancer are disproportionately high."" Medicaid, which insures many low-income patients in these populations, does not pay for routine infant circumcision in 16 states. The study authors hope that this growing evidence in favor of circumcision will persuade policy-making bodies, both in the United States and in other countries, to officially recommend the procedure -- which could make patient education and insurance coverage more likely. It's not clear why circumcision may affect infection rates. But the study authors suggest that penile foreskin may provide a moist, favorable environment for herpes and HPV to survive and enter cells on the skin's surface. Once the foreskin is surgically removed, the risk of infection may be reduced. Health.com: Men can lose their sex drives too . They also note, however, that male circumcision is not completely effective in preventing sexually transmitted infections.

"(CNN) -- Anger is growing in Mexico over a fire at a government-run day care center that claimed its 46th child this weekend. Maria Jesus Coronado Padilla mourns for her 2-year-old daughter, who died in the Hermosillo fire. Parents of the dead children and their supporters have held two noisy rallies in Hermosillo, the city in northwestern Mexico where the fire broke out June 5. They blame the government for laxity in enforcing safety regulations, for conducting a weak investigation and for failing to punish anyone in the 10 days since the fatal blaze. ""It is my fault for trusting them,"" parent Roberto Zavala said at a rally Saturday in front of the Sonora governor's office. ""I am responsible for the death of my child. Mr. Governor: Here is one of those responsible you are looking for. Come get me. I am waiting for you."" The rally was televised nationwide by CNN affiliate TV Azteca. ""If there is no justice from the authorities, there will be vengeance from the people,"" Zavala shouted to great cheers. The crowd chanted ""renuncia, renuncia"" (""resign, resign"") toward the office of Sonora Gov. Eduardo Bours Castelo. He did not appear at the rally. Bours told CNN on Monday that he understands parents' anguish but has not heard any calls for his resignation. ""What we are seeing is natural,"" he said. ""There are destroyed families. It's natural that people express their sadness and, in some cases, anger. And there are those who are using this for political purposes."" The investigation, he said, is ""complex and advancing."" Mexican President Felipe Calderon has promised a full investigation. Officials have said an air-conditioning unit in a government-run warehouse in the same building as the ABC day care center caused the fire. The privately owned day care was leased by the government to provide low-cost service to parents. Many prominent Mexicans have joined the parents in saying the government is not doing enough to find out what happened and to punish the responsible parties. ""There are 46 children, and nothing is happening,"" said radio and TV commentator Eduardo J. Ruiz-Healy. ""Nobody is responsible. Federal authorities say nothing major happened. There are 46 dead children, and no one will go to jail for it."" Ana Maria Salazar, another TV and radio commentator, also has voiced her anger -- in newspaper columns, on Facebook and on her blogs. Salazar, who lives in Mexico City, grew up in Sonora state and traveled to Hermosillo last week. ""I just returned from Hermosillo, Sonora,"" she wrote Wednesday on her blog. ""Sorrow for the death of the [then] 44 children is now transforming into outrage. The death of these children has impacted Hermosillo, the state of Sonora and Mexico."" She's still angry, she told CNN on Monday. ""My concern is that there are 46 children who died in what appears to be negligence and that nobody's going to be punished,"" Salazar said. In addition, she said, the government has not conducted any investigations to see if other day care centers are safe. ""What is unacceptable,"" Salazar said, ""is that nothing has been done to make sure this doesn't happen again."" The United Nations Children's Fund's representative in Mexico, Susana Sottoli, said all day care centers in the nation should be investigated, the state-run Notimex news agency reported Monday. Last week, Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora said officials had found safety irregularities at the ABC day care center in 2005. He declined to detail those irregularities but said authorities are investigating if anything was done about them. ABC day care officials denied Monday ever being told of safety problems. Critics point to cozy business relationships between the owners of the ABC day care and government officials. News reports have said one of the co-owners is a cousin of Calderon's wife. Two state government officials whose wives also are ABC co-owners resigned last week. In all, six officials have resigned or been fired since the blaze. The well-regarded El Universal newspaper published a column and a story Monday taking the government to task. The article says a Universal investigation revealed that family members and political allies of the governor own at least 13 day care centers in Sonora state. The ABC day care is not one of them. Bours, who was elected governor in 2003, called the article ""malintentioned."" ""Some of my relatives had those [day care centers] since before I was governor,"" he said. ""This is a low blow by people who want to link one thing with another."" But Ruiz-Healy calls the day care industry in Mexico ""a business run by politicians and politicians' wives."" And he rails at what he sees as arrogance by government officials, whose actions, he said, have led to ""a total crisis of credibility."" ""There have been a series of events that insult our intelligence,"" Ruiz-Healy said. ""The political class is divorced from reality and from the rest of the country.""","Parents, their supporters have rallied in Hermosillo, where fire broke out June 5 .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A technical snafu left some Visa prepaid cardholders stunned and horrified Monday to see a $23,148,855,308,184,500 charge on their statements. Josh Muszynski noticed the 17-digit charge while making a routine balance inquiry. That's about 2,007 times the size of the national debt. Josh Muszynski, 22, of Manchester, New Hampshire, was one Visa customer aghast to find the 17-digit charge on his bill. Adding insult to injury, he had also been hit with a $15 overdraft fee. He noticed that his debt exceeded the world GDP while making a routine balance inquiry on his online Bank of America account. According to his statement, he had spent the profound sum in one pop at a nearby Mobil gas station -- his regular stop for Camel cigarettes. ""Very, very panicked,"" he jumped in his car and sped to the station. Had they perhaps noticed any ""outrageous"" charges come across their books recently, he inquired of the cashier there. She checked the records. They had not.  Watch the story of an astounded customer in Memphis, Tennessee » . Muszynski wondered aloud what he might possibly have asked to purchase for such an astronomical price. ""Can I buy Europe on pump 4?"" He next called Bank of America, the issuer of his Visa prepaid debit card. The bank kept him on hold for two hours, during which time he contemplated the impossibly bleak financial future that might await him. He also felt a stab of fear that he had saddled all his unborn grandchildren -- and their grandchildren -- with a lifetime of debt. ""Down the generational line, nobody would have any money."" Finally, a bank representative told him that the $23 quadrillion charge -- and the $15 overdraft fee -- would be stricken from his account. Muszynski compared the giant debt reprieve to receiving ""an amazing Monopoly card that says, 'Bank error in your favor.' "" In a statement, Visa said the rogue charges affected ""fewer than 13,000 prepaid transactions"" and resulted from a ""temporary programming error at Visa Debit Processing Services ... [which] caused some transactions to be inaccurately posted to a small number of Visa prepaid accounts."" The company assured customers that the problem has been fixed and that all falsely issued fees have been voided.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Music fans who buy concert tickets during Live Nation's ""No Service Fee Wednesday"" may be surprised when they check their receipt and see some service fees were charged. Concertgoers expecting service-free tickets during a Live Nation promotion may still find fees. Live Nation's announcement for the promotion -- and stories based on their news release -- did not mention the concert promoter's narrow definition of a ""service fee."" ""Fans will still be asked to pay parking fees (usually $6) as well as in some cases facility fees and/or charity fees,"" Live Nation spokesman John Vlautin wrote in a reply to CNN's request for clarification. Still, the promotion will save consumers several dollars on amphitheater lawn seats bought from 12:01 a.m. to 11:59 p.m. Wednesday. Vlautin did not respond to CNN's question about why the promotion was called ""No Service Fee Wednesday"" if there were still fees added to the base cost of each ticket -- or why it was not disclosed in the announcement. Service fees tacked on to ticket purchases -- averaging a third of the base price -- have long been a source of grumbling from concertgoers. ""People get a little ticked off when they think they're paying $20 for a ticket and as they progress along the various pages of the electronic transaction they see more fees added along the way,"" said Ray Waddell, who writes about live music tours for Billboard magazine. When buying tickets online using a credit card, the buyer does not see the total charged -- with the added fees -- until after they've submitted the order. Live Nation discloses this in its ""terms and conditions"" statement: . ""Live Nation Ticketing may assess a convenience charge on each ticket purchased and/or ordered for certain events."" The parking fee, which does not actually pay for a parking space, is on each ticket -- even if the fan doesn't drive to the show. ""We have always charged it this way to alleviate traffic issues that occur when the fee is taken at the lot entrance,"" Vlautin said. A facility fee is ""charged at some venues and goes to defray the cost of venue maintenance,"" he said. Vlautin did not respond to CNN's request for a detailed list of service fees that will be waived during ""No Service Fee Wednesday."" Live Nation only began selling tickets to its own concerts last year, just months before announcing plans to merge with Ticketmaster -- the world's largest ticket-seller. Before that, Live Nation promoted shows but had no infrastructure to sell tickets, and it contracted out to Ticketmaster or others to sell them. The Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger plan has drawn criticism. The Justice Department launched an investigation of the proposed merger in February. Neither Live Nation nor Ticketmaster executives would respond to questions about the merger. However, Ticketmaster CEO Irving Azoff did talk about it before a U.S. Senate subcommittee earlier this year. ""[The merger] will give us greater flexibility in how we promote, market and sell tickets to events. It will give us a pathway to alternative pricing and fee structures. And we will be better able to develop new and innovative products and services that enhance the fan experience and make all forms of entertainment more accessible to everyone.""","Live Nation promotion doesn't mention narrow definition of a ""service fee""

"(CNN) -- A Los Angeles-area man has been charged with murder in the death of his wife while on a cruise along the Mexican coast, an FBI spokesman told CNN sister network HLN. Shirley McGill, 55, was found dead on Tuesday in her cabin on the Carnival Elation. Shirley McGill, 55, was found dead in her cabin on the Carnival Elation on Tuesday as the ship, after a five-day cruise to Cabo San Lucas, was heading back to its origination point of San Diego, California, authorities said.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- Russian authorities are investigating the recent killing of a model-turned-bodyguard. Anna Loginova in a photo shoot for the Russian edition of Maxim magazine. Anna Loginova, a 29-year-old former successful model, ran a private security firm of female bodyguards, highly trained in martial arts, demanding high prices to protect Russian billionaires. One notable client was Russian boxer Kostya Tszyu. A carjacker pulled Loginova out of her Porsche Cayenne Sunday in Moscow. Loginova grabbed onto the door handle as the car picked up speed and she was dragged along the street before letting go as the car sped away. ""An intruder just threw her out of the car"" Russian police stated, ""She grabbed the door handle, but when the car picked up speed, she let go."" Her fearlessness proved fatal. Loginova died on the scene from serious cranial injuries. The vehicle was later found abandoned in southern Moscow. Luxury car theft is common in Moscow.

"(CNN) -- Dionne Warwick was one of the thousands of guests to attend Michael Jackson's memorial service Tuesday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. Dionne Warwick said Michael Jackson brought a new insight to things people should be paying attention to. Warwick talks with CNN's Larry King about the moving tributes during the service and the legacy left behind by the ""King of Pop."" King also talks with Warwick's son, Damon Elliott, who has been a friend of Jackson's since childhood and was writing a song with Michael just before his death. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: What did you think of the event, Dionne? Dionne Warwick: Well, it was probably one of the most emotional mornings and afternoons that I've spent in a very long time. It was done with a great deal of style and class. King: He would've liked it? Warwick: He would've loved it. He would've loved it. King: How did you and Michael hook up, Damon? Damon Elliott: From Mom. We shared moms. When I was very little, I used to beg her probably at least once a week, ""Mom, you have to take me out to the house, you have to take me out to the house."" She'd always say, ""I'm on tour right now, baby. But when we I get home, we'll go see Michael."" And one day we did, and he showed up, I think, in my living room or somewhere. King: You were writing a song at his death? Elliott: Yes. Actually, I was working on some music for the new record that I was going to get over to Jermaine. And the night before he passed away, it's crazy we were writing a song. King: How great a singer was Michael Jackson? Warwick: Michael was... King: A singer -- a pure singer? Warwick: And he could sing. Yes. Yes. It was more than the magic of everything else that he did. He was a brilliant singer. King: What was he like to work with, if you were working on a song together? What was that experience like? Elliott: Well, from a distance, I got to work with Michael. I mostly worked through Jermaine, who was another amazing talent. But just all the brothers, you know, they have so much conviction and so much feeling in their delivery.  Watch Jackson family address crowd » . And Michael was like the greatest teacher to all of us -- producers, dancers, singers, songwriters. He just had it all. He would come in and beat box a melody and you'd try to emulate it on a drum machine and it just was impossible. So you'd just keep what he did. King: What's Michael Jackson's legacy? Warwick: The wonderful things that he did for this entire world. I think he brought a new insight as to the things that we really should be paying attention to. He did it brilliantly, and I think that's his legacy.","Singer Dionne Warwick: Jackson's memorial service was done with style, class .

"(The Frisky) -- You don't have to be Jennifer Aniston to think that the four women who Krazy-Glued a cheater's penis to his stomach were way harsh and beyond psycho. If  your ex's loved ones ask why you broke up, it's OK to admit he cheated on you, writer says. But in our less scrupulous/mature moments, many of us want to punish a particularly nasty ex, especially if he was a cheater. Ladies, let's keep it legal (and Krazy Glue-free), OK? Here are 10 ideas: . 1. Email his crappiest crap e-mail to Jezebel.com's Crap E-mail From A Dude and when they publish it, discreetly post the link as your GChat away message. 2. Call up your hottest platonic male friend, grab your digital camera and go do something adorable together. Now it's time to create a Facebook photo album full of pics of you looking smiley. (Bonus points if your ex was slightly paranoid that this guy had a thing for you). The Frisky: Possible to remain friends with an ex? 3. Permanently adopt that comfy sweatshirt he left at your place.

"(CNN) -- Former Miss California USA Carrie Prejean wants to set the record straight. Carrie Prejean says pageant officials wanted her to make appearances for Playboy and a gay movie premiere. Prejean garnered widespread criticism when she declared her opposition to same-sex marriage in a response to a question posed to her during the Miss USA pageant. Prejean was allowed to keep her Miss California USA crown in May, despite a controversy over topless photos and missed appearances. However, state pageant Executive Director Keith Lewis took her crown on Wednesday, saying it was a business decision based solely on ""contract violations."" Prejean offered her side of the story when she spoke with CNN's Larry King on Friday. She also discussed whether she would sue to reclaim her title and her future plans. The following is an edited version of the interview. Larry King: You've had a couple of days now, Carrie, to think it all over and it's sunk in. What are your feelings today? Carrie Prejean: I'm definitely a little bit surprised just by the way that I found out about this. You know, I was called by the media to inform me that I was fired. King: Are you saying the pageant didn't call you? Prejean: No. I haven't received any phone calls. In fact, my lawyer found out from the media, as well, before we received any contact. I still have not, to this day, received any contact from Mr. Lewis. King: Now, since they were so supportive of you at the time and after the Trump announcement, what do you make of the fact that they didn't call you? Prejean: Well, I think Mr. Trump was definitely in the middle. And I think that, you know, he has only heard one side. Ultimately, at the end of the day, you have to think about, Are you going to release Mr. Keith Lewis or are you going to release Carrie Prejean? I think that they had to release the beauty queen at the end of the day. King: How do you respond to (charges from Lewis)? Prejean: Well, Larry, all I can tell you was this basically comes down to the answer that I gave the night of the pageant. As you can see, Mr. Lewis does not agree with the stance that I took. I think he's very angry. I think he's hurt. He said in a previous statement that he's deeply saddened and hurt that -- what Carrie Prejean believes in -- a marriage is between a man and a woman. Politics and religion have no play in the Miss California family. My question is, then why was the question asked at the pageant in the first place? If politics has no role in the pageant, why was I given this question? It was a hidden personal agenda that judge No. 8 asked, and I think that they were not ready for my answer that I gave. King: Let's say they were upset by your remarks. They didn't like your answer. Why didn't they just tell Donald Trump, we're unhappy and let's pick the runner-up or whatever? Prejean: He absolutely did. I mean Keith Lewis held a press conference in Los Angeles and didn't invite me to the press conference and, you know, awarded the first runner up as the new ambassador of California. That is just undermining me and undermining his own titleholder from day one.  Watch how e-mails between Prejean, Lewis may have contributed to firing » . As far as the other appearances, I've had some inappropriate appearances that Keith Lewis has asked me to do. And I'm sure you're aware of them already -- one of them being Playboy; another one being a reality show which is being filmed in Costa Rica. So had I said yes to these, I mean, I would have been out of the country. Again, Playboy, I couldn't believe. I was completely shocked that he would even pass this along to me. Another one was a gay movie premiere that he wanted me to attend incognito. He actually said he wanted me to wear a hat and go in disguise and attend this movie premiere promoting gay marriage and then come out with a statement the next day saying that Carrie Prejean attended a gay movie premiere. It just doesn't seem right, Larry, does it? King: Are you now sorry you even entered. Or, in retrospect, has this been a boom for you publicity-wise? Prejean: You know, this isn't something that I signed up for, Larry. I simply entered in a pageant, the Miss California USA contest, and I gave an answer that a lot of people weren't expecting. The bottom line, I took a stand, and I think I am now being punished for the answer that I gave. This isn't about contracts. This isn't about me missing out on appearances. If you want to ask Keith Lewis any appearances that I have made prior to the Miss California U.S. pageant, I will guarantee you, Larry, he will not even -- he can't even tell you an appearance that he -- he scheduled for me. This isn't about appearances. This isn't about a breach of contract. This is about Keith Lewis not agreeing with the stance that I took on saving traditional marriage. And from day one, he wanted me out. King: Well, are you going to sue, Carrie? Prejean: That's -- you know, that's something that is not something that I want to -- I want to do. I think that what's going on is wrong. And I think that there is definitely some information that is missing. And I know that sooner or later, the truth will come out and people will recognize here who's right and who's wrong. King: What are your lawyers telling you to do or advising you to do? Prejean: You know, that's up to my lawyers to determine whether or not they think that there will be a lawsuit involved. But that's not up to me, at this point. King: What are you going to do right now, career-wise? Prejean: Well, first of all, I want to thank the millions of viewers. I know you have so many viewers on your show, Larry. Thank you so much for your support. Thank you to all the Californians who have supported me, who backed me, who sent me thousands of letters and e-mails. I just want to thank you so much for your prayers, for your support. And I know that when God is for you, no one can be against you. So thank you. King: Can you tell us what you're going to do, though? Prejean: I'm not sure. Definitely some -- a lot of offers -- opportunities have come my way, a lot of offers. I'm just really excited. I feel relieved. I feel just so blessed and so honored to have represented the state of California. And I'm ready to move on with my life and just be where God leads me.","Carrie Prejean says she learned she lost Miss California USA crown from media .

"ALSIP, Illinois (CNN) -- A Cook County cemetery where hundreds of graves were dug up and allegedly resold has been declared a crime scene, meaning that relatives of people believed buried there will not be allowed to visit for several days, an official said Friday. Family members and police gather outside the Burr Oak Cemetery office in Alsip, Illinois, on Wednesday. ""It would be the height of irresponsibility for me to invite people in, to raise expectations and then crash them,"" Cook County Sheriff Thomas J. Dart told reporters in a news conference held at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. He pleaded for patience, saying he hoped to reopen the 150-acre cemetery to the public in five to seven days. Dart said the scope of the investigation has broadened to include ""Babyland,"" a section of the cemetery intended for children. ""A lot of women came up to me and asked for help with Babyland,"" he said. ""To a person, every one I talked to could not find any of their children in Babyland.""  Watch sheriff discuss gruesome revelation » . A large number of grave sites ""are completely missing,"" he said, adding that he had received more than 5,000 telephone inquiries and 1,700 e-mails about the matter since the investigation began. As many as half of the complaints were about missing headstones, 25 to 30 percent were about loved ones who had been relocated, he said. He cited the experience of one family looking for 10 relatives buried there. ""They couldn't find anybody,"" he said. In addition, in some cases there are no records of burials having taken place, despite relatives' insistence that they did, he said. In other cases, records have been altered, destroyed or found in people's houses, he said. ""Our office has to investigate over 5,000 grave sites due to the vast amounts of inquiries from grieving family members,"" he said. Dart said he himself walked through the cemetery on Friday and what he saw was disturbing. ""I found bones out there,"" he said. ""I found individuals wandering aimlessly looking for their loved ones who can't find them."" Some people told him that an entire area that used to have gravestones facing in one direction now has them facing in another direction, he said. ""This is getting bigger,"" he said. ""We don't have an end in sight ... more people have not found relatives than have found them."" More than 2,000 families have descended on the cemetery since authorities uncovered what they say was a scheme to resell the plots, excavate the graves, dump the remains and pocket the cash. Four people face felony charges for their alleged involvement. He had said earlier this week that the number of disturbed graves was around 300, but said Friday that number was sure to rise. One family arrived on Thursday to bury a woman in a plot they had purchased and found the plot was already occupied, he said. Authorities also discovered Emmett Till's original casket in a dilapidated garage on the cemetery grounds. The casket had been replaced by a new one after Till's body was exhumed in 2005. ""There was wildlife living inside of it,"" Dart said of the old casket, found in the corner of a garage filled with lawn care equipment and other ""piles of things."" Till was killed in August 1955 in Mississippi after the 14-year-old reportedly whistled at a white woman. His body was exhumed 50 years later as part of a renewed investigation into his death. The Chicago Tribune reported that he was reburied in a different casket. Thousands of people had viewed Till's body in the original casket in Chicago shortly after he was killed, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said at the news conference. ""His mother had the gut and grit to say that 'I want America to see what they did to my baby's body,'"" Jackson said about Till, whose body was mutilated. ""More than 100,000 saw his body lying at the church. It is said that those who saw his body were never the same again,"" he said. ""Emmett Till's lynching redefined emotions in our culture in very fundamental ways. So to see his casket in this state of desecration and neglect is very painful."" Cemetery groundskeepers told investigators that Till's grave was not among those disturbed in the alleged resale scheme, Dart said earlier this week. Carolyn Towns, an office manager for the cemetery; and Keith Nicks, Terrance Nicks and Maurice Daley, all gravediggers, have each been charged with dismembering a human body, a felony charge for which sentences range from six to 30 years, authorities said. Steven Watkins, an attorney for Towns, said his client is innocent. The public defender's office in Cook County said it had represented the three others at the bond hearing but could not provide a statement for them. Authorities began investigating the cemetery -- where, along with Till, blues legend Dinah Washington and some Negro League baseball players are buried -- about six weeks ago after receiving a call from its owners, who said they suspected ""financial irregularities"" regarding the business, Dart said earlier this week. He said the owners are not believed to be involved in the alleged scam.","Officials say there was scheme to resell plots, excavate the graves, dump remains .

"(CNN) -- Once-missing Virginia Tech mental health records regarding a student who killed 32 people and himself in a campus rampage were released Wednesday. Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and faculty members on April 16, 2007, then killed himself. The records cover all the interactions between Cho Seung-Hui, 23, and Virginia Tech's Cook Counseling Center during November and December 2005 -- the only times the center saw Cho, the university said, and nearly two years before his April 16, 2007, shooting spree. They were found recently at the home of Dr. Robert Miller, the center's former director. According to the university, Miller's attorney has said the records were inadvertently taken from the center when Miller left his job there more than a year before the shootings. The records detail a phone evaluation by the counseling center on November 30, 2005, and on December 12, 2005. Cho was evaluated in person following his release from a mental health facility on December 14, 2005. He was sent to the facility on a temporary detention order, the records indicate, after a female student filed a complaint with university police that Cho had been instant-messaging her and left a message on her dry erase board. The records from the facility, Carilion St. Albans, note that Cho told his suitemate he might as well kill himself because ""everybody just hates me."" The records said Cho stayed overnight at the facility. ""Essentially, it does not appear that he had any serious intent when he made the suicidal statement,"" the records said. ""He was counseled about the need to act responsibly."" In each of the three evaluations at the Cook Counseling Center, Cho ""explicitly denied any intent to hurt himself or others and there was no evidence to the contrary,"" Virginia Tech said in its statement. ""At the time of his last appointment, Cho was completing his fall 2005 semester exams and was scheduled to spend the holiday break with his family. He was provided with emergency contact information. ""As we know, Cho never called or returned to the Cook Counseling Center, and more than a year elapsed between the time he was evaluated by counseling center professionals and the tragic events of April 2007."" The records also contain a December 14, 2005, e-mail to the center from a university housing official, documenting Cho's ""history of erratic behavior and counseling-based issues at the time of his referral to Carilion St. Albans."" Cho's suitemate had notified police because he had made suicidal statements and had ""blades"" in his room, said the e-mail. Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine said last month the files were discovered at Miller's home in connection with a civil lawsuit, but did not elaborate. The records' absence was a mystery and a concern during the investigation, he said. The governor said his office was asking the Cho family for permission to make the records public. Cho's family agreed earlier Wednesday to the records' release. ""The family has consistently favored and urged disclosure of their son's and brother's records in the interest of advancing the investigation into the tragic events of April 16, 2007, as well as ensuring that the families of the victims have as much information as possible,"" said family attorney Bernard DiMuro in a letter to Mike Melis, Virginia assistant attorney general. ""The unavailability of pertinent counseling center records during more than two years of investigation and review has created needless uncertainty and understandable speculation that has compounded the suffering of the survivors, families and the Virginia Tech community as a whole,"" the university said in a statement. The records confirm facts already established by the panel that reviewed the incident, the university said. But ""Virginia Tech remains deeply dismayed by the prolonged unavailability of the records and looks forward to the completion of the Virginia State Police investigation into their unauthorized removal from the Cook Counseling Center."" CNN's Eric Fiegel contributed to this report.","Files show dialogue between Cho Seung-Hui and VT's Cook Counseling Center .

"(CNN) -- Cars have Global Positioning System devices to pinpoint where drivers are when they get lost, so why can't GPS be used to locate the exact position of planes when the worst happens? There is currently no way to constantly track planes as they fly over oceans. It took search and rescue teams over 30 hours to locate the wreckage of the Air France plane that crashed in the Atlantic on Monday. It appears that the aircraft's onboard GPS system was little help to rescuers in the mission. Although details of Air France flight 447's fate remain uncertain, in some air accidents, this critical time could mean the difference between life and death for any survivors. Michel Roelandt, aviation expert for Eurocontrol, a European air navigation safety organization, told CNN that nearly all modern planes are fitted with GPS navigation systems. How sophisticated those the communications and navigation systems are is down to individual airlines when they fit out their planes, an Airbus spokesperson told CNN. On board GPS systems are primarily navigation tools for the crew, and do not currently enable a constant tracking of a jet by a ground crew at all times. Planes receive a position signal, but don't transmit that back. This is not a problem when a jet is flying over land or in coastal areas, as it is tracked by radar. Over oceans radar does not work as it relies on line-of-sight tracking from a ground station. On oceanic flights a flight crew will know its exact position via GPS, but it is not able to be tracked by air traffic control. It is left to someone in the cockpit to relay information via satellite communication to air traffic control or a ground station. ""Airlines often have a contract with a private operator to provide their satellite communications. Some companies pay for it, some have free contracts,"" Roelandt said. Modern jets equipped with an Aircraft Communication, Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), like the A330-200, are also able to send automatic digital signals. These are not instigated by the crew but report automatically on the plane's systems and relay information to a receiving station. In AF447's case that was Air France's head-quarters in France. According to an Airbus spokesperson, it is up to an airline to determine how much information is sent in a data signal; it may or may not include location details. Shortly before the AF447 disappeared, its automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to Air France's maintenance computers, indicating that ""several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down,"" Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon said on Monday. When the Air France Airbus A330-200's systems failed these messages would no longer have been able to be transmitted. They did relay the plane's location, but the plane continued flying for an unknown period of time, so the precise location where it went down could not be known. Once a plane loses its electronic system, the automatic data messages can no longer be sent, and in those circumstances no one on the flight deck would be able to transmit a message either. Aviation experts have stated that the idea of GPS tracking has not been part of any safety review within the aviation industry. The general consensus has been that a trained flight crew is on hand that always has the capability to be in contact with someone on the ground should an emergency arise. In the case of Air France Flight 447, it appears that the crew had no time to relay an emergency message. As well as searching for wreckage, a crashed plane can be found by pin-pointing the location of the in-flight black box recorder. Black box flight recorder devices contain flight deck data and crew voice recordings. When a plane has crashed black box recorders automatically emit a honing signal, located via radar. Emitting a regular ping for 30 days it can be picked up via radio waves, meaning there is a limit to the distance from the device search and rescue teams can be before they can pick up the signal. According to Airbus the capabilities of tracking a black box is down to the airline; satellite tracking of black box recorders is not a standard requirement. The Air France jet was equipped with a satellite-tracked black box recorder, but it is thought that depths of the ocean in the crash area are too deep for it to be located It's also possible, although unlikely, that the location of a troubled aircraft could be pinpointed by military defense satellites, experts said. Some U.S. military satellites employ heat-sensitive cameras that scan the skies for missiles and could possibly detect a plane if it were not obscured by clouds, said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a public policy organization whose Web site provides news on weapons systems and the defense industry. Upgrading from radar to satelitte . The aviation industry is moving toward replacing its traditional radar-based tracking system with a satellite one that would allow air traffic control to know where a plane is at all times. However the new systems would still not enable air traffic control to track planes over remote ocean areas. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has begun implementing a system, nicknamed NextGen, in which GPS signals would transmit an aircraft's precise location to air traffic controllers via ground receivers. The system would allow planes to fly more direct routes instead of zig-zagging between radio beacons. The FAA is testing the system in pockets of the U.S. and plans to be using it by the end of the year in the Gulf of Mexico, much of which is out of radar range. The agency hopes NextGen will cover the entire country by 2013. Roelandt says a similar system will be implemented in Europe by 2015. ""It means planes will automatically transmit the GPS position to the ground and surrounding aircraft within about 150 miles,"" he said. ""In the far future the idea is to be in a free flight condition,"" where pilots have more flexibility in their routes while GPS keeps planes safely separated. In a trial last year using an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast system, two Airbus planes were able to change altitude safely while cruising over oceanic airspace. At present, airliners flying over oceans are usually not permitted to change altitude, because oceanic airspace beyond a certain distance from land cannot be controlled by radar. Controllers and pilots keep the planes on vectors, or defined highways in the sky, to maintain safe distances between aircraft. The ADS-B system is being developed internationally. But the expense of outfitting planes with GPS is dwarfed by the cost to upgrade from radar to satellite tracking of planes. According to a 2006 FAA report, it would cost $4.6 billion to change to a satellite-based system in the U.S. ""It's a bit of a chicken and egg situation,"" Roelandt said. ""If you don't put an implementing rule on this equipment, airlines won't install it as it's a costly operation for them. It is ongoing, and will be installed on European commercial airliners, but it takes time as always."" CNN's Brandon Griggs and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this story.","GPS on airliners can't help locate planes, as they receive but don't send signals .
Pilots know their position over an ocean but don't automatically share that data .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian authorities believe two suicide bombers checked into the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta and carried out coordinated bombings Friday morning, killing themselves and at least six victims and wounding more than 50 others. A body is removed following the blasts at the Ritz-Carlton and the nearby J.W. Marriott hotels in Jakarta on Friday. It is unclear what group is behind the attacks on the Marriott and the adjacent Ritz-Carlton hotel, Indonesia's National Police Chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso said at a news conference. He warned that the death toll could rise. Four of the six victims in Jakarta's hotel bombings were foreigners, the Indonesian Healthy Ministry said Saturday. The ministry identified two of the dead as Australian, one from New Zealand and one from Singapore. Another victim was Indonesian and the sixth remained unidentified. Eight American nationals were among the wounded, according to the U.S. State Department. Investigators are also analyzing closed-circuit television footage from the Marriott that shows a man, sporting a baseball cap and pulling a wheeled suitcase, heading toward the JW Marriott Hotel's lobby-level restaurant seconds before the deadly blast. Five victims and one suicide bomber were killed at the Marriott, according to police spokesman Inspector General Nanan Soekarna. Minutes later, another suicide bomber struck the adjacent Ritz-Carlton, killing one person and the bomber. Indonesian national police confirmed that the man seen in the CCTV video, distributed by Indonesian television, is being investigated in connection with the blast. ""We are suspecting the man in the footage because the time frame matches with the time of the bombing,"" national police spokesman Nanan Soekarma said. ""It is obviously premature to confirm it right now as we will have to wait for the lab results and the investigation to conclude."" Indonesian authorities have detained several witnesses and others for questioning, and have sent forensic evidence from the scene for testing, a spokesman for Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said. ""It's all being studied now,"" Dino Patti Djalal told CNN. Yudhoyono warned that it is still too early to determine who was behind the attacks. ""This terrorist action is thought to be the work of a terrorist group, even though it is not certain whether this is the terrorism which we are familiar with up until now,"" the recently reelected president said. See images of the aftermath » . The bombings at the two luxury hotels -- which are connected by an underground tunnel -- happened shortly before 8 a.m. (9 p.m. Thursday ET), first at the Marriott and then 10 minutes later at the Ritz-Carlton, police officials said. Both blasts struck the hotels' restaurants and several prominent international business leaders were among the casualties.  Watch footage of the scene of the blasts » . An unexploded bomb was found on the Marriott Hotel's 18th floor where several suspects believed to be linked to the bombings were staying, Hendarso said. Indonesian investigators believe the bombers checked into the Marriott on Wednesday and were scheduled to check out on Friday, he added. It is unclear how they got around the ""robust security"" at the hotels, according to Alan Orlob, security chief for Marriott Hotels. Ritz-Carlton is a subsidiary of Marriott. Orlob said there had been no indication of any ""immediate threat in Jakarta.""  Watch Orlob describe security measures » . Security has been extremely high at the Marriott hotel in Jakarta since it was struck by a car bombing in August 2003 that killed 12 people. Suspicion immediately fell on Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), the Islamist terrorist network with ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network that was tied to the 2003 Marriott attack and the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings that killed more than 200 people, mostly foreign tourists. Hendarso said the type of explosives found were similar to those found in a recent raid on a home in West Java that was linked to Noordin Top, a suspected leader of a small JI splinter group that espouses the use of large-scale terror attacks to push for the establishment of Islamic states in the region. So far, there has been no claim of responsibility for the latest attack. Al Jazeera English reported that it was in touch with a JI member who denied any involvement in Friday's hotel bombings.  Watch analysts discuss potential suspects » . The fatalities include New Zealand national Timothy David McKay, 60, according to Indonesia's state-run Antara New Agency. McKay -- the CEO of Holcim Indonesia, a cement company -- was at the hotel for a breakfast meeting with fellow prominent business leaders, the Jakarta Post reported. Indonesian media also reported that two directors of Freeport Indonesia, the largest copper and gold mining company in Indonesia, were wounded in the attacks on the two hotels. English soccer team Manchester United canceled its trip to Indonesia after the bombing. It had been scheduled to check into the Ritz-Carlton on Sunday. Hotel guests said the first blast at the Marriott shook the building. The second blast at the Ritz-Carlton apparently struck the hotel restaurant on the second floor, according to witnesses. The force of the blast blew out the windows on the Ritz-Carlton's second floor. ""The shocking part was entering the lobby, where the glass at the front of the hotel was all blown out and blood was spattered across the floor, but most people were leaving calmly,"" hotel guest Don Hammer said. Greg Woolstencroft said he had just walked past the hotels to his nearby apartment when he heard an explosion. ""I looked out my window and I saw a huge cloud of brownish smoke go up,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""I grabbed my iPhone to go downstairs ... and then the second bomb went off at the Ritz-Carlton, so I then ran around to the Ritz-Carlton and I was able to find that there had been a massive bomb that went off in this ... restaurant area and the explosion had blown out both sides of the hotel."" Woolstencroft said he saw a body that ""looked like someone who had been a suicide bomber or someone who had been very, very close to the explosion."" The chief technology officer for a television station said he had lived at the Ritz for a year before moving to his nearby apartment, and had been impressed by the facility's security. ""I just don't know how someone could get in there with a bomb, given the level of security and screening that people have to go through,"" he said, citing armed guards at checkpoints and thorough searches of people, bags and vehicles.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A high-pitched device used to combat anti-social behavior among young people has been called ""unfair"" by children's campaigners in England. ""The Mosquito"" has been used to combat anti-social behavior among young people across England . The Children's Commissioner for England, who oversees children's rights, has called for a ban on the ultra-sonic gadget, known as ""The Mosquito,"" which disperses young people by emitting sharp, piercing sounds. The device causes discomfort to younger ears by exploiting their ability to hear very high frequencies -- a power which declines once they reach their 20s. But human rights groups say the machine infringes civil rights and creates a divide between young and old. Launching the ""Buzz Off"" campaign, England's Children's Commissioner Al Aynsley-Green said: ""I have spoken to many children and young people from all over England who have been deeply affected by ultra-sonic teenage deterrents."" Aynsley-Green said about 3,500 of the devices are in use across England to split up gatherings of youth in areas such as parks and shops. ""These devices are indiscriminate and target all children and young people, including babies, regardless of whether they are behaving or misbehaving,"" he added. Youth leaders backed the campaign, adding that The Mosquito fails to address the root problems of anti-social behavior among youths -- and may even push teenagers to congregate in unsafe areas. ""Police, local authorities, and business instead should work collectively with young people and their communities to address the underlying causes of anti-social behavior in areas that cause concern,"" said Fiona Blacke, chief executive of the National Youth Agency, a government-funded group that works with young people on social development. The Mosquito was invented by Howard Stapleton, from Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, and is manufactured by Compound Security Systems. The company describes The Mosquito as an ""ultrasonic teenage deterrent"" and ""the most effective tool in our fight against anti social behavior."" It says the device has a range of 15 to 20 meters and teenagers are ""acutely aware of The Mosquito and usually move away from an area within an average of 8 to 10 minutes."" The company says The Mosquito has proved popular with shop keepers who buy it to move along gatherings of teenagers and anti-social youths. It could not be contacted for a response to criticism of the deterrent. Railway companies have also placed the device to discourage youths from spraying graffiti on trains and station walls, Compound Security said. The controversial gadget was first used by shopkeeper Robert Gough, from South Wales. He told The Times newspaper: ""Either someone has come along and wiped them off the face of the earth, or it's working."" However, Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights group Liberty, said: ""What type of society uses a low-level sonic weapon on its children? Imagine the outcry if a device was introduced that caused blanket discomfort to people of one race or gender, rather than to our kids. ""The Mosquito has no place in a country that values its children and seeks to instill them with dignity and respect.""

"BRYCEVILLE, Florida (CNN) -- Michael Ratley was known as a hero. Michael Ratley will spend the rest of his life in jail, without parole, for killing his wife with a hammer. In December 2006, Ratley carried his 2-week-old son, Aiden, and his wife, Effie Ratley, 29, from the flames as fire engulfed their Bryceville, Florida, trailer. Days after the fire, a teary-eyed Ratley told local media that love drove him to save their lives. ""I might have lost everything physical, but I've still got my two most precious things,"" Michael Ratley told CNN affiliate WJXT-TV at the time. A month later, Effie Ratley was dead, bludgeoned with a hammer in a bedroom of her in-laws' home, not far from the trailer's ashes on a dirt road marked only with a black arrow on a wooden sign. The man who was hailed as a hero for saving his wife was convicted in July of murdering her. On Tuesday, a Nassau County Court jury in Yulee, Florida, said he should spend the rest of his life in prison for the crime. Circuit Judge Robert Foster sentenced the 25-year-old to life without possibility of parole. What changed a heroic husband into a hammer-wielding wife killer?  Hero gets life for murder » . During the trial, no motive was offered. On January 27, 2007, with his parents downstairs watching TV with the door shut and his infant son in the other room, prosecutors said, Ratley put on a pair of thick black gloves, grabbed a heavy-duty hammer and went into the bedroom where his wife was lying down after taking some medication. He lifted the hammer and ""savagely and brutally beat her on the head over and over"" -- at least seven times, said Assistant State Attorney Bernie de la Rionda. During the trial, Ratley said he had nothing to do with the slaying. His defense lawyers argued that an intruder, who Ratley alleged attacked him in the barn the night before, was the culprit. But prosecutors said that was part of Ratley's plan, setting up for a scenario in which an intruder killed his wife by cutting the wire on their window. Testifying on Tuesday, his friends and family spoke of him as a church-going, gentle man who always went out of his way to help others -- the elderly at a nursing home, a neighbor whose husband was slain and sick family members. ""He has always been a caring, nonviolent person,"" said his mother, Cindy Ratley. ""He'd give you the shirt off his back."" Cindy Ratley said it had been her dream to have her close-knit family living together on her secluded 20 acres. Witnesses for Ratley tried in court to give a picture of the son, grandson, and friend they said he had always been, with the defense calling the murder a ""single, horrible snapshot"" in Ratley's overwhelmingly positive life. They urged the jury to give Ratley's son a chance to know his father, one who cares and loves deeply for him, they said. As his mother and others left the witness stand in the packed and divided courtroom, they each told Ratley they stood behind him and loved him. As they walked back to sit down, many mouthed, ""I love you."" The prosecutors argued Ratley's character couldn't be clearer, based on his actions. ""Unfortunately, the best example we have of his character is in what he did. This shows his best character,"" de la Rionda said, showing the jurors gruesome photos of Effie Ratley's injuries. De la Rionda disputed the description of Ratley as a wonderful father. ""This loving father had no problem whatsoever -- a short distance from his son -- exterminating the life of his son's mother,"" he said. Michael Ratley met Effie Williams when she was having car trouble. He offered to buy a new tire for her and change it. Effie Ratley, who enjoyed listening to '50s music and watching black-and-white movies, was thrilled when she and her husband had their baby, her family told the court Tuesday. ""Her son was her pride and joy,"" said her stepmother, Joy Williams, wearing a purple and pink ""Justice for Effie"" bracelet. ""But she never knew more than six weeks of her motherhood dreams."" By all accounts, the Ratleys' relationship had its rocky points. They were married, separated and remarried. Michael Ratley's family said that the first time the couple got married, they were worried he wasn't mature enough, that he needed to grow up, and they said the couple definitely had growing pains. ""He didn't know if he could love her enough, because he only wanted the best for her,"" Donna Stanley said, talking about her nephew. Effie Ratley's father, Duane Williams, cried on the stand Tuesday as he talked about his only daughter. His voice quivered as he tried to explain how he feels her loss each day. ""She's the first thing I think about in the morning when I wake up,"" he said, his voice wavering. ""And the last thing before I go to bed."" Neither Effie or Michael Ratley's families wanted to speak about the sentencing after the hearing, but de la Rionda said Effie's family was pleased with the result. ""They were always hoping for [the] death [penalty], but they're happy he's going to get life and he's not going to be able to get out,"" de le Rionda said. ""He's going to die in prison."" While the announcement of the sentence, which spared him from death, was greeted with a pronounced ""Yes!"" from Michael Ratley's family inside court, the gravity of the situation seemed to hit during a short recess. His grandmother began sobbing. Family members comforted her until Cindy Ratley sat down next to her. The two cried and embraced for a couple of minutes. Michael Ratley looked over, saw his grandmother upset, and he, too, began to cry.","Michael Ratley, 25, sentenced to life without parole for murdering wife .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- House Republicans on Wednesday presented what they called a ""sorely needed"" alternative to Democrats' proposals to overhaul health care. Rep. Eric Cantor says Republicans are drafting a plan to ensure all Americans have access to affordable coverage. Republicans want to make sure all Americans have access to affordable coverage, Rep. Eric Cantor, the House minority whip, said Wednesday. ""We do so by making sure we keep down costs and incorporate the ability for folks to pool together to access lower costs, to bring private sector into the game and keep government out,"" Cantor said. Neither Democrats nor Republicans have detailed how they would pay for their proposals. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, said his party's plan will cost ""far less"" than that of the Democrats and ""provide better results for the American people."" Rep. Dave Camp, R-Michigan, who co-authored the GOP plan, said it's important to make sure the bill is one with a ""common-sense approach."" ""We are not going to have a bill that is larger than the GDP [gross domestic product] of most countries, which is what we are beginning to see roll out,"" said Camp, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. ""Clearly, if we move forward and this bill is on the floor, we are going to have to have a bill that is paid for and that's going to depend on what the scores come back."" A score is a preliminary estimate of the cost of proposed legislation. A preliminary review by the Congressional Budget Office of a plan being drawn up in the Senate found it would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years to extend health insurance to 16 million people who otherwise would not be covered, about a third of the roughly 45 million now uninsured. Camp said that the House Republican proposal calls for refundable tax credits for lower-income Americans. But Camp and Republicans have not determined key details for their proposal, including the amount of those tax credits or who precisely could be eligible. House Republicans on Wednesday planned to release a two-page summary of Camp's proposal, which CNN Radio obtained. Some highlights include: . This Republican alternative bill also contains several health care ideas that are increasingly championed by both parties. This House Republican plan comes a day after fellow Republican Rep. Mark Kirk of Illinois and other moderates in the so-called Tuesday Group released their proposal, which spelled out many of the same ideas as the Camp bill. Kirk contends his plan is less partisan but said he supports Camp's effort. CNN's Lisa Desjardins contributed to this report.","NEW: Rep.

"(CNN) -- It's a high-tech, high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse. Ryan Kelly, a Web designer from London, England, says his software was used to attack an Iranian Web site. As the Iranian government seeks to crack down on the online networks being used by protesters who question the nation's election results, a community of Net-savvy users -- both inside and outside the country -- are working to try to stay one step ahead. ""To the Iranian government hackers who keep attacking the places they see as a threat, you are wasting your time,"" wrote one anonymous poster to a message board loaded with eyewitness accounts of violence, plans for protests and notices about people reported missing or dead. ""You are completely outnumbered. There are thousands of Iranians who want to be free and people who support them for every one of you there is."" That site, with a server in California, was unable to be accessed for a couple of hours Wednesday afternoon. The error could have been caused by too many people trying to access the site at the same time. The same error would be caused by a so-called ""denial of service"" attack -- using a program to flood a site with thousands of hits in a short time. Access to networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter and photography site Flickr have been blocked in Iran, where the government also has been accused of blocking text-messaging, launching denial of service attacks and spreading misinformation to protest communities online.  Watch CNN's Octavia Nasr explain how voices of dissent are getting out » . But Web users have been able to get around those roadblocks by the thousands, thanks to Internet proxies -- Web servers set up in other countries that allow Iranians to hide their computer's Internet Protocol address from censors within the country. ""I think the filters and the restrictions have been going on for so long in Iran that the experienced people are already prepared for this,"" said Jon Pincus, a former Microsoft project manager and digital activist who works on projects promoting online freedom. The networking sites have been crucial in sharing information among protesters. Equally important, they've helped spread word to news organizations now barred from covering massive anti-government demonstrations and the violence that reportedly has led to the deaths of an untold number of demonstrators. Many blogs, message boards and Web pages sharing information from inside Iran are urging users to log on through programs such as Tor, a free Web page designed to allow users to surf the Web and communicate with each other anonymously. The Web page bounces a user's information through relays -- other networks provided by volunteers all over the world -- preventing someone monitoring an Internet connection from seeing what sites are visited on that connection. The measures haven't always been successful. In Twitter posts and on various Web sites, protesters in Iran on Wednesday described having their online access shut down. Pincus compared it to Chinese dissidents trying to crack their country's stringent rules for Internet use.  iReport: Share your photos, video and stories from Iran . ""Word continues to get through, but basically it's very, very difficult,"" Pincus said ""Many people who try are caught."" In Iran, ""there's been a noticeable decline already in the amount of photos and video that's coming down,"" he said. ""That says that, thus far, the government is succeeding."" Early Thursday morning, a Twitter user with a new account and who was not following anyone else on the site was posting false information -- including a report that opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi had conceded the election and that a demonstration had been canceled because government tanks were in the street. The Twitter user posted the phone number of a ""safe house"" and urged other demonstrators to call it. Other users quickly began spreading word that they think the user is a government agent. But the fight is ever-changing and moving on, proponents said. On Twitter, users all over the world were changing their personal information and time-zone settings to make it appear they live in Iran. It's an effort, they said, to provide cover for people really posting in the country. ""Security forces are hunting for bloggers using location and timezone searches,"" read a message on a Web page titled ""Cyber War Guide for Beginners."" ""If we all become 'Iranians' it becomes much harder to find them."" Kevin Arth, 40, of Reno, Nevada, is one of the Twitter users who took up the call. ""I don't know how it started,"" said Arth, who is pursuing a degree in computer science. ""I was monitoring things that were going on at Twitter and at some point somebody said, 'Here's what we're doing.' "" Arth said he's not sure how effective the technique is -- there are other ways for Iran's government to track Internet users -- but for him it's a show of support as much as anything. ""It's easier to fight a battle when you know you've got support behind you,"" he said. And at least some members of the community are taking the fight to Iran's government and its supporters -- using some of the same online scrambling techniques they believe are being used against them.

Humor covers for Pitt's lack of tech credentials as the Hollywood hunk and star of Quentin Tarantino's new film, ""Inglourious Basterds"" offers up a range of tongue-in-cheek advice for Wired readers. He touches on subjects ranging from managing your online persona to looking at porn on your work computer. Wired says Pitt approached the magazine with ideas for the story. The magazine, which is owned by Conde Nast and is a CNN.com content partner, collaborated with Pitt and contributing photographer Dan Winters to create the article. ""How to Behave: New Rules for Highly Evolved Humans"" hits newsstands July 21. Wired said in an e-mail that the piece is a re-think of the celebrity magazine profile. On the cover, a photo shows Pitt wearing a Bluetooth device in his ear. ""Rule No. 52: Ditch the headset. He can barely pull it off -- and you are not him,"" a blurb on the magazine front says. Most of the article is delivered in a spoof question-answer format. Pitt contributes several answers, as do regular Wired writers. One question asks if a person who exaggerated his or her salary on an online dating profile should confess. ""Hell no,"" Pitt writes. ""Everyone lies online. In fact, readers expect you to lie. If you don't, they'll think you make less than you actually do. So the only way to tell the truth is to lie.""

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Security remains a top concern, as Afghanistan holds its second-ever presidential election Thursday, prompting the government to ask for a ban on media coverage of violence. An Afghan police officer walks near a bank in Kabul where an armed robbery ended in a gunbattle. Afghanistan's government has ordered the media to refrain from covering possible attacks on election day in an effort to ""ensure the wide participation of the Afghan people."" ""If anybody broadcasts or gives news about any movements or activities of terrorists, domestic media offices will be closed, and foreigners will be kicked out of the country,"" according to a statement from Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmad Zahir Faqiri. He said the order is in line with Afghanistan's constitution, which allows for such mandates ""in exceptional situations"" to protect ""national interest and national security."" Escalating violence in the capital, Kabul, this week has made some Afghans think twice about whether to venture out to vote. ""If we are not at peace, why should we vote, who should we vote for?"" asked Ferishta, 21, who last weekend lay in a blood-soaked shirt and was connected to an intravenous drip after a suicide bombing. But at least one independent news agency refused to heed a blackout on reports of violence. Restricting media freedoms has no basis in the Afghan constitution, said the Kabul-based Pajhwok News Agency. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul insisted that press freedoms are necessary to ensure credible elections. ""While we recognize the sovereign rights of the Afghan government and note their intention to encourage Afghans to turn out and vote, we believe that free media reporting is directly linked to the credibility of the elections and continue to support the freedom of the press and responsible reporting,"" spokeswoman Fleur Cowan said in an e-mail. On the eve of the election, roadside bombs killed three Afghan election workers in the southern province of Kandahar, and four others were killed Tuesday in the northern province of Badakshan, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan spokesman Noor Mohammad Noor said. Amid the violence, the candidates wrapped up last-minute campaigning with the hope that the elections can showcase their country's fledgling democracy. ""We're at a moment of truth,"" said Mark Schneider, senior vice president of the International Crisis Group, an independent advisory and analysis organization. An incumbent president and about 40 challengers, including two women, are on the ballot, vying for the votes of what the election commission says are an estimated 17 million registered Afghans against a backdrop of war, graft, poverty and illiteracy. More than 3,000 donkeys, 3,000 cars and three helicopters will traverse harsh terrain to carry voting materials to remote polling stations, the election commission says. And 30 observer groups, domestic and international, will be on hand to help guard against fraud, it says. At the heart of every vote will be the two biggest impediments to progress in one of the poorest nations in the world: stifling corruption and an increasingly bloody Taliban insurgency. International donors are helping pay for the $223 million electoral undertaking, and hundreds of U.S. Marines and Afghan soldiers have moved into strife-torn southern Afghanistan to protect voters against possible Taliban attacks. The top U.S. envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, expressed optimism that Thursday's vote would be Afghanistan's moment to shine. It's tough to organize elections during a war, he said, but the reality is that violence during elections is commonplace in many parts of the world. ""Afghanistan has never had a contested election,"" Holbrooke said. ""So this is a remarkable experiment in democracy and something that Afghanistan needs to give legitimacy to the new government."" That legitimacy has become a key issue in the campaign. Frontrunner President Hamid Karzai's chief challengers -- former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani and former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah -- have both lashed out at the incumbent for failing to rein in corruption. In its annual global corruption perception index in 2008, Transparency International ranked Afghanistan 176 out of 180 countries and said graft is ""a major factor impeding the country's stability and future growth."" Ghani said the most significant challenge Afghanistan's next president will face is earning back the trust of the people. ""This government has lost it,"" he said in a recent interview. ""There is no sense of trust, not only in the current leadership but in the political class as such. And in the capacity of the state or the international community to improve the lot of our people."" Ghani characterized Karzai as a ""very poor manager"" who failed to deal with pressing issues and create any sense of momentum for the nation moving forward. As a guest on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" this month, Ghani said Afghanistan's corruption had metastasized into a cancer that was ""eating through the society."" Abdullah argued that people's dissatisfaction with the Karzai government has helped strengthen the insurgency. ""There is no doubt there is a hard-core element in it,"" he said. ""But there are thousands of people under the same brand, Taliban, [who] have joined the insurgency because of other reasons."" The insurgents are filling a vacuum left by Afghanistan's Western-backed government, which foreign diplomats and military commanders concede suffers from nepotism, corruption and predatory practices. During a recent political debate, Karzai admitted that corruption was a problem but offered no specific cures. He also has been blamed for what has become the bloodiest summer since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Most polls, however, show Karzai with a commanding lead. Latifa, a Kabul housewife, said she was pleased with Karzai's stewardship and would vote for him. ""Like raising a child for seven years, in seven years he has helped our Kabul, our Afghanistan, stand on its own two feet,"" she said. ""We didn't know an election before; we hadn't seen a parliament."" But can a nation as troubled as Afghanistan carry out fair and free elections? Some observers of Afghanistan and human rights activists have voiced their doubts. Kai Eide, the United Nations special representative in Afghanistan, said Thursday's election will be the most difficult he has encountered in his life. Besides the violence and corruption, a weak infrastructure and a high illiteracy rate will add to election woes, he said. The problems were reflected in a new Gallup Poll that found fewer than one in four voting-age Afghans are confident the election will be fair and transparent. Voting in Afghanistan, Eide said, is not yet the kind of democratic expression understood in the West. ""If you look at the well-established democracies in the West, for instance, that's not possible under these circumstances,"" he said. ""But what my objective is that we have credible, inclusive elections where the result will be accepted by the people. That is our level of ambition, and I think we will achieve that."" Eide said that a significant number of polling stations in Helmand, Kandahar, Ghazni and Wardak provinces will not be able to open for security reasons. He said ballots ought to be counted at the polling center itself instead of transporting them elsewhere and increasing the possibility of fraud, encountered in the last election in 2004. Of the 4.6 million new registered voters, 39 percent are women. So thousands of women had to be employed to search burqa-clad female voters at polling places. Human Rights Watch, however, said this week that the recruitment drive for women began too late and as a result, not enough women will be available for security checks. ""Women voters have been badly let down by their government and its international backers,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch. Women's votes will be closely watched in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime stripped women of equal rights and education, essentially hurtling them back to the Stone Age. But despite the violence, despite the threats from the Taliban to disrupt the voting, enthusiasm filled the air this week. A campaign rally resembled more a rock concert than a political event in Afghanistan, as Kabul stadium transformed into a sea of blue, Abdullah's campaign color. Supporters hoisted banners and sported T-shirts emblazoned with Abdullah's face. Not old enough to vote, another young woman named Ferishta -- this one 15 years old and a beauty school student -- attended a rally for Ghani with many of her classmates. ""We want a president who is peaceful and caring,"" she said. ""We don't want any more bombs. In these bombs, so many Afghans have died, one person's son, one person's child."" But no one can predict whether abounding energy will translate into high turnout. Not in a war-ravaged nation. Not when bombs were still exploding just hours before balloting was to begin.

"(CNN) -- Elvis Presley. Marilyn Monroe. Jim Morrison. Officials won't say  where Michael Jackson was buried, but family gathered at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Their graves are public shrines for fans and followers. Countless people from all over the world make pilgrimages to their burial sites, hoping to draw close to those they adored from afar. Now Michael Jackson's gravesite will become the next holy grail. A private gathering for the pop icon was held Tuesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California. Afterward, his casket was taken to the public memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. But it remains unclear whether his body has been interred -- or where. Officials at Forest Lawn won't disclose where Jackson's body is being buried. If his final resting place is at Forest Lawn, fans who wish to visit will have to overcome the funeral company's stringent security patrols. A Los Angeles Police Department official told CNN that the force hoped Jackson would be buried outside of its jurisdiction for fear officers might be assigned to protect the grave for months. There has been some speculation that Jackson's body will eventually be moved to Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California. But that would require the family to obtain zoning exemptions and settle legal disputes, which could take years. Jackson retained only a small share of ownership in the ranch. If a public memorial were created at Neverland -- or anywhere -- it might easily surpass the tombs of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley as the most-visited gravesite. ""If it gets moved somewhere more public, I think a lot of people will come visit,"" said Steve Goldstein, author of L.A.'s Gravesite Companion: Where the VIP's RIP. ""He'll probably take over as the most visited grave site over Marilyn."" Fame follows celebrities in life and in death. ""There's always a fascination with celebrities, but it's rude to stalk people and sit outside their houses,"" says Jim Tipton, founder of findagrave.com, a site that lists the grave records of more than 34 million celebrities and ordinary citizens. ""But once they are interred into the ground, anyone who wants to go can go."" Tipton's fascination with locating earthly remains began 15 years ago, when he saw mobster Al Capone's grave in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois. He and many others who are avid about visiting celebrity and historical graves dub themselves ""grave hunters."" They seek the dead for various reasons. Some go out of simple curiosity. Others are history lovers. Many are fans who deeply admired the stars. Some say they feel a connection to the celebrities by standing beside their graves. At Elvis Presley's Graceland in Memphis, Tennessee, guests visiting the grave can stay at the retro Heartbreak Hotel and visit the museum to learn more about the King of Rock and Roll. Westwood Memorial Park and Cemetery in Los Angeles houses Hollywood notables including sex symbol Marilyn Monroe and comic Rodney Dangerfield.  The most recent celebrity to be buried there is actress Farrah Fawcett, who died of cancer last month. Visitors can access the cemetery easily, and even tour buses drop by. ""I'm a product of that era, of Charlie's Angels,"" said Jayne Osborne, a self-proclaimed grave hunter who visited Fawcett's grave a week ago. The 48-year-old education administrator began searching for celebrity graves in the early 1970s. Since then, she's visited hundreds of celebrity resting places in Southern California. ""I wanted to pay my respect."" At Westwood, the most popular grave site remains Monroe's. Fans often decorate her grave with flowers and cards. Her headstone is slightly darker than the others from so many fans touching it, grave hunters say. In Père-Lachaise, the largest cemetery in Paris, France, American singer Jim Morrison's grave is tattooed with graffiti and artwork. Morrison fans like to leave candles, poems and gifts as tokens of appreciation. At one point, fans were so rowdy that a stone block was put in place in an attempt to seal the grave from fans trying to unearth it. After unsuccessful attempts by French authorities to move the tomb to another site, security officers were placed at the grave. Similar trouble plagued Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia, where members of the Allman Brothers Band were buried in the early 1970s. Thousands of fans journeyed to visit the graves and party there, leaving behind cigarette butts and empty alcohol bottles. Relatives fought to have an iron fence erected around the graves. Some celebrity graves prove tempting to visitors, like that of heartthrob actor James Dean. His headstone in a public cemetery in Fairmount, Indiana, has been stolen twice. Forest Lawn Memorial Park remains one of the most exclusive Hollywood burial sites. The staff is tight lipped, refusing to release the whereabouts of anyone buried there, except to family members. Security cars constantly patrol the grounds. ""We don't advocate or promote any visitation out of respect for the privacy of the family,"" said William Martin, a spokesman for company. Company officials wouldn't say whether Jackson's body was, or could be, tucked into one of the cemetery's locked gardens where celebrities like Humphrey Bogart, Jean Harlow and Sammy Davis Jr. are laid to rest. If Jackson is buried in Forest Lawn, that won't stop fans and grave hunters from trying to sneak in, says Karen Fogarty, a paralegal from the San Fernando Valley area in California and an occasional celebrity grave hunter. ""It's going to keep Forest Lawn on their toes,"" she said.","Celebrities' graves become public shrines for fans and followers .

"BUNNELL, Florida (CNN)  -- Faith Coleman had no health insurance when she learned she had cancer, but she describes her battle with the illness as ""one of the absolute greatest blessings"" of her life. Faith Coleman's ordeal as an uninsured cancer patient drove  her to help others without health insurance. ""Having kidney cancer was one of the best things that ever happened to me ... because I can truly empathize with patients,"" said Coleman, 54. That compassion inspired Coleman to open a free clinic in her Florida community to help other uninsured people in need of medical care. In July 2003, Coleman, a nurse practitioner, learned she had a malignant tumor growing on her right kidney. But as a contract worker for several doctors, she did not receive health insurance. Coleman's treatment totaled about $35,000, and she was forced to take out a mortgage on her house to help pay for it. ""I [fell] through the crack ... and I [had] a great job and a good education,"" said Coleman, a mother of six. Realizing that her financial and health woes were not unique, Coleman -- now in remission -- became determined to help those in similar situations access medical treatment. ""I have been given another chance, and I felt that it was important for me to make a difference and to help other people,"" she said. So after her recovery in 2004, Coleman approached Dr. John Canakaris. The local physician with 60 years of experience had been treating the indigent population for years. Canakaris was eager to reach more patients in need. The two worked together to establish the Flagler County Free Clinic in Bunnell, Florida, which provides medical care for the uninsured. It has treated more than 6,700 patients. The clinic opened its doors in February 2005, with eight volunteers treating eight patients. Since then, it has expanded to 120 volunteers who see about 80 patients every other weekend. Coleman said she's seen an increase in the number of patients at the clinic, which serves people who meet federal poverty guidelines. ""If you see 100 cars in the parking lot, that's us!"" Coleman said, describing how she tells people the way to find the clinic. ""We have what I call 'controlled chaos.' It's just busy, busy, busy, go, go, go.""  Watch the ""controlled chaos"" at the clinic » . Health insurance: 'Nebulous, fairy-like thing' Flagler County has a 15.5 percent unemployment rate -- the highest in Florida -- according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Living without medical insurance often is the only way for some local struggling families to make ends meet, Coleman said. ""When your health insurance [premium] is the same or more than your mortgage payment on your home, which one do you think they're going to choose?"" Coleman asked. ""They have to live. They have to eat. Insurance becomes the nebulous fairy-like thing that's flying around out here. It would be nice to have because it's silver and shiny and pretty, but it's too expensive to hold on to. So it has to go,"" she said. The clinic, which operates out of a building donated by Canakaris and other doctors for use on the weekends, is not affiliated with any hospitals, Coleman said. The local Rotary Club, churches and private contributions help fund the operation. In addition, physicians volunteer to see patients recommended by the clinic, and an imaging center donates two X-rays and two CAT scans per month. Coleman says she and her team generally treat common illnesses like diabetes, hypertension and other chronic diseases, but adds ""we've also found a lot of cancers."" Many diagnoses have led to life-saving treatments.  Watch Coleman interact with patients at her clinic » . ""I had this lump growing in my throat on the right side and it just kept getting bigger and bigger, and I didn't have any insurance,"" said Franklin Dias, a cancer survivor. ""Ms. Coleman called in one of her buddies who said this is an emergency ... [then] I was in the hospital."" Today, Dias is cancer-free. And to show his appreciation of the clinic, he bakes. ""I paid them in banana bread, zucchini bread, pumpkin bread,"" Dias said. Emilio Viera, a Cuban immigrant, also credits Coleman with saving his life. ""She was perfect, she was precise, she was accurate,"" said Viera. ""I'll be very grateful all my life to Ms. Coleman. She's 'Faith,' and when you have five minutes with her she makes you have faith."" Want to get involved?

"WASHINGTON (CNN)   -- The Department of Homeland Security will investigate a Halloween costume party hosted by a top immigration official and attended by a man dressed in a striped prison outfit, dreadlocks and darkened skin make-up, a costume some say is offensive, the department's secretary said. Julie Myers, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, called the man's costume ""offensive."" Julie Myers, head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and host of the fundraising party, was on a three-judge panel that originally praised the prisoner costume for ""originality."" Myers later apologized for ""a few of the costumes,"" calling them ""inappropriate and offensive."" She said she and other senior managers ""deeply regret that this happened."" A department photographer photographed Myers with the man, but the images were deleted after the costume were deemed offensive, ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. Between 50 and 75 people attended the party, which was a fundraiser for the Combined Federal Campaign, a federal government collection of charities. Nantel said one employee, whom she declined to identify, was wearing a black-and-white striped prison outfit, dreadlocks and a skin ""bronzer"" intended ""to make him look African-American."" But, she said, it was not immediately apparent that he was wearing the make-up. ""Most people in the room didn't realize he was wearing make-up at all,"" she said. ""It was unintentioned. The employee did not mean to offend although there were some employees that were rightfully offended by it,"" Nantel said. Myers and the other judges ""noted his costume for originality."" ""There were a couple of people who were offended,"" Nantel said. ""When it was confirmed through a conversation with the employee that he was wearing make-up,"" Nantel said, the employee was counseled and Myers sent out a note to employees apologizing. In a November 2 email to ICE employees, Myers wrote, ""It is now clear that, however unintended, a few of the costumes were inappropriate and offensive. While we were all thrilled to be a part of the CFC fundraising effort, I and the senior management at ICE deeply regret that this happened."" She reminded all employees to be compliant with the department's diversity training requirement. Myers has served as head of ICE since January of 2006 but is still awaiting Senate confirmation. An ICE congressional liaison said ICE officials briefed congressional staffers about the costume party this week as a courtesy. But at least one congressional staffer said they approached ICE after receiving an anonymous fax about the incident. Myers called House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, about the incident and is expected to meet with him before the end of the week, a Thompson spokeswoman told CNN. Myers also contacted the National Association of African-Americans in the Department of Homeland Security. In a letter to NAADHS members, the group's vice president, Sjon Shavers, said the group ""appreciates (Myers) reaching out to us so quickly in order to keep us apprised of the matter and we commend her on moving so swiftly toward appropriate corrective action."" As head of ICE, Myers heads the law enforcement agency charged with enforcing immigration law inside the United States. It is the second largest investigative agency in the federal government, with more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 investigators. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff ""supports the actions that Assistant Secretary Myers has taken,"" DHS spokeswoman Laura Keehner said. ""We do not tolerate inappropriate behavior at DHS."" ""The Secretary has asked for an inquiry into the facts surrounding the incident. Once the facts have been determined, we will take all necessary and appropriate actions,"" Keehner said.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Charging chesty women more for their bras doesn't win a lot of support, British retailer Marks & Spencer acknowledged Friday as it announced an end to the surcharge on its larger lingerie. Marks & Spencer have apologised for charging chesty women more for bras. ""We boobed,"" screamed a full-page Marks & Spencer ad, which appeared in British newspapers Friday. Marks & Spencer gave in to campaigners who argued that the higher prices of the bigger bras was unfair. The retailer charged as much as £2 ($3) more for all sizes DD and up. ""It's true that our fantastic quality larger bras cost more money to make, and we felt it was right to reflect this in the prices we charged,"" the ad said. ""Well, we were wrong."" It follows a nearly year-long campaign by members of the Facebook group Busts 4 Justice. The women behind the site argued other chain retailers didn't charge extra for bigger sizes, so Marks & Spencer shouldn't, either. And it pointed out that the store doesn't charge extra for larger sizes of clothing, so it shouldn't charge more for larger undergarments. What's your view? ""We would like to thank everyone who has supported us on this issue; especially the thousands of brilliant, busty women that have joined forces with us. We couldn't have done this without you,"" the two administrators of the group, Becky Mount and Beckie Williams, posted Friday on Facebook. ""Busts 4 Justice remain committed to making things better for busty women on the high street, but for now we're happy just to be able to encourage all ladies to reward themselves and their boobs with some properly fitted, fairly priced lingerie.""

Its underwear department is the first stop for many British shoppers and is especially famous for reliable basics. And to give customers an added lift, Marks & Spencer also announced it is cutting the prices of all of its bras by 25 percent for the rest of May. ""I think even though we all obviously held a bit of a grudge against buying our bras from M&S we should really be grateful they got rid of the surcharge and have given us the super generous 25 percent off,"" Mount wrote on the group's site Friday.

"(CNN) -- -- A poor decision by a regional airline was being blamed Friday for Continental Airlines passengers getting stranded overnight as their plane sat on a tarmac in Minnesota, federal transportation officials said Friday. Passengers on a Continental flight operated by ExpressJet sat on the tarmac for nearly six hours on August 8. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said a representative of Mesaba Airlines improperly refused requests by the plane's captain and crew to let passengers off the plane. They were stuck on the tarmac in Rochester on August 8 from 12:38 a.m. to about 6 a.m. with nothing but pretzels to eat, LaHood said. ""There was a complete lack of common sense here,"" LaHood said in a written statement. ""It's no wonder the flying public is so angry and frustrated."" Mesaba, based in Eagan, Minnesota and owned by Delta Air Lines, was the only carrier able to assist Continental Flight 2816, which was on its way from Houston, Texas, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, when it was diverted because of strong thunderstorms, LaHood said.  Watch how pilot tried to get passengers off plane » . The flight's 47 passengers described crying babies, overflowing toilets and cramped conditions. According to a Department of Transportation preliminary report, Mesaba's representative refused to help passengers off of the plane, incorrectly saying the airport was closed to passengers for security reasons. In audiotapes released by the Transportation Department, the unnamed captain of the aircraft can be heard pleading with an airline dispatcher to find a way to get the passengers off the plane. ""We're stuck here with no lavs, no nothing -- no food,"" he says. ""And they won't let them get off because the terminal is closed."" Later, the dispatcher tells the captain that he has spoken to the commuter airline's representative and that ""she says there is nothing she can do to help us out. She's not going to let them off the plane."" ""That's ridiculous,"" the captain responds. LaHood, who called the incident a ""nightmare,"" said federal regulations allow passengers to get off of a plane, enter an airport and reboard without being screened by safety personnel as long as they remain in a secure part of the terminal. Mesaba said Friday that its employees tried to help. ""Mesaba respectfully disagrees with the DOT's preliminary findings as they are incongruent with our initial internal review of the incident,"" CEO John Spanjers said in a written statement. ""Because Continental Express Flight 2816 diverted to an airport where they have no ground handling service, Mesaba offered assistance as a courtesy during this delay. ""While the investigation is ongoing, Mesaba is fully cooperating with the Department of Transportation and looks forward to the final report."" Mesaba is a wholly owned subsidiary of Northwest Airlines, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines. Delta CEO Richard Anderson said the airline is working with Mesaba, Continental and the Department of Transportation to help determine exactly what happened. In the department's statement, LaHood said that the Continental crew was not at fault for the passengers being stuck. ""In fact, the flight crew repeatedly tried to get permission to deplane the passengers at the airport or obtain a bus for them,"" he said. Department of Transportation investigators have interviewed passengers, the flight crew, airport workers and others during an investigation expected to be completed in the next few weeks. The department ""is considering the appropriate action to take against Mesaba,"" according to the statement. The investigation did show that while the crew of the flight, operated by carrier ExpressJet, did all it could, higher-level officials should have become involved in the effort. The Aviation Enforcement Office has proposed regulations requiring airlines to have plans for how to handle lengthy tarmac delays.","Continental passengers were stuck on airplane nearly six hours .

"HERMOSILLO, Mexico (CNN)  -- Parents in northern Mexico on Sunday began to bury the children who died in a horrific day care fire as Mexican authorities raised the death toll from the blaze to 41. Maria Jesus Coronado Padilla mourns her 2-year-old daughter, Paulette Daniela Coronado Padilla on Sunday. A large crowd of mourners attended a funeral for six of the victims Sunday afternoon in Hermosillo, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the U.S. border. The cause of Friday's fire at ABC Day Care wasn't known, but investigators concluded that the fire didn't start inside the building, said Eduardo Bours, the governor of Sonora state. Neighbors described parents arriving at the day care center completely desperate on Friday, seeing it engulfed in flames and knowing there was no way to get the children out. The building had two doors, one of which was padlocked shut, and windows were too high for the children to reach, officials said. Some parents rammed their vehicles into the building to try to free the trapped children, witnesses told CNN.  Watch parents gather at site of fire » . ""When we went out and ran towards the nursery, teachers already had many children outside, those who could walk properly,"" said one man at the scene, who did not give his name. ""A pickup truck broke down the walls. The dad of one of the kids broke down one of the walls with his car driving in reverse, and that helped us a bit."" Others said they waited for hours for news of their children.  Watch a town in deep shock » . ""They didn't tell us anything, nothing, until like 6 p.m.,"" said Ofelia Vasquez, whose 4-year-old son Herman was in the building. She said she eventually was told he was at Chavez Hospital. ""We went there and we saw that he was badly burned, 75 percent of his body was burned,"" she said. Herman Vasquez died after surgery, his mother said. As of Sunday afternoon, 26 children remained hospitalized, 12 of them in critical condition, Sonoran authorities said. Another 10 children had been transported to other hospitals: eight to Guadalajara, one to Ciudad, Obregon, and two to Sacramento, California. A team of 29 medical experts in Hermosillo was deciding if any more victims would be moved to the Shriners Hospital for Children in Sacramento, or elsewhere. In addition, six adults were injured, Sonora spokesman Daniel Duran said. ""Without a doubt this is the worst disaster we've had,"" Bours told CNN. President Felipe Calderon traveled to Hermosillo on Saturday. He arrived with Interior Secretary Fernando Gomez Mont and Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova to get firsthand updates from doctors and investigators, the state news agency Notimex reported. Calderon ordered the nation's attorney general to investigate the blaze. Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation and not burns, Bours said. But the fire was serious enough for the roof to collapse, he added. At the time of the blaze, 142 children were inside the ABC Day Care. The day care is for children ages 2 to 4, but Bours confirmed that children even younger were among the victims. All the children at the center had been accounted for by Saturday evening, Bours said. A severely burned 3-year-old girl arrived Saturday at the Sacramento hospital -- where pediatric burn treatment is a specialty -- and was in critical condition, according to Dr. Tina Palmieri, assistant chief of the burn unit. The child was burned over 80 percent of her body, the doctor told reporters. She said the hospital normally can save just over half of the children with burns that severe. In Hermosillo, a large crowd gathered outside of the emergency entrance of the city's general hospital and many people consoled each other, video from the scene showed.

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- Automated messages sent from Air France Flight 447 just before it crashed Monday indicate the plane's systems were providing contradictory information about its airspeed, the jet's manufacturer said on Friday. Friends and relatives of the 228 people aboard Air France Flight 447 attend a memorial service Thursday in Brazil. That suggests the pilots may have been flying too fast or too slow through the violent weather they encountered before the crash, officials said. In addition, investigators have said the plane's autopilot disengaged, cabin pressure was lost and there was an electrical failure before the disaster. Airbus confirmed on Friday that in the wake of the crash it sent a Telex to operators of all Airbus models reminding them what to do when speed indicators give conflicting readings. The spokesman said the notice does not mean there is any major flaw in the aircraft, but is simply a reminder to pilots about what to do in the cockpit if they get conflicting information about air speed. Message transmissions from the aircraft in the final moments before it crashed Monday into the Atlantic Ocean show there was an ""indicated inconsistency in measured air speeds,"" Airbus said. The company did not elaborate. Experts said that could mean the pilot's and co-pilots' sensors were showing different speeds. ""If they're malfunctioning, it can give a false read that can be misinterpreted in the cockpit, and a disaster can follow,"" said Peter Goeltz, the former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. While the pilots themselves sent no distress calls, the aircraft's computer system relayed about four minutes of automated messages indicating a loss of cabin pressure and an electrical failure, according to investigators. Airbus said it sent the Telex Thursday night after the action was recommended by the French investigating agency, which plans to hold a news conference Saturday morning in Paris, France.  Watch as experts question whether recovery is possible » . Meanwhile, the hunt for debris continued Friday, a day after a Brazilian air force official said debris plucked from the ocean was not from the Air France jet. A U.S Navy P-3 temporarily based in Brazil has flown three missions -- on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday -- in assisting the Brazilian government search for debris, but found nothing connected to the disaster, U.S. Southern Command spokesman Maj. Darryl Wright said. Earlier Friday, Goeltz said the search for Flight 447's voice and data recorders is becoming more difficult as ocean currents disperse debris from the crash site. ""The clock's ticking"" in the search for the plane's recorders, he said. ""The batteries on these locator devices attached to the black boxes have a limited life span -- just 30 days,"" he said. ""The longer time goes on, the further away from the actual crash site the debris floats."" All 228 passengers and crew aboard the Airbus 330 are presumed to have died when the plane disappeared northeast of the Fernando de Noronha Islands, an archipelago 355 kilometers (220 miles) off the northeast coast of Brazil. The flight originated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and was en route to Paris.  Map of Flight 447's flight path » . While the ocean depth in the area where the plane is thought to have crashed presents a challenge, the challenge may not be insurmountable, Goeltz said. ""We've recovered boxes as deep as 6- or 7,000 feet,"" he said. ""We've recovered debris from as much as 10,000 feet."" Authorities have said the depth of the water in the area ranges from 3,000 meters (9,840 feet) to 7,500 meters (24,600 feet). Cmdr. Christophe Prazuck of the French Ministry of Defense said Friday that a French research vessel was expected to arrive this weekend in the search area carrying a deep-diving submersible. The submersible would try to pinpoint the recorders, but must rely on another vessel to retrieve them, he said. The submarine helped recover artifacts from the Titanic disaster. Meanwhile, France's transportation minister warned that ""extreme prudence"" should be used in releasing information about why the plane crashed. It is possible the plane experienced a total electrical failure, officials have said. Goeltz said it is possible the jet's speed indicator was faulty. ""That could really be disastrous and it's happened before,"" he said, speaking generally. If it malfunctions, ""it can give a false read into the cockpit that can be misinterpreted,"" he said. Investigators also said the autopilot system may have failed. A Spanish pilot reported seeing an ""intense flash"" near where the plane is believed to have crashed, the Spanish carrier Air Comet said on Thursday. The co-pilot and a passenger on the flight from Lima, Peru, to Lisbon, Portugal, also said they saw a light. Air Comet said the pilot's report has been sent to Air France, Airbus and the Spanish civil aviation authority.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Some lucky Michael Jackson fans got the e-mails they were hoping for Sunday, saying they've won two free tickets to Tuesday's memorial service. Some memorial tickets went out to ""friends and family"" on Sunday. ""OMG OMG OMG OMG i got tickets to the michael jackson memorial service!!!"" Deka Motanya wrote Sunday afternoon in a Twitter message. The 8,750 fans chosen were summoned to Dodger Stadium Monday to pick up their tickets and have a wristband placed on their arms to prevent them from reselling them. The Michael Jackson memorial, set for 10 a.m. (1 p.m. ET) Tuesday in the Staples Center arena, is expected to be a star-studded and emotional tribute to the entertainer, who died June 25.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Vietnam veteran and Bronze Star recipient who volunteered to return to the Army and serve in Afghanistan became the oldest U.S. service member to die in combat there, the U.S. military announced Friday. First Sgt. Jose San Nicolas Crisostomo was killed by a roadside bomb in Kabul on Tuesday while riding in an armored Humvee. His body was flown to the United States early Thursday morning. Crisostomo of Spanaway, Washington, was 59. He would have turned 60 later this month, according to KING television in Seattle, Washington. He was one of a very few service members who served in Vietnam and in current U.S. military operations, his record shows. He twice received the Bronze Star, which is awarded to U.S. troops for combat valor. Crisostomo also received the Purple Heart for being wounded in combat, according to his records. It was not clear from his official records if he received the medals for combat in Vietnam or Afghanistan. His records also indicate he received numerous other commendations. He also served during the first Gulf War in 1991 and received the Kuwait Liberation Medal. He jointed the Army in 1969 and retired in 1993, then volunteered to serve again in 2008. According to his records, his position in the Army was automated logistical specialist, but it was unclear in what capacity he was serving while in Afghanistan. Earlier this year, a 60-year-old soldier was killed in Iraq, becoming the oldest U.S. service member killed in either the war in Iraq or the war in Afghanistan.","First Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Some of the strongest support for health care cooperatives' place in the national effort to reform the nation's health care system comes from those who experience a co-op's care every day: doctors and patients. Co-op patient Norman Nistler says he didn't even realize he was a part of a health care co-op. Co-ops are non-profit organizations, so any money that is earned goes back to be used on patients and other costs. Patients also elect a governing board, which is in stark contrast to operations under private health insurance plan. Proponents point to two co-ops as evidence they are an alternative in the health care reform debate: HealthPartners in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, Washington. HealthPartners has been in business for half a century and served more than a million people in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Some decades-long members said they didn't know they were with a co-op. ""I watch a lot of it on television now. There's a lot of talking about co-ops, but I didn't realize this was a co-op,"" said patient Norman Nistler. The co-op was able to save millions, officials note, by switching to generic drugs and cutting tobacco use among its members by double the Minnesota state average because doctors help patients to quit. Darla Andrews, a patient at the co-op, said she and her doctor have easy access to her records. ""It's all digital, so it works out good for me. It's more convenient."" Dr. Eric Seaver, who works at Group Health. ""We can communicate with patients through secure e-mail for routine questions or concerns that in the private world physicians often aren't able or won't do because there's just no motivation to do that. There's no reimbursement. ... Here with Group Health's model, it's all about providing patients the care that they need when they need it in a form that works best for them."" Group Health lists Microsoft and Starbucks as organizations that use its system. ""I have great contact with the doctors,"" said Group Health member Dave Jacobs. ""I'm treated like a person, not a number."" ""My care has been absolutely exceptional. And that's because I believe I'm going to a private medical facility, dealing with doctors one-on-one and not a bureaucrat,"" he said. ""Part of the great value in that structure is that our patients are actively engaged, not just in the organization and governance but actively engaged in finding ways to engage themselves in their care itself,"" said Scott Armstrong, president and CEO of Group Health Cooperative. ""We all know that an engaged patient leads to a better health outcome. So much of health care is actually the responsibility of us as individuals."" Aaron Katz, of the University of Washington Health Services, says the group health model could be viable nationally, but only if there are tougher restrictions on insurance companies. The reason co-ops are successful, he says, is because they employ their own doctors, specialists, pharmacies and can reduce the amount of tests and procedures that drive up costs. Seaver says his co-op emphasizes evidence-based medicine and making decisions in patient care based upon ""the best evidence that we have available for what's effective and what is ineffective."" ""I think what we're finding in this model is doing the right thing for the patient is the best thing not just for the patient but also for the system as a whole,"" he said. ""I feel like I'm able to practice medicine the way I had envisioned back in medical school."" Working at Group Health ""has been a breath of fresh air for my career,"" he said. CNN's Dana Bash, Ed Hornick, Lesa Jansen, Chris Welch and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","Co-ops are non-profit organizations where patients elect a governing board .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Described as ""an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane,"" Hurricane Bill was churning closer to the Atlantic island of Bermuda on Wednesday, forecasters said. Most forecast maps show Hurricane Bill passing to the west of Bermuda. Although Bill is not expected to make a direct hit on the island, forecasters cautioned that the storm is large and will generate large swells on Bermuda as well as the islands of the northeast Caribbean Sea over the next day or two. Swells may also affect the eastern United States on Friday and Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said. CNN meteorologists said Bill could cause cause dangerous rip tides and some coastal flooding in the northeast United States and could move very close to or make landfall in Newfoundland, Canada, early next week. In addition, Bill may strengthen further over the next couple of days, forecasters said. As of 5 p.m. ET, Bill's center was about 335 miles northeast of the Leeward Islands and about 970 miles south-southeast of Bermuda, the hurricane center said. ""It's a little too early to evaluate what kind of direct impact Bill may have,"" said Jack Bevin, a senior hurricane specialist. ""Most of the computer guidance has the storm passing between Bermuda and the U.S. coastline, then turning northeastward."" Other models show Bill turning more sharply out to sea and not affecting any areas, he said. Bill's maximum sustained winds were at 135 mph Wednesday afternoon. It was moving northwest at near 20 mph and was expected to continue that motion over the next day or so, turning north-northwest by late Friday. Five-day forecast maps show Bill passing to the west of Bermuda before turning to the northwest. ""Bill is a large tropical cyclone,"" the National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 85 miles from its center, with tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230 miles out. CNN Radio's Andrew Spencer and Lee Garen contributed to this report.","Storm is not expected to make a direct hit on Bermuda .

"Hamid Dabashi is the author of ""Iran: A People Interrupted."" He is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York. His Web site is http://www.hamiddabashi.com/. Hamid Dabashi says allegations of rape and torture are testing Iran's Islamic Republic as never before. (CNN) -- Troubling news of kidnapping, rape, torture, and murder is flooding out of Iran. Neda Aqa Soltan was murdered point-blank in the streets of Tehran for the whole world to see; while Sohrab Arabi was killed far from any global attention and his body given to his mother quietly to bury, as was the tortured body of Mohsen Ruholamini. These names have assumed symbolic significance for many more innocent young men and women murdered by the custodians of the Islamic Republic with a wanton disregard for the lives and liberties of its own citizens. Not just murder, but the rape of young men and women also is on the shameless roster of the Islamic Republic. After years of sporadic charges and troubling rumors, finally a courageous cleric has put a stamp of public recognition on atrocious practices in the theocratic state. Mehdi Karrubi -- one of the revolutionary founders of the Islamic Republic, a high-ranking cleric, a presidential candidate, a former speaker of the house and now a widely popular political activist -- has published a letter, addressing it to the former president and current head of the Expediency Council Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. He accuses the security officers of the Islamic Republic of repeatedly and violently raping young women and men while they are in custody. Since the publication of this letter, a massive outpouring of testimony and reports has come out, corroborating Karrubi's charges that rapes of young women and men are a widespread, common practice in the Islamic Republic. These are not light charges for any state, for any republic, let alone for an Islamic Republic. These charges are no longer brought by expatriate, and at times discredited, opposition. It is the founding fathers of the Islamic Republic, with impeccable revolutionary credentials, who are bringing these charges, as others are coming out and corroborating them in excruciating detail. The Islamic Republic has never faced such a deep crisis of legitimacy in its turbulent 30-year history. As widely evident, it is not just the regime's claim to a ""republic"" that is in question and in jeopardy, but, perhaps far more seriously, it is its claim to Islam that has troubling consequences for more than 1.3 billion Muslims around the world. People in the streets of Tehran are chanting, paraphrasing a famous slogan of the 1979 revolution, ""Independence, Freedom, Iranian Republic,"" pointedly replacing ""Iranian"" for ""Islamic."" Though this a perfectly legitimate demand, given the criminal record of the Islamic Republic, by no means is this sentiment a common denominator of the growing opposition to the regime. To the degree that, at least in part, he represents this uprising, Mir Hossein Moussavi, as a pious and practicing Muslim, continues to insist that he wishes to restore the ideals and aspirations of the Islamic revolution within the constitution of the state. Never have the two opposing ideas of an ""Islamic Republic,"" and Muslims living in a democratic republic seemed so at odds with each other. The 30-year experience of the Islamic Republic shows fundamental flaws in defining a state apparatus in the exclusive terms of a militantly legalistic Islam, while at the same time Iranians, the overwhelming majority of them Shiite Muslims, have repeatedly demonstrated, under this regime, they are perfectly capable of democratic behavior. Not just as immigrants in the E.U. nations and the U.S., but as citizens in Iran, millions of Muslims have shown they are integral to the democratic institutions embedded in the notion of a nation-state. What is in question is the viability of an Islamic republic -- or for that matter, a Jewish state, a Christian empire,  a Hindu fundamentalist government -- or any state or movement that is defined not by the democratic apparatus of citizenry, but by exclusionary membership in a world religion. As in the rest of the Muslim world, Islam is integral to Iranian society. But not exclusively so. Over the last 30 years, a radically legalistic interpretation of a cosmopolitan faith has been force-fed into a multifaceted political culture -- and today all the world can see the violent convulsion of the system. There has been much talk of the need for an Islamic ""reformation"" over the last few years. But what Islam needs is not a Christian-style Reformation. What Islam needs is a restoration of its historically cosmopolitan character in which Muslims and non-Muslims live in peace and prosperity, and which they now need to retrieve in order to live in peace and prosperity in a world that is not entirely Muslim. By virtue of living in a democracy, and having endured indignities of rampant Islamophobia in their own country, American Muslims have a historic role to play, by way of sending a delegation to Iran, connecting to this grassroots democratic movement in a Muslim nation, and helping it restore its cosmopolitan character in pursuit of enduring democratic institutions.

"Editor's note: Uwe Reinhardt is James Madison professor of political economy at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. From 1986 to 1995 he served as a commissioner on the Physician Payment Review Committee, established in 1986 by Congress to advise it on issues related to the payment of physicians. Uwe Reinhardt says health costs are rising at unsustainable pace, gobbling up middle-class incomes. (CNN) -- Watching the angry outbursts at town hall meetings on health reform and the continuing public ambivalence about current efforts to reform our health system almost makes me wish that the reform effort fails. Perhaps Americans need to be taught a basic lesson on the economics of employment-based health insurance before they will feel as smugly secure with it as they do now and before they will stop nitpicking health-reform efforts to death over this or that detail. And America's currently insured middle class will be increasingly desperate if health reform fails. Millions more such families will see their take-home pay shrink. Millions will lose their employment-based insurance, especially in medium and small-sized firms. And millions will find themselves inexorably priced out of health care as we know it. Milliman Inc., an employee benefits consulting firm, publishes annually its Milliman Medical Index on the total health spending by or for a typical American family of four with private health insurance. The index totals the family's out-of-pocket spending for health care plus the contribution employers and employees make to that family's job-related health insurance coverage. The Milliman Medical Index stood at $8,414 in 2001. It had risen to $16,700 by 2009. It is likely to rise to $18,000 by next year. That is more than a doubling of costs in the span of a decade! Since 2005, the index has grown at an average annual compound rate of 8.4 percent. Suppose we make it 8 percent for the coming decade. Then today's $16,700 will have grown to slightly over $36,000 by 2019. Economists are convinced that this $36,000 would come virtually all out of the financial hides of employees, even if the employer pretended to be paying, say, 80 percent of the employment-based health insurance premiums. In the succinct words of the late United Automobile Worker Union leader Douglas Fraser: . ""Before you start weeping for the auto companies and all they pay for medical insurance, let me tell you how the system works. All company bargainers worth their salt keep their eye on the total labor unit cost, and when they pay an admittedly horrendous amount for health care, that's money that can't be spent for higher [cash] wages or higher pensions or other fringe benefits. So we directly, the union and its members, feel the costs of the health care system."" (""A National Health Policy Debate,"" Dartmouth Medical School Alumni Magazine, Summer 1989: 30) Unfortunately, very few rank-and-file workers appreciate this fact. Aside from their still modest out-of-pocket payments and contributions to employment-based insurance premiums, most employees seem sincerely to believe that the bulk of their family's health care is basically paid for by ""the company,"" which is why so few members of the middle class have ever been much interested in controlling health spending in this country. The price for that indifference will be high. If efforts at better cost containment fail once again, and health care costs rise to $36,000 on average for a typical American family of four under age 65 -- as almost surely it would -- that $36,000 will be borne entirely by the family. That family's disposable income would be much higher if the growth of future health spending was better controlled. And, as noted, many smaller firms will stop altogether providing job-based health insurance. It would be a major problem for families with an income of less than $100,000 a year. In 2007, only about 25 percent of American families had a money income of $100,000 or more. Close to 60 percent had family incomes of less than $75,000. Here it must be remembered that the wages and salaries of the solid American middle class have been relatively stagnant in recent years and are likely to remain so for the next decade. Unemployment is not likely to fall significantly soon, regardless of what stock prices do on Wall Street. Indeed, often stock prices rise as firms lay off workers to drive up profits through leaner payrolls. This prospect -- relatively stagnant family incomes combined with family health-care costs that double every decade -- is what America's middle class should contemplate as it thinks about the imperative of health reform. It is a pity that this central issue seems to have been shoved aside by mendacious distortions from Sarah Palin, Betsy McCaughey, Rush Limbaugh and other extremist commentators seeking to frighten Americans with their prattle about ""death panels"" and ""pulling plugs on granny"" that no bill before Congress even remotely envisions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Uwe Reinhardt.","Uwe Reinhardt: Consider what will happen if health reform fails .

"(CNN) -- One person died and six were injured when a cargo train derailed, causing an explosion and massive fire in Illinois, a fire chief said Saturday. A train carrying chemicals derailed and burned for hours, forcing the evacuation of about 600 homes . Crews were still fighting the blaze at midday, but expected to have it fully contained in the afternoon, said Rockford Fire Chief Derek Bergsten. ""It's under control and we're taking every precaution not to harm firefighters or residents,"" Bergsten said, adding that federal and state environmental officials were on scene monitoring air and soil samples. The fatality was a woman, said Winnebago County Coroner Sue Fiduccia. The cause of death had not been determined because Fiduccia was unable to get close enough to examine the body. Bergsten said six people were injured, and all train workers were accounted for. The train was carrying chemicals that burned for hours, forcing the evacuation of about 600 homes in the town about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, authorities said. Officers were called to the scene near Rockford about 8:30 p.m. Friday, a city police spokeswoman said. The derailment involved automobiles, but it was unclear whether they were on the tracks, she said. Three motorists who were stopped at a train crossing were burned, one severely, Bergsten said. One of the victims, who tried to run from the blaze, suffered second-degree burns on his hand while trying to shield his neck from flames, according to Bergsten. At least 14 cars of the 114-car train caught fire after the derailment, officials said. The rest of the Canadian National Railway train -- including 70 cars carrying ethanol, a colorless, highly flammable liquid -- was disconnected and moved away from the blaze, Bergsten said. CNN's Greg Morrison and Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.","NEW: Woman dead after train derails, erupts into flames in Rockford, Illinois .

"(CNN) -- They were taken before Marilyn Monroe became branded as the voluptuous blonde who oozed sex appeal in dozens of Hollywood films. A 24-year-old Marilyn Monroe poses for Life magazine in August 1950. They were taken before rumors of an affair with President John F. Kennedy swirled and her mental breakdowns became public. They were taken before the beautiful actress's mysterious overdose that resulted in her death at the age of 36. In a collection discovered by Life.com last month, unpublished photographs of Monroe reveal a softer, more innocent 24-year-old budding starlet in a more peaceful time, before her fame peaked. Her flawless face bears a natural look with minimal makeup, unusual for the star, who was often glamorized in photo shoots with lipstick, designer dresses and expensive jewelry. Monday would have been Monroe's 83rd birthday. In one photo, the young Monroe lies in bliss, reading on a park bench, which editors at Life.com believe was shot at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. In another, her face is serene as she is perched over a bridge barefoot. The shoot, which dates to 1950, was conducted by Life photographer Ed Clark. It's a side of Monroe that the American public has rarely seen. ""She hasn't really exploded as a star, yet she was on the brink of something big,"" says Dawnie Walton, deputy editor at Life.com, a Web site harboring more than 7 million Life magazine photographs. The site was launched in March. ""I was amazed looking at her face. Although she looks very innocent, there is something very ... sexy."" Last month, Walton stumbled upon the rare photographs while combing through the company's digital photo archives. Apparently, no one at Life.com even knew they were ever taken. Upon investigating the photos, Walton says, she found there were few notes left on the negatives. She says the photos were probably taken for a cover shoot that was never used. Monroe appeared on her first Life magazine cover in 1952.  See some of the previously unpublished photos of Monroe » . ""It just got lost and stowed away,"" Walton said. ""It was just ... somewhere in a warehouse in New Jersey."" At the time the photos were shot, Monroe had her first small breakout role as a mistress in ""The Asphalt Jungle."" The star was better known as a model at the time, though she'd had a handful of cameos in films. Photographer Ed Clark told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune a friend from 20th Century Fox alerted him that the studio had just signed ""a hot tomato."" ""She was unknown then, so I was able to spend a lot of time shooting her,"" Clark said. ""We'd go out to Griffith Park and she'd read poetry. I sent several rolls to Life in New York, but they wired back, 'Who the hell is Marilyn Monroe?' "" Photographs later in the 1950s and early 1960s would display a much more confident and sexual Monroe -- images that would become iconic in popular culture. There is the famous photograph of a busty Monroe in a white halter dress, standing with her skirt blowing up in 1955 for her role in ""The Seven Year Itch."" In 1962, American photographer Bert Stern shot a tipsy, sometimes nude Monroe in a series of delicate shots that would be known as ""The Last Sitting."" Monroe died about six weeks later, on August 5, 1962. Life.com staff members say there are 15 million photographs in the Life archive dating back to the late 1850s, even before Life officially began publishing in 1936. Two years ago, the publication began slowly transferring the photographs into a digital archive. From time to time, unpublished photographs will be found that the company doesn't know existed. Other times, the photographs may have been taken but never selected to be used for publication. Last March, to commemorate the 11th anniversary of Frank Sinatra's death, Life.com released a series of unpublished photographs of the singer. In April, Life.com released newly recovered, never-before-seen photographs of Martin Luther King Jr. taken by a Life photographer on the day King was assassinated at a Memphis, Tennessee, hotel in 1968.","Unpublished photos of Monroe shot by a Life photographer surfaced in May .

"(CNN) -- If an e-mail popped up in your inbox promising a house for $100, you'd expect to see it sent from a guy in Nigeria asking you to wire him several thousand dollars first. Zeb Smith lies on his front lawn and spends a quiet afternoon with his neighbors. But this depressed housing market dream is real. And Detroit, Michigan, artist Jon Brumit and his wife, Sarah, are living it. The couple never counted on owning a home. ""It's not that we have a little money,"" Jon Brumit said, laughing. ""I'm saying we have no money."" But the couple began entertaining the idea of a permanent nest when their friends Mitch Cope and Gina Reichert, also artists, started taking advantage of foreclosures in the city, where the average home price dipped to $11,533 in April, according to the Detroit Association of Realtors. Dragging down the average are homes that are long abandoned or foreclosed on that are selling for pennies on the dollar. Detroit already had the lowest market value houses in Michigan before the latest rounds of job losses at GM and other huge employers, market analysts say. ""Those artists are doing a good thing; they are at least helping to stabilize neighborhoods that would be all but lost,"" said Mike Shedlock, an investment adviser who blogs frequently about Detroit's economy. For less than a few thousand dollars, Cope and Reichert snapped up a dilapidated bungalow in a north Detroit neighborhood called ""BanglaTown,"" for its unexpected mix of Bangladeshis, African-Americans, Polish and Ukrainians and the occasional shady character. Scrappers had cleaned the house to the bone. The copper had been stolen; the electrical wiring was stripped. But no matter. Here was a chance for Cope and Reichert, who run a popular Detroit art store, to rehabilitate the 1920s brick house into a bastion of energy savings, with solar panels, LED lights, recycled wood and high-end insulated windows. They're installing a security system that exemplifies elegant efficiency with hurricane-proof windows and steel doors replacing burglar bars. They are also experimenting with running their air-conditioning on a car battery. The project became known as the Power House. Cope and Reichert wanted to create a central place to power homes nearby and, in turn, revive a neighborhood's sense of community. The trick was getting their friends not only to cheer the concept but invest in it by moving next door. ""It was much easier than we thought it might be,"" Cope said. ""We told everyone that Detroit is an interesting city to work in as an artist, and the neighborhood is diverse. But, really, it came down to money."" ""I kept telling Mitch, 'Wow those are an awesome, ridiculously good deals but if you find anything that's less, let me know,"" Brumit said. ""Like, if something comes along for next to nothing, cool."" A few weeks later, Cope e-mailed Brumit a photo of an abandoned home on his block. Its windows were boarded up and plywood was nailed across the front door. The huge hole in the roof was courtesy of the fire department. A neighbor said the house had been set on fire -- twice. Pricetag: $100. Brumit called a real estate agent with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, who confirmed that bids on the foreclosed property started at $95 for the property, $5 for the house. There were no back taxes -- no one seemed to be sure who once owned the house, it had been empty for so long, Brumit said. Cope, also a designer and builder, and an inspector did a walk-through. ""Inspection was fine and Mitch told me the foundation was good,"" Brumit said. ""He just said, 'If you didn't mind scraping some peeling paint, doing some surface treatments, putting in new utilities, windows and repairing the roof ... this could be pretty interesting.'"" Now, when he's not hauling loads of rubble away or knocking out walls to create a single, open studio space, Brumit's searching Craigslist for a furnace. In exchange for designing the business Web site of a local barn recycler, he's getting materials to turn that hole in his roof into a skylight. ""I saw it as a project,"" the artist said. ""I'm a builder. I've been building skateboards since I was 12."" Skateboards are one thing. Rebuilding homes where the plumbing has been ripped out or the cabinets destroyed in a fit by an upset foreclosed homeowner is another. Michigan housing authorities acknowledge that there's little incentive for people who aren't quite as handy as Brumit. In two weeks, the state will begin offering $25,000 to anyone who buys a home, as long as they pay 1 percent of the total cost and live in it.  Landlords or speculators aren't eligible. Part of a $263 million grant given to Michigan and other states under 2008's Housing and Economic Recovery Act, the funds are intended to help buyers bring trashed properties up to code, according to Mary Townley, a director with the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. She and other housing officials CNN spoke with said Michigan's economy has some extremely frustrating woes. A report from the nonprofit think tank Brookings Institution said Detroit had the lowest performing economy out of 100 U.S. cities it analyzed -- scoring the worst in unemployment and average wages, the highest foreclosure rates and the lowest market value homes. The artists in BanglaTown are careful to say they are not looking to change a city. Their goal is simply to improve a neighborhood, one house at a time. New neighbors, freelance photographer Corine Vermeulen-Smith and her husband Zeb Smith, a designer, are always checking out www.freecycle.com, where a stainless steel kitchen sink can be bought for $65. The Smiths bought their 660-square-foot home for $549.99 from Cope and Reichert, who originally purchased the foreclosed home for $500. ""We knew the property, we knew it had been sitting there empty for at least a year, and it had been trashed,"" Vermeulen-Smith said. ""But we wanted to own a home."" All the copper in their ""micro-home"" had been ripped out, as well as every electrical outlet, Vermeulen-Smith said. Trash had to be hauled out in several loads. ""You have to get over that fear that the house had that history, that you're going to be a victim of a crime or something,"" she said. ""Crime is everywhere. My husband and I have lived in the city for a long time; we know that people look out for each other here. We don't have that kind of fear."" Careful not to entice thieves again, the Smiths replaced the copper with plastic. They are considering taking the home completely off the grid by installing a mini-wind turbine, but for now they are happy to put in the basics. A bathtub from Habitat for Humanity cost them $100. And Zeb Smith, who works at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, brings home wood the museum would otherwise toss when installations close. ""This is, for us, very exciting to believe that we could totally reinvent a space,"" she said, ""and prove that having a home isn't about having money.""","Detroit artists buy a trashed, abandoned house for $100, fix it up .

"(CNN) -- Pop star Michael Jackson will avoid foreclosure on his Neverland Ranch property with a new loan, a Jackson insider told CNN Wednesday. Michael Jackson owes millions of dollars on his sprawling property in the Santa Ynez Valley in California. Documents show that Neverland Ranch in Los Olivos, California, is scheduled for a public auction on March 19 at Santa Barbara's downtown courthouse. But the Jackson source said that won't happen. ""Michael Jackson's ranch is not going to be auctioned off at the courthouse,"" the Jackson insider said. ""The financing is all being worked out."" ""There are plenty of lenders willing to work with him. The real estate market is very bad right now and Jackson is being affected just like many other Americans,"" the source said. The Santa Barbara County Recorder's Web site lists a ""notice of trustees sale"" by Jackson and his property lenders, Financial Title Company, filed Monday. In California, title companies typically represent lenders in foreclosure cases. A notice of trustees sale cannot be posted earlier than 90 days after a notice of default is filed. That notice is not filed unless a loan is in substantial default, sometimes six months or more past due. A real estate source inside Santa Barbara County said the trustees filing is only the first step in a long process that could drag on for months. The real estate source said other options are available to Jackson, including selling the ranch directly to another party or making a payment on his $24.5 million Neverland debt that would satisfy the trustee. The recorder's Web site also reveals there was a release of lien on Jackson on February 4, showing he paid off all or part of delinquent taxes to the state of California. ""It seems unlikely that someone would pay off back taxes, only to let the ranch go up for auction a few weeks later,"" said the real estate source. Jackson has not lived at Neverland since June 2005, after a Santa Barbara County jury found him not guilty of child molestation charges.

"(CNN) -- A bit of music history was lost Friday morning when flames gutted the Georgia Theatre in Athens, Georgia. The Georgia Theatre in Athens, Georgia, smolders after firefighters put out a morning blaze. The 19th-century building was a cornerstone in the alternative rock music scene that gave the world the B-52s, R.E.M. and the Indigo Girls, said Doc Eldridge, president of the local Chamber of Commerce. The theater, in downtown Athens near the University of Georgia campus, suffered heavy damage from the fire, which was discovered at 7 a.m., according to Athens-Clarke County government spokeswoman Sandy Turner. ""The facade is still there, but it's very bad,"" she said. ""From the big names to the no names, countless of musicians and groups have left their mark on the Athens music scene from the stage of the Georgia Theatre,"" Eldridge said. iReport: Photos of theater burning . Sheffy McArthur was a University of Georgia student when he and two friends converted the movie theater into a music venue in 1978. ""The B-52s paid us to play there, imagine that,"" McArthur said. Sea Level, a blues-jazz-rock group that grew from the remnants of the Allman Brothers Band, played the first show in the theater in January 1978, McArthur said. It became the place ""for alternative music, instead of cover-type stuff for real artists to play,"" he said. Wilmont Greene took over the theater five years ago and began renovations. R.E.M., which formed in Athens in 1980 and became one of the first popular alternative bands, played in the 600-seat theater in the group's early days. In recent years, the theater served as host for album release parties and benefit shows by R.E.M., which is based in a building just down the street. ""All of us here certainly wish Wilmont Greene and his staff the best of luck and Godspeed in their efforts to rebuild the Athens landmark,"" an R.E.M. statement said.","Georgia Theatre in Athens, Georgia, gutted by fire Friday morning .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- A U.S. Marine based on Okinawa has been arrested in connection with the reported rape of a 14-year-old Japanese girl, the island's police force said Monday. Police said the assault was reported Sunday night in the Chanton entertainment district on Okinawa, a major hub for U.S. forces in the Pacific. The 38-year-old American was arrested shortly after the report, police said. The Marine was not identified, and there was no immediate comment from the service on the allegation. Previous criminal cases against American troops have triggered widespread protests by Okinawans since 1995, when three American servicemen were found guilty of raping an Okinawan schoolgirl.

"(CNN) -- You pay for checking your baggage, for snacks and for extra legroom. Word is one airline has even toyed with charging you to use the toilet. So it makes perfect sense to some fliers that heavier passengers should pay for spilling over into the next seat. Earlier this year, United Airlines formalized a policy that charges some larger passengers for a second seat. Frequent flier Ross Murphy, 54, has been sandwiched between larger fliers in coach, and he believes they should have to shell out for a second seat. ""They have a right to sit in the seat next to me,"" said Murphy, who travels cross-country at least 15 times a year to watch his sons' sporting matches. ""But they don't have a right to sit in my lap."" A growing number of airlines are forcing bigger passengers to pay more as they cope with the costly and uncomfortable quandary that arises when obese passengers cannot squeeze into a single coach seat. With airlines trimming flight schedules -- meaning fuller passenger loads this summer -- the issue is bound to spur some awkward encounters. Chart: Compare some of the common airline fees . ""It's a growing problem, no pun intended,"" said George Hobica, president of AirfareWatchdog.com, a site that is part of Smarter Travel Media LLC, which provides airfare deals and advice. ""Everyone suffers. The obese people suffer and the people who are skinny and get spilled over on suffer as well."" U.S. obesity rates have mushroomed during the last 25 years, but the width of a coach airplane seat has changed little, remaining between 17 and 18 inches in most commercial planes. More than one-third of Americans fall into the obese category, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This makes traveling in tight spaces vexing for airlines trying to bolster profits by selling the maximum number of seats. The Federal Aviation Administration does not regulate seat width, but it does require passengers be able to sit belted and with both arm rests down to comply with safety standards. In April, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines formalized a policy that says passengers who are unable to safely fit into one seat must pay full price for a second seat. They may receive it free if the plane has vacant seats. Flight attendants on the airlines are responsible for making sure passengers are fitting in their seats and may ask a heavier passengers requiring two seats to pay extra. Robin Urbanski, a spokeswoman for United, said the company received 700 complaints in 2008 from passengers who were upset because a larger passenger encroached on his or her seat. ""This new policy was created for the comfort and well-being of all our guests on board,"" Urbanski said. A survey conducted this year by Europe's low-fare airline Ryanair found a third of the 100,000 passengers polled believed a ""fat tax"" should be instituted, requiring heavier passengers to pay more. Most U.S. airlines have a policy or plan for dealing with heavier passengers, though some are not formalized like United's. Officials worry heavier passengers squished into one seat may pose a safety hazard when a plane must be evacuated during an emergency. Southwest Airlines has had a ""customer of size policy"" for more than 20 years, requiring passengers to buy a second seat on a full plane if their body crosses the armrest boundary. The company will issue refunds if unoccupied seats are available, which they say is the case 97 percent of the time. Airlines with open seating policies such as Southwest find it easier to relocate passengers in need of an extra seat. On all airlines, passengers can buy first-class or business-class seats, which are wider. But those tickets cost more than a coach seat. Experts at Boeing Company, an aircraft manufacturer, say 17-inch seats can accommodate 95 percent of the traveling public. They say studies have found most seat space invasions happen because of wider shoulders and not derrieres. Still, some larger passengers who need more than one seat believe being charged extra is discriminatory and the airlines are not accommodating the growing American waistline. ""The airlines need to be making bigger seats,"" said Peggy Howell, a spokeswoman for the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, a group based in San Francisco, California. ""It's not safe to be cramming us into two seats."" Lawsuits have been filed by heavier passengers and by those who complain about large passengers encroaching on their space. The courts have ruled  the airline policies are within their rights. In the United States, there aren't any discrimination laws to protect obese people, attorneys say. (In some employment discrimination cases, attorneys have been able to win by proving obesity was a genetic disease beyond the person's control.) In 2003, the issue of passenger weight surfaced when a commuter plane crashed on takeoff from Charlotte, North Carolina, because of excess weight and a maintenance error. The accident prompted the FAA to increase the estimated weight per passenger by 10 pounds, including 20 pounds of carry-on luggage. For example, the average weight for a passenger traveling in the summer (including carry-on luggage) went from 180 pounds in 1995 to 190 pounds in 2003. ""We realized after that accident that the weights we were using probably didn't reflect the current state of the American traveling public,"" said Les Dorr, a spokesman with aviation safety at the FAA. In 2004, a CDC scientist studied the effects of obesity on the airline industry. The scientist calculated his findings based on data revealing the average weight of an American had increased by 10 pounds in the 1990s. He estimated the extra weight cost airlines $275 million extra for fuel in 2000. The figures are likely higher today, with fuel costs rising. Scott Cluthe, 57, who works in the radio industry in Houston, Texas, a city known for its obesity epidemic, said average-sized passengers should not have to incur the higher fuel cost caused by the airline's heavier customers. ""A small child needs to pay for a flight, so why wouldn't an obese person?"" said Cluthe, who flies several times a year, mostly in coach, for personal trips. ""I'm not a discriminatory person, but we have to look at the reality of the situation. It's getting a little crowded in here."" Some larger passengers don't mind paying for the second seat. Other heavier fliers argue while tall passengers pay a fee for legroom, the fees are only a fraction of the price of a entire seat. Air France offers obese passengers booking a second seat up to 33 percent off the ticket price, depending on the type of seat and availability. Mike Vasey of Cheyenne, Wyoming says even some normal-sized people can't fly comfortably when they are packed in the cabin like sardines. Vasey, 45, who considers himself a large guy at 400 pounds and over six feet tall, usually pays for two seats. ""I'd rather be comfortable first ,"" he said, ""and worry about discrimination later.""","Obesity rates have grown in the last 25 years but plane seat sizes remain the same .

"(CNN)  -- A 23-year-old beauty queen and seven men arrested in vehicles loaded with weapons and cash near the central Mexico city of Guadalajara have been transferred to Mexico City, the state news agency said Wednesday. Laura Zuniga and seven men were found in vehicles with guns and $50,000, Mexican police say. Laura Zuniga and the men were traveling Monday night in two vehicles that contained AR-15 assault rifles, 38-caliber specials, 9 mm handguns, cartridges and $50,000 in cash, said Luis Carlos Najera Gutierrez de Velazco, secretary of public security for the state of Jalisco. Police, who had received a tip that armed men were in a home, detected the vehicles in the city of Zapopan as authorities were en route to investigate the call, Najera said Tuesday. Inside one of the vehicles, authorities found Angel Orlando Garcia Urquiza, 29, who is Zuniga's boyfriend and the brother of ""one of the greatest capos [bosses] of narcotraffic,"" Ricardo Garcia Urquiza, a member of the Juarez cartel already in police custody, Najera said. All eight were filed before the news media Tuesday. Zuniga, wearing blue jeans and a gray sweater, raised her handcuffed wrists to cover her face in a police picture.  Watch footage of the eight arrested and weapons seized » . They were transported in a heavily armed 30-vehicle convoy late Tuesday to Guadalajara International Airport and flown to Mexico City, the official Notimex news agency reported. The federal organized crime team in Mexico City will investigate, and the suspects will face arms charges, Najera said. Zuniga is from Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, a center of drug activity. In July, she won the title Our Sinaloa Beauty. That gave her the right to compete two months later in the national Our Mexico Beauty in Monterrey, where she won ""The Election of the Queens,"" one of five special recognitions, and came in third overall. In October, she won the title ""Hispanoamerican Queen 2008"" in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Mexican newscasts referred to her Wednesday as ""Miss Pistols"" and likened her situation to ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" According to the Nuestra Belleza Mexico Web site, she is to represent Mexico in next year's Miss International contest. A statement issued Wednesday by Lupita Jones, director of Our Mexico Beauty, said the organization will wait to see what happens in the legal system.

"(CNN) -- One year ago, a sheriff's dispatcher in Orange County, near Orlando, Florida, received a strange 911 call. A small child was missing -- and had been for a month. Casey Anthony didn't tell anyone for 30 days that her daughter, Caylee, was missing. The child's grandmother was frantic, talking a mile a minute. But her mother seemed unemotional, disconnected from the drama around her. So began the Caylee Anthony case, a mystery that became a nightly fixture on cable television and captivated true-crime buffs across the country. Today, the tot's 23-year-old mother, Casey Anthony, is in jail, charged with first-degree murder, and faces the death penalty if convicted. She denies harming her daughter or having anything to do with her disappearance. Her attorney, Jose Baez, has said that once all the facts are known, it will become clear that his client is innocent. While reports of missing children are not unusual -- a Haleigh and a Haylee are two recent examples  -- several elements came together in the Caylee case to make it a high-profile news story, said Robert Thompson, who heads the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. ""The fact that it's a toddler had that really dramatic, 'this is our worst nightmare' thing. It doesn't get any more dramatic than that,"" he said. ""Then, of course, there's Casey herself."" The 30-day delay in reporting Caylee's disappearance, along with the frequent release of police documents containing the personal details of the family's life, whetted the public's appetite.  See how the case unfolded » . ""By that time, it becomes self-fulfilling,"" Thompson said. ""Once the story gets into the inbox of places that cover this thing -- Dateline, America's Most Wanted, Greta van Susteren, Nancy Grace, Geraldo -- it becomes a packaged drama. We want to know how it turns out."" Caylee's body was found December 11, six months after she disappeared and just a few blocks from her grandparents' house. The remains were bagged and partially buried in a swampy, vacant lot. Duct tape covered the child's mouth. But the cause of Caylee's death is just one of many questions that remain unanswered a year later. And the answers are not likely to come soon, if at all. Casey Anthony's trial, originally scheduled to begin October 12, has been pushed back until some time next year. Thousands of pages of court files have been made public. Police questioned Anthony's friends and boyfriends, pored through her cell phone records, went through her computer, and seized her digital photo albums. They even analyzed her sleep patterns. But the picture that emerges is far from clear. The story begins at about 9:40 p.m. on the evening of July 15, 2008, with Cindy Anthony's call to 911. The call capped a day in which she and her husband, George, a retired police officer from Ohio, received an impound notice and tracked down their daughter's abandoned white 1998 Pontiac Sunbird -- and then their daughter, Caylee's mother, who was staying with a boyfriend. ""I found out my granddaughter has been taken,"" Cindy Anthony told the 911 dispatcher. ""She has been missing for a month. Her mother finally admitted that she's been missing. ... We're talking about a 3-year-old little girl!"" ""I need to find her,"" Cindy Anthony continued. ""I told you my daughter was missing for a month. I just found her today, but I can't find my granddaughter. She just admitted to me that she's been trying to find her herself. There's something wrong. I found my daughter's car today, and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car."" George Anthony told police later that the car gave him ""a bad vibe."" ""I got within three feet of it. I could smell something. You look up and you say, please don't let this be. Please don't let this be,"" he said in a July 24 police interview. A cadaver dog confirmed for police the scent of human decomposition in the car trunk. Casey Anthony's friends told police she said she hit an animal with the car. But many of her stories did not check out, investigators said. Although Casey Anthony has frequently fallen out with her parents, they have always insisted that she is innocent. They haven't visited her in jail for months, in part because authorities record the visits and release them to the public. During the search for Caylee, some say Casey Anthony didn't behave the way one would expect of a worried mother. She went to nightclubs and sent hundreds of text messages to friends, according to cell phone and text transcripts and investigative reports released by police. Those phone and text records also showed that she hardly mentioned her missing daughter. At one point, police analyzed her sleep patterns, finding that the cell phone calls and text messaging ceased for only three or four hours a night at about the time Caylee disappeared. For weeks, curiosity seekers camped out in lawn chairs outside the Anthony home, where the family had posted large flyers asking, ""Where is Caylee?"" When the crowd grew unruly, Cindy Anthony waved a hammer and George Anthony shouted back at the hecklers. Authorities say they also found traces of chloroform, a knock-out drug, in the trunk of Casey Anthony's car. And they said that on her computer, they found Internet searches of missing children and chloroform Web sites. Investigators first labeled Casey Anthony a person of interest, and later, a suspect. She was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder on October 14. But Thompson, the pop culture professor at Syracuse, cautions that the final curtain hasn't fallen on this drama. ""It isn't necessarily a slam dunk,"" he said. ""We have the JonBenet Ramsey case to show that we may think one thing, and it isn't so."" Early in that investigation, authorities said John and Patsy Ramsey were ""under an umbrella of suspicion"" in their daughter's death, but they later were cleared. ""These things are capable of twisting around,"" Thompson said. ""But that's another element that makes them interesting.""","Cindy Anthony called 911, reported Caylee missing a year ago .

"(CNN) -- She's only 23, but Deepika Padukone is already living a life millions would envy. From calendar model to Bollywood big-time: Deepika Padukone. The model-turned-actress was spotted in a music video and then cast in one of the biggest grossing films in Bollywood history. She still only has three movies under her belt, but star status has already been bestowed upon her. With no family connections to the film industry and not being from Mumbai, Padukone traveled a route to movie stardom millions could only dream of. After deciding to become a model at the age of 16, she was picked out of a music video by acclaimed director Farah Khan and cast in her next film opposite Shahrukh Khan. ""Om Shanti Om"" went on to become not only a hit in India, but also gained wider acclaim among western audiences. ""I completely didn't expect it. When I met Farah I thought she was joking. And at that point it seemed too good to be true. Shahrukh is someone who I've grown up watching, and I didn't think that I deserve being a part of such a huge film. It's only later, when I met Shahrukh and when things actually started happening, when I realized that this is for real,"" she told CNN. Despite her meteoric rise to fame and work on some big budget films she believes she's learning the job of being an A-list Bollywood actress. ""I had great debut, a successful film, but after that...I would think it's quite difficult to choose the right film. You never know what's right and what's wrong,"" she said. ""Things for me changed quite overnight, actually. I remember a couple of months before the film release, not too many people knew me. In November 2007 when my film released and immediately after that I had to travel to New York, to Dubai and to London, and suddenly everyone on the streets started recognizing me, especially the Indians. That's when I realized that things have changed."" With the public attention has come the inevitable media spotlight on her private life. She says she never experienced the ""casting couch"" but is consistently romantically linked with other Bollywood stars, and there were rumors about a relationship with Indian cricketer MS Dhoni. ""As someone who didn't know how to deal with it, yes it was really difficult for me initially to read about myself or to read about things that are untrue. But I think slowly you start learning to deal with these things."" Padukone's father was a professional badminton player, and she played too as a teenager, traveling across the country to compete in tournaments. But by her late teens she decided she wanted to be a model and got the full support of her parents. ""I trained, I lost some weight. I then got a portfolio done. I sent it to Bombay to a couple of agencies and waited for awhile. I think that period is really the most challenging. Because that's really the time that one can really go wrong. The waiting period. You can really make some wrong decisions and go completely wrong,"" she told CNN. ""I had the support of my family. I didn't get carried away. I think I was patient enough to wait for the right assignment to come my way."" As a model she appeared in commercials and music videos. Since her move into the movie business more commercial endorsements have come her way, but in an industry notorious for its high turnover of starlets she is aware that for actresses there is often a limited shelf-life. ""For me my life now is my work. But I know that at some point I will have to have a life beyond my work. And I know that today there's me, tomorrow there will be someone else. Maybe I'll be here for 5 years, maybe I'll be here for many, many years. ""I'm definitely going to work hard and make sure that I can be here for as long as I can, but I'll also make sure that people don't get bored of me. And...yes, let's see how it goes.""","Padukone was picked out from a music video to star in ""Om Shanti Om""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Brad Pitt gets top billing in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds,"" but Austrian actor Christoph Waltz may have turned in the most memorable performance as a Nazi ""Jew Hunter."" Christoph Waltz attends a special screening of ""Inglourious Basterds"" in New York. Waltz, a 52-year-old veteran of German television, was hardly known outside of Europe, until now. Tarantino, insisting on actors with geographic origins similar to their characters, chose Waltz to play a complex and unforgettable villain: Nazi Col. Hans Landa. Landa mixes charm, humor and intelligence with great cruelty and opportunism as he travels through Tarantino's unpredictable screenplay. Waltz calls Landa ""one of the great villains in dramatic literature."" His performance earned Waltz the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival, but the actor credits the writer for creating a ""multifaceted and layered"" character. ""It's what Quentin [Tarantino] has written, and let me tell you, that's plenty,"" Waltz said. ""Because I could still be sitting there trying to figure out what else is in there. And it's bottomless."" The opening scene of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is itself a short film in the style of a spaghetti western, starring Waltz as ""The Jew Hunter.""  Watch the stars of the movie discuss the film » . ""It was pure Tarantino to me in that it blended so many different elements perfectly, of tension and comedy, dialogue and excitement,"" actor B.J. Novak said of the scene. Waltz's character uses three languages in his encounter with a French dairy farmer who was hiding a Jewish family under his farmhouse floor. ""The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I can think like a Jew, where they can only think like a German or, more precisely, a German soldier,"" Landa tells the farmer. Landa's motivation is more complex than the typical Nazi depicted in a past movies. A literature scholar could build a career around studying the character, Waltz said. ""Landa is one of the great villains in dramatic literature from the very beginning, for specific reasons, and it's a real job to find out the reasons,"" he said. ""You sit there and you study and you study."" The role provided him ""ample opportunity to show other sides,"" Waltz said. ""That's the fantastic thing with Landa, is it's so multifaceted and layered."" But Waltz said he will be careful about repeating a similar role. ""This is the best villain there is, and now it has to be significantly different for me to consider,"" he said. His three-decades-long acting résumé shows the diversity of his talent. His 1996 portrayal of Roy Black, one of Germany's most beloved pop stars, earned him one of Germany's highest acting honors. Waltz, now with a Hollywood agent, hints that scripts are coming his way because of the ""Inglourious Basterds"" exposure. One disadvantage of playing the villain in a Tarantino film is that the director insisted that Waltz not pal around with cast mates while away from the set. ""It might be a good idea not to establish this buddy-buddy situation, to keep everybody on their toes a little bit,"" he said. ""That awkward distance that they kept from me made it easier."" Pitt, however, did approach him early in the filming, he said. ""The fact that he is one of the biggest stars didn't come into that equation after he eliminated it,"" Waltz said. ""He approached me literally with open arms, and that was that."" ""Inglourious Basterds""-- rated R -- hits theaters Friday, August 21.","Christoph Waltz plays Nazi Col.

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Hurricane Bill spun northward toward the New England coast Saturday with wind and rain as officials warned beach lovers to head indoors for the night. Signs at Lighthouse Beach at Chatham, Massachusetts, warn beach-goers Saturday of rough waters. At 11 p.m., the center of the Category 1 storm was about 195 miles southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, the National Hurricane Center said.

"FERNANDO DE NORONHA, Brazil (CNN)  -- Forty-one bodies have been recovered from the crash of Air France Flight 447, the Brazilian Navy Command and Aeronautical Command said Tuesday. Brazilian military personnel on Tuesday carry the remains of one of the passengers of the Air France crash. Sixteen bodies pulled from the Atlantic Ocean Tuesday were taken to Fernando de Noronha for transportation Wednesday afternoon by helicopter to the air base in Recife, Brazil. The 25 bodies previously found were put aboard a Brazilian frigate. Searches for the remaining bodies will continue overnight, the navy and aeronautical command said in a written statement. The Airbus A330 crashed in the Atlantic Ocean June 1 en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France, carrying 228 passengers and crew. The first bodies were recovered about 320 kilometers (200 miles) northwest of the Brazilian archipelago of Saint Peter and Saint Paul; Tuesday's recoveries were 80 kilometers (50 miles) away. It was not clear whether the bodies had drifted in the 1-2 knot currents or whether their separation suggested that the jet may have broken apart in the air. Watch bodies being returned to land » . Meanwhile, the French, who are leading the investigation, were increasing their naval efforts. The nuclear submarine Emeraude was expected to reach the search area Wednesday to search for wreckage, including the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. And the French sent two tugs towing 40 tons of recovery equipment, a surveillance ship and a ship equipped for amphibious operations. The United States is also sending equipment to help with the search. Watch challenges faced by search crews » . Brazilian authorities said the plane debris will be taken to France for investigation but the bodies would undergo forensic tests in Recife. The cause of the crash is not known, but investigators are looking at the possible role of airspeed sensors known as Pitot tubes, among other factors. Air France has agreed to replace the sensors on its Airbus A330 and A340 jets, a pilots' union said Tuesday. The airline said Saturday that it began replacing its fleet's sensors last month. Another Air France pilots' union, ALTER, has advised its pilots not to fly planes until their Pitot tubes are replaced. ALTER, the smallest of three Air France pilots' unions, would not say what percentage of the carrier's pilots it represents. Watch an explanation of what could have caused the crash » . The biggest union, SNPL, said Tuesday it has accepted Air France's assurances that no Airbus A330 or A340 will take off unless at least two of its three Pitot tubes have been replaced. Union spokesman Eric Derivry added that there is no indication that the Pitot tubes caused the accident. Air France said over the weekend that it began to notice in May of last year that Pitot tubes sometimes briefly iced up at high altitude on A330s and A340s. That caused ""a loss of airspeed data,"" according to the airline -- that is, the pilots didn't know the plane's speed. Air France decided to replace all its probes starting April 27, following laboratory tests earlier in the year, the airline said. That is the program the pilots say the airline has promised to complete within days. The location of the crash has not been determined, because ocean currents have moved the bodies and debris. Map of Flight 447's flight path » . The ocean depth where the debris and bodies have been found varies, but averages about 3,000 meters (nearly 9,900 feet) deep, according to the University of New Hampshire/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association Joint Hydrographic Center. The search area covers 200,000 square km (77,220 square miles), nearly the size of Romania, Brazilian officials said. Brazilian officials emphasized Monday that finding bodies was their main priority. The French are in charge of finding the voice and data recorders. Fourteen aircraft -- 12 Brazilian and two French -- were participating, along with five Brazilian ships and one French frigate. The U.S. Navy will contribute two high-tech acoustic devices to listen underwater for the emergency beacons that are attached to the voice and data recorders. The ""towed pinger locators,"" which help search for emergency beacons on downed aircraft to a maximum depth of 20,000 feet -- will be placed aboard two French tugs that are part of the search efforts, the official said. CNN's Karl Penhaul, Ayesha Durgahee, Niki Cook, Jim Bittermann and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","First bodies recovered from the crash of Air France 447 returned to land .

"(InStyle.com) -- A hit TV show. An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born. The Ingénue: ""This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,"" Heigl says. ""I like simple hair and makeup."" There has been a self-tanning mishap . As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fiancé, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets. Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products. ""I love everything new,"" says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" just started a production company at Fox. ""When I was in Rhode Island filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca."" She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Nautica's new women's fragrance in January. Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit ""Knocked Up"" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl. These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Katie (and Hollywood calls the Next Big Thing), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like. KATHERINE HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat. IN STYLE: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign. KH: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth. IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks? KH: It was fun. I was working with such great hair and makeup people. And to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat. IS: Do you ever go without makeup? KH: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the ""Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup"" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products. IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge? KH: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept. IS: How do you think you express your personality through style? KH: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again. As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me. I'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm ""preparing"" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat. IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding? KH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, ""I'm done."" Everyone says, ""You just know when you put that dress on."" My sister found the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling. IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months? KH: My poor mother is probably like, ""Why, God? Why?"" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun. And I don't want to freak out or stress. IS: Does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look? KH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing. IS: Would you ever wear a wig out? KH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out. IS: How would you describe your skin? KH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse. IS: How do you treat a breakout? KH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores. If I backed up, things might look fine. IS: What do you always carry in your bag? KH: Powder, because I get shiny. And lip balm, either the Smith's Rosebud Salve or C.O. Bigelow's Mentha Lip Shine in Black Cherry Soda from Bath & Body Works. It's shiny with a little shimmer and tastes so good. IS: An In Style.com reader wants to know how you maintain a healthy body image in Hollywood. KH: I train with Harley Pasternak. I love him with my whole soul and follow his 5-Factor diet. I first said, ""I'm never going to be -- nor do I want to be -- an uber-athletic girl."" It's just not me and I don't have that kind of discipline. He said, ""I just want you to be healthy."" A lot of what we focus on is posture. I slump into myself when I get stressed. If I were going to play an action hero, I'd have to get that look. But I'd never maintain it. For me it's never about achieving a look that's impossible. E-mail to a friend . Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright © 2009 Time Inc.
