"(CNN) -- A trailer carrying revelers on a haunted night ride overturned Saturday in Maine, sending at least 15 people, including two by helicopter, to area hospitals, a fire official said. The accident happened during what's called The Gauntlet, a spooky hayride through forest and including ""things that jump and scream in the night."" The activity is part of Pumpkin Land, a venue featuring a variety of Halloween-themed activities in Mechanic Falls, about 30 miles north of Portland. David Clukey, of the Mechanic Falls Fire Department, said multiple people were injured when the tractor-trailer flipped. Seven fire departments and three police departments -- including state police -- rushed to the scene, according to Clukey. Clukey didn't offer details on the state of the injured, beyond that two people were flown out by helicopters and 13 others were transported by ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center and St. Mary's Regional Medical Center, both about 15 miles away in Lewiston. Jennifer Johnson, a nursing supervisor at St. Mary's, said her hospital had received seven patients -- all of them stable -- from the incident. Authorities remained on the scene Saturday night investigating the cause of the accident. In 2011: Police get 911 call from hayride .

"Washington (CNN) -- Last-minute jostling in Louisiana's Senate race has given sudden life to long-stalled legislation to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline. Both houses of Congress are on track to vote in the coming days on proposals sponsored by the candidates who will face off in a December Senate runoff in Louisiana. The House has scheduled a vote for Friday on a bill to green-light the $8 billion project to transport oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. The Senate, meanwhile, is likely to vote early next week on similar legislation. The moves could force the hand of President Barack Obama, who has said he won't make a decision on whether to allow the pipeline to go forward until the State Department can finish a years-long independent review. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters traveling with the president during an Asia trip on Thursday that the administration takes ""a dim view of these kinds of proposals,"" suggesting a veto is possible. The pipeline has become a political football in Louisiana, which is holding a Dec. 6 run-off election for its Senate seat. Democratic incumbent Mary Landrieu is trying to demonstrate her clout as Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chairwoman one last time by prodding the chamber to vote on legislation authorizing the pipeline. She said repeatedly that at least 60 senators would vote for her bill. ""I am so pleased to have been one of the spark plugs to help to get us moving -- not in the next Congress, but in the lame duck session of this Congress,"" Landrieu said on the Senate floor Thursday. House Republicans countered by scheduling a vote on their own on the same bill -- this one sponsored by Rep. Bill Cassidy, Landrieu's GOP challenger. Combined with Senate Republicans' pledge to place Cassidy on the energy panel, it's an effort to mute Landrieu's claims of influence on energy issues that are important in oil-rich Louisiana. ""Regardless of the reason, what we're doing here today is working together on ideas that we've been trying to push for a long, long time,"" GOP Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas said on the House floor Thursday. ""Now that the Senate is here to join us, we are here to work together,"" Sessions said while repeatedly pointing out that Cassidy is sponsoring the measure. Landrieu was aided in the Senate by West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, who acknowledged that Landrieu ""is in a fight for her life here"" but said she'd be willing to take her name off the bill if doing so would ease its passage. ""The best politics is good government,"" he said. ""If you do something good, as a Republican, as a Democrat, we all get credit for it."" It's not clear whether Congress actually has the authority to approve the project -- or whether that power lies solely with the State Department, which has jurisdiction because the pipeline would cross international borders. The legislation would use a January 2014 State Department environmental analysis of the project to satisfy requirements that it be studied for adverse effects. Notre Dame law professor Bruce Huber said the legislation the House and Senate are set to vote on ""would override the presidential permit process and simply declare the proposal to be approved as a matter of federal law."" He said there likely aren't enough votes to overturn an Obama veto -- especially with Democrats still holding a Senate majority before new lawmakers are sworn in early next year. ""Nonetheless, this is the most substantial shift in momentum with respect to the Keystone project that has occurred in the last several years,"" he said.","The House could vote to approve the Keystone XL pipeline on Friday, followed by the Senate next week .
Efforts to boost the two candidates in the Louisiana Senate run-off election have propelled the legislation .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic was a man in a hurry. The two-time defending champion at the ATP World Tour Finals might have been expected to be tested by the new U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic, in their Group A opener, but it turned in to a one-sided rout Monday. World number one Djokovic broke the giant Croatian no less than six times on his way to a 6-1 6-1 victory in less than an hour at the 02 Arena in London. It was the Serbian's 11th straight victory at the end of season event and his 28th straight in matches played indoors. Cilic's powerful serve, which so helped him to his grand slam triumph at Flushing Meadow, was rendered impotent by the returning brilliance of the number one seed, . ""It was a great performance obviously,"" he said after his quickfire victory. ""Marin was a U.S. Open winner but I managed to neutralize his service and get a lot of balls back in play."" Djokovic, who is looking to wrap up the season-ending No.1 ranking, will achieve that feat if he reaches the semifinal stage with a 3-0 winning record from the round-robin group. He plays Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland next on Wednesday and the Australian Open champion was also a commanding winner in his group opener. Wawrinka also dropped just two games in beating giant Czech Tomas Berdych in a little over an hour. The number three seed has been in poor recent form, but he showed a big improvement against the misfiring Berdych, who made 24 errors. He was damning in his verdict of his performance following the defeat. ""Well, unfortunately it was my worst match of the whole season,"" Berdych told the ATP World Tour website. ""My game is about hitting the ball nice, clean, then you can create something. But that's the beginning of what I didn't have today at all. I hit so many frames."" Spectators at the prestigious eight-man event have now seen four matches with four straight sets victories, the pattern started as Japan's Kei Nishikori beat home favorite Andy Murray 6-4 6-4 in the opener Sunday. Roger Federer, who can still pip Djokovic to the top ranking, followed up with a 6-1 7-6 win over Milos Raonic as he began his quest for a record seventh ATP World Tour Finals crown.","Novak Djokovic wins opening match in ATP World Tour Finals .

"(CNN) -- It has been an eventful few weeks for space news. First came the launch failure of an unmanned Orbital Sciences rocket and cargo spacecraft bound for the International Space Station, which started a conversation in the media about the wisdom of relying on commercial carriers for transporting cargo (and later, crew) to the space station. Days later came the fatal crash of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo during a flight test. The media discussion expanded to include the question of whether it would be ethical to launch members of the general public to space in the future, as nonprofessionals seeking the experience. Regardless of the misconceptions (NASA has always relied upon commercial companies to design and manufacture its spacecraft and rockets) and arguments either way, the fact is that the public suddenly became aware that we are doing a lot of things in space. Some learned for the first time that we have a space station and that science and STEM education work is being performed aboard. Others were surprised that Americans are still flying into space and participating in exploration plans. Then came the new blockbuster movie ""Interstellar"" just a week after the Virgin crash. It is setting box office records, reinforcing space as the subject on people's minds. And now, the Philae lander is capturing the public's imagination. It has apparently accomplished a major first: a soft landing onto the surface of a comet. Finally, a success story, a positive one that gets people's attention about space exploration! Usually only space mishaps and tragedies are able to push aside reality shows. These events show two of the major facets of exploration: Risk and the wonder of discovery. They also show the power of risk and exploration as pop culture. Now that we have a success to celebrate, let me expand on what Philae (part of the Rosetta spacecraft and mission) is about, and trying to accomplish. First, congratulations to the European Space Agency and the Rosetta team! It has been a long time coming. The operations team has been working for over 10 years on the program. Launched in March 2004, the Rosetta spacecraft reached comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August 2014, having traveled more than 500 million kilometers. It then began a 17-month mission. At this distance, it takes a signal (traveling at the speed of light) about half an hour to travel one-way to or from Earth. The United States has a small part in this mission, as some NASA instruments are onboard. We applaud the success of our European partners, and this is just another example of what we can accomplish through international cooperation. Philae was released on November 12 and began a seven-hour controlled descent to the comet surface. At approximately 1600 GMT, the lander touched down, despite a few technical glitches, which added to the drama (during the descent, control jets failed to activate). After landing, there was jubilation before a second problem was detected. Harpoons were to be fired downward into the comet, to help anchor the lander to the surface. These units failed to fire, and telemetry indicated that the lander ""bounced"" and apparently settled onto another spot on the comet. This is because the comet, being only about 4 kilometers in width, has very low gravity. The escape velocity off of it is only 0.5 meters per second, so it would take only a little jump by an astronaut to go flying off into space. The fear is that Philae may have bounced off. What is the purpose of landing on the comet? Besides the technical and operational lessons learned from this event, there is serious science to be had. There are theories that comets helped seed the Earth with most of its water, and indeed, perhaps with the basic chemical building blocks of life itself. Philae, if successful, will analyze the comet soil and determine the quantities of water, nucleic and amino acids present. These data will help shed light upon these theories of comet seeding. If supported, the implication is that this likely happened in many other places in the universe as well. In short, Philae and Rosetta are poised to help answer fundamental questions on one possible mechanism of the creation of life. As of this writing, the fate of Philae is unknown. After its landing bounce, it apparently landed in a place where the antennae are not pointed toward Earth. So, no signal can be received for several hours, until the rotation of the comet brings the antennae back into alignment. Maybe this is not all bad. The drama of whether the lander survived and didn't bounce back off the comet just might keep the public engaged long enough to also become interested in the science that the spacecraft might return. Please, standby!","Space has been in the news with a recent rocket explosion and a spaceship crash .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama lags in several polls on fixing the economy. His favorability rating is virtually even with that of presumed GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. His signature health care reform law appears on the verge of being overturned. Women, once central to his base, are now drifting toward his opponent. He has even lost support among once-passionate young voters. Yet, according to a USA Today/Gallup poll released this week, 56% of those polled believe the president will cinch re-election this fall, compared to 36% percents who think Romney will win. Some are wondering: ""What gives?"" Despite the heated campaign, lackluster performance on the economy and negative feelings many conservatives have toward the incumbent president, many voters still like Barack Obama as a person. And, in the popularity contest that is American politics, that can go a long way. He croons the opening lines of Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" and the Twitterverse goes crazy. Flattering pictures of him with the first lady and his daughters spread across Facebook like kudzu. He goes on late-night TV to slow jam with Jimmy Fallon, and then reclaims the overplayed mantle of the ""cool"" president. Poll: Romney up, Obama down among women . Obama even turned on the charm during an appearance Tuesday on ""The View,"" a move political experts say will help revive his popularity among women -- a key voting bloc. He answered pop quiz questions about reality star Kim Kardashian's short-lived marriage. He deferred to the first lady on a question about the racy ""50 Shades of Grey,"" a novel currently on many women's must-read lists. Still, he is locked in a virtual dead heat with Romney in nationwide horserace polls and his approval rating is stuck around 50%, according to the latest CNN/ORC International poll. But Gallup this week has the president leading the former Massachusetts governor by 29 points when it comes to ""likeability."" And an earlier CNN/ORC poll had Obama nearly 10 points ahead of Romney on the likeability factor. Poll: Gender gap and likeability keep Obama over Romney . New York Times columnist David Brooks recently dubbed Obama the ""ESPN president,"" attributing his high favorability marks to his ""post-boomer manliness."" ""It's been long established that voters want a president they're comfortable with,"" said Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor with the Cook Political Report. ""What's his favorite pastime? Playing basketball. He likes hanging out with his kids. It's clear he's a parent like most parents. He talks about his wife. He's very good at connecting with people, he's a good speaker."" Those factors lend to Obama's ""nice guy"" image, Duffy said. It's an image the Obama campaign worked hard to cultivate during the 2008 election cycle when he was portrayed by Republicans as an Ivy-League-educated, poor-bowling, elitist professor who looked down on people who ""cling to guns or religion."" Sending first lady Michelle Obama out on a charm offensive to make the rounds on talk shows and dispatching Vice President Joe Biden to places like eastern Ohio, where he was slated to speak on the president's economic record, has also helped, Duffy said. But his opponent is launching his own charisma counter-offensive. Now that the bruising GOP primary has ended, the Romney campaign's efforts to soften their candidate's image as a stiff and out-of-touch rich guy may be paying off, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. Romney got chuckles when he appeared on ""Late Night with David Letterman"" in December. His Top Ten list of things he'd like to say to the American people included quipping ""What's up gangstas -- it's the M-I-Double Tizzle."" Other personal touches include a blog by Romney's personal aide, Garrett Jackson, which chronicles his time on the campaign trail with the GOP presidential hopeful and even features a stop at Junior's Cheesecake restaurant in New York. Ann Romney's popular Pinterest page includes recipes and pictures of patriotic-themed desserts. Gillespie attributes most of the gain in Romney's favorability to fact that he's the likely Republican presidential nominee. ""Now that it's clear to see that he is going to be the nominee, you'll find Republican voters fall in line and like their guy a little bit more,"" she explained. Still, Romney's comments about his wife owning ""a couple of Cadillacs,"" stories about elevators and six-car garages, bragging about his pals who own NASCAR racing teams and Ann Romney's recent appearance on CBS' ""This Morning"" in a $1,000 designer t-shirt fueled critics who accuse the former Massachusetts governor of flaunting his wealth. Even in the midst of a struggling economy, Ronald Reagan used his popularity and likeability to help propel him to a second term in 1984. And Harry Truman won a come-back re-election in 1948 after a series of battles with Congress over post-war reconstruction. But plenty of well-liked presidents ended up as one-termers, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Former president Gerald Ford, who had a friendly, affable persona, had a tough time overcoming his pardon of Richard Nixon. Former president George H.W. Bush, whose popularity peaked after the first Gulf War, was ultimately felled by a sluggish economy. ""Presidential decisions are a product of economic conditions and job approval,"" Sabato said. ""It's wonderful to be liked, but it doesn't affect the vote that much.""","Even in a tight race and a bad economy, Obama's likeability numbers keep him above water .
Candidates are using social media, daytime and late-night TV to show some personality .
Romney is pushing his own charm factor to woo voters ."
"(CNN) -- Rhona Levy, a real estate management secretary living in the Bronx, has already decided upon her final resting place. Like many, she wants to be buried in a cemetery with her loved ones. Her loved ones just happen to be her four cats and one dog. Levy, 65, never thought she would be able to be buried in a pet cemetery but a new regulation enacted by the New York Department of State officially permits pet cemeteries to inter the cremated remains, or ""cremains,"" of pet owners along with their pets. ""A sizable segment of the New York community articulated a desire to be able to have their cremains buried with their pet remains,"" stated the formal ""notice of adoption"" published in the official New York State register Wednesday. ""No evidence suggests that permitting this practice will harm cemeteries for human remains."" Under the regulation, effective August 2, pet cemeteries can accept human cremains for burial but cannot charge a separate fee for those remains or advertise their human-remains burial services. The state set those rules to make it clear pet cemeteries were not engaging in ""the operation of a cemetery for human remains."" New York is one of a handful of states that has made formal regulations regarding human remains in pet cemeteries. ""Most states have not addressed this specifically. It's very much a state of flux right now,"" said Poul Lemasters, an attorney and funeral director based in Cincinnati, Ohio. Lemasters also is a consultant for the International Cemetery Cremation and Funeral Association and the Pet Loss Professionals Alliance. Virginia currently is proposing a similar regulation allowing pet cemeteries to be added to existing human cemeteries. Additionally, Pennsylvania is one of few states that allow human bodies to be buried on pet cemeteries without having to be cremated, according to Lemasters. The effort to formally allow human remains to be buried in New York pet cemeteries began in 2011 after NYPD officer Thomas Ryan wanted to be buried with his deceased dogs in Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in upstate Hartsdale, New York. The pet cemetery, established in 1896, had been allowing human-remains interment for decades. ""Our records indicate it was being done since early 1920s,"" Ed Martin Jr., the cemetery's director, said of the practice. ""We were doing it all along. A couple of years ago, the New York [state] Division of Cemeteries asked us to cease the procedure to take a closer look."" Eventually the state decided in favor of people who wanted to rest eternally with their mascots. And it was the growing demand of owners wanting to be buried with their pets that sparked government attention, said Lemasters. ""It's been going on for so many years and no one has ever said anything,"" said Lemasters. ""It's going to happen, so why not allow it to happen and regulate it. It's just a matter of time before states start regulating this more and more."" The decision covers all pet cemeteries in New York state. Once Levy found out about the new regulation, her mind was made up. ""My decision was set in stone right then, that I knew I would be cremated and I would be buried with my pets, my babies,"" she said. For decades, Levy enjoyed their company. Her dog, Snow, and three of her cats, Putchke, Pumpkin, and Twinkie are all buried at Hartsdale. She and another cat, Shaina, will join them one day. ""They're my children, they're my babies, I love them,"" she said. ""When they live with you, when you raise them, they're your family.""

"(CNN) -- What's the age at which older men are no longer allowed to compliment women in their 20s on being beautiful? Is there an age when such compliments go from nice to creepy? And is there a similar rule that bars older women from calling younger men ""handsome""? We ask because of the uproar that erupted this week when 73-year-old ESPN sportscaster Brent Musburger made a slew of comments -- on air -- about the beauty of 23-year-old Katherine Webb, the reigning Miss Alabama. He did this during Monday's national championship college football game between Alabama and Notre Dame; Webb is dating Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron and was in the stands for the game. Here's what he said when the cameras focused on Webb during the broadcast: ""...you see that lovely lady there? She does go to Auburn, I'll admit that, but she's also Miss Alabama, and that's A.J. McCarron's girlfriend. Wow, I'm telling ya, you quarterbacks, you get all the good-looking women. What a beautiful woman! Whoa! So if you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw it around the backyard with pops."" And boom! Cue the controversy. People attacked Musburger as ""creepy,"" for ogling her too much, for being a ""dirty old man,"" for being sexist, inappropriate, and more. One publication even went so far as to claim that Musburger's comments are ""evidence"" of ""a culture of domestic violence and sexual assault in football."" Katherine Webb: Media unfair to Musburger . The attacks on Musburger reached such a deafening crescendo that ESPN issued a statement: ""We apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far and Brent understands that."" I'm glad Brent understands it, because I don't. Can someone please explain to me where Musburger went too far? Musburger didn't imitate Howard Stern and evaluate Webb's physical attributes part by part so he could decide if she was attractive enough to pose for Playboy? Musburger didn't utter a truly creepy remark like Matt Lauer did when recently interviewing actress Anne Hathaway after her wardrobe malfunction and opening the interview with his comment: ""Seen a lot of you lately."" Musburger didn't continue with a running commentary of Webb's beauty during the telecast. He didn't abandon the announcer booth and run down to the stands in the hopes of getting a date with her. Nope, he just made a few comments about Ms. Webb's beauty in the span of 15 to 20 seconds. But in this day of instant outrage and instant access to social media to vent it, that was enough to create a media storm. News: Game? What game? There's a pretty woman in the stands . The only criticism that's arguably fair is Musburger's implication that if you are great quarterback, you will have earned a beautiful woman -- a reward, more than a human being. If that had been Musburger's intention, that, of course, would have been wrong. However, if you listen to the actual broadcast, you can clearly tell from Musburger's tone that that was not his point. C'mon, we all know the difference between when people are being playful and when they are being hateful. By objecting to mere playfulness, well-intentioned people are going to undermine their credibility when they latter offer criticism on issues that really are objectionable. And let's be brutally honest: If Musburger had been a 73-year-old woman and gushed over how handsome a 23-year-old man was, would there be any uproar at all? Of course not. But for those who still have issues with Musburger, maybe Webb's own comments on Wednesday morning's ""Today"" show will sway you: ""I think the media has been really unfair to [Musburger] ... If he would've said something along the line that we were hot or sexy or made any derogatory statements like that, I think that would've been a little bit different, but the fact that he said that we were beautiful and gorgeous, I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that."" And Webb's parents have even come to the defense of the sports announcer. Indeed, her father's comments to the media I think best sum up the entire situation: ""...he was trying to be complimentary, and I think they need to give Brent a break."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Brent Musburger commented on air that a player's girlfriend was ""lovely""
Dean Obeidallah asks: Why should ESPN have apologized for the remark?
Obeidallah: Would a 73-year-old woman be slammed for such a comment about a man?
He says overwrought critics hurt their credibility when a real outrage arises ."
"(CNN) -- Richard Rockefeller, son of philanthropist David Rockefeller and great-grandson of Standard Oil founder and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, was killed Friday in the crash of a single-engine plane in Westchester County, New York, a family representative and airport officials said. Rockefeller, 65, was the only one aboard the Piper PA-46-500TP Meridian aircraft when it crashed at 8:08 a.m. Friday less than a mile from takeoff at an airport near White Plains, airport manager Peter Scherrer said after the crash. He said the plane disappeared from radar and authorities lost contact with the pilot. At 8:23 a.m., police were notified that a plane had crashed in the hamlet of Purchase, missing a house by about 200 feet, Scherrer said. Rockefeller was headed to Portland, Maine, after flying into New York on Thursday for his father's 99th birthday, he said. Scherrer described Rockefeller as an experienced pilot and said the morning was foggy with a quarter-mile visibility. ""This is a terrible tragedy,"" the Rockefeller family said in a statement released by spokesman Fraser P. Seitel. ""The family is in shock. Richard was a wonderful and cherished son, brother, husband, father and grandfather. He was an experienced pilot and respected medical doctor. It is just horribly sad."" Rockefeller was a practicing physician in Portland until 2000, according to his biography posted on the Rockefeller Brothers Fund website, where he is listed as an advisory trustee. Rockefeller also taught medicine in Maine from 1982 until 2000, according to the website. He founded and was president of the Health Commons Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving American medicine, and he was chairman of the U.S. Advisory Board of Doctors Without Borders from 1989 until 2010. He had two grown children and resided in Falmouth, Maine. Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration are investigating at the crash site, and National Transportation Safety Board members were on the way to the scene, said Harrison, New York, Police Chief Anthony Marraccini. CNN's Leigh Remizowski contributed to this report.","Richard Rockefeller dies in crash of single-engine plane in Westchester County, New York .

"(CNN) -- The world economy may be bracing for another grim year, but political donors in the United States are breaking out their checkbooks to finance what is expected to be the most expensive presidential election in American history. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates $6 billion will be spent in the U.S. elections by campaigns, political parties and corporations hoping to propel their candidates into the White House and what writer Mark Twain once called the ""best Congress money can buy."" The projected price tag of the 2012 U.S. election dwarfs that of other nations, but corruption monitors from Transparency International (TI) say it's not just how much will be spent but where the money is coming from that threatens the integrity of politics around the world. United Kingdom . While the trajectory for spending in U.S. elections is soaring, total party spending in the 2010 general election in the United Kingdom was actually 26% less than in 2005. But despite the fact party spending dropped to $49 million, the absence of limits on the amount individuals or corporations can donate has contributed to the ongoing erosion of public confidence in the political process in the UK, according to one watchdog organization. ""When donors are making contributions exceeding Â£20,000 ($31,000) -- and some are making donations well over Â£250,000 ($390,000) -- it's perfectly understandable you don't give away that kind of money without expecting something in return,"" Chandu Krishnan, executive director of TI UK. In November 2011, a UK advisory body recommended increased public funding as one way to avoid future scandals and limit the influence of big donors in elections, but the three main political parties rejected the proposal. Norway . Krishnan, citing Scandinavia as a model, believes increased public funding would cut down party dependence on large donations and give the election system more credibility. In Norway, government funding accounted for 74% of political parties' income in 2010, according to Statistics Norway. And unlike in the U.S., where candidates and their supporters can buy as much television time as they can afford, political ads are banned from television and radio. India . Corruption monitors say the lack of public funding in India, the world's largest democracy, has contributed to a staggering influx of under the table corporate contributions to candidates that has undercut the integrity of recent elections. Intelligence reports received by India's Electoral Commission suggested that upwards of $2 billion in so-called ""black money"" will be spent to influence the Uttar Pradesh state elections this year, according to Anupama Jha, executive director of TI India. ""Everybody knows about black money,"" Jha told CNN. ""Corporations are expected to donate no more than 5 percent of their profits, but they pay more than that under the table. Those who donate funds also control the politicians, and the politicians (become) more accountable to their sponsors than to their constituents."" India's Electoral Commission told CNN it is committed to curbing the use of money power in elections. But it's not just corporate black money that's a problem, but the buying of votes in poor areas with hard cash, and sometimes with smuggled liquor. In the 2009 election in Tamil Nadu, a state with a population roughly the size of France, 33.4% of voters received money from candidates' supporters for their vote, according to a poll by India's Centre of Media Studies -- and in 2011, voters were lured to the polls with blenders, grinders and other household appliances. But Ja says there's a lack of political will to bring about fundamental change in politics in India. ""It's extremely difficult to get into politics if you don't grease somebody's palm,"" she said. ""This is why good people don't want to contest elections ... so ultimately you vote for corrupt people, because those are the only people you have to choose from."" Russia . Corruption monitors say the issue of big money in politics pales in comparison to the abuse of government resources by the United Russia party of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who announced on March 04 he had won Russia's presidential election, returning the former KGB officer to the office he held from 2000 to 2008. While there are no limitations on the amount U.S. political parties can spend on televison ads, broadcast time in Russia is doled out on a limited basis, and is proportionate to the results of the last election. But as opposition parties prepare ads to maximize a limited amount of television time, nightly news broadcasts on state-run channels are filled with stories of United Russia politicians repairing hospitals, or opening new underground rail stations -- officials benefitting politically from initiatives paid for with taxpayer money. ""There are two sets of rules in Russia -- one set for parties who are paying out of their own pockets, and another for the party and candidates with access to public resources,"" says Elena Panfilova, head of TI Russia. While opposition parties must finance campaign trips around the country during election season, incumbent politicians can campaign during official state-funded trips, according to Panfilova. Abuse of media and Russia's public resources may be time-tested tools of incumbents here, but that hasn't stopped United Russia from trying other ways to get a leg up on the competition. In November a crowd at a concert in Siberia rained down boos on veteran rock band Mashina Vremeni -- Time Machine in English -- when they were introduced by an emcee who announced that the concert was backed by United Russia and awarded them medals from the local governor. ""The parties try to hijack whatever they can hijack in Russia,"" Panfilova told CNN. Brazil . Another country where big money and elections go hand in hand is Brazil, Latin America's largest country and one of the world's fastest growing economies. Roughly $2 billion was spent by parties and candidates in the 2010 presidential election, according to Claudio Weber Abramo, executive director of TI Brazil. Nearly 98% of winner Dilma Rouseff's campaign donations -- and 95.5% of her main opponent's -- came from corporations, says Abramo. Abramo says corporations donated 99.04% of all money spent in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous state, during the 2010 election -- a reflection mainly of voters' apathy and politicians' failure to form relationships with their constituents. ""This is an enormous problem,"" Abramo told CNN. ""The distribution of money reveals something deeper in the Brazilian political landscape, which is that citizens are not very much concerned about supporting parties and having a political life."" While some observers want to ban corporate spending outright, Abramo says that will only make it harder to track corporate influence on politics in the country. ""The interests are still there even if you prohibit corporations from donating to candidates above the board,"" he told CNN. ""They will do it in a hidden way, and they will lose visibility."" Nigeria . While political finance watchdogs such as the Center for Responsive Politics monitor the amount of money spent during U.S. elections, a financial adviser for the International Foundation for Electoral Systems says no reliable information exists for how much money was spent during the 2011 presidential election in Nigeria. While Nigerian law gives the country's election commission the right to set a maximum spending limit for parties, the commission neglected to do so before the 2011 election, according to Magnus Ohman. ""Parties can do whatever they want, there's no limit to the amount they can spend,"" Ohman told CNN. ""Candidates do have limits, but the money they get from their parties is excluded from that limit."" While the 2011 elections were hailed as a step forward in Nigeria's evolution as a young democracy, the lack of restraint on political spending is a worrying development for election monitors. ""It really was an expensive election not only at a presidential level but also at the gubernatorial level, especially down in the south,"" said Ohman. ""It's an electoral system where you need to spend."" UK corruption monitor Chandu Krishnan says an ever-increasing amount of money in elections is a global problem. ""In many countries across the world, the cost of elections is increasing,"" he told CNN. ""If parties and politicians can't find the resources from the state, there is an increasing desperation to seek them from private sources -- and that is where the corruption comes in.""

"(CNN) -- Robert Plant has called reports of a Led Zeppelin tour ""rubbish,"" and now Richard Branson is doing the same. On his blog Wednesday, the Virgin Group founder said he's ""dazed and confused"" by rumors that he offered an $800 million (Â£500 million) contract to see Led Zeppelin re-form for a reunion tour. ""As much as I love the band, there is absolutely no truth to the story,"" Branson said. And despite what you may have heard, Virgin Atlantic isn't going to rename a plane ""and include a stairway to heaven"" in Led Zeppelin's honor, Branson added. ""However nice an idea, this is also completely untrue."" The report that Branson was involved in a Led Zeppelin reunion appeared in The Daily Mirror this week and claimed that Branson was eager to cart the band around in one of his jets as part of a tour that would hit London, Berlin and New Jersey. It was said that Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones were all in for the deal along with Jason Bonham, the son of the band's late drummer, John Bonham. The holdout, the Daily Mirror reported, was lead singer Robert Plant. ""Jimmy, John and Jason signed up immediately,"" a source told the paper. ""It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him."" ""Rubbish,"" was Plant's publicist's response to the story, which appears to have been removed from The Daily Mirror's website. Branson is taking it a step further. Not only is it untrue, he says in his blog post, but it diminishes the band members' current careers. ""Making up this story is very disrespectful to how wonderful (Robert Plant's) solo career with the Sensational Space Shifters is going,"" Branson said. ""He is setting out on a sold out tour today and they released a brilliant album last year. ... Robert told me he is very proud of his history and the band's past, and has always had great respect and love for his work throughout his career. However, he really believes he must move on with his life and career today."" Legends like Led Zeppelin are once-in-a-lifetime creators, but that doesn't mean they should be restricted to simply rehashing their old stuff; Page and Jones also have their own projects in the works, Branson pointed out. ""I'm proud of how so many artists from my generation, whether it is Led Zeppelin, Mike Oldfield or Peter Gabriel, are still being so creative and inventive,"" Branson said. ""As Robert told me: 'Look Richard, I just do things because I love them and I want to do more new things that I love.' I couldn't agree more.""

"(CNN) -- Bahrain lifted state of emergency laws Wednesday that had allowed for a crackdown on political leaders and journalists, but at the same time continued its crackdown on the country's major Shiite political opposition movement and stifled the latest street protests. It filed charges against four top opposition leaders in a move that could weaken the country's Al Wefaq party, according to two opposition sources. This came as King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa appealed for dialogue, saying that talks with opposition groups are scheduled to begin in July. The lifting of the emergency laws, imposed in mid-March, is thought to be an effort to signal an end to months of civil unrest stemming from the Arab Spring, a wave of anti-government demonstrations that started in Tunisia and have since roiled several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Egypt, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. But the announcement by the country's Information Affairs Authority followed one from the justice ministry the day before warning against ""any type of activities that could affect the security or harm the national peace and safety."" Meanwhile, protesters gathered across Bahrain, in locations including Aldiraz, Daih, Bani Jamrah, Karzakan, Abo Qowa, Duraz and Sitra, according to Nabeel Rajab, a prominent Bahraini human rights activist. Rajab said peaceful protesters were attacked by security forces with tear gas and rubber bullets, causing injuries but no deaths. The demonstrations were dispersed soon after they started, he said. The country is set to hold parliamentary elections in September, filling seats vacated by members of Al Wefaq, which left parliament in protest over the crackdown. The military prosecutor in Bahrain on Tuesday summoned four top Al Wefaq leaders and presented them with charges that could result in prison terms, the two opposition sources told CNN. The sources didn't know what the charges were. It is not clear whether those opposition leaders will be permitted to take part in the September elections. If someone faces charges, they can't run for election or travel out of the country. The four are Sheikh Ali Salman, Wefaq's leader, Abdul Khalil Jalil, the leader of Al Wefaq's parliament bloc, Khalil al-Marzooq, who once was deputy leader of that bloc, and another lawmaker whose identity was not available. Two other Al Wefaq members had already been detained and another is out of the country. One of the two is Matar Ebrahim Matar. Bahrain said he is being detained based on evidence provided to the courts, but one of his relatives told CNN that family members are not aware of any charges against Matar. Protesters initially took to the streets of Manama, the capital, to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy. But some have called for the removal of the royal family that has led the Persian Gulf state since the 18th century. Young members of the country's Shiite majority have staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, issues they say the country's Sunni rulers have done little to address. The government has since come under intense criticism by human rights groups over its detentions. Also last week, Bahrain said it had released 515 detainees imprisoned since the state of emergency went into effect. It is unclear how many people were in custody. Last week, the United States pulled its human rights officer from the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain after he became the target of a harassment campaign that senior American officials say appears to have been fanned by some hard-line members of the government. Ludovic Hood was for months the subject of threats and anti-Semitic slurs on a pro-government website and in state-sanctioned newspapers, the officials said. Hood was scheduled to leave the country this summer, as his tour of duty was coming to a close. But senior U.S. officials said the embassy sent him home several weeks early over concern for his safety.","The country lifts emergency laws imposed since mid-March .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A plane carrying senior government officials from Laos crashed Saturday in a province bordering Vietnam, authorities said. The country's National Assembly President, Pany Yathotou, was on board the Laos air force plane, which was carrying 18 people, according to Lt. Gen. Nipat Thonglek, a Thai defense spokesman. Yathotou is the first woman to hold that high office. Other high ranking officials were on board, including the Laotian defense minister, who was traveling with his wife, the spokesman said. A regional governor was also on board the plane, which crashed in Xiangkhouang province north of Laos. The group was traveling to take part in the memorial celebration of a historic battle. A Thai television station showed photos of a jungle site in flames and victims in military uniforms. In October, a Laos Airlines propeller plane flight crashed near the Mekong River, killing all 49 on board, after flying through remnants of Typhoon Nari.

"Rebel-controlled northern Syria (CNN) -- Mohamed Rashid walked out of the gate of his house with a giant blood stain on his white T-shirt. ""This is the blood of a martyr! Of a hero! Of a lion!"" he bellowed. ""This is his blood. It is pure!"" Mad with grief, Rashid kissed his bloody T-shirt before being led away by worried relatives. Just hours before, Rashid learned his son Abdul was killed in battle in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Housam Abdul Rashid was a 22-year-old defector from the army. He was also the fourth man from his small hilltop village to be killed fighting for the rebels. The younger Rashid is one of the casualties of the five-day-old rebel offensive on Aleppo, the country's commercial capital. Another rebel, who asked only to be named ""Khorshid"" because his wife and children were still living in Aleppo, described how his comrade was killed by a helicopter gunship, while climbing onto a rooftop. Syria: As al-Assad's grip loosens, what could come next? ""Housam's specialty was a sniper,"" Khorshid said. ""He went to the roof, and a helicopter gunship killed him. Another fighter from Aleppo with him was also killed. I was just 4 meters away when it happened."" Khorshid said the rebels mounted their offensive on Aleppo last Friday, two days after a bomb killed four of Syria's top security officials. Rebel commanders and fighters claimed they made gains, particularly in the neighborhood of Salahuddin. But they were also clearly suffering casualties. What began 17 months ago as a peaceful protest movement has evolved into a full-fledged armed insurgency. Rebels bracing for showdown in Aleppo . Countless rebel battalions with names like ""Shield of Idlib Battalion"" and ""Freedom Brigade"" have emerged, as well as military rebel councils in large towns and cities. The rebel militias are composed in large part of defector soldiers. But there are also many civilians, including students, shopkeepers, real-estate agents, and even members of President Bashar al-Assad's ruling Ba'ath party. Ahmed Habib spent a decade working as a bureaucrat with the Aleppo branch of the Ba'ath party. But eight months after joining the rebels, he was now dressed in improvised military fatigues, carrying a Belgian-made Fabrique Nationale assault rifle slung over his shoulder. ""We wished to have a new democracy when Bashar al-Assad became president,"" he said, when asked about his years of Ba'ath party service. ""We wished to have freedom for the people, but that never happened. We just got new cars and computers. It's ... nothing,"" he cursed in English. A Syrian town's 'Street of Death' ""We tell Bashar al-Assad, very soon we will be in Damascus, in the president's palace, we promise that,"" Habib said. ""He has to hear that and he has to leave, otherwise we will kill him."" Habib was now bivouacked in a village school in Syria's Idlib province which had been converted into a barracks for rebels from the Syrian Falcons Brigade. The group's leader, Mustafa Abdullah, claimed to lead 600 men. Though he insisted all of his fighters were Syrians, at least one armed man introduced himself to CNN as a citizen of Turkey. Fighters were heard telling the Turk not to speak to journalists in Turkish. Meanwhile, residents of the village where the Syrian Falcons were headquartered said there were fighters of several North African nationalities also serving with the brigade's ranks. A volunteer Libyan fighter has also told CNN he intends to travel from Turkey to Syria within days to add a ""platoon"" of Libyan fighters to armed movement. Though there are some foreign volunteers, it is clear the bulk of the fighters are Syrians. Every day, it appears there are new volunteers. One of the newest recruits is Soukrot Amin, a 23-year-old native of Aleppo, who was determined to start his own rebel group. Amin smuggled himself across the Turkish border to Syria on Sunday, carrying a bag full of walkie-talkies, sniper scopes and novelty spy cameras disguised as watches and car keys -- all tools for his rebel cell. He said he bought the devices with savings earned after spending five months working as a car mechanic in the United Arab Emirates. ""I go to war for my family, for my country,"" Amin said. ""Because (Assad) has killed everyone. He killed my cousin. He destroyed my village. He destroyed my home."" Photos: Massacre in Syria . The young volunteer said he had a list of around 40 recruits for his group. He said he had only 15 weapons for his group. But Amin added that upon arrival in Aleppo, he planned to apply to a group in Turkey calling itself the High Revolutionary Council for weapons to arm his fighters. ""We will win,"" Amin said. The veteran fighter named Khorshid had no illusions that the fight for Aleppo would be easy. He choked back tears after burying his slain friend Housam Abdul Rashid on Tuesday. But then he swore to return to the battle in Aleppo, within a matter of hours. ""Tonight,"" Khorshid said. ""We must fight Bashar al-Assad, because if not, he will kill us.""

"(CNN) -- With lights, floats and flying, Russia kicked off the opening ceremony in Sochi as the world turns its attention to the costliest Olympic Games in history. Spectators from all over the world watched the introduction of athletes that marked the official start of the Winter Olympics. Light shows and music, lots of it, filled the air, starting at exactly 8:14 p.m. local time, or 20:14 in military time. ""Most of the ceremony focuses heavily on Russian classical music,"" said Konstantin Ernst, the main creative producer of the ceremony. ""Unfortunately, unlike London, we cannot boast a plethora of famous world-known pop performers. This is why we are now focusing on what Russia is best known for musically around the world; namely, classical music."" The celebration opened with a dream sequence of a little girl, who imagined all of the letters in the Russian alphabet, each letter recalling a Russian writer, artist or landmark. Then the girl, rigged with wires, flew into the air and floated dreamlike over floats that depicted Russian landscapes. The athletes followed. Despite anxiety about terror strikes, controversy over gay rights and ridicule for poor preparations, the nation's officials have maintained that the sites in Sochi are secure. It will be ""the safest place on Earth during the Olympics,"" said Dmitry Chernyshenko, head of the Games. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who pushed the International Olympic Committee to hold the Games in the nation, attended the ceremony. The opening ceremony was the only event scheduled for the day. About 40,000 people watched from the stands at Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi. Russian classical music star Anna Netrebko performed the Olympic anthem. A day before, high excitement marked qualification events in the men's and women's slopestyle, women's moguls and team figure skating. SECURITY . Russia has drafted 37,000 police and security officers to handle security in Sochi, but that has not done much to assuage fears. Turkish hijacking: A Turkish jetliner signaled a hijacking and landed in Istanbul on Friday after a passenger said a bomb was on board and told crew members to take the plane to Sochi, Turkish officials said. A suspect is reportedly in custody, and authorities are searching the plane for explosives. Toothpaste terror: A day after the United States warned of how explosive materials could be concealed in toothpaste or cosmetic tubes, its government Thursday temporarily banned all liquids, gels, aerosols and powders in carry-on luggage on flights between the United States and Russia. U.S. partnership: U.S. authorities are working with Russia and other countries to try to disrupt several possible threats, including the toothpaste tube concern, a U.S. intelligence source said Thursday. The threats vary in credibility, and the biggest one traces to the group Imarat Kavkaz in Russia, which has publicly said its followers will try to disrupt the Games, the official said. ""The threat stream is credible, I think it's real,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. Private protection: The U.S. ski and snowboarding team has hired a private security firm, Global Rescue, to provide protection. It's not clear how much the firm could do in the event of a major incident when Russian forces will be in charge. But it has been gathering intelligence on the ground and will provide an extra layer of protection as athletes travel around. Ships for safety: Two U.S. Navy ships have steamed into the Black Sea, where they will be ready to help if any mass evacuation of U.S. citizens is needed. U.S. security officials are working with their Russian counterparts to keep the Games safe against the backdrop of a regional separatist movement that has threatened to use terrorism at the Olympic Games. Targets of threats: Americans are not the only ones who are jittery. Austria said two of its female athletes had been the target of specific threats. Austrian media reported that an anonymous letter was sent warning Alpine skier Bernadette Schild and skeleton racer Janine Flock they could be kidnapped. We've heard it before: It's not the first time security issues have dominated the buildup to the Olympics. Britain parked missile batteries on apartment block roofs and a warship on the River Thames before the 2012 Games. The Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 were held amid heightened security only months after the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States. And in 1996, the Summer Games in Atlanta were subject to a terror attack. PREPARATIONS . When Russia bid to host its first Winter Olympics in 2007, a document quoted an expected cost of around $12 billion. That figure has ballooned to around $50 billion. That's more than four times over budget and surpasses the cost of Beijing's 2008 Summer Games -- making it the most expensive Olympics ever, summer or winter. Russia had less than seven years to transform what was a fairly low-key seaside resort town into a Winter Olympics venue. The project required staggering feats of engineering in building a new freeway and rail link up a mountain, and a ski resort on the top. And yet questions about Sochi's readiness have dogged the final run-up to the Games. Not quite there: While the sports facilities were completed in good time, journalists and others arrived in Sochi this week to find that some of the 40,000 new hotel rooms were far from ready and that construction workers were still hard at work on parts of the Olympic Park. Thanks to pictures of chaotic scenes posted on Twitter, Russia's pride has not been spared. But CNN's Ben Wyatt in Sochi reports that the picture is not all bad. His hotel has been ""superb,"" and staff and Games volunteers are clearly making an effort to be helpful and speak English, he said. While some media hotels and landscaping projects have not been completed on time, the sporting venues all look to be in very good condition, he said. PROTESTS . Every Olympics has protests. But thanks to social media, Russia is facing a global backlash. What got many people riled was Russian lawmakers' passage last summer of legislation known as the anti-gay propaganda bill. The law makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. Open letter: More than 200 writers from around the world signed an open letter published Thursday in the UK newspaper The Guardian, calling for a repeal of laws that have placed a ""chokehold"" on the right to free expression in Russia. ""As writers and artists, we cannot stand quietly by as we watch our fellow writers and journalists pressed into silence or risking prosecution and often drastic punishment for the mere act of communicating their thoughts,"" the letter said. Designated site: There is a designated protest site in Sochi. But there's been criticism of organizers' decision to tuck it away in a hard-to-reach village 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the main Olympic Park. More protests may be yet to come -- perhaps even by athletes -- despite an Olympic Charter rule that bans demonstrations in any Olympic sites and other areas. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Zain Asher, Carol Jordan, Michael Martinez, Jake Tapper, Evan Perez and Paul Cruickshank contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect reportedly in custody in Turkey after jet bomb threat, desire to fly to Sochi .

"(CNN) -- There are stories you just wish weren't true, and for me, a mom of two young girls, this is one of them: media outlets counting the days until Kendall Jenner, one of the youngest members of the Kardashian clan, turns 18. The celebrity site TMZ posted a photo last week -- a very revealing one, at that -- of Jenner in short shorts and a bikini, with this headline: ""Kendall Jenner 53 Days."" Hmmm -- 53 days until what? A new TV gig? A new modeling contract? Until she announces college plans? Oh no, my friends. Below the headline and the supremely sexy photo was this: ""Until she turns 18. Not that we're counting."" It wasn't just TMZ. Another celeb site, HollywoodLife, tweeted the same photo and added this: ""To all those wondering, Kendall Jenner turns 18 in 52 days."" I wasn't wondering -- were you? And here's the thing: Something just doesn't feel quite right about the whole concept of a countdown for a young woman about to turn the age when she's legally viewed as an adult -- even a young woman like Jenner, who has spent much of her life on reality TV. No matter how much Jenner and her attention-seeking family pursue the national spotlight, and no matter how much Kardashian critics might question my spending time on this at all -- this story, let me be clear, is not about Kendall Jenner. It is about a child. Kylie and Kendall: Growing up Kardashian . After all, while no one is specifically indicating to what everyone is counting down, one can assume it's not that Jenner will soon be able to vote for the first time. ""Maybe they are counting down the days until she is legally responsible for her decisions,"" said Dorothy Liu, a mom of a 10-year-old girl, on my personal Facebook page. If only that were the case! Too hot for tweens: Why some parents dread back-to-school shopping . ""There is a countdown clock waiting for a girl to turn 18 so they can (ogle) her more inappropriately then they already do,"" Jodi Ferich said on CNN's Facebook page. ""I think its a valid question about the appropriateness of waiting for a young lady to age so you can objectify her as a sex object."" ""I believe it's not fair game to count down to her being 18,"" said a reader via e-mail in response to a request for comments on CNN's Facebook page, adding that it can be looked at as ""perverted, disgusting and just plain wrong."" ""Anyone who is watching this countdown waiting for this child to turn 18 needs a mental evaluation. 18 is still a CHILD in every way,"" said Krista Dawn Savoury, also on CNN's Facebook page. ""Is nothing off limits?"" said Sharon Rowley, a blogger and mom of six. ""Yes, I know her family has 'sold out.' "" Opinion: For strong daughters, stop with the sex stereotypes . It is that last point -- how her family has embraced the media in every way possible -- that led many others to believe counting down until Jenner turns 18 seems entirely appropriate. ""Jenner is part of the Kardashian clan and they live for the camera,"" said Joni Hudson-Reynolds, a blogger, via e-mail. ""They court the spotlight and when you make the choice to live this way, you live with the consequences, and know the consequences will be taped."" Jodi Jill, a celebrity columnist in Los Angeles, questions ""why all the eyebrow raising."" ""This would be different if the ladies didn't want this kind of attention, but they do,"" Jill said. ""That's not to say this doesn't go too far, but if it was inappropriate like everyone is screaming about, the Jenner clan would have already stopped it. One call from a concerned mom (better known as Kris Jenner) would have pulled it down."" Sadly, this is not the first time there's been a public countdown until a celeb turns the legal age. Years before Mary-Kate and Ashley Oslen turned 18, a number of Internet sites popped up, counting down the years, months and days until the big day. And it's not just a sexualization-of-girls thing. There was also a countdown until Justin Bieber reached the big one-eight, although one might argue this ogling until teens are ""jailbait no more"" seems to happen more for young women than young men. We know our kids grown up faster than ever, and we see that evidence just about everywhere we look, from the clothing options for our tweens and teens to the way their role models (or former role models) present themselves (think Miley Cyrus!) to the concerns about the photos they're sending each other online. Adult-inspired lingerie marketed for young girls . That said, can't we expect or demand that, as Sharon Rowley said, certain things should be completely off limits? Beth Engelman, a mom of one and co-host of the blog Mommy on a Shoestring, said, ""I don't care for that family but ... still shame on TMZ for perpetuating the sexualization of this child."" Like Engelman, I don't quite get why there is such a fascination with this family. So why is this story news? Because it seems, at least to me, completely outrageous to count down until a young woman turns 18, almost implying that once her 18th birthday approaches, she is fair game for sexual exploitation and objectification. As one reader said, ""To be glorifying it is just wrong and teaches the wrong idea to people who don't have common sense."" Or morals. Or respect for women.

"(CNN) -- Canada will stop processing visa applications from foreign nationals who have visited West African nations with large outbreaks of the Ebola virus, Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander said Friday. Applications will be returned to people from Ebola hot spots who have already applied for visas, officials said in a press release. The changes do not affect Canadians currently in West Africa, the press release said. Health care workers in West Africa will be permitted to travel back to Canada. The action is similar to that taken by Australia several days ago. ""Our number one priority is to protect Canadians,"" Alexander said. ""We continue to work with domestic and international partners to aid efforts to respond to the outbreak in West Africa, while strengthening our domestic preparedness here at home."" Also on Friday, the United Nations Ebola coordinator said it's not necessary to quarantine people merely because they come from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea. ""People do not need to be quarantined unless they have come into contact with people have Ebola or unless they have symptoms,"" said Dr. David Nabarro, U.N. system coordinator on Ebola. Nabarro expressed cautious optimism about the apparent slowing of the rate of infection in Liberia, saying the numbers ""look quite exciting right now."" But Nabarro put two caveats on his statement, saying that authorities ""do not always have timely production of full data,"" and warning that ""reduction in the rate of increase does not mean that the outbreak is under control. .... The outbreak ends when the last case of Ebola has been treated."" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power arrived in New York City on Thursday after a trip to West Africa and praised Cuba for sending health care workers to fight Ebola. ""I have to commend Cuba for sending 265 medical professionals ... and they are sending another 200 on top of that 265,"" she said at a press conference on Friday. Power tweets picture of her airport Ebola screening . Power said only a few countries have truly committed to fighting Ebola. ""A few countries have done a lot, and a much larger number of countries have done very little,"" she said. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said Friday that 83 contacts with Spanish Ebola patient Teresa Romero Ramo have completed the 21-day follow-up period for the virus incubation with no new cases reported. Spain needs to complete a 42-day period that started on October 21, when Romero tested negative for a second time, before the country can be declared free of the virus, if no new case is reported, according to the WHO. 9 ways travelers are handling Ebola anxiety . A total of 4,951 people have died from the Ebola virus and there have been 13,567 cases in eight countries since the outbreak began, the WHO said in a statement Friday. The figures are current up to October 29. The number of probable and suspected cases are from six affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States) and two previously affected countries (Senegal and Nigeria), the WHO said. Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone remain the worst affected countries, with 13,540 cases and 4,941 deaths attributed to the virus. A total of 523 healthcare are known to be infected and 269 have died, according to the WHO. Meanwhile, there is a separate and unrelated Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo where there have been 66 cases of infection and a total of 49 people have died as of October 28, the WHO said.

"(CNN) -- With no end in sight for the Syrian civil war, it's mostly grim pictures that come out from the country. Yet a group of artists in the capital, Damascus, have created a colorful, vibrant piece of work that is seen as a symbol of hope in the war-ravaged nation -- and setting a Guinness world record as well. In January, Moaffak Makhoul and his team of six artists completed a mural made of assorted scrap -- broken mirrors, ceramics pieces, soft-drink cans, pipes, cooking utensils, bicycle wheels and car parts. Guinness World Records announced on their Facebook page in late March that the multicolor artwork, measuring 720 square meters (7,750 square feet), is the world's largest mural made of recycled materials. ""In the difficult conditions that the country is going through,"" lead artist Makhoul told Reuters. ""We wanted to give a smile to the people, joy to the children, and show people that the Syrian people love life, love beauty, love creativity."" They started working on the mural in October 2013. The artists scoured the materials themselves, but they got some help too. Local housewives donated bits and pieces of things that they would otherwise throw away. Many people came from war zones to give their house keys or other personal objects to the artists. The mural wall runs along a key motorway through the center of Damascus, in the upscale neighborhood of Al Mazzeh. The work was completed two months before the third anniversary of the Syrian conflict. The vibrant outdoor artwork has brought people out onto the street, giving them a chance to enjoy art, bringing more sense of normalcy to their life -- and perhaps even easing some pressures.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Seventy-five former professional football players are suing the National Football League, saying the league knew as early as the 1920s of the harmful effects of concussions on players' brains but concealed the information from players, coaches, trainers and others until June 2010. The players ""did not know the long-term effects of concussions"" and relied on the NFL to protect them, the suit says. The lawsuit also names as a defendant the football equipment maker Riddell Inc., which has been the official NFL helmet brand since 1989. ""For decades, defendants have known that multiple blows to the head can lead to long-term brain injury, including memory loss, dementia, depression and (chronic traumatic encephalopathy) and its related symptoms,"" says the 86-page lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Tuesday. ""This action arises from the defendants' failure to warn and protect NFL players such as plaintiffs against the long-term brain injury risks associated with football-related concussions. This action arises because the NFL defendants committed negligence by failing to exercise its duty to enact league-wide guidelines and mandatory rules regulating post-concussion medical treatment and return-to-play standards for players who suffer a concussion and/or multiple concussions."" NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday night that the league had not seen a copy of the suit but would ""vigorously contest any claims of this kind."" Riddell declined to comment, issuing a statement saying only, ""We have not yet review(ed) the complaint, but it is our policy to not comment on pending litigation."" NFL to require sideline test after head blows . The 75 former players accuse the NFL of engaging in ""a scheme of fraud and deceit"" by having members of the NFL's Brain Injury Committee ""deny knowledge of a link between concussion and cognitive decline and claim that more time was needed to reach a definitive conclusion on the issue."" ""When the NFL's Brain Injury Committee anticipated studies that would implicate causal links between concussion and cognitive degeneration it promptly published articles producing contrary findings, although false, distorted and deceiving, as part of the NFL's scheme to deceive Congress, the players and the public at large,"" the suit says. ""The defendants acted willfully, wantonly, egregiously, with reckless abandon, and with a high degree of moral culpability,"" the former players charge in court documents. The suit notes that in 1994, the NFL studied concussion research through funding the NFL Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury. The committee's published findings in 2004 showed ""no evidence of worsening injury or chronic cumulative effects"" from multiple concussions, the suit says. In addition, in a related study, the committee found that ""many NFL players can be safely allowed to return to play"" on the day of a concussion, if they are without symptoms and cleared by a doctor. However, ""it was not until June 2010 that the NFL acknowledged that concussions can lead to dementia, memory loss, CTE and related symptoms by publishing (a) warning to every player and team,"" says the suit. ""The NFL-funded study is completely devoid of logic and science. More importantly, it is contrary to their (the NFL's) Health and Safety Rules as well as 75 years of published medical literature on concussions,"" according to the suit, which asks for a jury trial and damages. Even when the warning was issued, the NFL did not warn any past players, including the plaintiffs, or the public of ""the long-term brain injury caused by concussions,"" the suit says. ""By failing to exercise its duty to enact reasonable and prudent rules to protect players against the risks associated with repeated brain trauma, the NFL's failure to exercise its independent duty has led to the deaths of some, and brain injuries of many other former players, including plaintiffs,"" the lawsuit says. Film aims to show NFL's culture of playing on . Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a degenerative, dementia-like brain disease linked to repeated brain trauma. The disease has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players studied at the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy as of May. They include former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson, 50, who shot himself in the chest in February, leaving behind a note requesting that his brain be donated for study. His widow, Alicia, said Wednesday that she had mixed emotions about the lawsuit. The Duersons weren't part of the lawsuit, according to court documents. ""I truly believe the NFL must have known on some level because there were always doctors present, you know, with these guys,"" Alicia Duerson said. ""But I guess the other part of me is saying the 12 families who have lost their loved ones and their husbands or father that did have CTE, I feel like we're the families who they probably needed to help in this lawsuit as well. ""Dave would approve of it, I think, because he did want his brain donated, and he felt there was a problem with his brain, and he felt because of all the blows he took to his head that it caused him to have this problem,"" she said. ""So David sacrificed his brain so they could research and develop and get better safety procedures and stuff like that for the NFL and for future football players. ""The final days of his life, it was very difficult for him because he was such a brilliant man, and he was very gifted, and for him to forget simple things like directions or having to write things down constantly and reminders for himself ... he was aggravated a lot,"" she said. Former NFL player suffered from brain disease . Another player who showed signs of brain damage was former NFL defensive lineman Shane Dronett, who committed suicide at age 38 in 2009. His family said this year that Dronett's symptoms, which began in 2006, included bad dreams that eventually came nearly nightly, along with fear, paranoia and episodes of confusion and rage. A wide variety of information on the subject -- including the first case of ""punch-drunk"" boxers, published in 1928 -- has been available to the league over the decades, the suit alleges. In June 2007, the NFL scheduled a concussion summit because of congressional scrutiny and media pressure, the suit says. ""Unfortunately, the NFL in keeping with its scheme of fraud and deceit issued a pamphlet to players in August 2007, which stated: 'there is no magic number for how many concussions is too many,'"" the suit says. During hearings by the House Judiciary Committee in October 2009, U.S. Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-California, ""analogized the NFL's denial of a causal link between NFL concussion and cognitive decline to the tobacco industry's denial of the link between cigarette consumption and ill health effects,"" the lawsuit says. A brain with chronic traumatic encephalopathy contains dense clumps of a protein called tau, which is associated with repeated head traumas -- concussions or subconcussive hits -- that are not allowed to heal. The disease can also diminish brain tissue and is associated with memory loss, depression, impulsive behavior and rage. The NFL was founded as the American Professional Football Association in 1920 and changed to its current name in 1922, the suit says. By 1924, there were 23 franchises in the league, court documents say. In 1970, the American Football League, which operated from 1960 to 1969, merged with the NFL. The lawsuit didn't specify a monetary figure for compensatory and punitive damages.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Responding angrily to a campaign ad from Newt Gingrich accusing him of being anti-immigrant, Mitt Romney insisted during last week's Republican debate at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville that he has no problem with immigrants. Perhaps not. But the dishonest and cynical way in which the former governor of Massachusetts has dealt with the immigration issue on the campaign trail shows that he has a problem being consistent. In Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Romney attacked Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich for immigration proposals that Romney said amounted to ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants. But last week, in Florida, where Hispanics account for 22.5 percent of the population, we caught a glimpse of a kinder and gentler Romney. He told the Hispanic Leadership Network, a center-right group, that he would create a ""temporary worker permit"" for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. However, Romney said, when the permit expires, workers wouldn't be forced to leave the United States. Instead, they would decide their next move themselves depending on their job prospects. His hope is that, at this point, many illegal immigrants would simply ""self-deport."" Good luck with that. Like former Wyoming Sen. Al Simpson used to say: ""There is nothing more permanent than a temporary worker."" People fall in love. They get married. They have children. And it becomes harder to remove them, even if we wanted to. Besides, it's not clear that Romney wants to remove anyone. The idea of voluntary deportation is absurd. I bet none of this is going over very well with the voters in the first three primary states who cast their lots for Romney, thinking he was going to be tough on illegal immigration only to find out that he doesn't even have the stomach to forcibly deport undocumented immigrants. Maybe Romney should ask President Barack Obama for pointers. The Obama administration has deported more than 1.2 million illegal immigrants and offers no apologies. Meanwhile, in a telenovela unique to the Florida primary, a group of Latinos who supports Romney called on Gingrich to yank a commercial labeling the frontrunner ""anti-immigrant."" A similar request came from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who while not endorsing Romney, defended him against the charge that he was anti-immigrant. Who does Rubio think he is? His own history with the immigration issue is spotty at best. In 2011, Rubio joined Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas in his efforts to require businesses to participate in a government-run ""e-verify"" program which is supposed to tell them if a Social Security number is authentic. Rubio also supports the Arizona immigration law -- and presumably others like it around the country -- which forces local and state law officials to enforce federal immigration statutes. In addition, he opposes the DREAM Act, which would give legal status to illegal immigrants who go to college or serve in the military because he considers it ""part of some broader effort to grant blanket amnesty."" Last week, in a good speech to the Hispanic Leadership Network, Rubio acknowledged that many Republicans -- including himself -- have been slow to condemn anti-immigrant rhetoric from other Republicans. Still, I don't care what Rubio says. Romney has, in this campaign, advanced a tone that is ""anti-immigrant."" It was Romney who -- bringing back a tactic he used in 2008 against Arizona Sen. John McCain -- painted Rick Perry as soft on illegal immigration. Romney attacked Perry for signing a bill in the Lone Star State that allowed undocumented students to attend state colleges and universities and pay in-state tuition rates. The narrative that Romney pushed was simple: ""Illegal immigrants are takers. They take advantage of in-state tuition rates. They take spots in university campuses that should go to U.S. citizens. They take, take, and take some more."" Never did Romney mention all that illegal immigrants contribute to society -- by paying taxes, increasing productivity, creating competition, and doing jobs that Americans won't do. Later, with Perry vanquished into the single digits, Romney used the same line of attack against Gingrich, accusing him of advocating a kind of amnesty for illegal immigrants after Gingrich said that he wanted to provide undocumented workers with a ""red card"" that allowed them to work legally in the country. Romney accused Gingrich of letting illegal immigrants take jobs from American workers. Now as he competes this week for Hispanic votes in Florida -- and, on Feb 4, in Nevada, where Latinos account for 26.5 percent of the population -- Romney must be hoping that Latinos have bad memories. We don't. We never forget a slight. And, in that respect, Romney has given us plenty to remember. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- It's one of the more unusual places to hold a fashion show: the United Nations. The global hub for peace and security opened its doors to ambassadors and fashionistas alike Monday night when Ambassador Riyad Mansour, head of the Palestinian permanent observer mission to the U.N., hosted Palestinian-Italian fashion designer Jamal Taslaq. The runway was quite literally brought to the bargaining table. Models strutted their gowns across the same surface on which resolutions are passed, and where environmentalists gather to sort out climate issues. This cultural event, however, was not immune to the conflict and fighting that so many other United Nations meetings are centered around. As violence between Palestinians and Israelis goes on for weeks -- with serious tension in the holy city of Jerusalem -- Ron Prosor, Israeli ambassador to the U.N., blasted the Palestinian delegation hours before the show for not condemning the acts of violence back in the Middle East. ""The Palestinian authority is glorifying terrorists and celebrating attacks on Jews and Israelis nearly every day. And where is the Palestinian delegation? Have they found the time to condemn these attacks? Of course not. You see, they have a very important function to attend this evening. A fashion show,"" Prosor said. ""The Palestinian delegation is off to a fashion show, because, after all, they are experts in dressing up and disguising the truth every day,"" he added. Mansour fought back with more words after the show. ""This is a racist remark, as if we, the Palestinians, cannot be a part of humanity to share the rest of humanity and the rest of the international community our creativity in the field of fashion,"" Mansour said. The unveiling of Taslaq's latest fall-winter collection was inspired by Palestine, his home country, the designer said. The fabrics themselves donned elements of peace and conflict: garments featured wood from olive branches brought from Palestine to Taslaq's studio in Italy as well as embroideries -- a classic Palestinian design heritage -- made by Palestinian refugees. Despite the current tension in the Middle East, which has spanned multiple weeks, both Mansour and Taslaq said they believe that fashion and design can play a role in promoting peace. ""Music has a role, fashion has a role, cinema has a role, intellectuals have a role, parliamentarians, politicians, diplomats -- all of it,"" Mansour said. Fashion, Taslaq says, is a ""message for peace."" ""I think fashion, like music, doesn't need the language. All the world can hear and watch the fashion,"" he added. ""And this is a message for all the world.""","Fashion was in fashion at the U.N., with a show by a designer .

"Washington (CNN) -- A group of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents is going to court, saying new Obama administration directives on removing illegal immigrants could put them in violation of federal law. Ten ICE agents filed a lawsuit Thursday in federal court in Dallas against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and ICE Director John Morton. The organization NumbersUSA, with it's self-proclaimed stance of ""for lower immigration,"" quickly claimed a stake in the suit, saying on its website that it was ""financing the effort"" of the agents' suit. NumbersUSA also emphasized on its site that Kris Kobach, the Republican Kansas secretary of state who worked on Arizona's controversial immigration law and is an informal adviser to presumed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, is representing the suing agents. The suit cites Obama administration decisions to allow young people brought to the U.S. before the age of 16 who meet certain criteria to apply for a two-year relief period in which they couldn't be deported. The complaint also objects to the policy of ""prosecutorial discretion,"" in which ICE agents are supposed to focus their attention on dangerous criminals who are illegal immigrants. In a nutshell, the agents do not want to obey the new policies and do not want to face any disciplinary actions or lawsuits if they continue to arrest any type of immigrant who is in the United States illegally. Undocumented immigrants line up for relief from deportation . ""We are federal law enforcement officers who are being ordered to break the law. This directive puts ICE agents and officers in a horrible position,"" Chris Crane, one of the agents filing suit and the president of the ICE agents and oficers union, said, according to a news release posted on the NumbersUSA said. Matt Chandler, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, responded, ""DHS uses prosecutorial discretion to assist in focusing vigorously on the removal of individuals who are convicted criminals, repeat immigration law violators, and recent border-crossers."" Chandler said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals decision is a temporary measure until Congress takes action on reforming immigration policies and that it ""ensures that responsible young people, who are Americans in every way but on paper, have an opportunity to remain in the country and make their fullest contribution."" The DHS spokesman also said that in fiscal year 2011 ICE removed 216,000 criminal illegal immigrants, a figure Chandler said is the largest in history and an 89% increase over the administration of President George W. Bush. The Obama administration announced in June it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they meet certain requirements. Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military can get a two-year deferral from deportation, . Supporters stress it does not grant immunity or a provide a shortcut to citizenship but affords undocumented immigrant children a chance to be productive workers -- with a promise they won't be deported for two years. Opponents see the policy as granting backdoor amnesty to people who came to America illegally and tightening an already poor job market for young Americans. As many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, a project of the Pew Research Center. The deferred deportation policy includes some of the provisions of a Democratic proposal called the DREAM Act that failed to win enough Republican support to become law. In this year's presidential election, Latino votes are critical in several battleground states, including Florida and Nevada. On Thursday, several members of Congress came out in support of the ICE agents' suit. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the administration's policies are ""having a very negative effect on our immigration law enforcement officers' ability to secure America's border and defend the rule of law."" Undocumented students in their own words . ""ICE agents should enforce our immigration laws and apprehend illegal immigrants,"" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. ""But the Obama administration makes it impossible for ICE agents to do their jobs.""

"(CNN) -- Costa Rican President Oscar Arias has been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus, commonly known as the swine flu, the government said in a televised statement on Tuesday. Oscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, has contracted the H1N1 virus. Arias fell ill on Sunday, complaining of a sore throat and temperature, Presidential Minister Rodrigo Arias said. A doctor's visit on Tuesday revealed that the president had the H1N1 virus, cases of which had been reported earlier in the Costa Rican capital of San Jose. The president's overall health was good, but following his doctor's advice, he will rest at his home until Sunday, Rodrigo Arias said. The president is expected to return to work on Monday, the minister said. As of Friday, there were 718 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus in Costa Rica, and the virus has been blamed for 27 deaths, according to a report by the country's ministry of health. A majority of the confirmed cases -- 480 -- were in San Jose. Arias, 67, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for helping bring an end to Central America's civil wars. More recently, he acted as mediator between two feuding sides claiming the leadership of Honduras.","President Oscar Arias has been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus, government says .

"(CNN) -- There's been plenty of talk about the gender pay gap in recent days after speculation that recently fired New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson was let go after speaking up about possible pay disparity between her and the previous executive editor, Bill Keller. In response to that talk, the New York Times publisher, in a lengthy statement over the weekend, said Abramson's total ""pay package,"" which included stock and other compensation in addition to salary, was ""comparable"" to Keller's and was, in fact, more than 10% higher during Abramson's last year, and that her removal was due to her management of the newsroom, nothing else. Until we hear Abramson's side of the story, it remains unclear what role, if any, an alleged pay gap played in her fate. What is clear is how outraged women were hearing that the Times' first woman executive editor could be making less than the last male executive editor. It was another reminder, to many women, that the income gap is alive and well. But if one city gets its way, that disparity between what men and women earn will become a thing of the past. Boston has pledged to become the first city in the country to eliminate the gender pay gap. It's certainly a lofty goal: How on Earth will Beantown make it happen? OPINION: Don't believe the hype: In real world, women still make less than men . On Monday, at a White House regional conference on working families in Boston, administration officials along with members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, including Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, joined business leaders and academics, to tout the city's ambitious plan and what it will take to succeed. The event is one of several this spring leading up to a summit with President Obama at the end of June at the White House. ""What's really significant is that Boston recognizes that this isn't just an issue of fairness and isn't just an issue of equity as a moral value,"" said Betsey Stevenson, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, in an interview. ""This is about competitiveness and having a competitive advantage."" Women make up about half the labor force but will soon represent more than half of the highly educated labor force, said Stevenson, who will be speaking at the Boston conference. ""That's why it becomes an issue of competitiveness. The amount of talent that is in that other half that you're ignoring is relevant and when you have a lot of the talent in that other half, ignoring it is going to become even more costly over time,"" said Stevenson, who is currently on leave from her position as associate professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan. Making Boston the 'premier city for working women' Last year, then Boston Mayor Thomas Menino pledged to make Boston the ""premier city for working women."" He created a Women's Workforce Council, made up of leaders in academia and the public and private sectors. Victoria A. Budson, executive director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School, is a member of the council. ""When you make a city good for women, you raise the economic profile of that city. You are going to retain talent,"" said Budson. Women outnumber men in Boston at 52% of the population, according to a report by the Women's Workforce Council. The city also has the largest proportion of young women between the ages of 20 and 34 of any major city, and has a higher percentage of college educated women than any other metro area. And yet, the city has a significant pay gap, although it's lower than the national average. In 2011, working female residents of Boston earned 83% of what male residents in Boston earned, according to the report. Nationwide, women earn 77 cents for every dollar men make. Boston is asking companies to voluntarily sign a compact committing to take steps to reduce the wage gap. About 50 companies, including some of the city's biggest employers such as Raytheon and State Street, have signed it. The council's report includes 33 different ""interventions"" companies can take to close the wage gap, from evaluating why mothers and non-mothers leave their businesses to standardizing compensation including bonuses to actively recruiting women to executive level and board positions. ""We've made it easy,"" said Budson, who was recognized in our recent CNN 10: Visionary Women special coverage for her work trying to eliminate the income disparity between men and women. ""We're not saying: 'Go make it equal -- figure it out.' We're saying: 'Here's a plan and a set of strategic goals. Pick some. Help your businesses grow.' "" The approach, she hopes, can serve as a model for cities around the country and the world. Just last month, Budson traveled to Paris to present what Boston is doing to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. ""Rather than a regulation,"" said Budson, it's a ""nudge."" What happens when women negotiate . For many women, taking steps themselves to close their own personal income gap makes them incredibly uncomfortable. According to an iVillage.com survey last year of 1,500 women, only 35% said they ever asked for a raise. That's even more significant based on the finding that of those who were unhappy at work, 63% said the number one reason was because they felt they were underpaid. There is a reason our discomfort is not unwarranted. According to Budson, the research shows that when women are given an offer and negotiate that offer, or when they are paid a certain amount and they want to negotiate their salary, people tend to want to work with them less. ""Women are expected to be relational and when they say, 'I think my value is X,' people might say, 'Hmmm, why are they asking? I don't feel so comfortable with that,' and it usually causes social backlash,"" said Budson. Whether or not Abramson faced some backlash for confronting her superiors over her compensation and whether that contributed in even the slightest way to her firing, we'll probably never know but, said Budson, it ""fits the pattern."" Read about Abramson's commencement address Monday . Jena Abernathy, a senior partner at the executive search firm, Witt/Kieffer, said there is a double standard when it comes to how men and women sit down and discussion compensation. She said the best advice for women is to keep track of their successes and then find the right way to make their case. ""Being able to sit down at the right time, at the right moment, to say ... 'How can we close this gap? What do we need to do?' ""You need to do it in a way that's not threatening,"" said Abernathy. ""There is an art to this."" OPINION: Was Jill Abramson fired because she is a woman? What do you think it will take to eliminate the gender pay gap? Chime in in the comments or tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter or CNN Living on Facebook.","Boston has pledged to become the first city to eliminate the gender pay gap .

"(CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama is heading to Iowa next month to campaign in one of the closest Senate races of the 2014 midterms. In what is only her second announced appearance on the trail for a candidate, Obama will stump for Bruce Braley, a four-term Democratic congressman seeking the open seat. The Braley campaign confirms the first lady's plans to come to Iowa next month, though no dates, events or locations have yet been set. The first lady could inject some momentum into the race that CNN currently rates as up for grabs. In a sign of how tough this year could be for Democrats, the seat has been held by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin since 1985. Braley is campaigning against Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iraq War veteran who beat a large primary field earlier this year with popular ads (including one about castrating pigs) and endorsements by many well-known Republicans, including Mitt Romney, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sarah Palin. 2014 midterm elections: Key races . Braley is trying to frame Ernst as an extremist whose views are not in line with Iowans on issues such as minimum wage and personhood. Ernst counters by hitting Braley for his years as a trial lawyer and accusing him of being a Washington bureaucrat.

"(CNN) -- Whether or not we reform our nation's immigration laws may all come down to cantaloupes versus cojones. Last year, Iowa Republican Congressman Steve King attacked undocumented immigrant children in America, saying, ""for every one who is a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there that weigh 130 pounds and they have calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."" Colorful though it might have been, that characterization is not only insulting but completely incorrect. Still, it reflects the underlying sentiment of many Americans who oppose immigration reform not just on rational grounds, but based on a deeper, emotional bias. Then you have everyone else — in fact, the strong majority of Americans — who support comprehensive immigration reform, including a workable path to citizenship. This crowd certainly includes President Obama and Democrats, who have reiterated that passing immigration reform is one of their key legislative priorities. And it presumably includes leaders in the Republican Party, who want to curry favor with business interests and Latino voters who support fixing our nation's broken immigration system. So the question is: Do Republicans have the cojones to ignore the ""cantaloupe caucus"" and do the right thing? As a refresher, here's where things stood before the election: In 2013, the Democratic-controlled Senate passed bipartisan legislation that would create a workable path to citizenship for America's undocumented immigrants while at the same time ensuring our immigration system and borders works as they're supposed to for the future. Although Republicans controlled the House of Representatives, the measure reportedly had enough support from individual Republicans, as well as Democrats, to pass. But House Speaker John Boehner wouldn't allow the measure to come up for a vote. And so it stalled. In the wake of Republicans failing to take leadership, President Obama said he would consider executive action to do what he could on his own, under his constitutional authority, to provide relief to millions of undocumented immigrants. The President held off such action before the election. Now, if Republicans again fail to act, executive action is back on the table. At a press conference following this year's midterm elections, President Obama said: ""I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse, but that whatever executive actions that I take will be replaced and supplanted by action by Congress. You send me a bill that I can sign, and those executive actions go away."" If Congress won't show leadership, the President will. In other words, the ball is in Republicans' court. We should take a moment to remember that in 2005, it was Republicans who championed immigration reform. Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham were instrumental in co-sponsoring and advocating for immigration reform and such efforts were enthusiastically backed by President George W. Bush. By the same token, in 2013, four Senate Republicans — John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake and Marco Rubio — joined four Senate Democrats to craft and pass the currently immigration reform bill. Rubio eventually explicitly opposed his own bill — and last week, Rubio, McCain and Graham sent a letter to President Obama implicitly criticizing the bill suggesting there should be no path to citizenship until border security demands are met (whereas the pending legislation addresses both simultaneously). Meanwhile, Republicans have used border security as a constantly-retreating goalpost to stall meaningful immigration reform. If President Obama uses his constitutional authority to take limited action on immigration relief, it will not be without legal or political precedent. In 2012, President Obama directed his administration to focus his immigration enforcement away from so-called Dreamers brought to the United States as children. But Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush also used executive action to protect the spouses and children of immigrants who were granted legal status under 986 immigration reform — arguably using their executive authority to extend the law beyond Congressional action. The Republican base may now retroactively condemn their hero Ronald Reagan for ""amnesty,"" but they don't condemn him as a domineering tyrant. Yet while President Obama has issued fewer executive orders than his predecessors, Republicans regularly smear Obama for acting like a ""king"" — repeated just this week by Sen. Rand Paul. Speaker John Boehner has said if President Obama acts on his own to give relief to our nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants, he will in effect ""poison the well"" for any compromise legislation. And yet it is Boehner who already poisoned the political landscape, failing to wrangle a Republican caucus that has continually proven itself ungovernable and yet now has the full responsibility to govern. It doesn't seem to matter what principles or ideals Republicans embraced in the past. Their essential ideology right now is anti-Obama. Remember, these are the same ""leaders"" who shut down our federal government, at an economic cost of $24 billion, basically out of spite. President Obama has shown plenty of good faith effort to compromise with Republicans in general and around immigration reform in particular. As the President said in his post-midterms press briefing: . ""The Senate on a bipartisan basis passed a good bill. It wasn't perfect, it wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it was a sound, smart piece of legislation that really would greatly improve not just our immigration system but our economy and would improve business conditions here in the United States and make sure that American-born workers aren't undercut by workers who are undocumented and aren't always paid a fair wage and as a consequence, employers who are breaking the rules are able to undercut folks who are doing the right thing."" That's what governing looks like — working together on compromise legislation for the good of the country, not political posturing. Indeed, Republicans have the most to gain from supporting immigration reform. After the 2012 elections, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus led an ""autopsy"" arguing that, among other moves, Republicans must show leadership on immigration reform or risk permanently alienating the growing percentage of Latino voters. But now, after the midterms? Priebus tried to blame Obama for inaction on immigration reform. For added measure, Priebus all but called the President of the United States of America a liar: ""I don't believe a thing he says,"" Priebus told CNN. Leadership is more than name-calling. Leadership is more than flip flopping on principles. Leadership is more than being against whatever the other side is for. Leadership is working together to solve problems. It's time Republicans finally step up, grow some cojones and lead on immigration reform. And if they fail to do so — again — then President Obama will be right to take action on his own and show leadership. After all, someone has to.","Sally Kohn says Republicans are now on the spot about immigration .

"(CNN) -- Apparently, Mother Nature's not a fan of Mother's Day, and she's letting some of us have it. At least one tornado touched down in Clay County, Nebraska, according to Loren Uden, emergency management coordinator for that county. He reported severe damage to the downtown business area in the town of Sutton. Roofs were torn off and windows were smashed. So far, just one injury has been reported there. A police officer in his cruiser on the edge of town suffered some minor cuts in his vehicle, Uden said. A farm in Sutton was reduced to rubble. ""I guess it just lifted up the house and slammed it back down, because it's just in a pile of rubble right now,"" said McKenzie Gross, whose car was crushed by a tree in the severe weather. ""This was my cousin's house. He and his wife lived there with their two kids. They weren't home. They got out in time. They went to my aunt's house a couple of miles away. It's freaky to see,"" she said. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency Sunday as residents cleaned up from Saturday's tornado that ripped through the small town of Orrick, east of Kansas City. The storm brought heavy rain, strong winds and hail to many areas of the state, causing significant damage to homes, vehicles and schools, and taking down trees and power lines. The National Weather Service has given the tornado a preliminary rating of EF-2 and is surveying the damage. In a statement, the governor urged residents to monitor conditions and heed weather alerts as another round of potentially dangerous weather is forecast for later Sunday. Nixon asked Missourians to ""stay alert, use caution and take shelter immediately"" if severe weather is headed their way. An area of low pressure stretching from Texas north to the Great Lakes region threatens to produce severe thunderstorms for much of the country late Sunday, CNN meteorologists warn. The storms have the potential to produce tornadoes, hail and damaging winds of 60 mph or greater. There was a moderate risk for severe storms across the Central Plains, including parts of Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri. A tornado watch has also been issued for parts of central and eastern Iowa, including the counties of Appanoose, Davis, Putnam and Van Buren and the towns of Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Dubuque and Iowa City. Shortly after the watch was issued, a tornado warning was issued along Interstate 35, south of Des Moines. Behind the severe weather affecting the Plains, meteorologists are keeping a watchful eye on a snowstorm in the Rockies. Winter storm warnings and advisories have been issued for parts of Utah, Colorado, southern Wyoming and western Nebraska. Higher mountain elevations could see 1 to 2 feet of snow, with isolated pockets of up to 3 feet. Denver could see up to 5 to 10 inches of snow. Although snow might seem unusual this time of year, it's actually not record-setting for the Mile High City. Denver received an inch of snow on May 11, 2011, and even recorded snow as late as June 12 in 1974. The Southwest won't escape this wild weather either. Very strong, damaging winds will blow into parts of southern California, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico with gusts up to 50 to 60 mph. Dry conditions mixed with gusty winds could spell a fire threat. Red flag warnings have been issued as far east as the Texas Panhandle. The only areas of the contiguous United States to escape Mother Nature's wrath Sunday will be the Northeast and the West Coast. Most of the rest of the country will be dealing with some type of wind or storms. Maybe New York and Los Angeles remembered to send flowers?

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- While the world focuses on the gruesome images of a dead Gadhafi in Libya, many are missing another big game-changer taking place Sunday in the Arab world -- through ballots, not bullets. It's happening in Tunisia, which is once again making history. With popular protest, Tunisia pushed its dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali from power on January 14. On Sunday, it will hold elections for the constitutional assembly that will determine the nation's future; it will be the first time many Tunisians have gone to the polls. This is a historic moment for Tunisia, and for the world. But there are no colorful banners or the festival atmosphere that often proclaims election seasons. Instead, Tunisian streets are quiet. Campaign posters are confined to designated spots on carefully marked walls. Walking around Tunis, one occasionally stumbles upon the checkerboard series of posters, usually with nearly identical slogans. Otherwise, it's business as usual. In part, this is because laws restrict campaign activities to indoor spaces with prior approval. These laws may be intended to level the playing field, but have the effect of muting debate. Beyond this, most would-be voters find the elections confusing. More than 100 parties, 1,500 party lists (which offer proportional representation) and 10,000 candidates are vying for 199 seats in Tunisia's 27 in-country districts. (Tunisia has established another six districts to represent Tunisians living outside the country.) This is combined with decades of authoritarian rule that has left many Tunisians cynical, uninformed and detached from politics. Only 4.4 million of an estimated 7.5 million to 8 million eligible voters are registered to vote, despite an extended registration period. For some, though, stakes seem incredibly high. Some Tunisians worry that ""old forces"" under Ben Ali's regime will find a foothold in the new order. Tunisian authorities banned those who held positions of responsibility in the old ruling party from running in elections. The ban technically excluded thousands and clipped the wings of the old regime, but few believe their influence has disappeared for good. Perhaps more palpable is the concern that Islamists will hijack the process. Some point to Islamist demonstrations against the airing of the animated film ""Persepolis"" on the private Tunisian TV station Nessma as a clear sign that Islamist forces are strong and determined to undo Tunisia's secular regime. Islamists opposed to the depiction of God in the animated, award-winning French film about the 1979 Iranian revolution marched in central Tunis, until riot police used tear gas to disperse them. In defense of freedom and rights, secularists mounted a counter-demonstration, marching with tape over their mouths to protest limitations of freedom. There is finger-pointing on both sides. Those who fear the Islamist party, al-Nahda -- by far the strongest, best organized in the country -- point to the demonstrations as evidence that al-Nahda can't be trusted, or at best will be forced by Salafis to take more radical policies. Those favoring al-Nahda tell a story of incitement and conspiracy, in which anti-Nahdists intentionally incited the conflict to undermine Islamists. More generally, they fervently pledge to respect women's rights, with loudspeaker announcements reminding voters that women make up an important half of society. On the bright side, debate is clearly alive and well in Tunisia. It is found around dinner tables, in conference rooms, schools and universities. Moreover, Tunisians seem determined to succeed. There is a sense of self-restraint and compromise among many, underpinned by formal agreements, that they must keep the process on track. It is incredibly important that the electoral process succeed, not just for Tunisia, but for the world. Just like the demonstrations that led to Ben Ali's downfall, the elections receive little attention. Yet, just as the demonstrations ultimately changed the face of the Arab world, the elections can alter the course of history. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ellen Lust.","Ellen Lust: Historic election Sunday will determine Tunisia's future, but there is little fanfare .

"(CNN) -- Despite airstrikes and international outrage against ISIS militants, the terror group is overrunning Iraqi forces and slowly marching on toward a province on Baghdad's doorstep. And as alarming developments piled up over the weekend, Iraqi forces threatened to flee if the U.S. military does not intervene. Here are where things stand: . On Baghdad's doorstep . ISIS fighters are making headway against poorly equipped local forces. The Islamist extremists appear set to take Kobani, a key Syrian town along the Turkish border. Next up: a province on Baghdad's doorstep. Iraq's Anbar province pleaded for U.S. ground troops to halt the group's rapid, relentless assault. The terror group came within 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) of Baghdad's airport, according to the leader of U.S. military efforts to fight ISIS in Iraq. The United States brought in low-flying attack helicopters to keep ISIS at bay, Gen. Martin Dempsey told ABC on Sunday. ""You're not going to wait until they're climbing over the wall,"" Dempsey said. ""Had (ISIS forces) overrun the Iraqi unit, it was a straight shot to the Baghdad airport."" Anbar province at risk . The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is moving -- fast. The group, which calls itself the Islamic State, controls about 80% of the province, according to Sabah Al-Karhout, president of Anbar Provincial Council. If the province falls, the Sunni extremists would take over an area from the perimeter of Iraq's capital to Raqqa in Syria, according to Falleh al-Issawi, the provincial council's deputy head. Iraq's military abandoned a strategically important base in Anbar after heavy fighting with ISIS militants, provincial security force sources told CNN on Monday. The base outside Hit was one of the Shiite-led government's few remaining military outposts in the predominantly Sunni province. Targeting law enforcement . No one is safe from the militants. The police chief of the province was killed over the weekend when a blast targeted his convoy, authorities said. The attack is just one of the things sending shock waves among forces fighting the militants. Iraqi army forces and Anbar tribesmen have threatened to abandon their weapons if the U.S. military does not intervene. The army soldiers lack training and equipment, according to local authorities. Already, some 1,800 tribesmen in the province have been killed or injured in the struggle. Iraqi officials have been adamant that they don't want U.S. forces on the ground. President Barack Obama has not shown any intent to deploy any. Family of ISIS captive speaks . Meanwhile, the family of an ISIS captive, British journalist John Cantlie, is begging ISIS -- also known as IS -- to re-establish direct contact. ""This is frustrating for all parties, including those who are trying to assist us. We had previously been in contact through a channel started by you, but then this stopped for reasons best known to you,"" Cantlie's sister, Jessica Cantlie, said in a statement. ""We strongly challenge those holding John to return to your previously opened channel, to which we continue to send messages and await your response so that in keeping with everyone's wishes, we can restart dialogue. We implore IS to reinitiate direct contact."" Offensive against ISIS in Syria . ISIS is still advancing in Syria, where it emerged during that country's civil war. Its focus is on Kobani, a Kurdish enclave a stone's throw from Turkey. The militants are gradually taking control of a large chunk of Kobani. Monday was one of the most violent days since ISIS launched its assault on the city, with sounds of fierce fighting, including gunfire and explosions, CNN staff on the Syria-Turkey border said. A fighter from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit, or YPG, told CNN's Arwa Damon that the battle was focusing on the main border crossing into Turkey. If ISIS took control, he said, ""it's over."" On Saturday, ISIS fighters also clashed with local troops over the official border crossing into Turkey at Mursitpinar. If they're successful, the militants would control three official border crossings between Turkey and Syria and a stretch of the border about 60 miles (97 kilometers) long. The U.S. military said it and its allies had attacked ISIS on Sunday and Monday, launching four airstrikes southwest of Kobani, three northeast of the city and one northwest of Raqqa. CNN's Chandrika Narayan and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","NEW: The family of captive John Cantlie calls on ISIS to re-establish direct contact .

"(CNN) -- Joe Metz, a straight-talking Texas rancher on the U.S.-Mexico border, awoke recently to find 50 cows roaming freely in his front yard. Undocumented immigrants, he says, left a gate open as they crossed his land, which abuts the Rio Grande. For years, he's witnessed migrants and drug smugglers touch American soil for the first time on his property. ""We deal with this every day,"" he said. But as a rancher in Hidalgo County, he also knows firsthand the need for labor to keep producers in the Rio Grande Valley operating. The traffic through his land frustrates him -- particularly the potentially dangerous drug traffic -- but he acknowledges that most crossers are looking for opportunity. It is an open secret that many of these undocumented immigrants will indeed find jobs in the local economy. More than 1,700 miles away, U.S. lawmakers are engaged in their own debate over how to balance security concerns and immigrant labor needs. The Senate has proposed one solution in the form of a sweeping immigration bill that the chamber passed last month. Border security figures prominently in that bill, and is also a priority for members of the House, where the debate has moved. Five reasons immigration reform isn't close . Those who live and work on the border say there is a disconnect between the debate in Washington and the realities on the ground. Voices of the border communities . Miles of border fencing built by the federal government -- actually a levy that was cut in half and reinforced with concrete to form a wall -- run across Metz's property near Mission, Texas. Two 40-foot gaps exist in the barrier so that workers can access all parts of the ranch, but there are no gates, creating a funnel for migrants and traffickers to cross. Metz's experiences make him hawkish on beefing up the border, but he doesn't just want more border patrol agents. He wants to see work permits granted the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the United States. The agriculture industry in the Rio Grande Valley depends on immigrant labor, he said. ""They (the government) just need to face up to the situation and give all these people work permits,"" Metz said. Opinion: Immigrants are driving the housing recovery . Migrants will keep coming across the border as long as there is work and a chance to make money, the rancher said. ""Farmers need the help, no doubt about that, because nobody wants to do the work,"" said Jimmie Steidinger, a farmer and agricultural producer, in Donna, Texas. How immigration reform would affect 3 families . For those whose lands are traversed by migrants, the biggest concern is drug traffickers, more so than economic migrants, he said. Putting undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship would provide not just more able hands, but the relief of knowing who is crossing the border, he said. For others, securing the border is not about how many boots are on the ground. Border security means that people on both sides of the boundary feel safe, said Michael Seifert, coordinator of the Rio Grande Valley Equal Voice Network. That is not the case, he said. The Equal Voice Network represents 11 community-based organizations focused on the area's poorest residents. To many of these residents, the border patrol is something threatening, Seifert said. Reports of heavy-handedness by border agents -- including use of force -- has bred mistrust among some border residents. In one case in Arizona last year, a border patrol agent shot and killed an adolescent who had been throwing rocks alongside several others at the border. The border patrol confirmed that agents were being assaulted with rocks and that after verbal warnings to stop, one agent fired his service weapon. Many in the community hear the stories of alleged beatings or use of stun guns by border agents and have become wary of their presence. ""We have a completely different perception"" than outsiders, Seifert said. The fears of the community are compounded by the fact that many families live in mixed-status households, where some members are living in the country legally and others aren't, creating fear of separation. Seifert said a further buildup along the border would be bad both for businesses and the welfare of the communities. The view from Washington . The Senate immigration overhaul bill passed only after being amended to include tough border security measures: Doubling the number of border patrol agents on the southern border to nearly 40,000, increasing fencing to 700 miles and deploying more technology. In the Republican-controlled House, border security is being touted as a prerequisite before any undocumented immigrants are placed on a potential path to citizenship. ""I understand the issues our borders face and am committed to making sure the first thing that must be addressed with any immigration bill is strengthening and protecting the border,"" said Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, a member of the bipartisan House group working on a bill. But some who study the border say the boundary with Mexico is as safe as it's ever been, and it doesn't make sense to flood the place with border agents. ""It sounds good and it looks good politically,"" to add more agents, said Maureen Meyer, Senior Associate for Mexico and Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America, or WOLA. ""Calls for border security don't always reflect reality."" Opinion: Should U.S. be more like Mexico? Currently, the border patrol is already double the size it was in 2005. As the agency grew, the number of illegal crossers apprehended decreased. In 2005, each border agent -- on average -- apprehended 118 undocumented immigrants that year, according to data extrapolated by WOLA. Last year, that number fell to 19 apprehensions per agent. If the border patrol is doubled in size again, how much further would that number fall? Would there be a lot of agents standing on the border doing nothing? Not just a border issue . About 70 miles north of the Rio Grande Valley lies Brooks County, a community that has seen the cost of illegal immigration up close, even though it is not located on the border. The county includes the town of Falfurrias, the site of the last border patrol checkpoint on Highway 281. Make it past the checkpoint, and a smuggler or migrant could be home free. Most migrants try to avoid the checkpoint altogether, choosing instead to go around it by hiking deep into the vast tracts of ranch land. But too often they become lost, or succumb to the unforgiving heat and die. In 2012, 129 bodies of migrants were found in Brooks County. At least 42 have been found so far this year -- 11 in the past two weeks. It can cost the county nearly $2,000 to pick up a body, transport it, and perform an autopsy. The county is also burdened with the costs of sending its deputies to these scenes instead of patrolling the community. The counties that are right on the border have access to federal funds to offset law enforcement and other costs, but Brooks County does not. KSAT: Immigrants survive wild ride in U-Haul truck . The border ""isn't secure, and I don't think they will ever secure it,"" Brooks County Judge Raul Ramirez said. Still, Ramirez says that doubling the border patrol and prioritizing border security before immigration reform is not the answer. ""I think they don't get it. I don't think that's the solution,"" he said. More agents will not stop determined migrants, but will simply drive up the price that a smuggler charges, he said. It also raises the likelihood that smugglers will choose riskier routes, meaning that even more people may die from exposure, he said. What Ramirez would like to see is a deployment of current border agents to high-crossing areas, and a focus on catching drug traffickers. What do border agents want? The border patrol would appear to have the most to gain from an immigration bill with a tough security component. It would mean more money and more manpower. But Shawn Moran, vice president of the union that represents border agents, the National Border Patrol Council, says that is not the case. Rather than spending millions hiring and training 20,000 new agents, it makes more sense to properly fund the existing force to bring the border patrol up to 100% staffing for current agents, he said. That alone would be the equivalent of 5,000 new agents. Calls for increased technology, from sensors to unmanned aerial vehicles are nice, but they are just tools, Moran said. It takes an agent to make an arrest, he said. ""We appreciate the sentiment, but we think (the immigration bill) has to be tweaked a bit,"" he said.","The Senate's immigration bill calls for doubling the size of the border patrol .
The House is debating a strong security component to its bill, too .
Those who live on the border have a nuanced view of security .
Many want work permits for undocumented immigrants ."
"(CNN) -- Just as Egypt's revolution took the world by surprise, so did President Mohamed Morsy's unexpected assertion of presidential power so soon after he came into office. On August 12, Morsy forced Field Marshal Mohammed Tantawi and his heir apparent, Lt. Gen. Sami Anan, to retire. No one was prepared for Morsy, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, to pull the proverbial rug out from under the two most powerful and widely hated military officials and to reassert civilian power. In hindsight, Morsy foreshadowed his move against the military in his inaugural speech when he declared that ""no institution is above the state."" In what has become almost second nature in Egypt since the revolution, people took to the streets to express their political views. Following Morsy's announcement, Tahrir Square was instantly filled with supporters -- a powerful reminder of who motivated Morsy to make his bold move. While ordinary people have shown their approval, the same forces that supported Hosni Mubarak's regime now insinuate that Morsy has taken his first step toward dictatorship. They dismiss the possibility that Morsy is fulfilling hopes of the revolution that brought him to power, and that he has a right to claim powers that come with his presidency. By unseating Tantawi and Anan, Morsy responded to the longstanding demands of the revolutionary forces as well as ridding Egypt of the handicap of a two-heads-of-state system. ""Down, down with military rule"" has been chanted by revolutionaries since Tantawi replaced Mubarak. No wonder the activist Wael Ghonim and the Revolution Continues coalition were among the first to publicly support Morsy's brilliant tactic. Morsy himself has explained that he has acted in the interests of the nation by fulfilling the aspirations of the revolution. However, much more needs to be done. The revolutionaries have called for the retrial of Mubarak's acquitted regime heads and prosecution of Tantawi and Anan for their crimes against civilian protesters. Morsy has opted instead for a more pragmatic ""safe exit"" for Tantawi and Anan, even bestowing them with decorations on their way out. Morsy should pardon more if not all civilian protesters -- some 12,000 in total -- who are still being held in military detention. So far, Morsy appears to be sensitive to the Egyptian street. Recognizing his own diminishing popularity as well as the declining approval ratings of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Parliament that it dominates, Morsy may feel the need to do more before August 24, when nationwide demonstrations against the Muslim Brotherhood are scheduled to take place. The two hard-won gains of the revolution -- civic participation and democratic processes -- have empowered Egyptians to engage actively in politics. The real force behind any change in Egypt comes down to ordinary citizens who flex their political muscles. Wagih El Akkad, a taxi driver in Cairo who voted for the first time in 67 years, spoke for many when he said: ""I didn't like either of them (presidential candidates Morsy and Ahmed Shafik), but I like the system. ... You have to take risks to bring about change, but these things take time."" Everywhere in Cairo, people are talking politics. Nothing, including the opaque control of possibly 40% of the Egyptian economy by military-connected entities, is taken for granted. For Morsy, it might have been riskier not to act. Egyptians are growing impatient with the lack of noticeable change in political life while the country's economy continues to slump. Gallup's Egypt polls indicate that Islamist voters have the same priorities for government as secular voters: economic growth and security. Distractions like the social issues pursued by the Brotherhood-dominated Parliament will not satisfy most Egyptians. Maybe this is why a Morsy representative announced that the president is inclined to further changes, including reforming the unpopular Constituent Assembly, which is charged with writing the Constitution. The jury is still out on Morsy. He will be hard-pressed to meet the demands of economic and social justice that fueled the revolution. Morsy's new appointments send mixed signals. He replaced Tantawi with Gen. Abdul al-Sisi as defense minister. Although al-Sisi has good relations with the U.S., he is known for defending the barbaric ""virginity tests"" performed by the military during the revolution. Arguably, the appointment of reformist judge Mahmoud Mekki as vice president (which has garnered little attention in the West) holds greater promise and significance for Egypt's future. What will Morsy do next? Will he deliver what the revolutionaries have hoped for? Or will he move in the Brotherhood's regressive direction, evident in their recent censorship of the press? We will find out soon. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Schneider and Khaled Abol Naga.","Cynthia Schneider, Khaled Naga: Egypt's new president took the world by surprise .
Schneider, Naga: President Morsy forced two powerful military officials to retire .

"Cedar Rapids, Iowa (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton swiped at Republican Senate hopeful Joni Ernst on Wednesday for canceling a meeting with the Des Moines Register editorial board last week, telling a labor audience that not answering ""tough questions"" is ""disqualifying"" in the state.

""You test your candidates, you actually force them to be the best they can be and they have to be willing to answer the tough questions.""

Joni Ernst defends skipping Des Moines Register meeting . Of course, the comment could extend beyond the Iowa Senate campaign. Clinton has acknowledged she is thinking about running for president, and many in Iowa think she will decide to run. Should she do so, she will be asked a number of difficult questions from Iowa voters and journalists. At her second event in Iowa on Wednesday, a rally in Davenport, Clinton repeated the line with a slight variation. ""Not in Iowa do people get away from asking tough questions,"" Clinton said, before adding, ""Except questions that are far in the future."" The line got the crowd laughing and Clinton responded with a slight smirk, acknowledging she was referencing her presidential ambitions. ""Only one candidate in this race answers your questions,"" Clinton added. ""Don't let anybody in this campaign ... hide behind outside money and negative adds. That is not the Iowa way."" Clinton also knocked Ernst, a female candidate, as someone who didn't stand with women because her stances on reproductive rights.

"(CNN) -- South African prosecutors will appeal the verdict and the sentence in the Oscar Pistorius case, a spokesman for the country's National Prosecuting Authority told CNN on Monday. A judge sentenced Pistorius to five years in prison last week after finding the double-amputee track star guilty of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, in the shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius acknowledged shooting Steenkamp in February 2013. Prosecutors claim he wanted to kill her; Pistorius said he mistook her for an intruder and her killing was a tragic accident. The appeal doesn't necessarily mean either the verdict or the sentence against Pistorius will be thrown out, said CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. And it's even less likely he will be freed at the end of what's likely to be a six-month process, she said. ""There's no real prospect of his acquittal out of this,"" she said. Prosecutors are arguing that Judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted a complex South African standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case, Phelps said. As a result, prosecutors argue, he should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge. Prosecutors originally took Pistorius to trial on a murder charge. In explaining her sentence, Masipa concluded that Pistorius did not intend to kill Steenkamp. But critics of the verdict have argued the judge didn't correctly apply the intent standard, which is broader in South African law than what it typically means in casual conversation, Phelps said. In their appeal of the sentence, prosecutors would have to prove the five years given by Masipa is ""shockingly inappropriate"" in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases, according to Phelps. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel called for a minimum sentence of 10 years, saying the negligence in Pistorius' actions ""borders on intent."" If an appeals court finds that five years is ""shockingly inappropriate,"" the court could set the sentence aside and issue a new one, she said. But appeals courts in South Africa are reluctant to get involved in sentencing decisions, Phelps said. Pistorius' uncle, Arnold Pistorius, told CNN's Robyn Curnow, ""We take note of the announcement made by the state. The legal process must take its course."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Brent Swails contributed to this report.","South African prosecutors to appeal verdict and sentence in the Oscar Pistorius case .

"(CNN) -- A third teenage girl has died from last week's shooting at a Washington state high school. Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, died Friday night at Providence Regional Medical Center, the hospital said. She and four other students were shot October 24 in the cafeteria of Marysville Pilchuck High School. Zoe Galasso, 14, died at the scene while Gia Soriano, 14, died Sunday night. Two students -- Andrew Fryberg and Nate Hatch -- were wounded by the teen gunman -- who happened to be their cousin. Shaylee's family issued a statement shortly after her death. ""Our hearts are broken at the passing of our beautiful daughter. Shay means everything to us,"" the family said. ""In Shay's short life she has been a radiant light bringing us incredible joy and happiness. She has been a loving daughter, a caring sister, a devoted friend and a wonderful part of our community. We can't imagine life without her."" Rampage ended when 'hero' teacher confronted gunman . Tulalip Tribes, a federally recognized Indian tribe, said the Chuckulnaskit family is part of its extended community. ""The Tulalip Tribes continue to offer up our condolences and prayers for the passing of Zoe Galasso and Gia Sariano, our hearts are heavy as we hear of the passing of Shaylee Chuckulnaskit,"" the Tribes said. ""With the loss of these three young lives there are no words that can truly express our compassion and condolences and the loss we feel."" Authorities say shooter Jaylen Fryberg invited his victims to the same lunch table by texting them. Many questions remain about why the shootings occurred, but the answers may never be known. Jaylen also took his own life in the school cafeteria. CNN's Mayra Cuevas and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","Shaylee Chuckulnaskit was 14 years old .

"(CNN) -- It was a five cent Chinese yuan coin that gave Tan Yuan Yuan the chance to dance. Poise, character and determination led to Tan becoming San Francisco Ballet's first Chinese principal dancer. Born into a traditional family in Shanghai, the obstacles Tan broke through to become one of today's most critically acclaimed ballerinas began at home. Her mother who had wanted to be a ballerina saw that her daughter's physique, looks and determination fitted perfectly into a ballerina's profile and encouraged Tan to become one. ""She wanted me to fulfill her dream,"" Tan told CNN's Talk Asia. But her father, an engineer, had a different plan for his daughter. ""He wanted me to become a doctor or an engineer...because I was a good student in school,"" Tan said. Her father saw ballet as a western art form inappropriate for a traditional Chinese girl and as a career that is unstable and short. The two settled their differences with a flip of a coin that landed in favor of her mother's wishes and her father accepted the defeat as a matter of fate. The relationship between ballet and Tan began at the age of five when Tan was mesmerized by the beauty of a performance of Swan Lake on TV. Apart from the tutus and the fairy queen's crown, the music and the ballerina's movements impressed her. At age 11, Tan began her rigorous training at Shanghai Dance School and graduated four years later. But entering Shanghai Dance School a year later than the other pupils made it difficult for Tan to catch up. ""I wasn't very good. I was always in the corner crying,"" said Tan. Things took a turn for the better in her third year when Ms. Ling, a new teacher took over the class and ""put her full time into our ballet trainings,"" Tan added. When CNN asked about her motivation to be an incredible performer, she explained: ""It is in Chinese blood to always try your best...and no matter what happens today, for example, if your back gives out or your foot is in pain or your toe is bleeding, no matter what happens you always give the audience a perfect show."" San Francisco Ballet artistic director, Helgi Tomasson, saw this desire and determination in Tan at an international ballet competition in France and immediately stole her from Stuttgart Ballet in Germany that had offered her a scholarship. Joining the company in 1995, two years later she became the first Chinese principal dancer in San Francisco's 70 year history. Along the way to becoming one of the world's best ballerinas, she has won three international dancing awards, danced at the White House for former President Bill Clinton, and was named one of TIME magazine's ""Asia's Heroes"" in 2004. But despite the accolades, Tan remains down to earth, even sewing her own point shoes with elastics and ribbons to attain the perfect shape for her feet. ""The shoes are just part of my life... it usually takes me more than half an hour to sew,"" she said. She has recently accepted Hong Kong Ballet's offer to be a guest principal dancer in ""Tricolor"", three 20th century masterpieces which include George Balanchine's Rubies, Serge Lifar's ""Suite en Blanc"", and Antony Tudor's ""Jardin aux Lilas"". In the future, Tan hopes to be a ballet educator, choreographer or designer in both China and the United States. But in the meantime she has decided to follow her Buddhist teachings and just ""go with the flow."" ""If a good opportunity comes to me I will embrace it. I am very grateful that I have this opportunity; if it's not mine, it's not mine,"" she told CNN.","Tan Yuan Yuan is San Francisco Ballet's principal dancer .

"(CNN) -- The nephew of deposed Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali found his sentence for a drug possession conviction doubled when he appealed it, state media said. Imed Trabelsi was sentenced in May to two years in prison and a 2,000-dinar (about $1,440) fine for possession and consumption of drugs, Tunisia's official news agency said. He appealed the ruling. On Saturday, the Tunis Court of Appeal upheld the decision and added two more years to the sentence: four years in prison and a 3,000-dinar ($2,160) fine, the TAP news agency said. The report did not say why the court imposed the additional time. Trabelsi is still to be tried as part of corruption cases filed against 114 Ben Ali relatives after the former president's ouster earlier this year, the news agency said. Last week, a Tunisian court sentenced Ben Ali and his wife to 35 years in prison in absentia on corruption charges. The court also imposed a fine of 91 million dinars ($65 million). Ben Ali and his wife, Leila Trabelsi, have been living in exile in Saudi Arabia since the January revolt that ended his 23-year rule and touched off a wave of uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East. The pair faced a total of 93 counts stemming from the discovery of cash, weapons, jewelry and drugs in the presidential palace after the revolt. Of those, 35 counts against Ben Ali and his inner circle -- including murder and torture -- have been referred to a Tunisian military court, the state news agency reported. Ben Ali had ruled the North African country since 1987. Protests began to erupt in December after the self-immolation of a fruit vendor whose cart had been seized by police. His fiery suicide touched off a firestorm among Tunisians fed up with corruption, high unemployment and escalating food prices. Ben Ali fled the country in mid-January after a revolt that left at least 300 people dead and 700 wounded, a top U.N. human rights expert said last month. The former strongman's political party has since been dissolved by a court order, and parliamentary elections have been scheduled for July. Earlier this month, Ben Ali said he has been unfairly portrayed and discredited by political opponents seeking to make a break with their country's past. In a written statement released by one of his attorneys, Jean-Yves Le Borgne, Ben Ali said it was time to break his silence because he was ""tired of being made a scapegoat"" and is a victim of ""injustice.""","Trabelsi was sentenced in May to a two-year term .

"LONDON, England -- Scientists in the U.S. are developing a laser gun that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes. The WHO has reported that around half of the world's population is at risk of malaria. The laser, which has been dubbed a ""weapon of mosquito destruction"" fires at mosquitoes once it detects the audio frequency created by the beating of its wings. The laser beam then destroys the mosquito, burning it on the spot. Developed  by some of the astrophysicists involved in what was known as the ""Star Wars"" anti-missile programs during the Cold War, the project is meant to prevent the spread of malaria. Lead scientist on the project, Dr. Jordin Kare, told CNN that the laser would be able to sweep an area and ""toast millions of mosquitoes in a few minutes."" Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people from the bites of female mosquitoes. It is particularly prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and kills an African child every 30 seconds, according to the World Health Organization. There are an estimated 300 million acute cases of malaria each year globally, resulting in more than one million deaths, the WHO reports. Responding to questions about any potential harm the laser could pose to the eco-system, Kare said: ""There is no such thing as a good mosquito, there's nothing that feeds exclusively on them. No one would miss mosquitoes,"" he said. ""In any case,"" he added. ""The laser is able to distinguish between mosquitoes that go after people and those that aren't dangerous. What remains to be seen is how precise we can get."" He added that other insects would not be affected by the laser's beam. Kare said the lasers could be mounted on lamp post-type poles and put around the circumference of villages, to create a kind of ""fence"" against mosquitoes. The research was commissioned by Intellectual Ventures, a Washington, U.S.-based company that was founded by Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft Corporation executive. His previous boss, Bill Gates, who funded the research, asked Myhrvold to look into new ways of combating malaria.","Scientists are developing a laser that could kill millions of mosquitoes in minutes .

"(CNN) -- ""Why did you turn off the RV?"" Alyssa Padgett recalls asking her husband, Heath, as their 29-foot RV careened off an exit toward the small town of Williams, Arizona. ""I didn't,"" he replied. Just 10 days into their cross-country honeymoon, the fuel pump in their camper, lovingly known as ""Franklin,"" malfunctioned. Then came the propane leak, the broken refrigerator, the leaking roof and the fender bender in an Oregon parking lot, to name just a few of the couple's bumps in the road. It's all part of the ""grand adventure"" the 23-year-old newlyweds from Texas were looking for when they set out on June 1 for a seven-month, 50-state road trip -- and an extended honeymoon. As their May 24 wedding date approached earlier this year, the pair decided it was an opportune time to do a little soul-searching together. ""We've lived in Texas our whole lives, 22 summers,"" Alyssa says. ""We wanted to go on this grand adventure and figure out where we wanted to live. We figured why don't we just do all of it at once?"" The couple says the plan quickly escalated from ""let's just move to California"" to ""let's make a documentary about finding meaning in your work,"" an issue with which they both were struggling. Both of them had always wanted to pursue a career in writing outside the day jobs they had settled into, but had never quite figured out how to translate their hobby into a dream career. So the couple quit their jobs -- Alyssa at a nonprofit and Heath in software sales -- and came up with the Griswolds-inspired scheme. ""When I told my parents, Heath wasn't there ... for his safety,"" Alyssa jokes. As a young couple just getting on their feet, the next hardest part was figuring out how to make ends meet on the road. Heath, with a little entrepreneurial know-how, contacted Snagajob.com, an hourly employment marketplace, to help find hourly workers (which made up 58.8% of the American workforce in 2013, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics) to spotlight during their travels. With a Wi-Fi router and a new video camera in tow, ""Hourly America,"" was born, where he spends one day shadowing an hourly worker in each state, whether working at a yoga studio in Connecticut, a farm in Wisconsin or a bakery in Wyoming. Before they left, the Padgetts mapped out their route meticulously, and it now hangs above their bed so they can track their progress. They are saving Alaska and Hawaii for last and will visit them by plane (driving a rickety RV to Alaska in wintertime is not recommended, apparently). In lieu of wedding gifts, the couple asked family and friends to donate to their GoFundMe crowdfunding site. But because of a slew of mechanical problems with the RV, the money was gone within the first month. ""We knew we've got to get smart really fast,"" Alyssa says. The couple doesn't get paid for their hourly jobs that are part of the documentary. Instead, they supplement their income with freelance writing on various RV renovation and life-on-the-road websites. ""The RV industry is kind of fascinated by us,"" Alyssa says, as millennials are an unconventional demographic for the RV crowd. Speaking of unconventional, so was choosing to spend their honeymoon in an RV instead of an exotic beach somewhere. ""It's sometimes difficult to balance the chaos of life on the road with spending quality time together, but we chose this honeymoon knowing it wasn't going to be traditional,"" Heath says. ""We work a lot, but we work side by side. It's not exactly sipping mimosas on the beach, but we love every minute."" The couple planned a ""honeymoon within the honeymoon"" -- a weeklong drive along the Pacific Coast Highway -- to share a little of that newlywed bliss. They'll roll back into Texas on Christmas, as their families requested, with a video and web journal of their journey plus a full ""blessings book,"" as they call it. ""We started it as a way to keep optimistic,"" Heath says. Like that night in Arizona when they broke down. They went into a nearby restaurant for a drink and a bowl of queso -- as one needs in those desperate times -- and met a couple, Jimmy and Karen, who teach martial arts in the small town. Their new friends bought them a beer and let them take a free class to work out some of that road stress. Alyssa and Heath say it's little things like that -- and parking in someone's driveway for free or watching a Dallas Cowboys game with new pals in a neighboring RV -- that keeps them going.","Heath and Alyssa Padgett are traveling to all 50 states in an RV for their honeymoon .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama's historic train ride to Washington on Saturday drew large, cheering crowds of people who braved freezing weather and gathered along the tracks in cities and small towns along the way in hopeful anticipation of getting a glimpse of the nation's next president. The crowd cheers as President-elect Barack Obama takes the stage in Baltimore, Maryland. In Baltimore, Maryland, alone, about 40,000 people stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the cold to greet Obama as he stopped on his way to his Tuesday inauguration. His welcome was raucous and animated, as the sea of people cheered, waved and took pictures. Tears rolled down one woman's face as Obama spoke. ""We love you, Obama!"" another yelled out. ""I love you back,"" Obama answered calmly, eliciting a roar from the crowd. The same emotions were expressed up and down the tracks on the 137-mile journey, a trip that started in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and retraced the train ride Abraham Lincoln took on his way to becoming president in 1861.  Watch Obama share the love » . As he did so often during his campaign, Obama drew upon American history in his remarks to pose a parallel to the country's current challenges. He noted the struggles of the colonials, the ""first patriots,"" against the British. ""They were willing to put all they were and all they had on the line,"" Obama told the crowd in Baltimore. ""Their lives, their fortune, and sacred honor for a set of ideals that continue to light the world: that we are all equal. That our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness come not from our laws but from our Maker."" Later he said, ""the American Revolution was, and remains, an ongoing struggle in the minds and hearts of the people."" And, as in Philadelphia, Obama alluded to, but did not name, the president who inspired his train journey. The soon-to-be president used a call-to-action uttered by Lincoln in his inaugural address in 1861, an appeal to Americans' ""better angels."" Obama, who will take up what he called the country's ""enormous"" challenges in fewer than 72 hours, noted that they will probably not be solved quickly. ""There will be false starts; there will be setbacks,"" he said. ""There will be frustrations and disappointments. I will make some mistakes. But we will be called to show patience even as we act with fierce urgency."" He added, ""So, Baltimore, starting now, let's take up in our own lives the work of perfecting our union,"" an appeal that brought forth a loud rumble of approval. Obama arrived later in Washington, where he will take the oath of office Tuesday. He did not have a speaking event there Saturday. Before getting on board the train in Philadelphia, the president-elect implored Americans to commit to a new declaration of independence -- rejecting ideology and bigotry -- as he acknowledged that the nation faces severe challenges. ""Only a handful of times in our history has a generation been confronted with challenges so vast,"" he said at a town hall meeting in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. ""An economy that is faltering. Two wars: one that needs to be ended responsibly, one that needs to be waged wisely. A planet that is warming from our unsustainable dependence on oil."" ""What is required is a new declaration of independence, not just in our nation but in our own lives -- from ideology and small thinking, prejudice and bigotry -- an appeal not to our easy instincts but to our 'better angels,' "" he said, using a phrase from Lincoln's inaugural address. The train stopped in Wilmington, Delaware, to pick up Vice President-elect Joe Biden and his family and then headed to Baltimore, Maryland, on its way to Washington. The train made its first ""slow roll"" in Claymont, Delaware, allowing Obama to wave at cheering residents gathered near the tracks. Claymont is also the town where Biden's family moved in 1953, when he was 10 years old. iReport.com: Is the train coming to your town? Send us your photos . Security for Obama's train ride was tight. Law enforcement officers from 40 jurisdictions provided protection from the ground. The U.S. Coast Guard was stationed on waterways along the route as well. The Federal Aviation Administration established ""moving"" flight restrictions that prevented private pilots, news helicopters, balloonists and others from getting anywhere near the train. The FAA is imposing additional airspace restrictions in Washington on Sunday during pre-inaugural activities and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday, the day of the inauguration.  Watch how security will protect Obama on way to Washington » . Nearly 2 million people are expected to hit the streets of Washington on Tuesday. Police will shut bridges across the Potomac River into the city, along with a huge chunk of downtown. People coming from Virginia will have to walk or take public transport, such as the area's Metro subway system.  Read about the times and places for inaugural events » . Two of the major routes coming into the city -- Interstates 395 and 66 -- will be closed to inbound traffic, at least for private vehicles. Amtrak said it has increased the number and length of trains running to Washington on Inauguration Day. Tickets are still available but are going fast, it said.

"(CNN) -- A British woman has been found dead in a hotel room, days after being confronted by a television reporter who accused her of online attacks on the family of missing girl Madeleine McCann. Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, on Portugal's Algarve coast, in 2007. Her parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, launched a massive publicity campaign to find their daughter and say they continue to believe she is still alive. On Thursday, Britain's Sky News reported that London's Metropolitan Police Service -- also known as Scotland Yard -- had launched an investigation into alleged online abuse of the McCanns. It showed video of Sky reporter Martin Brunt approaching Brenda Leyland, who it said went by the Twitter handle of ""Sweepyface."" The footage shows Brunt asking Leyland why she ""was attacking (the McCanns) so regularly."" Leyland excuses herself and walks away before turning and saying ""I'm entitled to do that."" When Brunt asks if Leyland is concerned that Britain's Crown Prosecution Service is considering investigating the alleged ""campaign of abuse,"" she replies, ""No."" Leicestershire Police said in a statement on Monday that police had been called on Saturday after Leyland's body was found in a hotel room in Grove Park, on the southwestern edges of the English city of Leicester. ""Ms Leyland's death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the Coroner. Officers acting on behalf of the Coroner will look into the circumstances surrounding and prior to her unexpected death,"" it said. A spokeswoman for Sky News said Monday: ""We were saddened to hear of the death of Brenda Leyland. It would be inappropriate to speculate or comment further at this time."" Scotland Yard confirmed that its officers were looking into allegations of malicious communications with the McCann family, having received a letter and other documentation on September 9. ""They are assessing its contents and consulting with the CPS and the McCann family,"" it said. ""Nobody has been interviewed by MPS officers in relation to this matter."" Kate and Gerry McCann left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep in the apartment on May 3, 2007, while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing. Scotland Yard reopened its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance in July 2013 after a two-year review of the original probe. Portuguese police reopened their investigation last October. An eight-day search of the resort town in June this year uncovered no new evidence, Scotland Yard said.","A UK woman is found dead days after being accused of being a ""troll"" by Sky News .

"London, England (CNN) -- Research teams at the Danish Golf Union have discovered it takes between 100 to 1,000 years for a golf ball to decompose naturally. A startling fact when it is also estimated 300 million balls are lost or discarded in the United States alone, every year. It seems the simple plastic golf ball is increasingly becoming a major litter problem. The scale of the dilemma was underlined recently in Scotland, where scientists -- who scoured the watery depths in a submarine hoping to discover evidence of the prehistoric Loch Ness monster -- were surprised to find hundreds of thousands of golf balls lining the bed of the loch. It is thought tourists and locals have used the loch as an alternative driving range for many years. The footage shot by underwater robotics team SeaTrepid, can be seen below. With an increasing number of golf balls discarded each year, the Danish Golf Association devised a number of tests to determine the environmental impact of golf balls on their surroundings. It was found that during decomposition, the golf balls dissolved to release a high quantity of heavy metals. Dangerous levels of zinc were found in the synthetic rubber filling used in solid core golf balls. When submerged in water, the zinc attached itself to the ground sediment and poisoned the surrounding flora and fauna. Course manager for the Danish Golf Union, Torben Kastrup Petersen, said the scale of the problem is unknown: ""There has been very little research on the environmental impact of golf balls, but it's safe to say the indicators are not good. We are planning to collaborate with environmentalists in America to conduct more tests to fully explore the extent of the problem."" Local government ministers in Scotland have also complained about the level of golf ball littering.  UK lawmaker Patrick Harvie told CNN: ""From the moon to the bottom of Loch Ness, golf balls are humanity's signature litter in the most inaccessible locations."" And he's not wrong. On February 6, 1971, astronaut Alan Shepherd was filmed taking a swing with a six iron on the surface of the moon. According to Shepherd, the balls flew off in the distance and landed a few kilometers away. Although the balls were left for future golfers to discover, it is believed the extreme temperatures on the surface would have dissolved the balls many moons ago. In many cases, removing a partially degraded ball from a lake or woodland area could result in further damage to the wildlife. So what is the solution? Harvie had this advice: ""Keep your balls on the fairway or invest in a stock of biodegradable balls.""","It takes 100 to 1,000 years for a golf ball to degrade .

"(CNN) -- As the story goes, in 2010 there was a dramatic political course correction. The electorate that just two years earlier had overwhelmingly voted for hope and change, sweeping Democrats into office, up and down the ballot, across the country, had buyers' remorse. America changed its mind after 2008 and broke hard for the tea party, building a wave that would devastate Democrats. At least that's the conventional lazy narrative about the 2010 midterm elections. That narrative draws a picture of a tea party wave that swept Republicans to victory on the back of a set of conservative policies in reaction to President Barack Obama and Democrats. As often is the case with Washington, reality and spin aren't necessarily on the same page. Reality is actually a little different; well no, it's actually really, really different than the tea party wave narrative would have you believe. And as we are a few weeks out from the 2014 midterm elections where many believe Democrats are poised once again to be battered into oblivion by another tea party wave, it's important to dissect what happened in 2010 and why there is a possibility that this time might be a little different from what conventional wisdom is trying to tell you. The 2010 tea party wave is a lie. In truth, if you look at the enormous drops in voter participation from 2008 or 2012 in comparison with 2010, instead of referring to it as the ""2010 Tea Party wave election"" a more accurate description might be ""the 2010 Democratic ebb election."" Ebb is a particularly fitting depiction because much of the 2010 election dynamic that helped Republicans then, and which the GOP is banking on for this November as well, can be explained by the rush back away from the polls of the younger diverse wave that swung the country toward Democrats two years earlier. Indeed, when we analyze the voter file (looking precinct by precinct at the number of voters in 2012 versus the number in 2010) across a sampling of key battleground states with critical down-ballot and federal races at either the congressional or Senate level (North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio, Florida and Virginia) to see in reality who is voting and not voting, what you find is that not all midterm drop-off is geopolitically equal. The reality is that Republicans had a much smaller drop in turnout in the midterm compared with the presidential election. In key battlegrounds, Republicans have a 17-point advantage in the actual voter turnout between base Democratic precincts and base Republican precincts. While base Republican precincts remain fairly energized from presidential to midterm elections, Democratic base precincts do not. In these key battleground states, 65-plus performing Democratic precincts (precincts that vote Democratic at a rate of 65% or better -- in other words, Democratic base) turned out at 34%, while Republican 65-plus precincts (precincts that vote Republican at a rate of 65% or better -- base Republican) turned out at 51% as a percentage of registration. Those precincts in the middle between the two ideological bases turned out at a rate of 44%. That in a nutshell is how Democrats lost in 2010 and how Republicans are poised to have a stellar year again in 2014 -- not a wave, but a Democratic base ebb. If Democratic base precincts across the battleground states turn out on average 17 points lower than Republicans precincts in November, Republicans will take the Senate and swell their majority in the House of Representatives along with their numbers in statehouses across the country. Regardless of how brilliant our candidates are, or how well our campaigns are run, Democrats simply aren't going to win if our base precinct turnout is some 40 points off from the presidential election. That's not theory, that's just cold hard math. Yes, Democrats have to persuade swing voters, but there isn't enough persuasion in the world to make up for a 17 percentage-point difference between Democratic base precincts and Republican base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone. Republicans get that midterms are all about firing up their base. The election map and history are set up to create a perfect storm for Republicans to run up the score and have a spectacular year; the only thing standing between them having a spectacular year and simply a good year is the Democratic Party's base. A base that has been underestimated before by Washington conventional wisdom. Note, much of the conventional thinking in 2012 had Obama in a really tight race, if not outright losing to Mitt Romney, and Republicans making net gains in the Senate. In actuality, the race wasn't really that close as Obama won by an electoral landslide and Democrats picked up seats in both the House and Senate. Many observers, riding on the backs of Republican pollsters' models that miscalculated the Democratic base, missed the possibility of a rising and determined, diverse younger electorate in 2012 that would ultimately lay waste to their perceived reality. If Democrats have any chance of surviving the perfect midterm storm on the horizon, it will be because the same underestimated younger and diverse cohort of voters that anchored the Obama majorities are awakened and engaged. As it stands now, they are not. But there are signs that their value to civic participation has been stirred, and they are looking for vehicles to express their voice for change. You hear elements of it in the grass-roots protest by young people happening now; you hear it in their anxious frustrated refrain, ""Hands up don't shoot,"" which has spread from Ferguson, Missouri, to across the globe. The question is: Will that refrain become hands up go vote as these younger diverse voters connect their frustration to the ballot box in post-Obama campaigns?

"(CNN) -- ""Crossfire"" is back, and just look how much life has changed since that first show in 1982. The clothes. The hair. The music. Yeah, we love the '80s, too. In the early years, the political debate show was all about the Cold War, Reagan administration, death penalty, sex education -- and bow-ties, big glasses and tweed blazers with diagonally striped ties. The first show on June 25, 1982, focused on Alexander Haig's resignation as secretary of state. ""Crossfire"" Classic: '88 comments on Middle East, Syria ring true today . These days, 31 years later, we're just as diverse on the daily commentary. Syria is weighing heavily on our minds, but then we just can't seem to stop talking about Miley Cyrus' over-the-top twerking performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. Culturally so much has changed. With ""Crossfire's"" return, we invited CNN readers to dish on life in the '80s. Many readers talked about coming of age and finding themselves during that era, with a little help from heavy metal, hairspray and MTV. These are some of our favorite takeaways: . Early '80s fashions were ""simply outrageous."" Stripes and polka dots combined, frilly dresses with leggings topped with leg warmers and tennis shoes, were just a few of the styles, wrote Yvonne Coverdale. ""My favorite clothing at that time to relax in public was a pair of black pants with a white or red stripe down the sides, a double breasted white or black tunic blouse and knee-high black leather boots; two-inch black leather belt optional."" ""Crossfire"" Classic: Frank Zappa on dirty lyrics . Music defined us. T. Ray Verteramo fell in love with heavy metal, which was under heavy fire at the time by Tipper Gore and those of the self-proclaimed moral majority. It was a topic of discussion on ""Crossfire"" when Frank Zappa was a guest. Verteramo believed it to be an issue of free speech. The experience shaped her. ""When you're judged so readily, so quickly, and so harshly for so long, it's hard not to become more empathetic. My tastes haven't changed and I'll never use hairspray again. But my appreciation and gratitude to be able to enjoy and share the music I love freely has definitely grown."" Music was also a unifying force. Growing up in Illinois, Janee Blackwell Cifuentes was transcending race and making friends from all different cultures. ""People may not like you on the outside, but they soften up when you sing them a song they can relate to,"" she said. ""I remember white kids in my neighborhood ... being amazed when they found out Journey was one of my all-time favorite groups and I could sing all of their songs."" ""Crossfire"" Classic: Falwell opposes MLK day in 1983 . There was a time before business casual and dress down Fridays. Corporate attire involved scarves tied in bows, dress pants, blazers and pumps. Marjorie Zien dug up this gem of the IT team at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in New York in 1985. ""When I look at the photo, it all seems so formal to me. It was as if we were wearing a uniform, which I guess in some ways, we were."" We were divided on Reagan. Ronald Reagan took office as president in 1981, wrote Janie Lambert, and ""within minutes, the Iran hostages were released. I was relieved and happy that he had been elected, having very high hopes for the next four years."" 1988 ""Crossfire"" Classic: Soviet military capabilities . During that same time, Hilary Ohm was protesting against nuclear weapons, America's involvement in Central America and Reagan's economic policies, which she believed were ""cruel and would hurt the poor and give the rich more wealth."" Cliff Olney voted for Reagan the first time around, but switched parties after Reagan fired more than 11,000 striking air traffic controllers in 1981. Olney is now a progressive Democrat ""thanks to Reagan's 'trickle-down economics' that never trickled down,"" he said. Life was simpler. At least, that's how we remember those times, ""when we weren't always so plugged in or bombarded with data,"" wrote Ellen Jo Roberts, now 41. It also seemed easier to pursue your dreams, said Marie Sager, who was a recently divorced mom of two boys in 1981. She found work as a ""helicopter hooker"" and later started her own helicopter company. ""Today that's not so, most people have to take whatever comes their way,"" Sager wrote. ""For me, the '80s were great. Even being a single parent, we managed to do OK."" But it wasn't all sunshine and roses. Generation X grew up ""with the threat of global thermal nuclear war and under the specter of AIDS,"" Roberts wrote. ""I like to joke now that the freewheeling baby boomers, with their sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, got to have all the fun, leaving us with ""Just Say No"" and songs like Jermaine Stewart's 'We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off (to Have a Good Time).' However, we were lucky to be witness to new wave, the early days of beatbox and hip-hop and the earliest inkling of an environmental movement."" ""Crossfire"" Classic: KKK Grand Wizard in 1982 . And we wished E.T. was real. After the Steven Spielberg movie came out in 1982, Lambert's 5-year-old daughter, Jennie, was enthralled. ""She thought having an E.T. would be such a fun thing. She even invented a pretend E.T. of her own and would play for hours."" If there was a full or almost-full moon, she would watch out the window to see if she could spot the alien.

"SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (CNN) -- The official count of confirmed deaths grew to 15 Friday afternoon, one day after a 6.1-magnitude earthquake shook north central Costa Rica, a government emergency official said. iReporter Leonardo Diaz photographed the damage in Plaza Mayor Shopping Center in San Jose. Reinaldo Carballo, a spokesman for the federal Commission for National Emergencies, said the updated death toll came from information given to the agency by Costa Rica Vice President Rodrigo Arias. In addition, Carballo said, rescuers were trying to reach 300 tourists stranded in a hotel in Varablanca. Carballo said he did not know the tourists' nationalities or the name of the hotel. There were conflicting reports on the number of dead from Thursday's earthquake. The Commission for National Emergencies had issued a news release earlier Friday saying the quake had killed four people. Also earlier Friday, Red Cross official Milton Chaverri told CNN there were 14 dead and 22 missing. Red Cross spokeswoman Fiorella Vilca said Friday afternoon there were nine dead and 42 missing. The discrepancy may result from the fact that the Commission for National Emergencies reports only deaths it has confirmed, Carballo said. About 32 people were injured, he said. On Friday, the U.S. government dispatched a team of 34 U.S. military personnel and four helicopters from Honduras-based Joint Task Force-Bravo to Costa Rica to assist. Survivors described the suddenness and brutality of the quake. Landslides, tumbling rocks and collapsed buildings caused widespread devastation and death. ""I saw how the earth moved and how it took my family -- my aunt, my cousin and her babies,"" Miguel Angel Marin told CNN affiliate Teletica TV. ""It was very hard because I wanted to save them, but I couldn't."" A sobbing Vilma Cambronero was asked what happened to her family. ""Some are well,"" she said. ""Others are buried."" An unidentified woman told Teletica, ""Everything started to move and everything fell on top of us. It was a miracle we got out."" More than 1,200 people were stranded, without a way to get out of towns or homes, Chaverri said. Another 1,000 people were living in shelters, he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video . ""Many people were injured, many buildings were damaged and landslides blocked roads in the area,"" the U.S. Geological Survey said. The dead included three young girls, officials said Friday. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez was scheduled to tour the affected area Friday. On Thursday, he appealed for calm. The remote area near Alajuela, where the quake hit strongest, is difficult to reach, and officials said they were having to rely on helicopters for medical evacuations and to airlift supplies. Randall Picado, a government rescue official, said many residents were without water and other necessities. About 400 volunteers and Red Cross personnel were giving aid in 15 communities, Chaverri said. The temblor was felt throughout Costa Rica and in southern and central Nicaragua, the U.S. Geological Survey reported on its Web site. ""I felt the earthquake,"" Costa Rican office worker Erick Solorzano told CNN in an iReport message. ""I work in a sixth floor, and it was very strong. We felt the building was going to collapse."" About 2,000 aftershocks have been felt in San Jose, the capital, and other cities throughout the nation, Red Cross spokeswoman Vilca said. The Geological Survey placed the earthquake's epicenter at 20 miles (32 kilometers) north-northwest of San Jose at a depth of 2.8 miles (4.5 kilometers).","NEW: Rescuers trying to reach 300 tourists stranded in hotel .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Two U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers were killed by a homemade bomb while supporting anti-terror operations on an island in the southern Philippines, Army officials said Thursday. Staff Sgt. Jack M. Martin III, left, and Sgt. 1st Class Christopher D. Shaw were killed Tuesday. Sgt. 1st Class Christopher D. Shaw, 37, and Staff Sgt. Jack M. Martin III, 26, died after a bomb exploded Tuesday near their Humvee on the island of Jolo, said Lt. Col. David King. Both soldiers were based at Fort Lewis, about 40 miles south of Seattle. King said the soldiers were working with members of the Filipino military on a project to build a school when they were killed. One Filipino soldier was also killed, and two more were wounded, he said. Tuesday's bombing, King said, was the second fatal attack on Americans working with the Filipinos. In 2002, a U.S. Marine was killed by a bomb set by the militant group Abu Sayyaff. It was Shaw's second deployment to the Philippines and the first for Martin, who served in Iraq, according to a news release from U.S. Army Special Forces Command. ""We lost a husband, father, son, brother and uncle,"" Shaw's family said. ""Chris was a man who deeply loved his family and believed that he was making a difference in the fight against terror."" Shaw was married with five children, according to the Army release. Both men were awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart and Meritorious Service Medal posthumously. Jolo is a well known stronghold for Abu Sayyaff, which is fighting to establish a separate Muslim state. The U.S. military is providing support and training to the Philippines in the battle against the terrorist group, which has ties to al Qaeda. King said it was not immediately clear who was responsible for the latest bombing. ""Abu Sayyaff has not claimed responsibility,"" he said. ""It's still being investigated if they were responsible, but the Filipino military is certainly going down that road."" About 600 U.S. military personnel serve in the Philippines at any one time, King said. Their mission is to assist the Filipino military and build support among the civilian population, he said. U.S. soldiers taking part in the mission are not allowed to engage militants unless acting in self defense. ""Despite what Hollywood portrays about Special Forces being the tip of the spear,"" King said, ""a good part of the mission is developmental projects like helping local schools and building wells.""","Christopher D.

"(CNN) -- Late last month in Aleppo, Syria, civilians who have cell phone subscriptions received a foreboding text message in Arabic: ""Game over."" Those on prepaid phones -- including many opposition fighters and activists, who tend to throw their devices away after several uses to avoid detection -- did not receive the text, or subsequent messages, signed by the Syrian Arab Army, telling them to surrender their weapons. ""The government was sending a message to the rebels through people who subscribe,"" says Taufiq Rahim, a Dubai-based Arab affairs analyst -- an act of psychological warfare carried out by cell phone. The texts have increased Syria watchers' concerns that the embattled government has realized both the full potential of using the Internet and mobile carriers to communicate with its leaderless opposition, and the importance of the networks as domestic and international lifelines for the rebels. Defecting Syrian propagandist says his job was 'to fabricate' There are growing fears that the regime could shut down the Internet across the country, similar to what was done in Egypt during its January 2011 uprising, which brought communication in Cairo to a near standstill. ""There have been enough rumors that the more tech-savvy folks are expecting it,"" says Jillian C. York, director for international freedom of expression for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which works to defend digital rights. ""In Egypt, you could say no one would have expected that."" Last month, the network was down for 10 days in Aleppo, the current focal point of the fighting, with activists and rebels communicating largely by satellite phone until service was restored September 20. Fareed Zakaria: Why Syria turmoil threatens Middle East . But perhaps the biggest red flag came in July, when the government-controlled Syrian Telecommunications Establishment shut down 61 of its 66 networks, effectively cutting off the country's Internet for about 40 minutes. Since the summer, smaller, infrequently reported outages have plagued Damascus, Aleppo and other hard-hit cities. ""Since it's state telecom that provides access, it's safe to say the government could turn the Internet off at any point,"" says Doug Madory, senior analyst at Renesys, a firm which tracks Internet data and intelligence and has been monitoring the situation in Syria. ""The outages we've seen in the last couple of months appear to be because of physical damage from fighting, or from power outages. They're short-lived, they flicker on and off. We've seen some Internet being (purposely) disabled in more disruptive parts of the country, like Aleppo."" Two weeks ago, rebels angry with the government's mass text intensified their attacks against forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. The escalation resulted in the partial destruction of Aleppo's storied covered souk, a heritage site since its days as a Silk Road trading post. It also triggered an increase in violence in the decimated city, where rebels Tuesday continued to advance with the seizing of Maaret al-Numan, a key strategic town on the road between Aleppo and Damascus. ""In a military zone, like Aleppo has become, the government can still communicate but opposition forces will have a very hard time"" should the network crash again, Rahim says. ""I think it'll happen in a case of desperation. I wouldn't be surprised if for some reason they took down a few towers in Aleppo."" Who is arming the Syrian conflict? The Syrian Internet market is a state monopoly. Unlike neighboring Lebanon, whose 3 million citizens have access to 900 Internet routes out of the country, Syria's 30 million people only have 66. ""It's a country with state control over the Internet,"" Madory says. ""There's no free market."" Fadi Salem, a Syrian scholar and activist, believes it's in al-Assad's best interest to keep the networks running. ""They're interested in measuring and assessing what's happening and trying to listen in, and even penetrate, and spy on activists and collect information,"" he says. And the regime has a history of discounting the global influence of activist bloggers. ""They don't think (the opposition) has the ear of the international media anyway,"" Madory says. ""So they want their supporters to be able to voice any opinion that's (pro-regime). And they'll want to allow their supporters to use the Internet to voice those opinions. ""It's the only reason why they haven't taken it down."" But just in case, activists are prepared. ""The standard government-controlled networks are not the only way of communication -- there are also satellite phones and Internet connection and landline phones,"" York says. ""So it would be a setback, but it's not going to cut off communications if people are prepared for it."" ""Much of the opposition rely on satellite phones more than anything else,"" Salem adds. During Aleppo's 10-day blackout, ""activists there were still able to upload videos and the like."" It's hard to predict twists and turns in Aleppo, where there is general lawlessness. ""Some groups under the Free Syrian Army are actually doing a lot of bandit-like action, looting government buildings, and for them it's justified,"" Salem says. ""Activists inside are angry about this, because they want to preserve the state and all its establishments while they try to remove the regime.""

"(CNN) -- Nineteen inmates were injured when a roof of a private prison collapsed Saturday near Lufkin, Texas, fire officials said. Ten prisoners were taken to hospitals by ambulance, and nine were transported as ""walking wounded"" from Diboll Correctional Center to area hospitals, according to prison officials. At 11:30 a.m., the sheetrock ceiling of one of the five housing units in the prison collapsed, according to Management & Training Corporation (MTC), which operates the prison. ""We are still trying to determine the cause of the collapse,"" said a statement by MTC. A local fire official on the scene wasn't sure what may have caused the collapse, or whether it's related to heavy rainfall in Texas recently. ""It's not raining at all today here. We got a lot of rain yesterday. It's a new building, a new facility. I don't know why the roof would collapse,"" said Lufkin Fire Department Battalion Chief Jesse Moody. David Driskell, the prison's warden, said, ""It probably had a lot to do with the rain over the last couple days."" Diboll Correctional Center has a maximum capacity of 518 inmates and is managed by MTC, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website. MTC, a private contractor based in Centerville, Utah, manages 22 prisons in eight states, according to the company website, and also operates 21 Job Corps programs for the U.S. Department of Labor.","Prison is near Lufkin, Texas .

"(CNN) -- On the sixth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, CNN asked users to share their stories of heroes from that fateful day and how they were being remembered. Sarah Glasgow of Easton, Pennsylvania, sent this photo of a 9/11 memorial made up of flags and shoes. Below is a selection of those responses, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Joshua Miller of Peoria, Illinois I would like to remember Patrick ""Joe"" Driscoll today. He lost his life aboard United Airlines Flight 93 on the morning of September 11, 2001. He was traveling with his friend, Billy Cashman, from New Jersey to California for a hiking trip. Joe was a man in his 70s who had had heart bypass surgery and hip replacement surgery. These physical setbacks didn't stop a feisty guy from New York City. He went on to live an active life. He was a fighter who had a gentle side. He adored his grandchildren, his children, and his wife. Joe is greatly missed. So many of us are so very proud of him. To ease my grief over the losses we all share from that terrible day, I often think of the passage from the gospel of John: ""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."" Thank you, Joe. You did just that. Jennifer Brower of Alexandria, Virginia Ray Downey, the most decorated firefighter in the history of New York City, a tireless soldier in the battle for the safety and security of the people of the United States, and an amazing father and grandfather, died in the command post in New York City on September 11, 2001. I had the honor of getting to know Ray through our work on the Gilmore Commission. My daughter is named after him, and he is a constant source of inspiration whenever I am scared to do things. I do not know whether he was scared, but it certainly never stopped him. Anne-Marie Canter of San Francisco, California I had three heroes on that day. Two of them were firemen walking up the stairs of the North Tower as we were all walking down and out. We had been backed up on the stairwells and some people were starting to panic but when the two firemen came up and told us all to carry on walking, we would get out and they just walked up the stairs past us. They had such brave, courageous faces and their voices were so confident. They carried on up the stairs and we all felt much better and continued our way down. We all got out but I don't think they did and I will never forget those brave faces and the hope their strong voices gave us. My other hero is my friend Debbie -- she walked down next to me all the way and kept cheerful and even managed to make me smile when she made a joke about what a mess our mascara must be -- it sounds silly but at that point we all had no idea what was going on outside but we needed to distract ourselves from some of the smells and sounds in the stairwell and seeing someone so calm made me feel a lot calmer. We all are so much stronger than we think, and our actions have such an impact on those around us. Jennifer Taylor of Upland, California I believe that those of us who have continued on with our lives, continued to travel, work, pray, love and care for one another and stand by our way of life are heroes! I believe all of those who lost their lives that day would have wanted no less. We will never forget you, not one of you!!! Theju Mudda of Bangalore, India My deep condolences to the innocent people who got killed in the 9/11 event. The event should be remembered as Heroes Day --- for the people who sacrificed their lives trying to save other lives and for the people who gave their lives for no mistake of theirs. God bless their families! Emory Baird of Brodnax, Virginia A quick game of shuffleboard [was] interrupted by an intercom announcement declaring one of the Trade Center towers had been hit by a stray plane. Completely oblivious to what was happening, I continued my game. As a result of the events and disappointment in myself over my reaction, I am now a state certified firefighter. I can only pray for the courage you all showed. A special thanks to FDNY, we haven't forgotten you. From Company 2 to you, thank you. You set the example for the world. Gil Gonzales of Houston, Texas My heartfelt prayers go out to the families of all who died on 9/11. May God help them overcome their grief. Christina Joseph of Chicago, Illinois As a person who was there in NYC watching the monuments of my city fall down, I can only remember the compassion. The firefighters who came from all over the United States to help, to offer support and just to be there. The many doors of religious organizations that were open day and nights to offer solace. One such church was on Park Avenue near Grand Central and it had a sign that just said ""come in and sit"" and it did not matter who you were, where you came from, we all needed each other. We still do. Daniel S. Martin of Manchester, Connecticut My younger brother who is an American Airlines pilot flew on 9/11/01 from Boston's Logan to NYC's Kennedy and finally San Diego. He left Boston around 6 or 6:30 a.m., landed in NYC, took off no problem and headed to the West Coast around 8:30 or so. ... Unfortunately, we all know the rest of the story. ... He was ordered to land in Indiana, which he did, arriving safely (knees shaking!) with his crew, passengers and aircraft. ... He's my hero. Benedict Albensi of Winnipeg, Manitoba I am an American who lives and works in Winnipeg as a medical professor. I have been flying the American flag in my neighborhood all week as a tribute to those heroes and other victims who lost their lives on 9/11. Last July here in Winnipeg, someone put a Nazi swastika on my car's American flag sticker. So now I fly the U.S. flag a lot more than I used to. It is not trendy to be an American in many foreign countries right now. Living in a foreign country I find myself having to advocate why the USA is still the greatest country in the world. It is a tough sell these days. As Americans we have to let the world know that America has problems but we are not ""the"" problem. J.E. Seaman of Huntington, New York We never mention nearly often enough the flight attendants on all the planes, but especially AA Flight 11. Talk about guts, they identified the hijackers before the first plane hit. Talk about professionals! Talk about the courageous! Matt Williams of Katy, Texas I will be honoring the many victims and heroes of that day by wearing a 9/11 pin that was given to me by an Army buddy of mine. This will be the fourth year that I will wear it. I wear it only September 11. Natasha Jenkins of Ottawa, Kansas I was a senior in high school, sitting in a college prep class, early on the morning of September 11, 2001. I remember my English teacher hustling into the room to share the news about the first tower being hit just as our class was starting. Unknowing, I made a silly comment to the English teacher about something random and I'll never forget the look she gave me. Once we had the TV tuned in to CNN, I felt as though my innocence and naive nature had been forever changed. This year, I will remember the fallen with my own students, as this is my first year of teaching. I plan on discussing the event, the aftermath, and the memories with my sophomore world history students. Tim of Dothan, Alabama ""Heroes""? A media term we sometimes use for comfort. Perhaps it's easier to reconcile the deaths of 3,000 of our fellow Americans if we refer to them as heroes -- it implies that they died for a noble reason. Perhaps it's less traumatic to lose a loved one if we can justify calling them a ""hero."" But the sad fact is, many of those we lost, including my brother, simply got up that morning to face another (supposed) mundane day on the job. It's been six years, and the word ""hero"" still brings no comfort, no reconciliation. Justin Wright of Salt Lake City, Utah I remember it as clear as day. You don't ever forget images like what I saw on the television that morning or throughout the remainder of that particular day. The mere fact that United Airlines Flight 93 didn't make it to its target is a simple testimony to the spirit and dogged fight that there is in the people of this country. I think of those who gave their lives. ... May God bless all those on 9/11/01 who went before us. Laura Keefner of Great Barrington, Massachusetts My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of 9/11 and their families and our country. That horrific day lives in my mind and I will never forget. A flag hangs outside my house every day, and I hope the rest of America displays the flag this day and every day. This is your country, and people flock here every day because of all the USA has to offer. I am proud to be an American and I wish the country could go back to the days after 9/11 when we were so united and proud of our country. Now there is so much bickering between political parties and the American people. God bless all the victims of 9/11, all policemen, emergency workers, firefighters and our military. They are my true heroes. Michael White of London, England When the planes flew into the World Trade Center, I just could not believe it. Afterwards, I was contracted to expand the fiber optics at the morgue to accommodate the newly installed trailers for identification of the dead. I watched as our fallen firefighters and police officers' remains were brought in for identification. I don't think I will ever forget the heroes who gave their lives for others.

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- BP is conducting a long-awaited procedure to permanently seal its crippled well in the Gulf of Mexico. It's proceeding with a complex operation known as a ""static kill,"" pumping heavy drilling mud down from above to push oil back into the well reservoir. The effort could take ""something in the range of a bunch of  hours to a couple of days,"" BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said Tuesday afternoon in a telephone conference. ""We're extremely focused at this point in making sure we execute the static kill as best we can."" The operation started about 4 p.m. ET. BP may pause the procedure from time to time to measure pressure and evaluate how it's working, Wells said. It's still unclear whether the mud will be followed by cement, according to Wells. Engineers will evaluate that as they proceed.  They may decide to wait until a relief well is completed in an accompanying well-killing effort known as a ""bottom kill"" -- intended to serve as an insurance policy that the well is sealed. That could happen about a week from now. The static kill is the biggest development in the long-running saga involving BP's well since a tightly fitting cap was placed on it in mid-July, stopping oil from flowing into the Gulf for the first time in almost three months. It represents the beginning of the end of the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history. Some reporters were allowed on the Q4000,  the ship that is pumping the mud, as the static kill got under way. The operation took place under blue skies in clear blue seas -- in sharp contrast to scenes in the Gulf weeks ago, when oil covered vast swaths of water. ""All I can say is that everything looks good. Everything is going the way we want it to,"" said Bobby Bolton, a BP representative on the ship. In previous operations, when BP was testing the ""integrity"" of the well, it wanted to see rising pressure readings, indicating the capped well was holding up. But in the static kill, declining pressure is a good sign, indicating the mud is proceeding down the well without seepage. That was indeed the case Tuesday, according to Bolton. He said pressure was dropping steadily. In late afternoon, it had dropped from more than 6,900 pounds per square inch to about 4,500 pounds per square inch. The ship's captain, Keith Shultz, said it also was important to keep the ship very stable during the static kill, and the vessel was being kept within a meter of its position. BP proceeded with the static kill after conducting a crucial test to determine if oil in the capped well could actually be pushed back down into the reservoir and it was safe to proceed. In the ""injectivity"" test, a surface ship slowly injected small amounts of mud into the well at several different rates to make sure the mud would reach the reservoir. Senior Vice President Wells said the test was ""textbook. It went exactly as we would have expected."" BP said that all the operations are being carried out with the approval of the federal official overseeing the response to the oil spill, retired Adm. Thad Allen. The injectivity test had been delayed because of a small hydraulic leak discovered in the capping stack hydraulic control system. But BP and Allen said earlier Tuesday the leak had been fixed by crews overnight. ""The leak involved two valves that are on the kill side of the capping stack and they started to lose pressure. We found that out in time and locked the valve shut. And, had the valves failed for any particular reason, that might have caused hydrocarbons to go into the environment and that's not good,"" Allen said. Allen emphasized that relief wells being drilled are the ""answer"" to plugging the ruptured well. ""I think all of our hopes and aspirations are that this thing will come to an end,"" Allen said, discussing the entire spill ordeal. ""It's been an agonizing period for the people of the Gulf and the United States in general."" Meanwhile, scientists charged with determining the flow from the leaking well said Monday that roughly 4.9 million barrels (205.8 million gallons) of oil have seeped from it.  About 800,000 barrels of that were retrieved by siphoning vessels on the surface over the leak.  Previously, the same group had put the total estimate of oil leaked from the well before it being capped on July 15 at between 3 million and 5.2 million barrels. According to CNN data, this makes it the worst-ever accidental oil spill in marine waters. It all started when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20, killing 11 workers and launching the relentless oil spill. That prompted a wide-ranging response that involved dispersants, burning oil on the surface of the water and gathering it with skimming ships, trying to prevent it from reaching shore with booms and collecting oil debris from beaches across the Gulf with an army of BP workers. The BP spill surpassed the 1979 Ixtoc 1 blowout in the Bay of Campeche off the coast of Mexico, which resulted in 140 million gallons of oil being spilled. The worst oil spill of all time was intentional.  During the Gulf War, the Iraqi Army purposely released 240 million gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf. When the BP well was capped in the Gulf of Mexico in July, scientists said some 53,000 barrels of oil per day were leaking from it, while roughly 62,000 barrels of oil were likely gushing from it each day at the beginning of the incident. ""We knew from the start it was a catastrophic spill,"" Allen said. Meanwhile, BP said Wednesday it has started ""a series of actions to expedite claim payments to businesses"" affected by the spill. ""We heard from many business people who are suffering, so we acted.  These changes are designed to cut through paperwork and expedite payments,"" said Darryl Willis of the BP claims team. The company said about 2,600 business claims were processed over the past three days with new guidelines. ""As a result, business claims totaling $9 million were approved Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  These payments will be mailed to businesses this week,"" BP said in a press release. CNN's Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.","NEW: BP representative aboard Q4000 says static kill proceeding smoothly .

"(CNN) -- The British government condemned China's execution of a British national Tuesday on drug smuggling charges. ""I ... am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted,"" Prime Minister Gordon Brown said. ""I am particularly concerned that no mental health assessment was undertaken."" Akmal Shaikh was convicted of carrying up to 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) of heroin at the Urumqi Airport in September 2007. According to Chinese law, 50 grams (1.76 ounces) is the threshold for the death penalty. China defended the execution in a statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in London. ""Drug trafficking is a grave crime worldwide,"" the statement said. ""The concerns of the British side have been duly noted and taken into consideration by the Chinese judicial authorities in the legal process, and Mr. Shaikh's rights and interests under Chinese law are properly respected and guaranteed."" The 53-year-old is the first European executed in China in 50 years, according to the British legal group Reprieve. The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Fu Ying, was summoned to the British Foreign Office in the hours following Shaikh's execution, the Foreign Office told CNN. The ambassador was set to meet Ivan Lewis, minister of state. ""I had a difficult conversation with the Chinese ambassador today,"" Lewis said in a statement following the meeting. ""I made clear that the execution of Mr. Shaikh was totally unacceptable and that China had failed in its basic human rights responsibilities in this case, in particular that China's court had not considered the representations made about Mr. Shaikh's mental condition."" ""We are deeply saddened, stunned and disappointed at the news of the execution of our beloved cousin, Akmal,"" Soohail and Nasir Shaikh said in a statement issued on behalf of the family. ""This was carried out this morning despite repeated requests for clemency and a proper appraisal of Akmal's mental state."" His family and the British government had asked Chinese leaders for clemency. His supporters argued that Shaikh was mentally ill, and that Chinese officials did not take his mental condition into account when trying him. Shaikh's advocates say he suffered from a bipolar disorder and that he was tricked into carrying heroin into China with promises of a career as a pop singer. ""The European Union condemns in the strongest terms the execution of Akmal Shaikh,"" the EU presidency said in a statement. ""It deeply regrets the fact that China has not heeded the repeated calls by the European Union and one of its member states for the death sentence passed against Mr. Shaikh to be commuted."" The EU remains opposed to capital punishment, the statement said. Brown raised Shaikh's case with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao during the international climate summit in Denmark earlier this month. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband echoed Gordon Brown's concerns about the execution. ""The UK is completely opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances,"" Miliband said. ""However, I also deeply regret the fact that our specific concerns about the individual in this case were not taken into consideration. ... These included mental health issues, and inadequate professional interpretation during the trial."" Sally Rowen, legal director with Reprieve, condemned the execution. ""The death of Akmal Shaikh is a sad indictment of today's world, and particularly of China's legal system,"" she said. ""Akmal was a gentle man who suffered from a tormenting illness ... and was betrayed and deliberately killed by one of the most powerful nations on Earth."" Before the execution, Philip Alston, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, said it would be a ""major step backwards for China"" to execute a mentally ill man. ""Both Chinese and international law clearly indicate that a person who committed a crime while suffering from significant mental illness should not be subjected to the death penalty,"" Alston said in a statement released by Reprieve. China expressed hope that the case would not affect the relationship between the two nations. ""We value the China-British relationship,"" said Jiang Yu, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman. ""So we hope the British authority can treat this matter rationally and not let it create new barrier between the two countries. I have emphasized that this is an independent criminal case. It has nothing to do with anything else.""","China defended the execution in a statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in London .

"(CNN) -- Bones and Mammoth. They're quite a team -- and they love a beach party. One is the wily veteran, a schemer who uses his years of experience to dictate play. The other is the powerhouse, the destroyer of opposition attacks. Between them they have forged one of the strongest partnerships on the international beach volleyball circuit, continuing a fine tradition in their native country. ""When you talk about beach volleyball you're thinking about Rio de Janeiro, Copacabana beach, so this is the home of beach volleyball,"" Emanuel ""Bones"" Rego tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""In the start it was a Brazilian sport and a USA sport, but right now beach volleyball is all around the world, many countries in Europe, and especially in Africa -- they have a lot of countries playing beach volleyball. ""Now I can say it's a world special party on the beach. Everybody can play, it's fun."" Brazil has won a gold or silver medal in every Olympics -- either in the men's or women's events -- since the sport's full debut at Atlanta '96. Rego triumphed with Ricardo Santos in 2004, and in combination with Alison ""Mammoth"" Cerutti he picked up silver at London 2012. Despite now being at the relatively advanced age of 40, he is hoping to take part in a sixth straight Games when Brazil is host in 2016 -- he already has the most Olympic appearances by any male beach player and a full collection of medals. ""I know for me it's a little bit harder because in 2016 I'll be 43 years old -- no other player plays at this age,"" Rego says. ""But you know it's a good feeling when you go to your own country to play at the Olympic Games. I want to be there, for sure."" Rego has been playing since he was 17, a mere waif from the city of Curitiba. ""I was so teeny -- no muscles just the bones -- but I'm still like that. This is the fun part. I'm still the real Bones."" At 27, Cerutti is the younger partner in the team. ""His nickname is Mammoth because he's big, he's a little bit slow -- but he's very strong,"" explains Rego. Cerutti also has a big tattoo of a mammoth on his side -- the nickname comes from the character Manny in the ""Ice Age"" films. ""This is a great partnership,"" Rego says. ""Beach volleyball is totally a team sport-- sometimes you are in bad position and your partner is the only one who can help you, so I trust a lot in Alison because he has saved me a lot of times. ""Alison is the best blocker at this moment and he makes me very fired up during the game. He puts his emotions into the game - that makes me happy on court, so this is my perfect partner."" They won the world title in Rome in 2011 -- Rego's third -- and reached the final at London 2012. ""I am not the player that hits the ball very fast but I am trying to control the velocity of the game, using my experience to do the best shots,"" he says. Cerutti adds: ""Emanuel's best quality is his concentration on court. He's very focused, and always helps in crucial moments. It's important."" They were unable to defend their world title in Poland in July -- losing in the semifinals to Rego's former partner Santos and Alvaro Morais Filho -- but they had plenty of support from the home fans. Rego even has his own fan club in Poznan, having been a yearly visitor to the East European country since 2004. ""They came yelling ... very, very loud -- anyone can hear them: Emanuel! Emanuel! But this is the motivation you have when you come here in Poland,"" says Rego, who has split with Cerutti until the end of this season so they can respectively train Evandro and Vitor Felipe -- who have already formed a promising partnership. ""I enjoy the Polish people and they enjoy me, so they enjoy beach volleyball -- so we create a good relationship. They cheer for us and I give all that I have to them just to keep this friendship."" It is this passion which has inspired Rego to become one of the most successful players in the history of beach volleyball, and which spurs him on to further glory. ""I've been lucky all these years because this sport is very passionate and I have a lot of passion,"" he says. ""I saw this growing of beach volleyball as a sport, as a style of life. That's why I keep the inspiration to keep playing. ""I'm still in the top of the beach volleyball because I learn how to develop my game every year . Every year I start to learn something new; this is the real development because you need to see where your mistakes to improve. ""Beach volleyball you play every weekend so you have a chance to improve all the time. This is the right path for the young players -- keep continuing the development, keep evolving.""","Emanuel Rego and Alison Cerutti are one of Brazil's top beach volleyball teams .

"(CNN) -- A detail in the fatal shooting of 14-year-old Shaaliver Douse by a New York Police Department officer earlier this month has been stopping me from grieving his death. The tragedy happened around 3 a.m. Why was a 14-year-old boy out that late without his mother, Shanise Farrar, who called the shooting an assassination? Or his aunt, Quwana Barcene, who said the bloody gun police say was found near his body was part of a coverup? Where was the supervising adult who should have been with a 14-year-old boy walking the streets of New York at 3 o'clock in the morning? ""I'm not saying that he's the best one, but he's my angel,"" his grieving mother said. Her ""angel"" was a suspected gang member who police say was chasing and shooting at an unidentified man when they encountered him. Her ""angel"" was arrested last month for attempted murder of a 15-year-old. Her ""angel"" left their apartment around 8 p.m. and she had no idea where he was until the next morning when detectives informed her that her son was dead. I want to mourn for her loss, I really do. But as callous and as heartless as this sounds, I just can't get past what awful parents she and the boy's father were. Children may be born angels, but with all the temptations out there in the world, it takes work to try to keep them that way. I'm sure the three teenagers suspected in the death of 23-year-old Christopher Lane -- killed because they allegedly were bored -- started off as angels. But who, besides their parents, would call them angels now? ""I know my son. He's a good kid,"" said Jennifer Luna, the mother of the boy prosecutor Jason Hicks said pulled the trigger. As a newspaper reporter, I covered and was around a fair number of crime scenes involving juvenile delinquents and few things bothered me more than listening to their parents. Crying, ranting, proclaiming how great their children were despite being kicked out of school or previous run-ins with the law. That's not to say kids won't be kids. Of course they will be. Which is why it is vitally important that parents be parents. So when kids get bored, they don't think they should go ""f**k with some n**gers,"" as then-18-year-old Deryl Dedmon Jr. suggested before he and his buddies ran over and killed 49-year-old auto worker James Craig Anderson, the first black person he saw, with his pickup truck back in 2011. Or randomly shoot a college student jogging down the street as entertainment -- though it seems the shooting may not have been as random as previously thought considering one of the suspects, who is black, tweeted that he hated white people back in April. Parents are supposed to instill a sense of right and wrong in their children and then keep up the due diligence necessary to make sure they don't veer off that path. When parents don't do that, we end up with three 15-year-olds assaulting and breaking the arm of a 13-year-old on a school bus in Florida. ""This is life. I am sorry what happened to the victim,"" Julian McKnight Sr., whose son Julian was one of the boys accused in the attack, said after a court appearance. A second appearance is scheduled later this month. ""It's just the way it is. My son ain't never been no bad person, he just got mixed with bad people, that's all ... he sorry."" I am not a perfect parent with all the answers. But I do know that it was the father, and not the son, who was apologizing -- and that, my friends, is our problem in a nutshell. We don't teach accountability, we don't expect accountability and I'm not even sure we even know what accountability looks like anymore. Some of us have become so addicted to pointing fingers at others for all the wrong that happens in our lives that self-assessment has become synonymous with blaming the victim. Yes, there are cultural factors that make parenting difficult. And sometimes a bad seed is just that. But none of this excuses us from taking personal responsibility where we can. I am tired of seeing ""sorry"" being used to cloak negligent parents. Sorry won't bring back Christopher Lane or James Craig Anderson. And they, too, were each somebody's ""angel."" If sorry is not good enough to protect a bartender who serves alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person who drives and kills someone, why is sorry good enough for parents who, through negligence, are culpable for the crimes their undisciplined children commit? If my son goes out and breaks the neighbor's window, I have to pay for it. Why is a window more sacred than another human life? We need to hold parents more accountable, both culturally and legally, for the actions of their children. Maybe then more parents will be more engaged in the lives of their children on the front end, rather than the back end, in front of a judge. Society has avenues for juveniles who refuse to obey their parents. But where are the safeguards for society when parents decide not to use those avenues? I'm tired of hearing how good the kids who commit heinous crimes are. Maybe we should start putting parents on the witness stand so they can tell us exactly what they did to raise such perfect children. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","14-year-old killed by officer at 3 a.m. LZ Granderson asks, where were the parents?

"(CNN) -- After thousands of years of civilization, finally India has Crunchwraps. In March, a Taco Bell opened in Bangalore, the first Indian outpost of the chain. About 2,500 people a day have been lining up to try burritos and quesadillas, helped out by employees hired to explain what, exactly, burritos and quesadillas are, according to reports. But Indian customers aren't just ordering the Tex-Mex treats known in the U.S. Yum Foods, Taco Bell's parent company, came up with a bunch of special menu items designed for local palates: crunchy potato tacos and extra-spicy burritos filled with paneer, the rubbery, fresh Indian cheese. This move is what people in the trade call product localization: customizing what you're selling to the people you're selling it to. It's a crucial strategy in the global fast-food business. American chains are bringing burgers and pizza and chimichangas to Asia, but they are also adapting to their new homes, coming up with hybrid foods that the folks back home don't hear about. This is nothing new, of course. McDonald's, which has branches in more than 119 countries, has been customizing its menus for years. Food court city: How where you live affects what you eat . Anyone who's seen ""Pulp Fiction"" knows that a McDonald's Quarter Pounder is called a Royal in France, but it's not just the names that are different. French visitors to the golden arches can get Le P'tit Moutarde, a smaller-size burger with mustard sauce, and they can pair it with a banana caramel shake. In the Netherlands, McDonald's serves a McKroket (a fried beef croquette on a bun); in Germany, it offers shrimp with cocktail sauce. The 280 Gr. is an Italy-only burger, designed for sophisticated palates -- you can get one with real Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. There's a burger on pita bread for the Greek market (the Greek Mac, of course), and a McKebab for Israel. Naturally, you can get guacamole on your burger in Mexico; you can also order McMolletes -- refried beans and salsa on an English muffin. Asia is the fastest-growing market for American fast food though, and all the chains trying to find a place there are scrambling to come up with new dishes to please local tastes. Here's some of what Americans may be missing: . India . As the Taco Bell honchos undoubtedly know, India is a tricky market for food chains. Hindus don't eat beef, Muslims don't eat pork, and a sizable percentage of the country doesn't eat meat at all. Fried chicken is a relatively safe bet, and KFC -- another Yum Foods-owned brand -- does a good business in buckets of Colonel Sanders' original recipe. But it also caters to vegetarians with a veg thali, a vegetable-and-rice mixed plate, and the Chana Snacker, a chickpea burger with Thousand Island dressing. The Indian Subway menu has the same turkey and tuna sandwiches as in U.S. stores, but roast beef is nowhere to be found, and the ham is made of chicken. And at franchises from Chandigarh to Chennai, you can order a chicken tikka sub or one made from roast lamb. When McDonald's set up shop in India in 1996, it ditched beef and introduced the Maharaja Mac, originally made with lamb. Chicken patties are used on the sandwich now, but even more popular is the vegetarian McAloo Tikki, a burger made from potatoes and peas. To allay strict dietary concerns, the carnivorous and vegetarian cooking is done separately, by different sets of workers: Those cooking the veggie meals wear green aprons; people handling meat wear red. The big fast-food success story is Domino's Pizza, which recently opened its 300th branch in India. It manages to please all tastes and honor all restrictions: There's a corn and black olive pizza for the vegetarians (the ""Gourmet"") and keema do pyaaza topping -- ground lamb and onions -- for meat eaters. For a true exotic taste, there's pepperoni: ""100 percent pork pepperoni,"" the online menu promises, rather scandalously. China . The leading American chain in the Chinese market, KFC, offers plenty of dishes that cater to local tastes. Instead of coleslaw, you can order seasonal vegetables with your chicken: bamboo shoots in spring, lotus root in summer. It also offers a traditional breakfast menu featuring congee -- rice porridge -- served with fried crullers or sesame flatbread for dipping. McDonald's, on the other hand, sticks mostly with classic sandwiches. After introducing regionally specific items, such as the rice burgers it serves in other Asian countries, and trying to compete with KFC on the chicken front, it found that its Chinese customers preferred to order Western foods. So it played up the burgers, rolling out a suggestive ad campaign with the slogan ""Feel the beef."" But not everything is exactly the same as it is in the States. A version of the Quarter Pounder (called the Big N' Beefy) is served with cucumbers rather than pickles and comes with a spicier sauce. If you don't want fries, you can order a corn cup, a side dish that has caught on at other Asian branches. For dessert, you can choose between pineapple or taro root pies. Japan . For its Japanese stores, McDonald's has found that novelty is the way to go, and the company has introduced lots of special menu items. You can pair your Teriyaki McBurger, made from pork, with a bag of Seaweed Shaker fries (add the seaweed powder yourself). You can get a Croquette Burger or a Bacon Potato Pie. Probably the most distinctively Japanese dish is the Ebi Filet-O, a fried shrimp patty on a bun (""ebi"" means shrimp in Japanese). McDonald's helped popularize the dish by signing up model Yuri Ebihara -- nicknamed ""Ebi-chan"" -- to do a series of print ads and commercials. A few years back, Pizza Hut Japan introduced the Double Roll, an over-the-top pizza to make all other over-the-top pizzas run away and cower in fear. One half (the ""gourmet half"") was topped with ham, bacon, sausage, tomatoes and garlic. The other half was covered with miniature hamburger patties, soybeans and corn. Sadly, the Double Roll is no longer sold, but that doesn't mean Pizza Hut is boring. Your topping choices include tuna, fried squid and spicy Korean-style beef. You also can get the ""Idaho Special"" with potato, corn, bacon and mayonnaise. South Korea . Dunkin' Donuts has made a big splash in South Korea, popularizing bagels and doughnuts as breakfast treats. Besides the standard American glazed and filled versions, it offers red bean and glutinous rice doughnuts as well as sweet potato muffins and a sesame tofu ring. There are savory fried croquettes filled with lentil curry or kimchi, spicy pickled cabbage. To drink, you can get a hot 12-grain latte, made from roasted barley, brown rice and other grains.","U.S. food chains adjust menus to local tastes in restaurants overseas .

"Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A 40-year-old mother of two was burned alive in central Nepal after she was accused of being a witch, police said Saturday. Dhegani Mahato was attacked and set on fire by family members and others after a shaman allegedly accused her of casting a spell to make one of her relatives sick, Police Officer Hira Mani Baral said. The attack occurred Friday in Bagauda in Chitwan district, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, Baral said by telephone. Police arrested 10 people, including two shamans, five women and an 8-year-old boy, in connection with the burning. ""Those arrested have confessed to their crime and will be charged with murder,"" Baral said. Mahato had just finished cleaning a cowshed early in the morning when she was attacked, Baral said. She was beaten with sticks and rocks before being doused with kerosene and set afire, an attack witnessed by her 9-year-old daughter, according to the local police report. Neighbors told police they were alerted to the attack but by then it was too late to save her. Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai appealed to the people not to heed to shamans and faith healers. The government announced 1 million Nepalese rupees (about $14,000) in compensation for Mahato's two children.","A shaman accused Dhegani Mahato of casting a spell to make a relative sick .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Cell phone users will get text message alerts of emergencies under a new nationwide alert system approved late Wednesday by the Federal Communications Commission, according to FCC spokesman Robert Kenny. An emergency text message would be sent in the event of a widespread disaster, severe weather or child abduction. Under the plan, the FCC will appoint a federal agency to create the messages and pass them on to cell phone companies that choose to participate, an FCC representative said earlier. Once that agency is named, the participating cell phone providers would have 10 months to comply with the new system's requirements. ""It is essential that we support and advance new ways to share critical, time-sensitive information with them in times of crisis,"" FCC chairman Kevin J. Martin said in a written statement. Earlier, the FCC representative explained how the plan would work. Cell phone companies that voluntarily opt into the system would send text-based alert messages to subscribers in response to three types of events: . T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint Nextel and AT&T all stated that they would be likely to opt into the alert system if it is passed by the FCC. ""While we obviously need to review the details of the FCC's decision, we look forward to offering mobile emergency alerts to our customers,"" AT&T said in a written statement. A Sprint representative said the company would participate if the FCC adopts the plan exactly as it was recommended by an advisory group. A federal agency, yet to be appointed, would create the messages and information that would go to the participating cell phone companies, an FCC spokesman said. Once that agency is named, all carriers that opt into the system will have to meet the requirements of the system within 10 months. Subscribers would be able to opt out of receiving the messages, according to the current plan, and carriers would be required to provide vibration or audio attention signals with a distinct sound for people with disabilities. The alert system plan was generated from an act Congress passed in 2006 that looked at emergency communications. The act directed the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the FCC and other agencies to work together to enhance and expand the capabilities of emergency communications in the United States.

"(CNN) -- A California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) employee who allegedly wrote a letter to a transgender woman and condemned her to hell has resigned, officials said Thursday. The employee, who worked for the DMV for two years, resigned Wednesday and will not receive benefits or unemployment, according to department spokesman Mike Marando. ""This in no way diminishes the severity of the situation,"" Marando said, adding officials believe the DMV employee's behavior was an isolated matter. The attorney for the transgender woman said the employee should have been fired, instead of being allowed to resign. Amber Yust told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Wednesday night that she got the letter after she went to a San Francisco DMV office in October and successfully changed her name from David to Amber and updated the gender on her license. According to Yust and her attorney, the DMV employee used her confidential personal information to send the letter. ""I have learned that the reason for the vast majority of gender change operations is the client's homosexual orientation,"" the letter dated October 22 states. ""The homosexual act is an abomination that leads to hell."" Yust said she also got a pamphlet from a church, which she said contained offensive material directed at her sexual orientation and gender. The DMV employee had been placed on administrative leave with pay pending an investigation after Yust came forward, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. George Valverde, director of the DMV, in a statement Thursday said the employee ""acted well outside the course and scope of his duties. We recognized this was unacceptable and wholly unauthorized behavior by this former employee."" Yust's attorney, Christopher Dolan, said the employee refused to assist another transgender person in 2009 and kept his job. The DMV employee went through a discipline process and received sensitivity training and counseling after that incident, Marando said. Other DMV employees also received training on transgender situations, he said. The 9,000 DMV employees routinely receive training on a variety of issues, Marando added. ""We emphasize that customers are treated fairly and equitably,"" Marando said. Dolan has filed a damage claim with the state, saying Yust suffered embarrassment and emotional distress. It asks for damages in excess of $25,000. ""Why didn't they fire him the first time?"" Dolan said of the DMV field representative. ""They let him sit at home for two months.""","California DMV employee submits resignation .

"(CNN) -- The body of chess legend Bobby Fischer was exhumed Monday in Iceland, law enforcement officials have told CNN. His body was reburied shortly after DNA samples were taken, the officials said. Iceland's supreme court ruled last month in favor of a request by Jinky Young, Fischer's alleged daughter, to exhume his remains in order to settle a paternity question. Police in the Icelandic town of Selfoss, where Fischer is buried, say the alleged daughter is 9 years old. A doctor, a priest and other officials were present during the procedure, according to the police department in Selfoss. Fischer was 64 when he died in January 2008. A child prodigy and chess master by the time he was 15, Fischer achieved international fame in 1972 when he defeated chess grandmaster Boris Spassky of Russia during the height of the Cold War, becoming the world champion. The tournament was considered a symbolic battle between the two greatest powers in the world. It was held in Iceland, midway between the United States and the Soviet Union. Soviet chess masters had held the title since World War II -- until Fischer won. The victory, unequaled by an American since, was followed by tens of millions of chess fans around the world. But Fischer's genius proved eccentric. Years after his historic win, Fischer gave up the title in 1975 and refused to defend it. He vanished and lived in a self-imposed exile for decades. He resurfaced in Yugoslavia in 1992 for a rematch against Spassky. It was another victory for Fischer, one that earned him $3.5 million. The U.S. government claimed Fischer's participation had violated U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia, imposed to punish Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, and revoked his U.S. passport. Fischer again disappeared. He was not heard from again until 2004, when he was arrested in Japan for traveling on an expired passport. When Iceland granted Fischer citizenship in 2005, he moved to that country and lived there until his death in a hospital.","Fischer's alleged daughter, Jinky Young, requested a DNA test .

"(CNN) -- About three quarters of American public libraries currently lend out e-books, and in the past year libraries have seen a sharp growth in e-book borrowing. Still, well over half of U.S. library card holders don't know whether their local public library lends e-books, according to a new Pew report. Pew also found that 12% of all Americans age 16 and older who read e-books have borrowed an e-book from a library in the past year -- and they're generally pretty happy with the experience. Two thirds of them characterized their library's selection of e-book titles as ""excellent,"" ""very good"" or ""good."" Of course, there are occasional hitches. Some library patrons reported waiting lists for popular e-books, or that the library e-book wasn't offered in a format compatible with their device. Earlier this year, Pew research found that about one in five U.S. adults have read an e-book in the past year, and that e-book users tend to read over 30% more books per year than people who only read printed material. If e-books encourage people to read more, that's good for public libraries -- which have a core mission to foster literacy and community engagement with information, culture and civic life. Also, lending e-books allows libraries to potentially serve more patrons beyond the hours and walls of their branches. Eventually this might lead to smaller collections of printed books on library shelves, but it also could free up space to meet growing community needs for meeting rooms and computer labs. Money is a top concern for public libraries. Lately most have been facing an especially severe budget crunch. This is motivating some libraries to making acquiring e-books a higher priority. According to Pew: ""A number of librarians report that some funds for purchasing printed books have been shifted to e-book purchases. Others' libraries have cut back on other media purchases, such as CD audiobooks, to free up funds for purchases of e-books."" Even though libraries have options to get many e-books for free, lending out many of the most popular titles definitely costs money. And this recently got considerably more expensive for libraries. Publishers have historically sold e-books to libraries (or to distributors such as Overdrive) at prices roughly equivalent to the retail hardcover price. However, in March, one of the largest U.S. publishers, Random House, suddenly increased its library pricing for e-books by as much as 300%. This was a big blow to libraries, which consider lending current bestsellers to be a critical service. Random House is the only major publisher to make e-books of its entire catalog available to any public library for unrestricted lending. The other ""Big Six"" publishers either refuse to allow libraries to lend out their e-books (at least their ""front list"" of current bestsellers), or they require libraries to periodically pay to re-license e-books. Publishers have largely resisted e-book library lending because they're concerned it might undermine their own e-book sales. Why would consumers buy e-books if they can get them for free at the library? But evidence indicates that publishers may not have much to fear from library e-book lending -- just like they haven't been hurt by library lending of print editions of current bestsellers. Pew found that nearly half of all Americans who have read a book in the previous year purchased their most recent book. Only one fourth borrowed their most recent book from a friend; 14% borrowed it from a library. Furthermore over half of e-book users who also hold library cards told Pew that they prefer to buy -- not borrow -- their e-books. Among the library patrons who are currently borrowing e-books, only one-third say they generally prefer to buy e-books; 57% generally prefer to borrow them. But, interestingly, slightly more library e-books borrowers told Pew that when they want to find an e-book, the first place they look is an online bookstore -- not the library. At least one major publisher is warming up to library e-book lending. Last week, Penguin announced a pilot program to allow public libraries in New York City and Brooklyn to lend out its e-books via 3M's Cloud Drive service. This is notable because last November Penguin pulled its books from Overdrive. The community role of public libraries is evolving, and libraries are seeking ways to better meet the needs of people who are especially in need of their services. Pew found that people who live in households with an annual income of less than $30,000, rural dwellers, and seniors are least likely to have a library card. Pew asked people who don't already borrow library e-books whether they might avail themselves of library programs that would prepare them for using e-books. Nearly half said they would be ""very"" or ""somewhat"" likely to borrow an e-reading device that came loaded with a book they wanted. About a third would be at least somewhat likely to take library classes on how to download e-books onto handheld devices (including smartphones), or classes on how to use an e-reader or tablet computer. Pew also noted: ""Those most interested in these services include some groups that librarians are especially eager to reach. African-Americans, Hispanics, and those who live in lower-income households are more likely than others to say they would be interested in borrowing pre-loaded e-reading devices and take classes about how to use the devices and download books."" Clearly, public libraries have more work to do with spreading the word that they have e-books to lend. It also wouldn't hurt if the process of borrowing a e-book were less clunky at many libraries. To find out whether your public library lends out e-books, check their website or ask a librarian. Or conduct a library search on Overdrive.com. You'll need a library card, of course -- so if you don't already have one (more than 40% of Americans don't), borrowing free e-books might be a good reason to finally visit your public library and get a library card. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Many Americans don't know whether their public library has e-books, a new Pew report says .

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN) -- Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi has lashed out at Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, predicting that Iraq could soon return to widespread sectarian violence that could require the return of U.S. forces. ""Al-Maliki is pushing my country to reach a turning point with deeply sectarian dimension,"" the Sunni vice president told CNN on Sunday during an interview in the semiautonomous Kurdish region in the north, where he has fled so that government forces loyal to the Shiite prime minister cannot execute an arrest warrant for him on charges of running a death squad. He expressed concern that Americans ""will face the same problem as they faced in 2003,"" when a U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq, toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein and unleashing a wave of sectarian violence. And he said he did not understand how U.S. President Barack Obama is able to characterize Iraq as a free, stable and democratic country. ""What sort of Iraq we are talking about?"" he asked. ""How the Americans will feel proud? How the American administration is going to justify to the taxpayer the billion of dollars that has been spent and at the end of the day the American saying, 'Sorry, we have no leverage even to put things in order in Iraq'?"" Though Iraq's instability may not affect this year's election campaign in the United States, ""it is going to affect the American interest in the region, and they should be very much concern about that,"" al-Hashimi said. ""The future of Iraq is grim."" The arrest warrant for al-Hashimi was issued last year, days after the Sunni majority bloc Iraqiya suspended its participation in Parliament amid that claims it was being cut out of the political process. The bloc ended that boycott on Sunday as a ""gesture of goodwill."" But a separate boycott of the Cabinet remains in place. Al-Hashimi denied the charges against him as politically motivated. He accused al-Maliki of having ""put my home and my office under siege"" during the three months before he fled to the Dokan resort about 400 km (250 miles) north of Baghdad. ""I kept patient on that, hoping that al-Maliki is going to behave sensibly sometime, and things aggravated,"" al-Hashimi said. Asked whether al-Maliki is becoming a dictator, al-Hashimi was blunt: ""What sort of explanation could I give for a real and serious power consolidation?"" he asked. ""What could the average Iraqi people or the American citizen ... say for the prime minister to be chief in command, the minister of defense, the minister of interior and the chief of the national security?"" The charges appear to have been based on the confessions of three security guards for al-Hashimi. Iraqi state-run TV has aired video of the men's confessions. CNN cannot independently verify their identities. An official in al-Hashimi's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, has said the men may have confessed under duress. In one confession, a man detailed roadside bombings and shootings that targeted government and security officials in 2009. He said orders at times came directly from al-Hashimi and at times through his son-in-law, Ahmed Qahtan, who is a senior member of his staff. The man alleged that the vice president thanked him after a number of attacks. The man in the video said al-Hashimi ordered him to map out security locations and checkpoints for the Baghdad Brigade, which protects the Green Zone. He said he was speaking out to ""clear his conscience"" and ""expose this criminal."" Since October, Iraqi security forces have rounded up hundreds of people accused of being members of Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath Party or terrorists. The Sunni-backed Iraqiya coalition says most of them belong to its political bloc and that the prime minister is simply taking out his opponents. The political turmoil in Iraq has raised concerns in Washington, with officials saying they are monitoring the reports about the arrest warrant. ""We are talking to all of the parties. We've expressed our concern regarding these developments. We're urging all political sides in Iraq to work out their differences peaceably, politically, through dialogue, and certainly in a manner that is consistent with democratic political processes and international standards of rule of law,"" Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said in December.

"(CNN) -- Far too often, children with developmental disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of their observable behavior, slotted into broad diagnostic pigeonholes and provided generalized treatments that may not always meet their specific needs. For instance, children are sometimes assigned with broad-spectrum labels of ""autism"" or ""attention deficit disorder"" after a single psychological assessment and are provided expensive therapies or prescribed strong medications with serious, long-term side effects. This incomplete diagnosis and/or overmedication can leave their underlying problems untreated and left to worsen, and compound the frustration of parents and child. Such an approach is analogous to trying to diagnose and treat a heart problem without ever doing a chest X-ray or ECG to looking at the heart. The essence of my talk at TED was simple: To diagnose any brain-related developmental disorder, it is crucial to look at the brain. Looking at behavior alone can provide an incomplete or misleading picture. Moreover, when looking at the brain, it is important to go beyond its structure to its function. This is because often in cognitive disorders, the structure of the brain is intact, but its function is compromised. Abnormalities in brain function have traditionally been detected using electroencephalography (EEG), which involves the measurement of the ongoing electrical activity generated by the brain. Traditional EEG appears as a pattern of spikes and waves that are visually inspected to detect these abnormalities. However, following more recent advances in technology, a pioneering EEG system known as Brain Electrical Activity Mapping (BEAM) has been developed at Harvard University by neurologist Dr. Frank Duffy. This system adds complex display schematics and statistical analyses to the traditional EEG recordings to provide more information about brain dysfunction. For instance, not only can BEAM map the patient's EEG recordings onto schematic 3-D maps of the head, but it can also estimate whether the EEG is outside the normal bounds for a child's age. This is achieved using a technique known as Statistical Probability Mapping, which compares the patient's EEG to a reference database of normal EEGs. The proprietary database contains EEG data on more than 2,000 fully screened, healthy subjects, making BEAM a unique and powerful investigative tool in the diagnosis of various neurological disorders. For instance, when using BEAM we have found that many children who are diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from virtually undetectable brain seizures that are presenting with autism-like symptoms. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that one-third to one-half of children with autism may be prone to abnormal seizure-like activity in their brains, and up to one-third of children with autism may develop epilepsy by the time they reach adolescence. In some cases, this seizure-like activity may merely be a consequence of the underlying neurological problem that is causing autism; in others, it may be comorbid (co-existent) with autism. However, in yet other cases, such as the one I described at the TED conference, we found that the seizures are in fact the cause of the children's symptoms and, when treated, the level and speed of recovery in these children has been remarkable. Since some of these children's symptoms (staring into space or being unresponsive) were mistaken for those of autism during behavioral testing, we would never have identified the epileptiform seizure activity in their brains without an EEG test. Of course, many children diagnosed with autism and other developmental disorders do not have any seizures or abnormal EEG activity. And for some who do, this may not be the cause of all their symptoms. Hence, I do not suggest that neurophysiological tests like BEAM should be used as a replacement for behavioral tests, but that they should be used in conjunction with such tests, to triangulate more accurately the cause of the child's symptoms, and to ensure more targeted and effective treatments or therapies. Since my talk at TED, I have been working on making Harvard's EEG BEAM system more widely available, from the United States to India. Indeed, after the recent deluge of enquiries I have received, we are working on this with greater urgency. My goal is to have numerous systems worldwide that are fully accessible and affordable to all families. Until then, it is important for parents to understand that even a standard digital EEG test conducted by a local physician could help reveal whether seizure activity in the brain is contributing to their child's symptoms. Indeed, my talk at TED was not intended so much to highlight a particular system or technology as it was to emphasize the importance of a particular approach to these disorders. That approach is simple: to diagnose a developmental disorder accurately, we should look at the brain directly. Or, to recall a phrase I use when testing children: ""When we put this magic cap on you, your brain can finally talk to us, and we can finally listen!"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aditi Shankardass.","Aditi Shankardass says too often learning disorder diagnosis based only on behavior .
She says it's important to look at brain activity and function .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry took exception with Nigeria's human rights record Saturday, but at the same time he defended that government's right to defend itself against terror groups disrupting Africa's most populous nation. In his first visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office earlier this year, Kerry singled out Nigeria's Boko Haram as ""a terrorist organization,"" though the United States doesn't formally list the Islamist militant group as such. ""One person's atrocity does not excuse another's,"" Kerry said, visiting the region on the day it celebrated the 50th anniversary of the African Union. Kerry noted that Boko Haram has ""wantonly upset the normal governance of Nigeria in fundamental ways that are unacceptable."" Then he endorsed Nigeria's right ""to defend itself and to fight back against terrorists."" But Kerry said he has raised ""the issue of human rights"" with Nigeria's foreign minister. ""We have talked directly about the imperative of Nigerian troops adhering to the highest standards and not themselves engaging in atrocities or in human rights violations. That is critical,"" Kerry said. ""To their credit, the government has acknowledged that there have been some problems and they're not -- they're working to try to control it,"" Kerry continued. ""Revenge is not the motive. It's good governance. It's ridding yourself of a terrorist organization so that you can establish a standard of law that people can respect. And that's what needs to happen in Nigeria."" Human Rights Watch reported this month civilian deaths and abuses by Nigerian forces in its campaign against Boko Haram. The conflict between the military and insurgents was evident more than a week ago when special forces targeted Boko Haram and other groups, killing 14 suspected terrorists and capturing 20 others. However, much of Nigerian violence in recent years has been blamed on Boko Haram, which means ""Western education is sacrilege."" Last week, a spokesman for the United Nations human rights commissioner told reporters that Boko Haram could face war crimes charges for alleged ethnic and religious cleansing in Nigeria. Last December and January, the Islamist group killed 34 people, including 27 Christians attending Christmas services, officials said. Also, Human Rights Watch said the Islamist group has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria. Nigeria, with nearly 175 million people, is considered the political and economic powerhouse of West Africa. Rich in oil, the country is a key U.S. partner. Kerry, making his remarks in the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia, said the United States is working closely with the union on economic development and bilateral trade issues. The African Union was formed to rid the continent of colonialism and apartheid and to promote cooperation for development. But Kerry also expressed concern about peace stability in the region, including between South Sudan and Sudan, whose situation ""remains tense,"" Kerry said.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Muntadher al-Zaidi, the man seen as a hero in some circles for throwing his shoes at then-U.S. President George W. Bush, was sentenced to three years in prison Thursday by an Iraqi court. TV reporter Muntadher al-Zaidi, shown in a file photo, was jailed after throwing his shoes at President Bush. Al-Zaidi threw his shoes at Bush during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in December in Baghdad. Neither shoe hit the president, and other people in the room quickly knocked al-Zaidi to the ground before security officials arrested him. Family members and journalists were cleared from the courtroom before Thursday's verdict. After news of the verdict reached family members, al-Zaidi's brother appeared close to fainting. Other family members were seen crying and shouting curses about al-Maliki and Bush.  Watch al-Zaidi's family protest the sentence » . Al-Zaidi was a journalist who worked for the television network al-Baghdadia. The network also called for his release shortly after the incident. He explained his actions during an hourlong appearance last month in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. Asked whether anyone pushed or motivated him, al-Zaidi said he was spurred by the ""violations that are committed against the Iraqi people."" In the Middle East, throwing shoes at someone is traditionally a sign of contempt. Al-Zaidi's angry gesture touched a defiant nerve throughout the Arab and Muslim world. He is regarded by many people as a hero, and demonstrators took to the streets in the Arab world and called for his release shortly after the incident. Al-Zaidi, who faced a charge of assaulting a visiting head of state, had 17 lawyers to defend him. There were also three judges in the courtroom, along with the prosecutor and family members. In December, his defense team told CNN that he could face 15 years in prison if convicted. But al-Zaidi's defense team was hoping to change his charge to an insult rather than assault, which would have brought about three months in prison rather than three years. CNN's Yousif Bassil and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Muntadher al-Zaidi gets three years in prison for throwing shoes at President Bush .

"Westminster, Colorado (CNN) -- It seems like a simple question, but ask Victor Perez and Dulce Garcia what grade they're in and you won't get a traditional answer. At almost any other school in the country, the 11-year-old friends would be in fifth grade. Not so at Hodgkins Elementary in Westminster, Colorado, where there are no grades and no grade levels. Here, children are grouped together in classes based on their ability, not their age . In literacy class, Victor and Dulce are both in level seven. In math, Victor is in level seven while Dulce is still learning level six. ""He's the highest in the class,"" said Dulce, who is proud of her friend's achievements. The move to do away with grade levels throughout the Adams County School District began three years ago. Standards-based learning, as it's called, is founded on the belief that every child learns in different ways and at different speeds. With the school district on an academic watch list, educators here were eager to reverse the slide. ""Every single student is getting an individualized education,"" said Hodgkins Principal Sarah Gould, who helped usher in the reform at her school two years ago. ""We are giving our kids exactly what they need when they need it."" Children work at their own level in each subject and must demonstrate proficiency in various learning targets, achieving a score of 75% or higher before they're allowed to move on to the next level. During a recent visit to Jennifer Gregg's literacy class, students ranging in age from 8 to 10 were gathered in small groups or working on their own to hit their learning targets. Each table had a basket with books separated into four different reading levels. Gregg says when she first heard about standards-based learning, she wondered, ""How do you juggle that many levels in one classroom?"" Now, she sees the benefits, since students aren't frustrated by work that's too hard, nor bored with assignments that are too easy. ""The kids know exactly what they're working on ... and what they need to do, so it's very empowering for them,"" she said. Gregg's students come to her when they're ready to take the proficiency test to move to the next level. ""I don't know if 'hounding' is the right word,"" Gregg said, ""but they definitely will let you know...'Please sign me up.'"" Unlike traditional schools, students at Hodgkins can move up a learning level anytime they're ready, not just at the end of the year. When a visitor asked who had moved up a level in the 2010-11 school year, almost all hands shot up. A large bulletin board in the hallway displays the smiling faces of nearly 400 students who had changed levels in the month of March. ""The time is right for a system that focuses on individual students and lets them progress at their own pace,"" said education researcher Robert Marzano, who is helping the district develop standards-based learning, a system that was first introduced in the 1960s. ""The conversation around the country is about that like it's never been before."" The Adams 50 school district is made up of about 10,000 students, mostly from Hispanic families. About 40% are still learning English. In the last decade, as demographics began to change, standardized test scores fell, leading the district to be placed on an academic watch list. School board president Vicky Marshall said the district needed something drastic to turn it around. She set out to enlist teachers and parents, aware that without their support, the new system would fail. High school teachers were among the first to embrace the idea, realizing students would have to have mastered material before moving levels. Their response, according to Marshall: ""'You mean, by the time they get to us they're going to know all ... of the prior material that they should know in biology, in math, in social studies, and I'm not going to have to spend the first three months of their freshman year figuring out what they don't know? ... Wow -- absolutely.'"" Parents, however, did have concerns, especially whether there would be a big age range in some classes. ""We were very quick to say, 'No, we're not going to have someone with a mustache ... sitting next to a 6- year-old.' That's just not going to happen,"" she said. Instead, older children at lower levels are given extra help, as they are in traditional middle and high schools. Standards-based learning in the Adams County School District is currently in place in kindergarten through ninth grade, and will be integrated through all high schools by 2014. But it's not for the faint of heart. This particular approach was developed by the Re-Inventing Schools Coalition, a nonprofit organization that helped turn around a small, struggling school district in Alaska. Students there went from 0% attending college to nearly 90% going on to secondary education or the military. The organization's executive director, Wendy Battino, said that in order for standards-based learning to work, schools must have strong leadership and shared vision. Of the approximately 300 schools that have attempted to enact this system, Battino said, half haven't been able to stick with it. ""Superintendents last 2-2½ years on average in this country. It's really hard to lead systemic change when you have that much turnover,"" Battino said. Community and school support are critical, she said, ""so when a leader does leave, you have enough shared vision and stakeholder support that they will hold onto this and it won't leave, despite the next leader."" The message is particularly relevant in Adams County, where the schools superintendent who brought the change recently resigned. And since school board members are are limited to two four-year term limits, the unanimous support may wane if standardized test scores don't improve. So far, they haven't. In last years' CSAP test, only 39% of Hodgkins' third- graders tested proficient in reading. That's 8% lower than the previous year, before the new system was put in place. School Board President Vicky Marshall explained that it would take three to five years for any type of major reform to show results. ""So I would say, if within three to five years we're not seeing the kind of results that we project, yeah, it probably could be at risk,"" she said. Principal Gould is quick to point out that the initial drop in test scores was expected, since many kids were placed in lower levels to make up for gaps in their educations. ""Our hope and goal is that when this year's test scores come out and the following year's, that progression will just continue to increase,"" Gould said, adding that test scores don't paint the whole picture. Discipline problems, Gould said, have decreased 76% in the past two years -- a sign, she said, that the system is working. ""When students are challenged exactly where they need to be,"" she said, ""there's not a lot of time for students to be messing around in class.""","A Colorado school switched to standards-based learning .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bipartisanship is in the eye of the beholder, it seems, as Democrats and Republicans ponder how cooperation between them can improve after the upcoming congressional elections. The voting on November 2 is expected to diminish Democratic majorities in both chambers and perhaps cost them control of the House. Whatever the final tally, widespread voter dissatisfaction with the hostile political climate in Washington is evident. Democrats blame Republican intransigence, calling the GOP a ""party of no"" that has opposed almost every initiative to undermine President Barack Obama's campaign pledge to change Washington politics. Republican leaders say their opposition is a response to a left-leaning agenda pushed by Obama and Democratic leaders that far exceeds what the public wants. In a new development this election cycle, the conservative Tea Party movement wants to throw out both parties, but its agenda aligns it with Republicans in the heated campaigning. While Obama and some Democrats and Republicans say they hope for better relations after the election, they express different views of what that would mean. ""We're going to continue to reach out, and we're going to look for common ground and a way forward to solve the problems facing this country,"" White House senior adviser David Axelrod said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program Sunday. Axelrod predicted Democrats will keep their majorities in both chambers, but conceded that ""Republicans will have more seats in Congress."" ""We're hoping with that comes a greater sense of responsibility,"" he said. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas had a different take, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" that it is up to Obama to change, not Republicans. ""If the president's going to maintain his ideological stance and try to jam things through to support the left in America, when we're still a center-right country, then we're going to say 'no,' "" Cornyn said, adding that Republicans will work with Obama on issues such as job creation, spending cuts and reducing the national debt. ""There is , I think, a fatigue on the part of the American people with the aggressive agenda that, frankly, they don't agree with, but they haven't been listened to,"" Cornyn said. ""They've been lectured to, and they're tired of it. They're going to speak up on November 2nd."" Cornyn's Republican colleague, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, agreed on the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" that Obama and Democratic leaders ""over-reached"" in the first two years, which he said rattled the American people. ""I don't think it's about everybody becoming a Republican in the last two years,"" Graham said of expected GOP election victories next month. ""I do believe it's a rejection of an agenda that scares people. The health care bill, the stimulus package, the financial regulation, all the spending was not what people expected from this president."" At the same time, some bipartisanship will occur, Graham predicted. ""There will be a bipartisan effort to extend the Bush tax cuts and not let them expire"" at the end of the year, Graham said. As Democratic candidates in swing states realize voters want middle-ground policies instead of a liberal agenda, more compromise will come, he said. ""I think we're going to have some bipartisanship when it comes to replacing the health care bill with a more moderate approach,"" Graham said. ""You'll see some Democrats and Republicans working early on to try to moderate things."" According to Graham, the Tea Party movement has helped refocus the national political debate on a center-right agenda, but added that conservatives shouldn't get carried away. ""Our Tea Party friends have done us a favor, ""Graham said. ""But if we talk about doing away with Social Security as part of our agenda, then we're going to lose the public. ... If you get too far right or too far left, you're going to lose the American people."" Axelrod and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs outlined an agenda for the second half of Obama's presidential term that focuses on the nation's immediate and long-term economic welfare. Gibbs told the NBC program ""Meet the Press"" that the president will work on strengthening the economy and trying to ensure its future stability, while continuing to push education reform and making sure that health care and Wall Street reforms are properly implemented. Obama needs Democrats and Republicans to work together to deal with the federal debt, Gibbs said. A bipartisan debt commission is scheduled to report a set of proposals in December. He made no mention of major issues such as immigration reform and energy reform, which Obama pushed strongly in his first two years. Axelrod, speaking on CNN, said both issues were part of the necessary foundation of reforms for sustainable economic growth in the future. ""I think that regardless of the outcome of election night that voters are going to want two political parties who may have different ideas but understand they have to come together and work together to solve our problems,"" Gibbs later told reporters. However, other Democrats don't expect a new spirit of partisanship to emerge. ""It doesn't appear right now that the Republican Party is welcoming moderates any more,"" Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said of the effect of the Tea Party movement on GOP candidates. ""I think that independent voters need to take a hard look in these elections and realize that what we may be getting to is the kind of gridlock that, frankly, is not something that's desirable in terms of good policy in this country,"" McCaskill said on ""Fox News Sunday. Republicans ""won't even pledge that they'll quit earmarking,"" she said, later adding: ""If they won't even say they'll stop earmarking in this kind of spending problem that we're facing, I just think there's a lot of politics being played.""","The two parties may have different takes on being bipartisan .
Republicans say Obama and Democrats must ease their liberal agenda .
Democrats question if Republicans are open to any compromise ."
"(CNN Student News) -- November 4, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Indonesia  • Atlantic City, New Jersey . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Here with your results from the U.S. midterm elections, plus more events from around the world, this is your commercial-free show for the classroom: CNN Student News! First Up: U.S. House Results . REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) MINORITY LEADER: Let me just say this: It's clear tonight who the winners really are, and that's the American people. It was the American people's voice that was heard at the ballot box -- the American people's voice. And listen, I'm gonna be brief because we've got real work to do and, frankly, this is not a time for celebration. AZUZ: Representative John Boehner, saying he and other Republicans are ready to get back to work in Washington, D.C. You might have noticed his title: minority leader. When it comes to the U.S. House of Representatives, his party won't be in the minority much longer. Yesterday, we explained how the Republicans needed to win 39 additional seats to take control in the House. They won at least 60. Experts say that is the biggest gain by any major political party since 1948. When we produced this show on Wednesday, Republicans were projected to win 239 of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Democrats were projected to take 185. 11 races hadn't been called yet. It takes 218 to hold a majority in the House. An important thing to keep in mind: The new members of Congress who were elected Tuesday, they aren't starting their new jobs just yet. That'll happen in January. And when it does, a lot of people expect that Representative Boehner will be chosen as the new speaker of the House. U.S. Senate Results . SEN. HARRY REID, (D) MAJORITY LEADER: I have to admit, this has been one of the toughest. But it's nothing compared to the fights families are facing all over Nevada right now. This race has been called, but the fight is far from over. The bell that just rang isn't the end of the fight, it's the start of the next round. AZUZ: Heading over to the other side of Congress now, the U.S. Senate. That was Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat and the Senate majority leader. His party will stay in the majority in the Senate. Takes 51 seats to hold that majority. After Tuesday's results, CNN is projecting that Democrats will hold 52 seats. Republicans are projected to hold 47. There was still 1 seat undecided when we recorded today's show. That 47 number for the Republicans is up from 41 before the midterms. So, they did make gains, just not enough to win a Senate majority. You've heard a lot about the Tea Party movement during this campaign season. It had an impact on the election results. Senate candidates in Kentucky and Florida who were backed by Tea Party supporters both won their elections. And some experts said that the Tea Party movement was responsible for the big shift in the House, too. What's the Word? JIM RIBBLE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the Word? relating to or about a governor . GUBERNATORIAL . That's the word! Governors' Races / Ballot Measures . AZUZ: Republicans appear to also have won a gubernatorial majority after the results of Tuesday's 37 elections for governor. They needed to take at least three governors' offices away from Democrats to win that majority. They picked up at least 10. Some gubernatorial races went the other way, switching from Republicans to Democrats. And in Rhode Island, neither party won. That state elected an independent as its new governor. Wasn't just people on the ballot. Voters also decided on certain issues that could become laws in their states. A few examples: Illinois passed an amendment to the state's constitution that will allow for the governor to be recalled from office. A couple states passed a bill that would let people there opt out of the U.S. government's health care reform requirements. And in California, voters shot down a measure to legalize marijuana. Presidential Reaction . AZUZ: In order to understand why Americans vote the way they do, organizations ask people questions as they leave polling locations. These are called exit polls. On Tuesday, those polls showed the economy was far and away the most important issue on the minds of voters. Exit polls also indicated that more than half of Americans aren't too happy with either Republicans or Democrats. It's something that President Obama talked about when he discussed the election results. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Over the last two years, we've made progress. But clearly, too many Americans haven't felt that progress yet, and they told us that yesterday. And as president, I take responsibility for that. What yesterday also told us is that no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here. But we must find common ground in order to set, in order to make progress on some uncommonly difficult challenges. This Day in History . [ON SCREEN GRAPHIC] .

November 4, 2008 -- Barack Obama is elected as the first African-American president of the United States . Indonesia Disasters . AZUZ: The nation of Indonesia is recovering from an earthquake and a volcanic eruption. If that sounds familiar, Indonesia suffered this same combination -- an earthquake and eruption -- just last week. Yesterday's quake was weaker than the previous one. No reports of damage or injuries from this quake. The volcano that's erupting is the same one: Mount Merapi. It's been shooting out lava and ash, like you see in these pictures here, since late October. At least 39 people have been killed. More than 70,000 have had to leave their homes. Some people who live on the volcano have left, come back to check on their houses and farms, and then had to turn around and leave again. Shoutout . MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Ferda's 9th grade American government class at Andover High School in Andover, Minnesota! The properties on the traditional Monopoly board were named after streets in what U.S. city? Is it: A) Atlantic City, B) Las Vegas, C) Miami or D) New York? You've got three seconds -- GO! Monopoly's properties were based on Atlantic City streets. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Monopoly Turns 75 . AZUZ: Atlantic City. I'd guessed New York. But from the streets of Atlantic City, Monopoly has exploded into one of the most popular games in the world! And this week, it turns 75 years old. Most of us have collected our $200 for passing go; maybe spent some time in jail. Now, we're going to take a trip to the factory that has a monopoly on this iconic game. (BEGIN VIDEO) PAT RISO, MONOPOLY SPOKESPERSON: Monopoly is the quintessential board game. It's sold in 111 countries and in 43 languages. GARY BRENNAN, VP, MANUFACTURING: It's the best game to play. This is where Monopoly is manufactured. This is the Hasbro Games facility. It's the largest games and puzzle producer in the world. We produce up to two million Monoploy games a year. TONY MARTINS, MONOPOLY MAKER: My job is to make plastic parts for our games and toys. I'm sure everyone plays Monopoly. It's something that's just never going to go away. ALMA OCAMPO, MONOPOLY MAKER: I've been here twenty-five years. I work in the Monopoly line. All Monopolies are different. This is only thirty pieces in each pack. I think it teaches you part of life, you know? You make the right decisions in life. If you make your investments, how to save money, how to buy property. It's been part of history. MARIA CRUZ CORTEZ, MONOPOLY MAKER: They're more fun with the family. You get to talk with the family. Video games, you just sit there and do this all day. BRENNAN: This is the final assembly line. This is where it all comes together. This is where the magic happens. It's just a way to bring the families together. It teaches about numbers. It teaches you about competition. It teaches you about relationships. Life is just too hectic now. It moves at a pace that we're not used to. This slows it down a little bit. Perfect family game. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: All right! Before we go, there is an art to organizing a food drive. In this case, the food drive is art. It's called can-struction, and it's a food drive/design project. Look at this! Ultimately, it all goes to charity. That's the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. What happens is that designers build these art pieces out of canned goods. The art then goes on display. Then all the cans go to help the hungry. Goodbye . AZUZ: So, you've got a good cause, a unique art show, competitors with a can-do attitude. Puts today's show in the can.

"(CNN) -- An American man -- in the United Arab Emirates to speak at an international creativity conference -- has been detained in that Middle Eastern nation for allegedly taking a photo in a forbidden area, a family spokeswoman told CNN. Robert Alan Black is being held in Abu Dhuabi's Al Wathba prison, said Rosemary Rein, the family spokeswoman, one of Black's longtime friends and a fellow speaker at the ""Creative Thinkers"" conference in the UAE capital. ""We know from Dr. Black that he took a picture of something he shouldn't have and that it was stupid,"" said Rein, who did not know what Black photographed, where or when. A former architect, Black often takes photos of buildings, according to Rein. Doing so is prohibited in some parts of the United Arab Emirates, particularly in and around government buildings, embassies, military facilities and other places that are considered sensitive. The family isn't aware of any charges filed against Black. Neither the local police or prosecutor's office have commented on his case, as is customary for similar arrests. When asked Friday about Black's case, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the U.S. government knew of the reports but she didn't offer details. ""We take our obligation to assist U.S. citizens overseas seriously,"" Psaki said. ""The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi is providing all possible consular assistance."" The 70-year-old Black characterizes himself as an architect, cartoonist, graphic designer, professor and creativity consultant on his website. He has given presentations at more more than 150 creativity conferences on six continents since 1978, not to mention authoring more than 600 articles and the book, ""Broken Crayons: Break Your Crayons and Draw Outside the Lines."" Rein said that Black's next stop, after the Abu Dhabi conference, was supposed to be Malaysia. But after noticing he hadn't posted to social media, she touched base with common acquaintances and learned that he'd never made it to Asia. Black's family has spoken to him twice since his detention, after a family member of a fellow inmate let him borrow a phone, Rein said. He told his daughter that guards there were treating him fairly and that he had access to his diabetes medication. ""He was so apologetic and just wanted to come home,"" Rein said. Rein said that U.S. Embassy officials are working to get Black a phone card, and that his family is trying to hire a local attorney and raise money for his defense. The family is also writing a letter to the UAE government, saying ""it is our sincere hope that we can talk to officials and bring him home without any further legal proceedings,"" Rein told CNN. ""We respect regulations, and any violation is unintended,"" Rein said, citing the family's message. ""We truly believe, if you see his profile and his track record as a consummate volunteer around the world, that any mistake that did happen was without any intent to disrespect the culture or the law.""","Robert Alan Black traveled to Abu Dhabi to speak at a creativity conference .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia is often touted as among the most conservative places in the world, with women forbidden even to drive. But in terms of attitude toward women's freedom of choice in clothing, it's significantly more freethinking than some of its neighbors, a survey of seven Muslim-majority countries suggests. Nearly two out of three people in Saudi Arabia believe women should keep everything but their eyes covered when they are in a public place -- but at the same time, nearly half say it is up to a woman to dress however she wants. That puts it on a level with socially liberal Lebanon, and ranks it as far less conservative than Iraq, Pakistan or Egypt. ""Saudi Arabia is not as conservative as it appears. Definitely on some level there is a considerable liberal leaning,"" said Mansoor Moaddel, the lead author of the study. That could be partly a reaction to the conservative leadership, he said. ""Saudi has had a religious government for a long time. People tend to develop an oppositional attitude,"" he argued. The findings come from a report published by the Middle Eastern Values Study of the University of Michigan's Population Studies Center. It suggests Egypt is, in terms of gender relations, the most conservative country in the study by some distance. Only 14% of Egyptians believe women should be allowed to choose how they dress, the lowest level in the survey. Egyptians are also the most likely to say that a woman should be required to obey her husband -- only one Egyptian in 20 disagreed. Moaddel does not link Egyptian conservatism to religion. ""Egyptians have become more sexist in the past decade. They have become less religious, less supportive of Sharia (Islamic law), but on the issue of gender, more conservative,"" he said. ""The problem with Egypt is not just religion, it is an intellectual trend. It is hard to say what caused the Egyptians to become less supportive of gender equality,"" he said, but suggested it could be due to general social turmoil. ""When there is a high level of social insecurity, people tend to fall back on traditional values,"" he said. His study is primarily an investigation of social attitudes in Tunisia, which the report labels the birthplace of the Arab Spring, toward a wide variety of subjects including political engagement, national identity, secularism and violence against Americans. But it delves into comparisons between Tunisia and six other countries: Saudia Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and Pakistan. In one of the survey's most striking questions, researchers showed people pictures of women with six different types of head covering, ranging from the full-body burqa to no covering at all. They asked people to say which was the most appropriate way for women to dress in public. Across the seven countries, the most popular answer was a tight-fitting white scarf that completely covered the hair and ears but showed the entire face -- a type of hijab. Just over half of Egyptians chose that option, as did well over half -- 57% -- in Tunisia, and just under half in Iraq and Turkey. But there were significant differences from country to country. Lebanon was the most liberal, with nearly half (49%) of respondents saying women should not wear any head covering at all, and another 12% opting for a loosely-fitting headscarf that showed some hair. At the same time, only 49% said it should be up to a woman to choose how she dresses. Turkey, which for decades banned women from wearing headscarves in public and is now in the middle of a controversy over the subject, was arguably the next most liberal country after Lebanon. One in three (32%) said a woman should not wear any head covering, while another 17% chose the loose headscarf. Just over half (52%) of Turks said a woman should be allowed to choose how she dresses. Saudi Arabia was the most conservative in terms of personal opinion, with about two out of three people (63%) saying a woman should wear a niqab, covering the entire head and face, showing only the eyes. Another 11% picked the full burqa, showing nothing at all of a woman's head and including a mesh over the face. And yet Saudi Arabia fell in the middle of the pack in terms of whether women should be allowed to choose what they wear, with 47% supporting it. Only Saudi Arabia had more than token support for the burqa, with just 4% supporting it in Iraq, 3% backing it in Pakistan, and numbers even lower in the other countries. Surveys were carried out between January 2011 and June 2013 for the study, ""The Birthplace of the Arab Spring: Values and Perceptions of the Tunisian Public in a Comparative Perspective."" The study was based on interviews with 2,005 people in Saudi Arabia and at least 3,000 in each of the other countries. The report, published in December, did not say what the margins of error were. The seven countries include several but not all of the most populous countries in the broader Middle East, from North Africa to South Asia. .","A tight-fitting scarf is the most appropriate thing for a woman to wear, Middle Easterners say .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, Raquel and Pedro Alvarado buried three of their children -- Erica, Alex and Jose Angel -- in the Mexican village of El Control, just five miles south of the Texas border. The final resting place for the youths -- all in their 20s -- is the place where their family originated. But this small community, administered by the larger border city of Matamoros, merely provides bookends to the lives these three Americans had north of the Rio Grande. The siblings were born in the United States, grew up in Progreso, Texas, and continued to make their lives there. They disappeared on October 13 -- kidnapped, witnesses say -- as they returned to Texas from a trip to visit their father in El Control. Their bodies were found last week. Each was bound at their hands and feet, the Tamaulipas State Attorney General's Office said, and each had a gunshot wound to the head. A fourth victim, Jose Castaneda, met the same fate. Castaneda was Erica's boyfriend, her family said. All four were killed the same day they disappeared, a spokesman for the State Attorney General's Office said, without elaborating. Some witnesses told investigators that the armed men who confronted and took the youths belonged to a new security force known as ""Grupo Hercules,"" State Attorney General Ismael Quintanilla Acosta told reporters. Grupo Hercules was created one month before the disappearance of the youths. It is touted as an elite security force under the direction of the mayor of Matamoros, 37-year-old Leticia Salazar. In parts of Mexico like this stretch of border, where drug cartels battle each other and law enforcement, things aren't always what they seem. Drug gangs have been known to pose as cops. Cops have been known to be on cartel payrolls. Cases of mistaken identity have had deadly consequences. But what troubles Pedro and Raquel Alvarado is that no one has offered a motive or theory about why their children and Castaneda were killed. No one has accused the Alvarado siblings of being involved in criminal activity. And while nine members of Grupo Hercules were interrogated by investigators, no arrests have been made. Salazar, the Matamoros mayor, has neither defended nor disciplined her security forces -- at least publicly. Contacted by CNN, Salazar referred questions to the city's public affairs team, which earlier said it did not have any comment on the allegations against Grupo Hercules and could not confirm why the group was created or even its size. In a news release announcing the group's unveiling, Grupo Hercules is described as being tasked with combating crime and made up of forces capable of carrying out intelligence and high-risk operations. A week ago, the attorney general said his investigators would call in the mayor for questioning, but that has not happened. ""I don't know why they took them,"" Pedro Alvarado said. ""They didn't start trouble with anyone. They were quiet, not aggressive."" If her children were mixed up in something criminal, there should be a record of their arrests or charges against them, but those are nonexistent, Raquel Alvarado said. ""If I knew they were doing something wrong, I would have recognized it as their mother,"" she said. ""And until someone proves otherwise, I will continue defending them."" Pedro, Raquel's former husband, was the one to identify the remains of his children, which were in an advanced state of decomposition, the State Attorney General's Office said. He identified them by their clothing, shoes and some tattoos. The U.S. Consulate in Matamoros has been assisting the family. ""We have been in contact with Mexican officials both in Washington and in Mexico to find out further details of the case, and will take appropriate action (if necessary) once more is known about the circumstances,"" a State Department official said. An FBI spokeswoman said the agency is assisting Mexican officials with any part of the investigation on the U.S. side of the border. Three lives . The final Facebook post that Erica Alvarado shared -- at least publicly -- is a fitting, if unplanned, goodbye. It is a collage of photos of her four children atop a backdrop with the words ""I love you."" She was born in Florida, and like her siblings, grew up in Progreso, a Texas town on the border and about as close as you can get to El Control on the U.S. side of the boundary. She was a dedicated mother, Pedro Alvarado said, and was planning to enroll in a nursing program. Her brother Alex loved his Chevy Tahoe, his father said. Alex's social media postings reflect that: photos of the Tahoe muddied, photos after a paint job, the Tahoe as a profile picture. The same armed men who took his children took the Tahoe, Pedro Alvarado said. The 22-year-old had a prominent tattoo on his left arm -- an image of St. Jude, the saint of lost causes -- the father said. By now, Alex and his brother, Jose Angel, should have been in Missouri, doing seasonal agricultural work, Pedro Alvarado said. Jose Angel was born in Houston, and Alex in Harlingen, during Pedro's own days as a seasonal migrant worker in the United States, their father said. Routine visit . The siblings visited their father in El Control each week, Pedro Alvarado said. On their short drive back to Texas, the Alvarado siblings stopped at ""La Curva Texas,"" a small restaurant underneath the last major overpass before the Los Indios International Bridge, Pedro Alvarado said. They arrived separately, Raquel Alvarado said. According to what witnesses have told her, Alex and Jose Angel arrived at the restaurant to find armed men beating up their sister and her boyfriend. The brothers intervened, and the armed men overpowered all four and placed hoods over their heads before escorting them away, the mother said. It was there, he said, that they were last seen before their bodies were found 16 days later. Raquel Alvarado said she and Pedro have told all this to authorities, but she accuses investigators of moving slowly. The facts that are known, she said, are thanks to the investigative work of Pedro, who tracked down witnesses. There was an outpouring of support at the funeral, Raquel Alvarado said. Family from across Texas and Mexico attended, and when the funeral procession moved from the church to the burial ground, they found that the crowd wouldn't fit in the cemetery. On Monday, the mother was back in Progreso, hoping to get some sleep to recover from the whirlwind of mourning, frustration and media spotlight. ""I hope when I wake up I will learn this was all a nightmare,"" she said. ""But I know it isn't."" Mexican mayor, wife arrested in case of missing students .

"Washington (CNN) -- South Dakota Democratic candidate Rick Weiland was glad when his party's Senate campaign arm injected $1 million into his race, but that didn't keep him from pledging to oppose the party's leader in the chamber. Weiland said Thursday during a televised debate that he would vote against prolonging Sen. Harry Reid's tenure as the Democratic Leader, and challenged his Republican opponent Gov. Mike Rounds to pledge to oppose Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as the Republican leader. ""Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell have given us the most dysfunctional government in a generation and they need to step aside,"" Weiland said. Weiland's pledge to oppose his party's leader in the Senate doesn't come as much of a surprise to those following the race. Behind the scenes, Reid not-so-quietly opposed Weiland's bid to be the party's nominee in South Dakota, which set off a feud between Reid and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who backed Weiland's bid. How South Dakota became the Senate fight surprise . But Weiland framed his opposition in anti-Washington terms, calling Washington ""broken"" and both parties ""beholden to big money."" ""Our Congress has been bought off and nothing is going to change until we get the money out of our politics,"" Weiland said. ""The people of South Dakota deserve more than business as usual."" Weiland has gained a reputation for his folksy campaign style, even writing and performing modified renditions of popular songs -- turning ""Wagon Wheel"" into a song about his low-budget campaign. And despite the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's $1 million investment in South Dakota, the support didn't flow directly to Weiland -- instead funding attack ads against Rounds. And those attacks could bolster either Weiland's campaign or former Sen. Larry Pressler's independent campaign. Pressler, who edged out Weiland in recent polls, has not said who he would caucus with, but his previous endorsements' for President Barack Obama's two presidential campaigns have fueled speculation that he could caucus with Democrats if elected. Could Independents tip the balance of the Senate? Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Weiland said he would vote against Reid for the party's leadership .
The statement comes after Reid reportedly opposed Weiland's candidacy ."

"(CNN) -- The Ebola outbreak in West Africa is a health crisis of massive proportions -- and one that keeps on growing. So far, the World Health Organization estimates nearly 4,300 people have likely been infected in the latest outbreak, with almost 2,300 deaths. With no proven vaccine or treatment currently available, and a case fatality rate of up to 90%, alarm bells are ringing across the globe. How worried should the United States be? And how can we help respond to this crisis? It's true that while Ebola is deadly and this outbreak is historic, the risk of it spreading to the United States is small. We have an advanced public health infrastructure that should be well placed to quickly screen for the virus and safely manage patients with Ebola. In addition, our health care providers have the training and equipment needed to control infections and protect themselves and others when caring for Ebola patients. However, a small risk does not mean there is no risk at all. With this in mind, the single most important thing we can do to protect ourselves is stopping the Ebola outbreak in West Africa before it can spread to other parts of the world. In July, I visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, our nation's health protection agency, and met with its director, Tom Frieden, to learn more about how the CDC is working with other U.S. agencies, the WHO, and domestic and international partners to coordinate Ebola assistance and disease control activities in West Africa. During that visit, we toured the CDC's command center for coordinating emergency responses to this outbreak. Last week, I met with Frieden again for an update, and to discuss his recent visit to the region. The CDC has deployed teams of public health experts to West Africa to assist with disease surveillance, health education, contact tracing, and database management. On Tuesday, I will participate in a Senate hearing on the response to this health crisis. One of the witnesses will be Dr. Kent Brantly, an American missionary physician who was successfully treated for Ebola in the United States. Brantly was given an experimental treatment and a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor before being flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. It seems like a promising breakthrough, and I look forward to learning more at the hearing. The seriousness of the current outbreak has been compounded by a number of factors that together have made this the worst outbreak of the disease in history. As the epidemic cripples already weak public health systems in the region, doctors on the ground are dealing with basic problems such as limited staff, little equipment, and poor facilities. This has made disease surveillance, isolation and effective care virtually impossible. Additionally, high levels of public mistrust and fear about the disease and the response have resulted in African patients breaking out of hospitals and communities hiding infected individuals. Cross-border travel between the three primary affected countries has also caused Ebola to spread quickly. All of these factors have made this outbreak a particular challenge to contain, especially in remote, rural regions of West Africa. Experimental treatments for individuals infected with Ebola are currently being developed, but they have not yet been tested for effectiveness and safety in clinical trials. It would, of course, be advantageous to have a proven vaccine or drug therapy to tackle Ebola, but in the meantime, basic care should be provided to significantly help those infected and prevent the spread of disease. Such steps can include providing and reinforcing a trained medical workforce to coordinate activities on the ground in Africa, educating local communities about Ebola and how it is transmitted, supplying basic medical equipment like masks and gloves, and assisting the governments in West Africa to strengthen their public health systems and emergency response infrastructures. Ebola can be stopped, but to do so requires both effective containment action and basic medical care. With the right international response and coordination, appropriate patient care can be provided efficiently and the spread of infection can be halted. Ebola does not have to be a death sentence, but leadership and global cooperation are required to meet this serious challenge.","World Health Organization: Ebola virus has case fatality rate of up to 90% .

"(CNN) -- Like many big cities in America, Atlanta is surrounded by a circular highway that connects with various freeway arteries that go through the downtown area. Weekday mornings and early evenings, no matter which highway you're on, or what direction you're going, you'll likely end up stuck in some hot traffic hell. Dana Jones, 26, used to drive from the south end of the city by the airport to a northern suburb at peak commuting times, right through the daily mess. ""There were so many people out,"" Jones says. ""You get road rage because nobody will let you in; nobody will merge right. It's just aggravating."" Despite the perils of a long commute, most people in the United States drive to work, according to the American Community Survey (PDF). In fact, more than 75% of Americans make the trek to work alone. The stress of waiting in gridlock can get intense if you're in a hurry, leaving you feeling frustrated and anxious about the traffic. That stress can translate into deeper health hazards. Try to distract yourself with your smartphone, and you can put yourself and other drivers in even more danger. Longer commutes may steal health and fitness . Road rage: An 'emotional spin cycle' LeeAnne Minnick was sitting in gridlocked traffic, waiting to get on an on-ramp, in a line of cars that had pulled over to let an ambulance pass. Suddenly, another driver darted out behind Minnick to tail the ambulance, taking advantage of the cars that had been moved, to enter the freeway. ""That incensed me,"" says Minnick, who makes a lengthy commute from Athens, Georgia, to Atlanta -- about a 70-mile trip -- three days a week. ""I immediately flew into a rage over it."" That happened a couple months ago, and Minnick still sounds irritated when she describes it. She doesn't act aggressively toward other drivers, but she does get bothered by disrespectful behavior on the road. It's easy to get lost in a cycle of emotions where you're talking to yourself and ruminating about traffic situations, says Leon James, professor of psychology at the University of Hawaii and co-author of ""Road Rage and Aggressive Driving."" ""Impatience, if you don't handle it at the beginning, tends to turn into resentment and anger,"" James says. The back seat of the car is what James calls the ""road rage nursery."" It's where kids hear their parents cursing out other drivers and expressing their disbelief about everyone else's poor skills on the road. Children learn the culture of aggressive driving in this way, he says. ""We use it as an opportunity to disrespect everything and say bad words that we would be shocked to say in any other place."" Another problem is that after a bad commute, people tend not to let it go, James says. They walk into the office and complain about their experiences, which leads to entire conversations about bad traffic and bad drivers. This venting may feel good in the moment, but it reinforces the emotions for the next driving trip, he says. James' solution: Monitor your traffic emotions. You might try keeping a diary of how you feel every day after your commute, or just keep a mental note about your state of mind. What are your negative thoughts while on the road? Are they justified? Confronting your internal dialogue about commuting frustrations may help. You may realize that your negative thoughts may not be proportional to the offenses you perceive from other drivers. James recommends asking yourself: ""Am I the kind of person who thinks these things about people?"" and ""Is this the kind of person I want to be?"" Suicides outpace car crashes as leading cause of death from injuries . Stress: When driving kills slowly . Traffic situations may trigger in us primal instincts that evolved in humans to promote survival, so that we can protect ourselves against threats, experts say. The ""aggressive, combative, competitive frame for driving"" may be linked to our evolutionary past, but it could have implications for cardiovascular disease, says David Strayer, a psychology professor at the University of Utah. In one experiment, Strayer and colleagues ran a simulation where people drove under the assumption that they were late to a meeting, and there was a financial incentive to get there before other people. One group drove in high-density traffic, another had an easier traffic environment. Some people were told there was a time limit. Men more then women got into aggressive driving mode, showing an elevated blood pressure when under pressure to weave their way through heavy traffic. In general, both men and women who adopt an aggressive driving persona seem to show this, Strayer says. ""In the simulator studies we've done, they'll actually start driving by cars and flipping them off and honking at them,"" Strayer says. ""That's just a computer, a computer rendition!"" Long-term stress increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, he says. Research on the precise level of cardiovascular risk is limited, but recent data doesn't paint a flattering picture for the vehicular commuter. A 2012 study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the farther people commute by vehicle, the higher their blood pressure and body mass index is likely to be. Also, the farther the commute, the less physical activity the person was likely to get. Experts recommend making the extra effort to avoid peak driving hours. You may even end up getting home at the same time as if you had left earlier. ""Maybe it is better off to say, 'I'm going to put the radio on a station that's nice, and kind of chill out for the 30 or 40 minutes, rather than aggressively try to get home and beat everyone else,'"" Strayer says. Distractions: When driving kills quickly . People get bored while driving for a long time. They want something else going on while they're just looking at cars crawling around them. But some forms of entertainment are far more dangerous than others. Strayer and colleagues used a driving simulator to look at just how distracting technology can be in the car. A 2008 study from his group, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, found that people made more errors driving while talking on a cell phone than while chatting with another passenger. The impact of those errors is more than you might imagine. The researchers showed in a 2006 study (PDF) that talking on a cell phone, in terms of how it impairs driving, is comparable to a blood alcohol level of .08, which is the legal limit in the United States. About one in three fatalities on the road can be linked to some kind of distraction; some estimates put this figure even higher, Strayer says. Distractions in your car can slow everyone else down, too, Strayer says. Computer modeling shows that if one car is not keeping up with the flow of traffic, the number of vehicles per lane, per hour, declines as more drivers are distracted. That can add precious minutes onto the commute you're complaining is too long anyway. We all know that texting while driving is risky. But even hands-free, voice-activated interaction with phones can be distracting, Strayer says. Some conversations are not mundane -- you may find yourself in a heated argument or in the middle of a breakup talk (not to mention a breakup text). What are the precise demands on your brain with voice-activated systems and what are the consequences of that? Bryan Reimer, research scientist at the MIT AgeLab and associate director of the New England University Transportation Center, is looking into this question. Reimer is working with Toyota's Collaborative Safety Research Center to study the visual and nonvisual demands of your attention while driving. Results should be out sometime next year. ""If you feel anxiety and your phone goes off, that's a problem,"" Strayer says. With all of the notifications barraging our smartphones from e-mail, text, social media and calendars, ""It's a little unclear what long-term consequences of that are."" Changing your commute? After several years, the daily drive to and from work in high-traffic areas can really get under some people's skin. ""It was something that was taking an enormous toll on my overall happiness, on my ability to deal with stress, on the amount of free time that I had,"" says Micah Puett, who used to live in Atlanta and worked for Turner Broadcasting in the 1990s. It wasn't until Puett moved to Denver and found himself in a similarly perilous commuting situation that he realized how much the driving was affecting him. He made a bold choice: centralizing where he lives and works. Puett now lives in a more urban neighborhood of Denver, where he can walk and bike around. In the warmer months, he'll ride a motor scooter, and two weeks might pass without him using a car. Since he is a contractor, Puett can be selective about which companies he works for based on travel time. (He'll accept longer commutes if they're short-term commitments.) ""Having lived the way I live now, you couldn't pay me enough for me to live out in the suburbs, or live anywhere, and commit to a 45-minute or hourlong commute every day,"" he says. ""There's no amount of money that I would accept to do that."" But there are plenty of people who don't -- or can't -- draw that line. Ramona Patrick is the principal of an elementary school and drives 55 miles through Los Angeles to get to work Monday through Friday. She'll leave later in the evening to avoid traffic, but ""your life is either on the road or at work."" And Minnick says she loves her job enough to make the trek from Athens three times a week. Podcasts and audio books help her get through. ""I would never say that this is fun,"" she says of her commute. ""I feel like I've done a good job of making it more enjoyable. I'm really good at knowing what's going to make me happy for two hours.""","Despite the perils of a long commute, most people in the United States drive to work .

"(CNN) -- It's a Jonah-and-the-whale kind of moment. You wake up, and your guest room appears normal. But as you get your bearings, you realize that you're in the belly of a reptile -- otherwise known as Australia's Gagudju Crocodile Holiday Inn. The curious trend of zoomorphic architecture -- that is, buildings that look like animals -- has been around for millennia (ever heard of the Sphinx?). And new species of animal-like buildings continue to turn up in concrete jungles like Bangkok, along roadsides or in national parks. Even serious tastemakers like Pritzker Prize-winning architect Frank Gehry have been inspired to inject a playful animalistic motif into their building plans. For the Vila Olímpica in the seaside city of Barcelona, Gehry managed to capture the sleek, muscular movement of a fish in motion in a way that is utterly sublime. Read on for more strange buildings that -- beastly or beautiful, by design or by accident -- pay tribute to the animal kingdom. Long may these crazy critters stand. See more buildings shaped like animals . Church by the Sea, Madeira Beach, Florida . Times were hard at the end of WWII, but this small community managed to cobble together a collection plate large enough to buy land. Volunteers flooded to help, including an architect who unwittingly constructed two eyes and a beak from the bell tower, eventually inspiring the nickname Chicken Church. When the bell rings it makes a clucking sound—well, not really, but it looks like it should. Travel + Leisure: World's coolest futuristic buildings . Vila Olímpica, Barcelona . In the late 1980s, many architects were obsessed with Grecian columns. Frank Gehry felt that postmodernists weren't looking back far enough. He surmised that we are all descended from fish and, for the 1992 Olympics, set about creating a structure near the Hotel Arts that would reflect our 300-million-year-old ancestor. The metal canopy, measuring roughly 114 by 177 feet, is supported by a wood and steel space frame and was the first of several fish-inspired buildings Gehry created. Cat Kindergarten, Wolfartsweier, Germany . This ingenious preschool is so adorable that it makes any work seem like play. Artist Tomi Ungerer and architect Ayla Suzan Yöndel designed it so that children enter through the cat's mouth, where the classrooms and cafeteria are located, and exit into the backyard via a slippery dip for a tail. Travel + Leisure: Cutest baby animals at U.S. zoos . Observation Tower, St. Georges de Windsor, Quebec . About two hours east of Montreal, on the drive toward the Maine border, is a roadside attraction worth a detour. Local artist Josée Perreault designed an observation tower from boulders painted to look like a cow reclining in a field. Upon climbing the squat tower, travelers are rewarded with a view of real-life cows reclining similarly in green pastures. Ladprao Tuk Chang, Bangkok . You'd have to have a thick hide to work in the 335-foot-tall Elephant Tower, easily a contender for one of the world's ugliest buildings. Architect Ong-ard Satrabhandhu's creation is certainly one of the most famous in Bangkok, thanks to three towers -- the pachyderm's thick legs and trunk. Travel + Leisure: World's most mysterious buildings . Universum Science Center, Bremen, Germany . A giant silver clam shell and a giant chrome sperm whale rising from the reflecting pool are two popular interpretations of Thomas Klumpp's design. Inside the Universum Science Center, opened in 2000, are interactive exhibits also meant to provoke and engage the visitor: you can, for example, feel sound waves vibrate throughout your entire body. Lucy the Elephant, Margate, New Jersey . Lucy was the first example of zoomorphic architecture in America, with the patent to prove it. Built in 1882 to sell New Jersey real estate, Lucy then found use as an office, a bar and a summer home. The patented 65-foot-tall tin and wood construction was meant to be one of a pack, but giant elephants didn't take off the way the architect intended. To this day, Lucy stands proudly alone. Gagudju Crocodile Holiday Inn, Kakadu National Park, Australia . Upon arrival, you don't immediately appreciate how true this hotel is to its name: the low-lying, curved corridors could simply be a way to give each room a unique view of the landscape, rich with kangaroos and other wildlife. A bird's-eye view, however, reveals that the entire hotel is shaped like one of the region's most feared residents, the crocodile, and that every guest has been swallowed whole.

"(CNN) -- The Academy Awards continued its upward climb in the ratings on Sunday, reaching a 10-year high with an average audience of 43 million viewers in the United States. The awards telecast, typically the year's No. 2 television event behind the Super Bowl, has grown its total audience for each of the past three years, despite perennial complaints about its length (this year the show clocked in at 212 minutes). Last year, the Oscars averaged 40.4 million viewers. Award shows in general have been enjoying a ratings resurgence, partly because of the popularity of so-called ""social TV,"" the tendency for viewers to chat along with live TV on Facebook and Twitter. The Golden Globes scored its biggest audience in a decade in January, and the Grammys set what was essentially a modern-day ratings record in February. The producers of Sunday's Oscars telecast and the host, Ellen DeGeneres, stoked the ""social TV"" phenomenon with a much-tweeted celebrity selfie. Twitter said it registered upwards of 14.7 million messages about the telecast on Sunday night. ABC said the 43 million viewer total for the Oscars was the awards show's best since 2004, when ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" won best picture. In a key advertising demographic for the network, adults 18 to 49, the show had a 12.9 rating, down one-tenth of a point from last year. The network also said that its special after-the-Oscars edition of ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" grew its audience for the third year in a row, just like the awards telecast. The talk show averaged 6.99 million viewers.","The 86th Academy Awards reached a 10-year ratings high .

"(CNN) -- Forty years ago this week, Egyptian and Syrian troops attacked the state of Israel. To enhance the surprise of their attack, the invading armies struck on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. Egypt enjoyed three days of tactical success, Syria less than that. The war ended with Israeli troops approaching Damascus and an entire Egyptian army surrounded. Despite Israel's ultimate military success, the war was interpreted by many as something close to a defeat for the Jewish state. Israel's two previous wars -- in 1956 against Egypt alone and in 1967 against an alliance of all its neighbors -- had terminated in lightning Israeli victories. The Yom Kippur War lasted 19 days, longer than 1956 and 1967 combined. Israel suffered more than 2,500 killed in action. Hundreds more Israelis were captured in the first days of fighting; dozens of these captives were gruesomely tortured and killed. Israel's enemies also seemed to have succeeded in upending the region's balance of economic and political power. The Arab members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut production and imposed an embargo on two Israeli allies: the United States and the Netherlands. A similar embargo had fizzled in 1967. This time, however, the embargo coincided with a surge in global commodity and energy prices. The whole Western world plunged into severe recession in 1974-75. Altogether, many analysts drew a grim conclusion from 1973 about the future of the Jewish state: Israeli military supremacy had come to an end. The world would have to adjust to the new power of Israel's oil-rich enemies. How wrong they were. In 1973, Israel's enemies scored their first battlefield successes since the foundation of the Jewish state. They also scored their last battlefield successes. In 1982, Israel and Syria battled once more, this time in the air over Lebanon. Syria lost 82 planes, a quarter of its air force; Israel lost not a single one. In the decades since 1973, Israel has suffered repeated terrorist atrocities. Iraq, Syria and now Iran have all sought to develop nuclear weapons. But none of Israel's enemies would ever again dare wage a conventional military campaign against the country that had looked so weak on the morning of October 6, 1973. The war waged against Israel has come to look downright puny compared with the savage wars that have ripped apart the Middle East beyond Israel's borders: the Lebanese civil war that erupted in 1975, the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, the Algerian civil war of the 1990s, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 followed by the Gulf War of 1991, the civil war after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and now the civil war in Syria and the violence inside Egypt. Back in 1973, Israel seemed -- if nothing else -- at least the center of the story in the Middle East. First the struggle between Israel and its neighbors, and later the struggle between Israel and the Palestinian population, were represented as the master key that would determine the future of the region -- and the price of oil for the world. That representation has proved signally false. A kind of peace has come to Israel's borders. Egypt and Jordan have signed peace treaties with Israel, and Syria has given up the military struggle. Meanwhile, the Palestinian problem has settled into seething stalemate, with governments in Gaza and the West Bank more or less at war with each other and neither able to say ""yes"" to anything Israel proposes. And yet ... none of this seems to make a difference to any of the larger problems of the region. The Palestinians could sign a treaty tomorrow, and Saudi Arabia and Iran would continue their proxy war inside Syria. Direct rail service could commence between Tel Aviv and Amman, and it would not change the fact that Egypt's population is growing faster than its economy. As Israel has become stronger and richer since 1973, it has also curiously become less important to its region. ""Peace in the Middle East"" seems as remote as ever, not because of animosity between Israel and its neighbors but because of internal hatreds within those neighbors. In October 1973, many wondered whether time was not running out for the little state with too little oil and too many enemies. On this 40th anniversary of the 1973 war, Israel is the only state in the region we can feel confident will still be there, under its present system of government, on the occasion of 50th. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","40 years ago, Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on Yom Kippur .

"(CNN) -- Unlike the A-list star of Cambodia's tourism show -- Siem Reap -- Phnom Penh doesn't have an ancient UNESC0-listed temple complex filled with beautiful archeological wonders to seduce global tourists. Most visitors hit the riverside capital as a quick stopover on the way to or from Angkor Wat -- the real reason they flew across the globe to visit Cambodia. It's to be expected, really. More: Cambodia's amazing Phare Circus . Not many bucket lists are topped with visits to the ghosts of genocidal dictatorships. Among Phnom Penh's most popular tourist attractions are a former killing field that exhibits skeletal remains from its Khmer Rouge era and a haunting memorial at the site where thousands of executions took place under their rule. But a cosmopolitan buzz that's lately been humming through the cracks of this city of 2 million-plus (and growing) is helping Phnom Penh drown its rep as just a sobering war history stop on the Angkor trail. Boutiques run by French-Cambodians trained at some of the top Paris design schools dot city streets. New pubs where well-dressed locals enjoy cocktails seemingly open every week, venues holding no likeness to the decaying hostess bars that once dominated the nightlife scene. French influence . Though Cambodia's French colonial period ended in 1953, France's cobwebs remain. Colonial architecture still lines the streets. The local love of crusty baguettes means good bread can be found citywide. More: 10 meals every visitor to Cambodia should try . Impressive restaurants serving innovative cuisine from as far off as Latin America and fine dining venues that celebrate the underrated Khmer cuisine are also on the rise. It's an exciting time for Phnom Penh, which is slowly laying the groundwork to become a top weekend urban getaway for those in the region. Affordability brings visitors . It'd be foolish to pretend price isn't a big factor in the city's growing bag of allures. Phnom Penh is cheap. A dinner for two at a high-end restaurant with a bottle of good wine will rarely put you out more than $50. A night at the hottest hotel ticket in town, the incomparable Raffles Le Royal, starts from $180, even lower on some booking websites. A transfer from the airport in one of its BMW series 5 cars costs $30. More: Insider Guide: Best of Cambodia . Well-designed boutique hotels range from $50 to $100 a night. An impeccably made original full-length gown can be purchased from one of those aforementioned boutiques for less than $200. Returning Cambodians fueling the city's rise . Though expats are contributing to the cosmopolitan growth, another exciting segment is making a mark -- returning Cambodians bringing experiences from abroad. Many are young adults who grew up in Western countries such as the United States, Australia, Canada and France, where their parents moved to escape the horrific events of the 1970s. Some don't remember Phnom Penh, having left as young children. Others were born overseas. Soreasmey Ke Bin is a 36-year-old French-Cambodian who moved to Phnom Penh in 2002. He's president of the Anvaya Initiative, a nonprofit group founded in 2010 to support Cambodian diaspora looking to give the country another chance. ""I think we can bring a lot of positive things to this country, in terms of work experience, investment and culture,"" he says, adding that a challenge is convincing potential returnees that the country has a lot to offer. More: Phnom Penh's In-and-Out-inspired burger joint . When asked to name some of the individuals behind the city's new flavor, he quickly rattles off a good two dozen notable returning Cambodians in fields as diverse as architecture, music, design, art and choreography. Standouts include Visal Sok, who's behind the city's first hip-hop group and about to release his first movie in November; and artist Borany Mam, a French-Cambodian doing restoration work at the National Museum. Then there's Armand GerbiÃ©, a former French Foreign Legion soldier who worked for years at famed Paris cabaret Lido before moving to Phnom Penh to open the popular Armand's The Bistro. And well-known French-Cambodian designer Romyda Keth, who recently opened a restaurant and boutique hotel. ""I hope we can become a niche country,"" says Soreasmey of his vision for Cambodia's future. ""A boutique market. We are small. We can't compete with Singapore or Thailand for big brand shopping. But we've got culture, the sea, the outdoors. I think it's a good mix."" Dreams vs. reality . Cosmopolitan potential aside, tourists who like their travel destinations wrapped up in postcard-pretty packages will be uncomfortable in Phnom Penh. The ongoing economic growth on the backs of footwear and garment manufacturing, foreign investment and tourism might be putting Cadillac SUVs and even the odd Rolls Royce on Phnom Penh's perennially dusty streets. More: 10-step guide to Siem Reap . But most live well below the poverty line, with 40% of Cambodia's population surviving on less than $1.25 a day according to non-government organization ActionAid. Though violent crime is rare, petty theft is extremely common. Multiple locals share stories of having their iPhone 5s yanked out of their hands mid-text or a carelessly laid bag snatched from the seat of a tuk-tuk by a passing motorbiker. At popular tourist spots like the Grand Palace, tourists still need to walk a heart-wrenching gauntlet of amputees and child beggars before they can enter. The first page of a local magazine targeted at tourists has an arresting full-page ad sponsored in part by UNICEF, reminding visitors that ""children are not tourist attractions."" It's part of a campaign to educate about the harm of ""orphanage tourism,"" in which visitors pay to visit local institutions, thereby creating a market for more orphans. But for visitors who can handle a side of grit, Phnom Penh is definitely worth a few days of exploration -- even if it's just for a stopover on the way to Siem Reap. In the end you might just find the capital gives those old Angkor ruins a bit of competition in your mental Cambodia highlight reel.

"(CNN) -- In the final chapter of her storied Olympic figure skating career, South Korea's Yuna Kim won silver -- not able to defend her shot at gold against a Russian teenager who seemingly came out of nowhere to get the top prize. Instantly, there was controversy. Russia's Adelina Sotnikova finished with a total score of 224.59, beating Kim's score of 219.11 by 5.48 points after the free skate program. Sotnikova, 17, became the first female Russian skater to win in the category. Some pointed out that she had stepped out after landing a triple combination, and others raised questions about the anonymous judging system. Dick Button, a men's figure skating two-time Olympic gold medalist, said he didn't think Sotnikova was the whole package. It didn't help that one of the judges had been suspended for a year for trying to fix an event at the Winter Olympics 16 years ago. Or that another is married to the head of the Russian figure skating federation. American figure skater Ashley Wagner also slammed the judging Thursday night. She skated without falling but finished seventh behind several skaters that had stumbled on the ice. She even finished behind Russian skater Julia Lipnitskaia, who fell more than once. ""I feel gypped,"" Wagner said, according to Yahoo! Sports. ""People don't want to watch a sport where you see people fall down and somehow score above someone who goes clean."" 5 moments from Thursday at the Winter Olympics . Critics have created a petition at change.org urging that the judging be investigated. Early Friday morning, the petition had more than 1.6 million supporters. Opinions varied on whether the right skater got the gold medal. Sotnikova's program had seven triple jumps, which was one more than Kim's. The final judgment split sports journalists and figure skating experts. ""It's debatable, but not a robbery,"" wrote Chris Chase of USA Today. ""Sotnikova skated well enough to win gold. She had a carefully constructed program with seven triples, five of which were in a combo. Kim had six and three, respectively. Thus, Sotnikova was going in with a higher total and made more margin for error, which she took advantage of with a minor hop after one exchange."" Sotnikova's technical score of 75.54 dwarfed Kim's technical score of 69.69. Results: Women's figure skating results . But others weren't convinced. Kurt Browning, a four-time world champion, told The New York Times: ""I just couldn't see how Yu-na and Sotnikova were so close in the components. I was shocked. What, suddenly, she just became a better skater overnight? I don't know what happened. I'm still trying to figure it out."" Italy's Carolina Kostner took the bronze. Kim was looking to be only the third woman to defend her Olympic figure skating title, joining Katarina Witt, who took to the ice in Calgary 26 years ago, and Sonja Henie, who competed in the 1920s and '30s. In 2010, she took gold in the Vancouver Olympics by a landslide, where she scored a record 228.56 points to win in women's figure skating. She eclipsed her closest rival by a massive 23.06 points. Known as ""Queen Yuna"" to her legions of fans, Kim's victory in Vancouver made her the first Korean figure skater to win a gold medal.

"(CNN) -- Two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks played a role in the surprise ending of a domestic assault case in Los Angeles, according to defense attorney Andrew Flier. Hanks had been serving as a juror in the trial since it started last week. Flier's client was facing up to a year in jail and the attorney was prepared to offer closing arguments in the case on Wednesday. Instead, as proceedings wrapped Tuesday, the prosecuting attorney revealed that another lawyer in the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office had interacted with Hanks outside the courtroom, thanking him for his service. As a result, Flier asked the court for a mistrial, citing prosecutorial misconduct. In a hearing on Wednesday morning, lawyers on both sides of the case convened and settled on a reduced charge for the defendant: disturbing the peace and a $150 fine. City Attorney's Office spokesperson Frank Mateljan confirmed the interaction with Hanks, saying, ""The city attorney has been appraised of the situation and will be reviewing it."" CNN reached out to representatives for Hanks for comment, but has not heard back. The alleged victim's reaction to the resolution was unavailable. Prosecutors do not identify those who makes claims of domestic violence, and the parties involved have made no public statement, Mateljan said. Flier said he was initially concerned that having a Hollywood star on the jury would unfairly influence the case's outcome. ""I think because of his celebrity status and because of his personality, I think (the jury) would have followed him."" But after interviewing Hanks in jury selection, Flier decided he was a good fit for the final slot on the jury. ""He never looked or made any statements like he wanted to get off jury duty. So based on everything, he seemed like a very fair juror,"" Flier said. Hanks' appearance didn't only affect proceedings inside the courtroom. Flier said the star also drew quite a crowd of photographers and fans outside the courthouse afterward. ""Everyone was taking photographs. He was smiling. He welcomed anybody,"" Flier said. If the case hadn't ended in a plea, Flier said he doesn't know how Hanks would have voted. ""He looked at me like he always had, smiled and said, 'I was going to vote the way of justice.' So he never disclosed what that justice was headed for, the defense or the prosecution."" CNN's JD Cargill contributed to this report.","Oscar winner Tom Hanks serves jury duty in Los Angeles .

"(Kaiser Health News) -- A decade ago, almost all doctors kept paper charts on every patient. That is changing quickly as laptops become as common as stethoscopes in exam rooms. Recent hacking attacks have raised questions about how safe that data may be. Here are some frequently asked questions about this evolution underway in American medicine, and the government programs sparking the change. Are my medical records stored electronically? At least some of the information you share with your doctor or any hospital or clinic where you've been treated is probably stored on a computer. It's pretty common for most hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices to digitally store your basic information including your name, address and insurance company, the same way many retailers do. It's also likely that at least some information about your specific medical conditions is linked to that data. Health care providers have been using computers to help them get paid for decades. That means many computer-generated bills sent to you and/or your insurance company contain medical details like the conditions you were treated for, prescriptions and referrals to specialists. Where things are really changing quickly is in the use of electronic records for day-to-day patient care. Until recently, most doctors used paper charts to record information generated during patient visits. But the 2009 economic stimulus package offered doctors and hospitals tens of thousands of dollars to help buy computers and software designed to replace paper charts. Adoption was slow at first, but as of June most hospitals and close to half of all doctors in America report that they are using systems that qualify for those payments. Some are aggressively digitizing older records stored on paper; others are not. Does the Affordable Care Act require doctors and hospitals to use electronic medical records? No. The stimulus package, which pre-dates Obamacare, offers doctors, hospitals and some other health providers money to help them upgrade from paper to digital records, but the Affordable Care Act does not. Nor does it require digital record use. The health law does offer bonus payments to health care providers that can prove they're more efficient and not unnecessarily duplicating tests and procedures. Electronic records make that easier. The ACA also includes penalties for those who fail to meet performance measures such as keeping people from returning to hospitals because they weren't treated properly the first time. More hospitals are starting to use electronic records to track patients, coordinate inpatient and post-hospital care and to record how well they're performing in an effort to win bonuses and avoid penalties put in place by the ACA. If electronic medical records are so common, why can't I e-mail my doctor? Some patients can. But concerns about privacy and payment mean many doctors would rather communicate with patients on the phone or face-to-face. Standard e-mail isn't secure enough to meet the standards of America's umbrella medical privacy law, known as HIPAA. That's why many doctors don't communicate with patients via e-mail, and continue to send prescriptions and referrals via fax. Some electronic records systems offer secure ""patient portals"" that allow patients and doctors to communicate electronically. More doctors and hospitals will have to start offering this service if they want to qualify for the maximum amount of stimulus act payments for going digital. But not all insurance companies will pay doctors for the time they spend communicating electronically, so many require patients to schedule an office visit instead. How secure are my electronic medical records? As more doctors and hospitals go digital with medical records, the size and frequency of data breaches are alarming privacy advocates and public health officials. Although health care providers face serious penalties if they allow patients' electronic records to be breached, thieves also have tremendous incentives to get around protections because health records contain so much valuable information. Privacy experts argue the health industry has been slow to respond to such incidents by adopting the encryption techniques used for years by financial companies. In the recent breach of Community Health System, a hospital chain based in Franklin, Tennessee, Chinese hackers bypassed the hospitals' security systems and stole personal data, including names, Social Security numbers and addresses of 4.5 million patients. Community Health said it would offer identity theft protection to affected patients and carried cyber insurance to mitigate some of its losses. This video from the federal Health and Human Services department's Office of Civil Rights explains some of the protections currently in place, as does as this fact sheet. The Federal Trade Commission offers this advice on preventing identity theft and protecting digital personal information. Can emergency room doctors call up my electronic medical records if I'm in an accident and unable to give them basic information? Probably not. A major criticism of electronic medical records in America is that the companies that make them have financial incentives to keep them from being easily shared. It's kind of like Windows versus Mac operating systems. Many companies are trying to win market share by creating software that doesn't ""talk"" to those made by other companies, so if a big hospital uses software from company X, then all the doctors that work with that hospital will have an incentive to buy that software, too. If you're unconscious and an ambulance takes you to a hospital you've been to before, they can probably call up their records if you're carrying some kind of identification. But they may not be able to access pertinent information stored on other doctors or hospitals' computers. Some states have good clearinghouses that allow health care providers to pull in all of a patient's digital health files, but they're still the exception at this point. Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.","At least some of the info you share with your doctor is probably stored on a computer .

"(CNN) -- In business, it's all about location, location, location. Even 12-year-old T.J. Guerrero knows that. Since 2013, he has been manning a lemonade stand at the corner of Patricia Avenue and San Salvador Drive in Dunedin, Florida, about 25 miles west of Tampa. He lives a few houses down the street from the junction, but got permission from the owners of the corner house to set up shop with his homemade sign at the higher traffic area during summer breaks and after school during the school year. But another neighbor on the street has been trying to put a squeeze on the kid's sweet operation, saying Guerrero's operation is a public nuisance. Dunedin City Manager Rob DiSpirito told CNN that the first complaint was lodged by 61-year-old Doug Wilkey in 2013. In at least four e-mails to the city since then, Wilkey complained that Guerrero's stand caused excessive trash, traffic, noise, and affected the property value of his home, which is next door to where the stand is set up. ""If this were a once a year event by a couple kids to earn a little money for a holiday or something, I would not have a problem with it,"" Wilkey wrote. ""I am very worried about the value of my home, which is why I built in a residential area, not a business area."" A community police officer has been sent out at least twice to survey the claims, and found it to be a non-issue after polling neighbors. ""We respect his right to have an opinion and took it seriously enough to do an investigation,"" said DiSpirito, who added that there has only been one person who has submitted complaints. This summer, when another complaint rolled in, DiSpirito once again inquired into the complaint. ""Same results, same investigation,"" DiSpirito said. Since Wilkey's stand against the stand gained local and national attention, the city of about 37,000 has rallied behind the budding entrepreneur, including local radio personality Mike Calta of 102.5 The Bone. On Monday, the station surprised Guerrero and sent an employee to work the lemonade stand until he got home from school. It also urged listeners to pay the boy a visit. ""This is amazing, I definitely did not know they were doing this, and I just got a call from a friend saying they were, so I just ran over here and it's amazing,"" Guerrero told CNN affiliate WFTS. The stand made an estimated $600 in two hours, according to WFTS. ""I think it's really good when young people get a chance to learn what it's like to earn some money for themselves,"" said Mayor Dave Eggers, who happens to live right around the corner from Guerrero. Neighbors like him don't want to vilify Wilkey for complaining. ""Sometimes you just have to step back and get a little perspective,"" Eggers said.","A neighbor complained that 12-year-old's lemonade stand was a nuisance .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to India travel, the state of Punjab, which borders Pakistan, doesn't make it to the top of that many itineraries. That's good news for intrepid travelers. From temples so gold they'll make your eyes water, to food you'll be longing for days after it hits your lips, Punjab is India at its colorful, lively best. 1. Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) Located in Amritsar, the holiest shrine of the Sikh religion, Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), is Punjab's top attraction. Reflections of its gold-encrusted dome shimmer in the clear water of the Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar), which greets those who enter from the north gate, the most impressive of all four entries. To take it all in, it's best to simply walk around the marble pathway surrounding the pool. Its waters are said to have healing powers. Devotional music, bathing pilgrims, golden carps and meditating devotees add to the atmosphere. Worth keeping in mind: There's a long line to visit the inner sanctum (Darbar Sahib), where the holy book of the Sikhs, ""Guru Granth Sahib,"" is kept. Visits are best scheduled for the late afternoon and early evening; every night the temple complex is illuminated. Simply stunning. You can end the day at the temple's langar (canteen). The scale of its free meal, put on daily by volunteers, is impressive, with 50,000 meals served each day, according to temple officials. The Golden Temple, Golden Temple Road, Amritsar, Punjab; +91 183 255 3957; open daily, 6 a.m.-2 a.m. 2. Punjabi eats . The city of Amritsar has a rich culinary heritage. Building a big enough appetite to give it the attention it deserves is a challenge. From melt-in-mouth chicken tikka to cream-laden, extra-large tumblers of yogurt lassi, Amritsar is an Indian food lover's dream destination. The best way to get a balanced taste is to start in Kesar Da Dhaba. Hidden in the twisting lanes of the old part of the city, it's reached only by foot, cycle rickshaw or bicycle. Founded in 1916, the restaurant is particularly popular with vegetarians. There's crispy butter-smeared tandoori bread; the house specialty, daal makhani, comes with a thick layer of ghee. At Makhan Fish and Chicken Corner, fried singhara (catfish) fillets are a must-try. They're coated in chickpea flour and caraway seeds then cooked. Perfect with cold beer. The creamiest and freshest yogurt lassi in Amritsar is at Surjan Singh Milk Bhandar; the thick drink is a mini-meal in itself. Kesar da Dhaba, Chowk Passian; +91 183 255 2103 . Makhan Fish & Chicken Corner; 21A, Majitha Road, near Maddan Hospital; +91 98 1519 3241 . Surjan Singh Milk Bhandar, Chowk Regent Cinema, GT Road . 3. Border face off . One of Punjab's most interesting rituals is the lowering of the flags ceremony, held at India's Wagah border each evening before sunset. Wagah is about 25 kilometers from the Pakistani city of Lahore. Indian guards in red and gold turbans march out to meet their Pakistani counterparts in a choreographed affair greeted with loud applause from onlookers. It's a splendid show of patriotism, pomp and panache. To secure good seats, it's best to get there by midafternoon or arrange for a VIP pass from the Border Security Force station. For security reasons, bags and backpacks aren't allowed. The border is 30 kilometers from Amritsar and takes about 45 minutes to reach by car. 4. Punjabiyat Lodge . Punjabiyat Lodge doesn't conjure quintessential images of India. Instead what you get here are feather-light beds with unobstructed views of green fields as far as the eye can see. The nature retreat in Punjab's agricultural heartland is a great place to de-stress through simple rural experiences. Visitors can lend a helping hand to farmers, cycle around the village, milk cattle or take a tractor ride. Rooms are luxurious but eco-friendly. Guests get a sense of remoteness and privacy; there are only four cottages, all set in a wheat field. Meals are a pleasure. Breakfast is served near the fields, lunch under the shade of sprawling trees and dinner on a terrace under a canopy of stars. Most meals are made with ingredients grown on the lodge's farm, says Punjabiyat manager Jagdeep Singh. Punjabiyat Lodge is in the village of Saidowal-Gunopur, about 75 kilometers from Amritsar; +91 981 870 5508 . 5. Sarai Amanat Khan . A scenic 45-minute drive from Amritsar, Sarai Amanat Khan is an old, crumbling caravanserai (roadside inn). Built by Mughals in 1640, it's a fantastic remnant of ancient architecture. It once served travelers on the Agra-to-Lahore trade route and was a prosperous pit stop back in the day. These days, the historic ruins only hint at its glorious past. Photogenic features of the complex include an arched entry, fading calligraphy, Persian tiles, eroding walls and a mosque. Amanat Khan, the inn's namesake, is believed to be the same guy who etched the calligraphy on the Taj Mahal in Agra. It's a great day trip from Amritsar. 6. Ranjit's Svaasa hotel . There are few better ways to end a wild day in Amritsar than climbing into one of the plush beds at the 200-year-old Ranjit's Svaasa hotel. Abhimanyu and his partner, Gayatri, are the gracious hosts of this charming, well-hidden retreat. The owners are seventh-generation members of the Punjabi Mehra clan, says general manager Deepak Biala. Corridors are dotted with family portraits, antique furniture and curios collected over their many travels. Secluded terraces and lounging spaces are spread throughout the property. The Rattan Chand and Dev Chand suites each come with a marble bathtub and a sitting area framed by large windows. Guest can learn to whip up a traditional Punjabi meal or hit the spa for an innovative wine-and-sugar scrub or face treatment with turmeric, sandalwood and organic rose water.

"(CNN) -- Suspended last season amid allegations that he bullied a teammate, former Miami player Richie Incognito has been reinstated by the NFL. ""He can fully participate,"" said league spokesman Greg Aiello. Incognito is a free agent and is set to meet with several NFL teams. The offensive lineman huddled with Tampa Bay on Monday. Incognito was suspended by the Dolphins in November after Jonathan Martin abruptly left the team, saying he was bullied by him. His attorney David Cornell called it ""harassment that went far beyond the traditional locker room hazing."" An NFL-commissioned report released in February found that three Dolphins starters, including Incognito, engaged in ""a pattern of harassment."" According to the report, Martin had been the victim of ""sexually explicit remarks"" and ""racial insults"" from Incognito, John Jerry and Mike Pouncey, while it was revealed that Martin contemplated suicide as a result of their actions. Incognito's lawyer challenged the report, calling it ""replete with errors."" Martin was traded to San Francisco in March.

"(CNN) -- Federal regulators have fined Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus $7,000 for an accident during a show that left nine people injured, many seriously. The so-called ""human chandelier"" stunt was performed May 4 at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island. Eight performers sustained serious injuries when the apparatus holding them failed, and they plummeted more than 15 feet. A ninth employee was hurt on the ground. An investigation by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration found the accident occurred because the carabiner -- a metal ring used as a connector -- supporting the performers was improperly loaded. OSHA cited the circus for one serious safety violation with a proposed penalty of $7,000, the maximum allowed by law, regulators said in a statement Tuesday. ""This catastrophic failure by Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus clearly demonstrates that the circus industry needs a systematic design approach for the structures used in performances -- approaches that are developed, evaluated and inspected by professional engineers,"" said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. ""While the $7,000 penalty is the maximum allowable by law, we can never put a price on the impact this event had on these workers and their families,"" he said. A spokesman for the circus said the company has not yet made a decision about whether to appeal. It has 15 days to decide. ""We do not agree with the conclusion that they drew that the way the carabiner was loaded was the sole case of the accident,"" said spokesman Steve Payne. ""But we're going to make changes out of an abundance of caution."" The hair-hanging act is no longer in the show, and the circus does not have any plans at this point to bring such a stunt back, he said. ""The safety of our performers, our crew -- as well as our audience -- is our top priority,"" said Payne. ""No one wants an accident like this to ever happen again.""","The accident happened May 4 in Providence, Rhode Island .

"(CNN) -- At least 800 people have been killed in a key Syrian city over the past 40 days, a Syrian monitoring group said Sunday. Most of those killed were ISIS militants and Syrian Kurdish fighters, battling for control of Kobani, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitoring group based in London broke down the casualty figures starting September 16, the day ISIS began its attack on the Syrian Kurdish enclave. More than half of the 815 people killed -- 481 -- were fighters with ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, the Syrian Observatory said in a statement. They were killed in ambushes and suicide car bombings as well as in attacks led by a Kurdish female commander, the group said. The group said 302 Syrian Kurdish fighters were also killed. Two civilians beheaded . Civilians accounted for 21 of the dead; two of them were beheaded, according to the statement. The real death toll could be a lot higher. The group said it believes the actual casualty figure is twice the number documented, ""because there is absolute secrecy on casualties and due to the difficulty of access to many areas and villages that have witnessed violent clashes and bombardment by the two sides."" Video from Kobani on Sunday showed a plume of smoke rising above the city, known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab. Most of the city's 200,000 people have fled across the border into neighboring Turkey.

"London (CNN) -- In the months before Vogue China launched in 2005, there were many skeptics, people who said it would fail because China's nascent luxury market was not ready for a world-class glossy magazine -- consumers there were just not sophisticated enough. At the time, the nouveaux riche were in the grip of bling fever, undiscerningly buying the most expensive goods they could afford in order to show off their success, according to a 2005 report by consultants Ernst & Young. But where some saw a problem, Angelica Cheung, Vogue China's editor-in-chief since 2005, saw an opportunity: ""We believed that China was going to experience a fast-changing period and consumers would change very quickly,"" she tells CNN. Cheung's intuition was spot on. ""By the time we launched the magazine, the readers changed again, so they embraced it immediately,"" she says. The rest is history: The first print run of 300,000 copies sold out on the first morning and was reprinted twice. In the nine years since, the newest edition of the style bible, which is produced in 19 countries, has more than doubled its circulation to 640,000 copies. Including web and tablet users, it reaches some 1.2 million people and now accounts for almost 10% of Vogue's international readership outside the United States. Cheung -- the youngest of all the Vogue editors-in-chief, including Anna Wintour and Emmanuelle Alt -- has been a driving force in the development of China's fashion industry. She has nurtured local models and designers, encouraged top talent from the fashion world to visit and advised luxury brands. Brands still don't get it . Today, most luxury retailers will tell you that their most valuable customers are from China. They are still the biggest buyers of luxury goods globally, making 29% of all purchases, according to consultants Bain & Company, despite a cooling Chinese economy and an official crackdown on corruption and extravagant gift-giving. Cheung says today's luxury market is ""very multi-layered (and) complicated,"" adding that most international brands are failing to connect with Chinese consumers. ""What (brands) don't realize is how quickly things change, from month to month, from day to day even ... one thing I keep stressing is the multi-layered reality of the market now ... you cannot have one single strategy for the country,"" she says. Luxury analyst and author of ""The Bling Dynasty: Why the Reign of Chinese Luxury Shoppers Has Only Just Begun,"" Erwan Rambourg says luxury brands have been caught out by China's luxury consumers because they are young digital natives. ""The speed (of change) comes from the fact that youth is driving sales. The Chinese luxury consumer is in their 20s, compared with the European who is in their mid-30s and in the U.S. older. ""Young people in China are all over blogs and forums, chatting all the time. Brands are finding it difficult to adapt because they are not very tech savvy,"" he says. From bling to complexity . Cheung likens the early Chinese luxury consumer as being like a starving person given food after a long time. ""People did not have anything in their house, they did not have designer handbags, they did not have outfits. So when the country opened and luxury products started to flood in ... they tried to grab anything they could and at that time people were not sophisticated, or educated enough about luxury, about fashion ... of course they went for something they could easily understand, which was symbols, what we call logos."" What's causing confusion among many international brands is how quickly many Chinese have passed through that phase -- particularly the top tier of market consumers who were at the bling vanguard a decade ago. ""(They) now start to have confidence, they have proved themselves by now ... now they actually feel that the most important is not 'how other people look at me,' it's 'how I feel.'"" This has had a dramatic impact on their buying habits and where before they might have gone for a logo handbag, they are starting to explore different brands and designers and creating personal style. Rambourg adds that five or 10 years ago, most Chinese luxury consumers only knew Gucci and Louis Vuitton handbag brands. ""Now they know 20 brands,"" he says. New concepts . Both Cheung and Rambourg agree that brands need to make their offerings in China more sophisticated. ""(It's time to) refine the concepts, refine the retail infrastructure, bigger stores, more products, edgier concepts,"" says Rambourg. He cites as an example Louis Vuitton in Hong Kong, which caters to very wealthy Chinese tourists, middle-class tourists, middle-class Hong Kong shoppers and Tai Tais -- wealthy Hong Kong women who don't work. ""Louis Vuitton is opening very big stores, which have a VIP salon to cater to someone who wants to feel special and drink champagne. Next to the salon there are the (cash registers) where you have more of a volume approach,"" he explains. Cheung says that while it was very easy to describe Chinese consumers 10 years ago, it's not so easy today: . ""There are people (who are) very sophisticated, they travel around the world, they know everything ... and people who are really new into this world of luxury."" Segmenting is something that Cheung has been doing at Vogue China for some time. ""The demographics of the consumers have become much more sophisticated and complicated,"" she says. ""What we do well ... is to structure the magazine in a way that can speak to the top tier (of) discerning consumers, but also appeal to a large, large number of readers ... new to all this and weave everything together in a seamless way."" And with a publication like Vogue China on the scene, Chinese luxury consumers are only going to get more refined. Where are the most beautiful people? Paris .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. District Court judge has overturned South Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage. The ruling, by Judge Richard M.

The judge set the order to go into effect on November 20, to give opponents time to appeal if they wish. Gergel, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of provisions of the state constitution or state laws or policy ""to the extent that they seek to prohibit the marriage of same sex couples."" If the judge's ruling stands and same-sex marriage becomes legal, South Carolina would become the 33rd state in which same-sex marriage has become legal.

"(CNN) -- ""Why not eat insects?"" asked Vincent Holt, a 19th century British author in his eccentric treatise on changing the English diet. ""Why should these creatures be called loathsome... they are in every way more fitted for human food than many of the so-called delicacies now highly prized,"" he wrote in ""Why Not Eat Insects?"" published in 1885. Grubs and bugs, believed Holt, were better than crabs and lobsters (""foul creatures"" that feed on ""putrid flesh"") and if embraced by ""the working man"" also could alleviate malnutrition and rural poverty. Despite his prediction that the day will come ""when the slug will be as popular in England as the sea-slug is in China,"" he didn't manage to convince Victorian Britons to give up their meat and veg for slimy or six-legged livestock. However, modern palates might now be ready to accept a serving of insects, as appetites grow for healthy and environmentally-sensitive foods across the globe. Insects are high in protein, vitamins and minerals like calcium, zinc and iron -- something that a few European and U.S. food start-ups have realized, with new offerings such as insect energy bars. Yet while still niche and generally seen as an exotic novelty for foodies in the west, in other parts of the world bugs don't have the same ""ewww!"" factor. Edible insects have long been a staple part of diets in many parts of Africa, South America and Asia, and Thailand is one country where bug farming has become a growing business over the last 15 years. It leads the world in insects for food production, averaging around 7,500 tons per year, according to a 2013 report by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). That's still tiny compared to the country's chicken production (around 1.6m tons per year), but insects hold a number of advantages over traditionally farmed animals. ""Mini-livestock"" could be key to combating future global food shortages, suggests the FAO, as insects are relatively easy to raise and have a minimal impact on the environment compared to conventional cattle. According to the FAO, to produce one kilo of edible crickets, only two kilograms of feed are needed, compared to five kilograms of feed for a kilo of pork and ten kilograms of feed for one kilo of beef. Across Thailand there are around 20,000 insect farming enterprises producing 200 edible insect species, the most popular type being crickets, grasshoppers, palm weevil larvae and bamboo caterpillars. The Asian financial crisis in 1997 precipitated the rise of commercial insect farming in Thailand. The return of jobless workers to the northeast of the country was a concern that Yupa Hanboonsong, co-author of the FAO report and associate professor in entomology from Khon Kaen University, decided to address head on. ""We went to rural areas to train people how to grow crickets so at least they were guaranteed food for consumption."" The long-standing tradition of eating wild crickets meant no cultural barrier to eating insects had to be overcome and a new industry could be nurtured. The main challenge was providing enough training to scale up farms and create high standards in agricultural practice. More needs to be done to create a well-managed, sustainable industry, says Hanboonsong, but ""fifteen years ago you would never have seen insects being sold in supermarkets like you do today."" International enterprises have begun to set up processing and packaging operations in Thailand for export, and last week Dutch supermarket chain Jumbo announced it will sell insect products in its stores from next year. However in Thailand, most of the demand is domestic. For Hanboonsong, the key to keeping cricket farms growing and promoting insects as food internationally is for farmers to diversify their products. Jacky Chung, director of Ento, a UK-based food start-up, agrees. ""The European mindset is generally that insects are icky,"" he says. For that reason the company is developing products like insect seasoning and ""croquettes"" for a potential commercial release next year. Currently they source their insects from an organic collective in Spain. ""Making the products like this should make it easier for Western palates to accept,"" says Chung, who adds that what you feed an insect affects how it tastes. Ento's pop-up restaurant in south London last year was an enlightening experience for Chung and his colleagues. A far cry from Holt's vaunted ""slug soup,"" the company served up a range of dishes including insect risottos and insect medallions. ""Most people are very disconnected from where their food is from, they generally don't want to see something on their plate that resembles the animal it's from."" CNN's On the Road series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile. However CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports.

"New York (CNN) -- ""Fatwa on your head?"" a new series of provocative ads on New York City buses asks. ""Is your community or family threatening you? Leaving Islam?"" The ads, sponsored by an organization called Stop the Islamization of America (SIOA), direct viewers to refugefromislam.com, a website designed ""for people who are thinking of leaving Islam or are leaving Islam and need resources"" to protect them from harm. Practicing Muslims who find the ads offensive should ""ignore it,"" SIOA leader Pamela Geller told CNN. ""It's not directed to them."" Speaking on conservative Sean Hannity's radio show recently, Geller said, ""it's time for Americans to stand up against the evil of Islamic jihadi terrorism and Islamic supremacism."" The SIOA, which is funded by its online readership, is currently lobbying to block a mosque proposed near the World Trade Center site. The Council on American-Islamic Relations in New York says the ads are nothing more than ""Islam bashing."" ""Islamophobes are notorious for their cheap tactics that seek to marginalize American Muslims and divide communities,"" CAIR Community Affairs director Faiza Ali said in a statement. ""Pamela Geller uses the same tactics as tobacco companies, hiding the cancerous nature of her agenda behind a smokescreen of feigned concern. Geller is free to say what she likes, just as concerned community members are free to critique her tactics and motives,"" Ali said. Speaking at a Tennessee ""Tea Party"" convention earlier this week, Geller called CAIR an ""unindicted co-conspirator Muslim-brotherhood front Hamas-tied"" organization. Although the same campaign caused controversy when SIOA bought ad space on public buses in Miami, New York Metropolitan Transit Authority spokesman Aaron Donovan told CNN that no one has asked the MTA to remove the ads yet. ""We have not gotten complaints on it, to be honest,"" he said. Like most ads seen on MTA subway cars and buses, the campaign will run a month. Last April, Donovan remembered, the MTA ran ads for whyislam.org -- an organization which encourages visitors to explore the Quran and seeks to ""challenge popular stereotypes and misconceptions about Islam"" -- on the subway system. All subway and bus ads seen on New York City public transportation are handled by a contractor who vets ads with MTA officials before running them, he said.","Controversial NYC ads target those leaving Islam .

"(CNN) -- The distraught caller to 911 sobs as the police dispatcher repeatedly asks him the nature of the emergency. Finally the caller realizes someone is on the other end of the phone. ""My parents got in an argument and there were shots fired,"" he cries. The man who was fatally shot was Daniel Crespo, the mayor of Bell Gardens, California, and the shooter was his wife, Levette Crespo, who shot her husband multiple times in the torso, according to police. On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department released two 911 calls from the September 30 shooting, one from the couple's son and the other from a neighbor. ""It wasn't my mom's fault. She was defending herself,"" Daniel Crespo Jr. says on the tape in the frantic aftermath of the shooting. After the Bell Gardens 911 operator confirms that the mother, 43, has shot her 45-year-old husband, Daniel Crespo Jr. says: ""He hurt me. He hurt me. He's on the floor dying, OK? He hurt me."" CNN affiliate KTLA reported -- citing investigators -- that the son, who is 19, tried to break up a fight between his parents. Levette Crespo has not been charged and a police investigation continues, KTLA reported. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Daniel Crespo moved to Bell Gardens in 1987. He worked as a probation officer, a job he held even after becoming mayor of the city of 42,000, about 10 miles southeast of Los Angeles in 2001.","On September 30, mayor of California town near Los Angeles was killed at home .

"(CNN) -- At least 11 people have died in Varna, the largest Bulgarian city on the Black Sea, as a result of massive flash flooding and mudslides, the Interior Ministry said. Some of the victims are children, the ministry said. Dozens were still missing, and tens of thousands were without electricity, the ministry said. The floods swept through parts of the port city Thursday and the rains continued Friday. City boulevards and streets have turned into rivers and many of the pedestrian underpasses are completely flooded. The heaviest hit district is Asparuhovo, where most of the streets are impassable, filled with smashed and overturned vehicles and uprooted trees. Some 4.3 inches of rain, more than double the monthly average, fell in Varna in a 48-hour period. The weather system responsible for this flooding has been progressing very slowly across southern Europe this week, and has spawned tornadoes in Italy, Greece, and Turkey, including near Istanbul. The storm system was beginning to move off to the northeast, but some more light rainfall was expected for eastern Bulgaria for the next 24 hours or so. Bulgarian authorities have declared an emergency in the region. Friday was declared a day of mourning for the victims. CNN's Brandon Miller contributed to this report.","Floods swept through parts of the city; rain continues .

"(CNN) -- Recent developments off the coast of Sweden raise many questions, and we do not as yet have answers. Last week, Swedish media reported that the country's military was searching for an underwater vessel, possibly a Russian submarine, after an emergency radio transmission allegedly made in Russian (although Russia has denied it has any vessels in Swedish waters). Now, as the Swedish Navy continues to search for the unidentified undersea vessel that may have penetrated the country's territorial waters, it's worth keeping in mind some key facts to help place the issue in perspective. For a start, anti-submarine warfare is complex and very difficult to execute properly. Especially in the close confines of territorial waters, the advantages tend to accrue to the submarine. The rocky floor of an inland sea like the Baltic can mask acoustic signatures that give watching ships, helicopters and maritime patrol aircraft the ability to track and identify a subsurface contact. Second, this is happening against the backdrop of the Swedish Navy and Air Force having suffered significant budget cuts over the past decades. As a general proposition, the Swedes have a capable and professional force. But since the end of the Cold War, they have not invested heavily in anti-submarine warfare capability. They are not alone in this regard -- many of the other European nations have likewise cut back in this area given a sense that anti-submarine warfare was something they would have needed against the USSR during the Cold War but less so during pre-Ukrainian crisis days with Russia. And although Sweden is not a NATO member, meaning this operation is a national effort, it is a very strong partner to NATO and has been involved deeply in positive ways in Afghanistan, the Balkans, Libya and other operations. Yet the fact remains that there is no treaty obligation on the part of NATO to be involved. If the Swedes ask for help, it is likely that NATO would respond, but to date they have not done so. Ultimately, though, we may never know exactly what has happened. It is entirely possible that a Russian submarine was performing an intelligence-gathering operation, and that it had a period of distress that alerted Swedish authorities to its presence. It may have sorted out its challenges and slipped away. Or it may be still operating in close while Russia sorts out a plan of action. The most recent volley from Russia, that it might be a Dutch submarine, seems highly unlikely. If it was any other nation's boat, they would have likely worked with the Swedes immediately if their vessel was in distress. The Swedes, who are capable and professional, seem insistent on their concern about an unknown undersea vessel. And the reality is that they have no reason to make any of this up, instead forthrightly reporting what they are seeing. With this in mind, NATO should offer to assist with other assets and help sort out the situation, especially if there is any possibility of a vessel in distress -- no matter what the circumstances of its presence in the Baltic.","James Stavridis: Swedish media reported undersea vessel, possibly Russian, off coast .

"(CNN) -- The ugly subject of sledging in cricket raised its head again on Thursday as Australia remained on course for a 4-0 series whitewash against the touring India side. Virat Kohli scored his maiden Test century, but the young India batsman complained bitterly about the comments he received after almost running himself out on 99. The 23-year-old blamed Ben Hilfenhaus after his ordeal at the end of the 90th over, bowled by five-wicket hero Peter Siddle, which came on Australia's national holiday. Australia captain Clarke joins illustrious club . ""Hilfenhaus said something to me which was totally unnecessary ... out of the blue,"" Kohli told reporters. ""He wasn't even bowling or doing anything. I survived that run out and he just said something which I can't obviously say in a press conference. I gave it back to him, saying, 'You didn't even have anything to do with it, why would you do that?'"" At the time Kohli, playing in his eighth Test match, was making a defiant stand of 33 runs for the ninth wicket with tailender Ishant Sharma in hot conditions in Adelaide. ""They sledge when they get frustrated. Obviously it was hot out there,"" he said. ""Constantly they were sledging the players so they could spoil our concentration. During that partnership they were really, really loud."" Kohli also complained about abuse from the crowd -- a single-day record 35,081 for Australia-India matches at the venue -- when he was fielding later. Australia reached stumps on 50-3 in their second innings, an overall lead of 382 runs after India's first-innings 272. ""It is really, really frustrating at times because they say stuff which shouldn't be said on a cricket field,"" Kohli said. ""We go out there to play, not to get abused like that. If they've come here to enjoy the game of cricket they should do that, not get drunk and abuse players. ""If the players say anything they're fined and banned, but the crowd can just say anything and go home."" Tensions between the side were stoked before the match started when India batsman Gautam Gambhir criticised Siddle, saying the bowler could only perform his own wickets. However, his words came back to haunt him as Siddle dismissed the opener for 34 with a rising delivery as he claimed figures of 5-49 and a total of 22 wickets so far in the series. ""Gambhir thought I had the luck of the green wickets but I guess there wasn't much bounce in this wicket today and it seemed to get him out, so it was a nice little reward for a wicket that is hard to bowl on,"" Siddle said. He also claimed the scalp of cricket's highest run scorer Sachin Tendulkar, who fell for 25 as his bid to become the first player to score 100 international centuries continues. Hilfenhaus contributed 3-62, while Kohli top-scored with 116 as he added 114 for the sixth wicket with Wriddhiman Saha, who made 34 standing in for suspended captain and wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Spinner Ravichandran Ashwin then took two wickets and veteran fast bowler Zaheer Khan another as the Australian top order collapsed. Captain Michael Clarke and his predecessor Ricky Ponting, who both made double centuries in Australia's first innings of 604-7 declared, were unbeaten on nine and one respectively at the end of the third day. Meanwhile, Pakistan took four late wickets to restrict England's hopes of a big first-innings lead in the second Test in Abu Dhabi on Thursday. Top-ranked England, having dismissed the ""home"" side for 257, ended the second day on 207-5 as off-spinner Saeed Ajmal continued his fine form. Ajmal, who took 7-55 as Pakistan won the first test in Dubai by 10 wickets, dismissed opener Alastair Cook (94), Kevin Pietersen (14) and Eoin Morgan (three) in the last 30 minutes. Abdur Rehman started the collapse when he bowled Jonathan Trott for 74, ending a stand of 139 with Cook. Pakistan had resumed on 256-7, but seamer Stuart Broad dismissed captain Misbah-ul-Haq (84) to finish with four wickets, and James Anderson took two in four balls in the next over. The three-match series is being played in the United Arab Emirates as Pakistan cannot host internationals due to past security problems.","India batsman Virat Kohli accuses Australia's Ben Hilfenhaus of unnecessary sledging .

"(CNN) -- It's hard to top the tricky, first-ever landing on a comet, broadcast live on the Internet. That's what space lovers and other curious types got on Wednesday, when the European Space Agency's probe Philae touched down on Comet 67P. It was high drama that continued into the afternoon as questions arose about whether the probe, in fact, stuck the landing despite the fact that harpoons designed to anchor it failed to fire. Then the probe's batteries appeared to conk out. Many in the United States bemoaned the fact that it was a European agency, not an American one, that led the mission (although NASA was part of a consortium of partners for the mission). Actually, NASA has done something very similar. The space agency made an impromptu landing on an asteroid called Eros on February 12, 2001. The agency's Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous-Shoemaker (NEAR-Shoemaker), the first mission to orbit an asteroid, wasn't designed to land, but when the mission ended, NASA decided to give it a try. It worked. The probe continued to send back data for several days and made its last call back to Earth on Feb. 28, 2001. There are dozens of other exciting unmanned missions underway -- and several really cool ones that have wrapped up. Take a look at the gallery above, which highlights 11 fascinating space missions.","Space probe Philae touched down on a comet on Wednesday .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Verizon Wireless is rebooting its application store for smartphones after a lackluster first attempt. The new storefront, called Verizon Apps, will be presented for free to Verizon customers with Droid phones. It will coexist with Google's Android Market, which comes preloaded on all of its phones. Verizon already offers apps that are exclusively available to its subscribers, such as one with live video of National Football League games. The U.S. cellular giant is set to introduce the new mobile software marketplace at its Las Vegas conference for developers on Tuesday. Verizon and Chomp, which provides the search engine for the service, have been briefing reporters on the news. The two companies partnered in May on a feature that allows people to search Verizon's current store, called V Cast Apps, along with Google's Market. The separate V Cast store, like many others for Android, never gained significant traction. (Verizon began offering the iPhone in February, but Apple does not allow third-party companies to operate competing app stores.) Verizon opened an office here last month where software developers are welcome to come code mobile apps and test them on the carrier's hardware. In an interview during the opening, Kyle Malady, a Verizon technology executive, acknowledged shortcomings with its V Cast market but said there is still room for alternative storefronts. Verizon will attract software partners by guaranteeing promotion for their products, he said. Even the big mobile app developers, including Electronic Arts, complain that some of their apps fail to get adequate exposure on other digital stores, Malady said. ""Their apps get lost,"" he said.","Verizon is set to announce a new Android app store .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the rappellers on the Washington Monument check for cracks in the structure's exterior, they won't be able to see themselves in another Washington landmark: the Reflecting Pool below. It's currently a giant mud pit. The pool where tourists have been able to see majestic reflections of both the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial has been under construction since last November to address problems with leaking and to make the water cleaner with a new circulation system. Although it currently looks like a mess, Steve Lorenzetti with the National Park Service sees it differently. ""I describe it as almost done with the infrastructure necessary for us to finish this project,"" he said. The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool project is expected to be complete in the spring of 2012. When finished, the pool will actually have about a third less water than previously and will be shallower. According to Lorenzetti, the general public won't be able to tell. ""The reflective quality of this pool is of paramount importance to us,"" he said. ""So what you will see if there is no wind is a flat, glassy surface."" The Reflecting Pool is just one part of the aging National Mall that has problems, according to Caroline Cunningham, president of the Trust for the National Mall. She pointed out to reporters Tuesday other mall sites that have been neglected in recent years, including the area called Union Square up near the Capitol. ""Right now, there's this beautiful reflecting pool. But, can we make it a place where people can come cool off in the summertime?"" she said, referring to another, smaller reflecting pool near the Capitol. She describes the National Mall as needing help, saying it needs to be more amenable for visitors. The Trust for the National Mall is currently running a design contest to come up with a sustainable, creative solution to problems at Union Square. ""It should be one of the most beautiful spaces on the National Mall and it has not really been touched since the 1970s when it was built,"" she said.","Reflecting Pool has been under construction since last November .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- There are few cars in the world where the difference between driving them and watching them being driven is greater than with the Trabant. It's a cute little car. Its two big, round headlights look almost like innocent eyes staring back at the beholder. And its tiny frame seems so fragile that all other drivers give you the right of way when you're taking a spin around town. But driving a Trabant is an adventure, to say the least. As pedestrians smile and take selfies in front of the car, you will be locked in a constant battle just to keep the vehicle on the road. Slipping behind the wheel of a Trabant is sort of like squeezing into a sleeping bag -- especially when you're 6 feet 5 inches tall, like me. Getting the engine started is half the battle -- the car immediately stalls if you take your foot off the gas -- and the brakes pretty much don't work at all. Take all these factors together and a trip in stop-and-go traffic quickly becomes nerve-wracking torture. You're thrilled when you've finally reached your destination, and the car can once again become the eye-catching backdrop of a myriad of photos snapped by gawking tourists. Nevertheless, the Trabant has been an icon to Germans ever since the tiny Communist-built cars started rolling across the border between what was then East and West Germany in 1989. There have been movies about the car, where it is depicted as an underdog in races -- almost like the American films about ""Herbie"" the Volkswagen Beetle. The Trabant is so significant that CNN Berlin just had to get one for our coverage of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it quickly became one of the centerpieces of our coverage. We looked on the internet and found that there are few ""Trabis"" left. The ones for sale were being offered up not for driving, but for spare parts. When we finally found one that had somehow managed to pass its latest driving inspection, we snapped it up immediately. The Trabant, produced in Communist East Germany by the government-run conglomerate VEB Sachsenring from 1957 till 1990, was flawed from inception. A few tweaks were made to the design in 1962, but fundamentally the car never really changed. The Trabi's frame is made of cheap PVC plastic -- a material the Germans nicknamed ""racing cardboard"" -- and its tiny frame houses a 26 horsepower, two-stroke engine that runs on a mixture of oil and gasoline. We needed a good concept to make our Trabi -- a 601 S station wagon -- the corner stone of our ""Fall of the Wall"" coverage, so we hired the artist Martin Raumberger to give the car a makeover. He focused on three themes: Berlin, CNN, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Martin did an amazing job. He sketched several of Berlin's most famous symbols on our Trabi, including the broadcast tower and the Brandenburg Gate. He also drew a tree of people breaching the Berlin Wall, a symbol of human life penetrating and destroying the anti-human barrier that separated East and West Germany. The longest part of the Wall still standing today (the East Side Gallery, for instance) is an open air museum, a living piece of art covered in graffiti. Thousands of people have scrawled their names on the Wall with permanent marker. We decided our Trabi should be no different. We asked people from all over the world to sign the car with their names and hometown, and the reaction we got was amazing. On November 9 thousands of people crowded around our car to sign it, draw on it, and take their picture with it. At some point the authorities asked us to stop because the crowd grew so large that it was blocking the bike path and the street at the East Side Gallery. Now that the celebrations are over it is time to decide what to do with the CNN Trabant next. It has turned into a real work of art by Martin Raumberger and all those who signed their names on it. I certainly will miss our little Trabant, but I will not miss driving it!","CNN's Frederik Pleitgen takes the iconic German Trabant car for a spin .

"Novato, California (CNN) -- When health care reform passed Congress more than two years ago, Julie Walters yelled for her husband to come into the living room where she was watching the vote live on television. ""I was so happy,"" Walters remembers. ""I yelled for Matt. I said, 'Do you know what this means? Do you know what this means?'"" The historic vote meant their 18-month-old daughter, Violet McManus, would be able to keep her health insurance. Without health care reform, she would have gotten kicked off her parents' insurance, perhaps as early as her 5th birthday, because her care is so expensive. ""I was like, Violet's covered now!"" Walters remembers. ""We're okay. We can breathe."" But now Violet's parents are worried they won't be able to breathe easily again. This week, the Supreme Court is hearing a debate on health care reform. The court could keep the reform intact, repeal parts of it, or get rid of the law altogether. ""I'm really scared,"" Walters says. ""Like, I-can't-sleep scared."" 'Completely blue in her crib' Violet McManus was born healthy, but when she was 11 months old her parents woke up in the middle of the night in their Novato, California, home to find her having a seizure. ""She was completely blue in her crib and shaking,"" Walters remembers. It was to be the first of hundreds of seizures -- sometimes thirty in one day. Violet has been hospitalized about six times and each hospitalization cost more than $50,000. She's now on two drugs to control the seizures and carries oxygen with her wherever she goes because she stops breathing when she has her seizures. She needs speech therapy and frequent doctor's visits. See more about Violet and her family . Matt McManus, Violet's father, gets health insurance through his work as a video game designer. Before health care reform, there was a $5 million lifetime limit on Violet's insurance policy. Violet is now 3 and her parents calculate she could hit that cap by her 5th birthday, and almost certainly by her 10th. See a quick breakdown of key health care reform issues . Health care reform made lifetime limits illegal -- which is why Violet's family breathed easier when it passed -- but now her parents are worried the Supreme Court could restore the limits and Violet would lose her insurance. Walters has been so passionate about health care reform she contacted the office of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-California) and MomsRising.org to advocate for the law. If Violet does lose her current insurance, her parents know there's no way another insurance company will want to insure her because her care is so expensive. ""They'd be crazy to want to insure her,"" Walters says. ""I mean, I wouldn't want to insure her if I was an insurance company."" Watching the Supreme Court case closely . Several provisions of health care reform have already gone into effect, so millions of other people, like Violet McManus, stand to lose a lot if all or part of it is reversed. For example, 2.5 million young Americans get to stay on their parents' insurance until their 26th birthday because of health care reform, according to the Obama administration. Seniors and people with disabilities have saved $3.2 billion on prescription drugs because of health care reform and insurance companies and 45 million women have received free mammograms and pap smears because of health care reform. There are ripple effects, too. After health care reform passed, Walters and McManus felt more secure about Violet's future and decided to have another child. Violet's little brother, Rory, was born two weeks ago. iReport: Should health insurance be mandatory? Violet's parents know not everyone shares their enthusiasm about health care reform. Some people even traveled to Washington to protest in front of the Supreme Court this week. In particular, they object to the ""individual mandate,"" which requires nearly all Americans to purchase insurance or pay a fine. The protesters object to being forced to pay for something they don't want, but Walters and McManus see it differently. At any point in time they say someone could find themselves in a difficult situation like they're in now and would want a system that insures you no matter how sick you are. As McManus puts it, ""I think people just sort of need to change their mindset about health care.""

"(Health.com) -- Doctors and health officials have relied for decades on body mass index (BMI), a ratio of height to weight, to categorize people as overweight and obese. A new study, however, suggests the use of BMI may be leading us to underestimate the already sky-high obesity rate. BMI, the researchers say, is an overly simplistic measure that often misrepresents physical fitness and overall health, especially among older women. Nearly 4 in 10 adults whose BMI places them in the overweight category would be considered obese if their body fat percentage were taken into account, according to the study. ""Some people call it the 'baloney mass index,'"" says lead author Eric Braverman, M.D., president of the Path Foundation, a nonprofit organization in New York City dedicated to brain research. Bodybuilders can be classified as obese based on their BMI, he says, while ""a 55-year-old woman who looks great in a dress could have very little muscle and mostly body fat, and a whole lot of health risks because of that -- but still have a normal BMI."" Health.com: Surprising celebrity BMIs . Based on their findings, Braverman and his coauthor, New York State Commissioner of Health Nirav Shah, M.D., say the BMI threshold for obesity, which now stands at 30, should be lowered to 24 for women and 28 for men. By that standard, a 5-foot 6-inch woman and a 5-foot 11-inch man would be considered obese at about 150 and 200 pounds, respectively. The study participants -- patients at a specialized private health clinic in Manhattan -- aren't typical of the population as a whole, Braverman notes. Still, he says, the large discrepancy between BMI and body fat measures seen in the study suggest that BMI guidelines should be revisited. ""People aren't being diagnosed [as obese], so they're not being told about their risk of disease or being given instruction on how to improve their health,"" says Braverman, who is also a clinical assistant professor of neurosurgery at Weill Cornell Medical College, in New York City. Health.com: Best superfoods for weight loss . James Hospedales, M.D., chief of noncommunicable diseases at the Pan American Health Organization, a division of the World Health Organization based in Washington, D.C., says that while one study is not enough to justify changing national standards, the findings do call for a discussion. ""We've known for a long time that BMI is not a perfect measurement, and that it's important to look at the overall picture,"" Hospedales says. ""In this study, it turns out that a lot of people who are classified as just overweight in fact have a bit more to worry about, and those are indeed valuable findings."" But lowering the cutoff for obesity could create its own problems, Hospedales adds. ""We'd also be calling an increasing number of people obese who aren't, which could lead to issues with stigma, insurance policies, and other problems,"" he says. ""We have to think quite carefully about the pros and cons."" Health.com: Can you be fit and fat? In the study, published today in the journal PLoS One, Braverman and Shah compared the BMI of roughly 1,400 men and women with their body fat percentage, which was measured using a type of scan, known as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), that provides a detailed breakdown of fat, muscle, and bone mass. (DXA scans are also used to measure bone density.) Overall, 39% of patients who were merely overweight by BMI standards fell into the obese category for body fat percentage, which the American Society of Bariatric Physicians defines as 25% or more for men and 30% or more for women. BMI appeared to provide a far less accurate picture among women, possibly because women lose muscle mass faster than men as they age, the study notes. Nearly half of the women were considered obese according to body fat percentage but not BMI, compared to just one-quarter of the men. Health.com: Mistakes women make in middle age . Testing for blood levels of the hormone leptin could boost the usefulness of BMI, the study suggests. Leptin, which helps regulate energy and appetite, was strongly associated with body fat percentage in the study, and it has previously been linked to obesity-related health complications. Adjusting BMI to account for leptin levels would provide patients with a more accurate measure of their disease risk, Braverman says. Lowering BMI obesity cutoffs, using DXA scans when possible, and incorporating leptin tests represents a ""three-pronged approach,"" Braverman says. ""Making these changes now can save the U.S. a fortune down the road, if it allows us to alert more people to their risks and prevent them from getting worse.""

"Istanbul (CNN) -- In what appears to be a broader government purge of Turkey's police force, 350 police officers were removed from their positions in the capital of Ankara on Tuesday. Police commanders were also removed from their posts in at least nine other cities around the country, the semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. According to Turkish state media reports, most of the police officers affected were working in departments that battle terrorism, smuggling and organized crime. ""The majority of the chiefs and police in question were appointed to the traffic unit,"" state broadcaster TRT reported on its website. The mass reassignment of police officers came amid reports of a fresh wave of police raids targeting suspects in a corruption case in the port city of Izmir. The Turkish government first began firing and reassigning scores of police officers last month, after police detained dozens of suspects closely linked to the government in an anti-corruption investigation. Amid corruption inquiry, Turkish prosecutor slams police . Police reportedly found large amounts of cash and a money counting machine in the home of the son of the interior minister, as well as shoe boxes full of cash in the residence of the director of the state-owned HalkBank. On December 25, at least four Cabinet ministers implicated in the corruption scandal were forced to resign as part of a larger Cabinet reshuffle. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced the investigation. He has repeatedly said it is part of an ""international conspiracy"" aimed at toppling his government. Erdogan also criticized police who carried out the raids, accusing them of operating outside the chain of command. The government removed several prosecutors overseeing the investigation and briefly banned journalists from entering police stations. In a highly unusual news conference last month, one of those prosecutors accused the government of obstructing the investigation and allowing suspects to flee and tamper with evidence. Turkish police fire plastic bullets as anti-government protests rage . Other observers are sounding the alarm about the independence of the judiciary in Turkey, which is both a member of the NATO military alliance and a nation that's negotiating to join the European Union. ""The future of law enforcement, the separation of powers, the constitution is in danger,"" said Suat Kiniklioglu, a former member of parliament from Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party. Kiniklioglu said the purge of the police force was part of the broader power struggle under way in Turkey between Erdogan and one of his former allies, a Turkish Muslim cleric who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania. ""The government is trying to remove police officers it thinks are close to the Fethullah Gulen group from positions where they could launch investigations into other corruption cases,"" Kiniklioglu told CNN. Gulen is the spiritual leader of an international empire of universities, businesses and media organizations. Until recently, he and his movement provided influential support to Erdogan during the prime minister's decade in power. Throughout this political alliance, some supporters of the reclusive cleric are believed to have assumed key positions in the Turkish police and judiciary. Last month's arrests turned simmering tensions between Erdogan and Gulen into an open verbal war between the two most charismatic leaders of moderate political Islam in Turkey. Erdogan and his deputies have openly denounced what they call a parallel state operating within the Turkish government bureaucracy. Gulen has responded in a fiery video sermon announcing, ""Those who don't see the thief but go after those trying to catch the thief, who don't see the murder but try to defame others by accusing innocent people, then may God bring fire to their houses, ruin their homes, break their unity."" The scandal has rattled Turkish markets. This week, the Turkish lira plunged to a record low against the dollar.","NEW: News agency says officers removed in Ankara and at least nine other Turkish cities .

"(CNN) -- CNN created the Global Wage Calculator with data supplied by the International Labor Organization, which takes on the gargantuan task of compiling the average wage of the world, as well as individual countries. The ILO collects this data by sending out annual questionnaires to countries' national statistical authorities and also trying to collect it directly from national statistical authorities' publicly available information. They can't cover the entire world -- some countries don't supply or have the information -- but this interactive uses data which counts for 93% of the globe's employees. However, there are some important caveats. The total employed population is broken into two groups. Employees who earn a wage, and the self-employed who earn what the ILO calls ""employment-related income."" The ILO does not include the latter because what is earned as a ""wage"" and what is earned as ""profit"" and reinvested in the company is hard to untangle and could therefore confuse the concepts. The share of employees in total employment varies across the world. In most developed economies, employees represent about 85% of total employment. However, in developing countries this is much less. In Africa, for example, employees are on average about 30% of total employment. This means the average wage as calculated by the ILO will not always capture what an average family lives on, particularly as self-employed workers in developing countries can earn much less than wage earners. China is also a special case. There is information on public wages and private wages, but nothing which combines the two. Because the percentage split is unclear, the ILO keeps the data points separate. The concept of an ""average wage"" is also imperfect because inequality has increased across the globe, and the percentage of low paid workers has increased in a substantial number of countries. However, global distribution figures still show how the majority of people in the world are still earning far less than the wealthy minority. The data also comes from different years, as some countries don't send their data to the ILO as regularly as others. However, with wages stagnant in recent years, at least in developed economies, the differences are likely to be small. You can see what year your data comes from in the blurb comparing your wage to the average in your country. In order to be able to compare wages globally, they are converted into what's called a ""purchasing power parity"" U.S. dollar. This uses a 2012 World Bank conversion rate to weight wages relative to the buying power of $1 inside the U.S. However, the comparison is not perfect because the definition of wages can vary from one country to the next. The $PPP figure reveals the buying power of what you earn, inside your country, relative to the spending power of someone in the U.S. The G20 data is presented as an indicator of global wages. Argentina and the EU are excluded because comparable data is not available. The representative jobs CNN chose were in the main guided by data the ILO had in hand, for reasons of consistency. The wages used by CNN can be found on the ILO website here, as can the years it is available. The U.S. chief executive and British Queen data comes from public records and were selected to represent those on relatively higher incomes. The Queen's income is what she receives to carry out her public duties. She also has private income.

"(CNN) -- In the narrow winding lanes of Old Delhi, the knotted masses of electrical wiring hanging across the streets are sometimes so thickly entwined they blot out the sun. In the streets of Bangkok, electricity wires loop and run in chaotic bundles from concrete power poles. In the slums of Mumbai to the townships of South Africa, electricity infrastructure is a triumph of make and mend. For power utilities in emerging markets, collecting the bills from this tangled skein of wiring is a nightmare and slow payment - even outright energy theft - remains a powerful disincentive for new investment in the sector. Smart solutions . One company, however, says smart meters may hold the answers to the power problems of the world's emerging markets. While smart meters have been in use in the United States and Europe for more than a decade, in markets such as Africa they are set to encourage much-needed investment in the sector. The devices not only record electricity consumption but relay information back to the utility for monitoring and billing purposes. Critically, they also require pre-payment which means that utilities that produce the power can be sure they will be paid for it. Alain Bollack, director at the Global Power & Utilities Centre of Ernst and Young, said the company worked with the city of Tshwane outside Johannesburg in South Africa to install pre-paid smart meters to solve endemic problems of late payment, long-term debtors and electricity theft. ""The city had two major problems,"" Bollack told CNN. ""The first was they couldn't collect the cash from customers -- either businesses or individuals. They had 800,000 customers that were an average 500 days in arrears. ""The second was that a lot of clients were stealing electricity and that's very common in emerging markets."" Chaotic infrastructure . He said the chaotic nature of the electricity infrastructure in places like Africa or India means that stealing energy is easy. ""Often it's as easy as hooking onto a line, bypassing the meter and getting free energy. The first major problem of energy in emerging markets is getting access to it i the first place, the second problem is that when there is access it gets stolen."" He said cities such as Mumbai had worked hard over the past 10 years to reduce the opportunity for consumers to steal electricity. ""Over ten years ago, some 65% of the energy produced in Mumbai was not paid for,"" Bollack said. Smart meters, he said, require customers to pay before they consume and also relay information back to the utilities if the meters are tampered with in any way. Legislation is key . So far, some 3000 smart meters have been rolled out in Tshwane, particularly among high consumers of energy. At the core of the solution, however, is legislation and Bollack said that the city government passed laws to enforce the new rule. ""That might not be very pleasant for many consumers but, at the end of the day, if you provide a service, it's quite normal to pay for it,"" Bollack said. ""If you have asked nicely for many many years and people still won't pay, then you have a right to enforce that by law."" He said the value proposition extended to consumers in that they also gained a better picture through smart metering of what and how they consumed electricity. Ultimately, however, energy theft is not a sustainable business model, leading to under-investment, more costly production and higher prices. Bollack said that Tshwane's foray into smart meters was now being viewed with interest from countries throughout the region including Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and parts of Nigeria. ""They are looking at it as a possible way of resolving the financing problem of energy infrastructure in Africa,"" Bollack said. ""If you are lucky if you've got investors from China or the US or Europe, who are happy to put billions on the table but don't have any guarantee of return on investment."" Holy grail . He said that smart meters in Africa are fast becoming the holy grail for energy sector investors and ultimately could accelerate investment that would provide power for millions more people in the region. While critics might argue that consumers have gone from free, albeit stolen electricity, to electricity they now can't afford, Bollack said smart meters, for the first time, could reverse the vicious circle created by energy theft. ""The business case for the city of Tshwane is interesting,"" he said. ""Energy is one of the city's main sources of revenue and what they are saying is that smart meters are not being introduced to balance the books, but to collect the cash to reinvest it into the community. ""Even though there's a lag between when you collect the cash and reinvest, what you ultimately create is a virtuous circle."" Read this: Is this the end of the 9-5 working day?

"(CNN) -- He's known as the ""bull dog"" in South Africa's legal circles, and just days in to Gerrie Nel's merciless cross-examination of Oscar Pistorius, it's easy to see why. The veteran state prosecutor's relentless grilling of Pistorius -- on trial for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year -- has riveted people around the world to their TV sets, and has sparked a debate about whether Nel's no-holds-barred tactics have crossed the line. Nel had to wait weeks to take on Pistorius, but has wasted no time since he got the chance late on Tuesday. At various times Nel has called the 27-year-old a liar, implied that Pistorius was pretending to be too emotional to testify, reduced him to tears, and laughed at him for failing to recall the answer to one of Nel's questions as the prosecutor ruthlessly tore into various aspects of his testimony. On Wednesday Nel took the defense by surprise when he played a video, taken just months before Steenkamp's death, of Pistorius shooting a watermelon at a firing range with friends and describing the impact as a ""zombie-stopper."" ""You know that the same happened to Reeva's head? It exploded,"" Nel told Pistorius, before showing the court -- and the multitudes around the world watching on live TV -- a grisly photograph of Steenkamp's wounded head, her hair soaked in blood and tissue from the impact of the bullet that tore through her skull. ""Have a look there,"" Nel barked, to gasps from the courtroom. ""I know you don't want to because you don't want to take responsibility, but it's time that you look at it."" Pistorius, sobbing heavily, said, ""I've taken responsibility but I will not look at a picture where I'm tormented by what I saw and felt that night. As I picked Reeva up my fingers touched her head -- I remember, I don't have to look at a picture, I was there."" Pistorius' family sat appalled at the front of the courtroom. The sprinter's attorney, Barry Roux, called Nel's tactics an ""ambush"" and objected. And the court adjourned for a recess, leaving a hysterical Pistorius to weep in the dock and shocked journalists and legal observers to debate what they'd just seen. ""It's not unusual for an accused to be shown pictures of the deceased. Although not always in this dramatic manner,"" tweeted Barry Bateman, an Eyewitness News reporter in the courtroom. Other reporters said that June Steenkamp, Reeva's mother, had been warned about the photo and understood why the prosecution believed it needed to be shown. Did Nel overstep the bounds of decency in his interrogation of Pistorius? CNN legal expert Kelly Phelps says that while Nel's strategy -- to unnerve the accused and destabilize his version of events -- was valid, showing the world a bloody photo of Steenkamp was ""unnecessary and gratuitous."" ""Nel has a responsibility to protect the dignity of the deceased and the victim's family,"" Phelps said. ""He could have showed Pistorius that photo without having to broadcast it for the whole world to see."" While Phelps said most people she spoke to shared that view, others said that Nel's ultimate responsibility to the victim and the family is to achieve justice. If that's how the prosecutor thinks he'll get a conviction, then he's right to pursue any avenues to get there, the thinking goes. Nel has infuriated quite a few opposing lawyers over the course of his career, Phelps says, but he has long had a reputation for being incorruptible and impossible to intimidate. When he went after South African police commissioner Jackie Selebi in a corruption case in 2008, he was arrested in front of his family. He spent a few days in jail before being released -- and ultimately put Selebi behind bars. In his spare time, he's active in South Africa's amateur wrestling federation as a coach and official. Nel may be known for being a courtroom bull dog, but is his bark worse than his bite? Despite his long assault on Pistorius' testimony, the fact remains that the state has very little evidence to disprove the track star's version of events that night. ""I think he knows that the state's case is mostly circumstantial, and it was always going to rely heavily on cross-examining Pistorius,"" Phelps said. ""And while Nel's been successful in getting his narrative on the record, he hasn't yet been able to get Pistorius to support that narrative."" In other countries, Nel's almost theatrical approach might be able to sway some members of a jury, but South Africa doesn't have jury trials -- and Judge Thokozile Masipa has already reprimanded Nel several times when he stepped over the line in her view. Ultimately Phelps says she doesn't expect the judge's decision to be affected by the prosecutor's flair for the dramatic. ""She's experienced enough to know the various tactics employed by the lawyers on each side,"" Phelps says. ""She will have sat before them in court on many occasions, and she's well positioned to cut through the white noise."" ""Still, it's never wise to get a judge's back up.""

"(CNN) -- A 21-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia was sentenced Wednesday to 30 years in prison for plotting to bomb a 2010 Christmas-tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. Mohamed Osman Mohamud was convicted after a two-week trial last year on one count of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, namely explosives. Mohamud was a 19-year-old Oregon State University student when he was arrested on November 26, 2010, and accused of trying to blow up what he believed to be an explosives-laden van parked near a holiday event in Pioneer Courthouse Square, authorities said. The bomb was actually a fake planted by federal agents involved in the extensive undercover operation. Mohamud described the device as ""beautiful,"" according to his arrest affidavit. Born in Mogadishu in 1991, Mohamud moved to the United States and became a naturalized U.S. citizen, settling in the northwestern Oregon city of Corvallis. Years before he enrolled at Oregon State University, he'd started thinking of taking part in a violent jihad, according to the U.S. Justice Department. In February 2009, he began exchanging the first of about 150 emails with Samir Khan, a now-deceased al Qaeda member who published two online publications tied to the terrorist group, Jihad Recollections and Inspire. According to the Justice Department, Mohamud wrote several articles under assumed names for the former publication. The Oregon resident began communicating electronically in August 2009 with another accused terrorist, Amro Al-Ali, who is now being held in his native Saudi Arabia on terrorist charges, federal authorities said. The two discussed Mohamud's possible travel first to Yemen and then to Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province for terrorist training. ""Yes that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do,"" Mohamud wrote back in December 2009, the affidavit stated. That trip never happened, despite Mohamud's efforts to contact intermediaries to facilitate it. But he was reached in summer 2010 by a man who, unbeknownst to him, was an undercover FBI employee. The FBI investigation moved to another level, including several discussions and trips involving Mohamud and undercover agents. On November 4, 2010, on the way back from a trial run to a remote location to detonate a bomb, he was asked what he hoped would happen to those attending the Portland holiday ceremony, a family event that includes people of all ages. ""I want whoever is attending that event to leave ... either dead or injured,"" Mohamud said, the affidavit states. Having canvassed to the area to find a spot to inflict the most casualties, Mohamud got what he believed to be a live bomb from the undercover agents. But the device was inert, and after his second attempt to detonate it, Mohamud was arrested. Opinion: Lone wolves are biggest terror threat .

"(CNN) -- To many who watched his long, rambling video statement, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau appeared strangely distracted, unfocused, perhaps under the influence of drugs while boasting of abducting nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls. But there is calculation in such cruelty, and method where some see madness. The kidnapping serves Shekau on many levels, and observers of Boko Haram say he should not be underestimated. Shekau's on-camera performances are the opposite of the composed appearances of late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the terror group's current chief, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Jacob Zenn, an expert on Boko Haram with the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based research and analysis firm, says Shekau has even acknowledged the intellectual chaos of his presentations. But they impress his followers. Shekau speaks classical Arabic and Hausa, the language of northern Nigerian Muslims, and had a religious education. As deputy to former Boko Haram leader Mohamed Yusuf, who was killed in 2009, Shekau delivered sermons littered with references to Islamic scholars. He also expressed admiration for al Qaeda as a jihadist movement, although Boko Haram is not an affiliate of the group. Shekau's rejection of the Christian calendar and of allegiance to the Nigerian flag resonates in a region where resentment of a corrupt and distant government runs deep. And his frequent reference to the great Bornu Empire -- a Muslim kingdom that ruled northern Nigeria for some 500 years -- harks back to a golden age. He is also ruthless in dealing with dissent. Shekau has no deputy and Zenn says that videos issued by the group never show other commanders. ""He kills anyone who challenges him, but to blow him off as a madman would be to underestimate his capabilities,"" says Zenn. Twice wounded himself -- in 2009 and 2012 -- Shekau appears to revel in violence. After a series of attacks in Kano in 2012, he said: ""I enjoy killing anyone that God commands me to kill, the way I enjoy killing chickens and rams."" Nor would Zenn be surprised if Shekau were under the influence of drugs when he recorded his video statement; they have sometimes been found in Boko Haram camps by the Nigerian military. 'I said I would...' The mass abduction of teenage girls yet again delivered on a threat that Shekau has made repeatedly. ""Western education"" is a prime target of Boko Haram because in the group's view, it reinforces colonial and Christian influence and suppresses Islam. In a July 2013 video, Shekau promised that schools would be burned and teachers killed. He has been true to his word. In February, a school in Nigeria's northern Yobe state was attacked and burned down, leaving 29 boys dead. And last September, more than 40 students at an agricultural college were killed. In abducting so many schoolgirls, Shekau may also have wanted to humiliate the Nigerian government just as the World Economic Forum gathered in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. Shehu Sani, a human rights activist in northern Nigeria who has previously been involved in mediating with Boko Haram, believes the abduction and other recent attacks are messages to the Nigerian government that the recent arrest of Boko Haram followers in Islamic schools will be avenged. In 2012, Shekau's wife and three children were reportedly taken into military custody. ""Every time people have started talking about the decline of Boko Haram, it has emerged as deadlier and more fierce,"" Sani told CNN. ""This is about a strategy of violence more than about ideology."" Rewarding the fighters . Boko Haram has suffered several setbacks in the last year. The emergence of civilian vigilante groups in cities like Maiduguri has pushed it into rural areas and the Nigerian military has gone on the offensive against the group. According to Sani, Boko Haram now does most of its recruiting in the countryside, coercing or financially inducing vulnerable youngsters from poor homes to join its ranks. The mass kidnapping of the teenage girls from Chibok may have been part of an effort by Shekau to reinforce the loyalty of these largely uneducated young men by providing them with ""free servants or sex slaves,"" Zenn suggests. In his video, Shekau said of the girls: ""We would also give their hands in marriage because they are our slaves."" ""Many will likely end up becoming mothers -- it's a real horror and over the next years we'll slowly hear the stories of girls few-by-few as they manage to make it out,"" Zenn told CNN. Shekau's unbending, almost medieval Salafism sees girls and women as servants for whom education is a sin. ""Women must go and marry,"" he said in the video statement. You can't get them back . The location of the abduction and the numbers involved were shrewd choices by Boko Haram. The girls were pulled from their beds at the school, loaded onto buses and trucks and swiftly transported to remote, hilly, forested areas in the northeastern corner of Nigeria. Boko Haram fighters are able to cross the permeable borders with Cameroon and Chad for resupply and to hide out, and U.S. officials believe some of the girls may already have been taken out of Nigeria. Sani said the timing was no accident: the school was full of both Muslim and Christian pupils taking their final exams. ""They are likely to be in rural, mountainous and forested areas on the move with fighters, with some forced into marriages,"" he told CNN. Zenn says it will be very tough to get them back. ""Boko Haram has likely split up or sold the girls into many small groups,"" and they can be used as human shields in the event of an attack, he said. Sani also dreads any military operation. ""Any attempt to rescue the girls by force will end in a tragic result -- it could be Nigeria's Beslan,"" he said, referring to the attempt to free hostages at a school in Russia in 2004 that left more than 300 dead, many of them children. Bargaining chips for prisoners, cash or concessions . Shekau is not beyond negotiating with the Nigerian government, despite his apocalyptic rhetoric and frequent denials of President Goodluck Jonathan's legitimacy. According to the International Crisis Group, negotiations in Ivory Coast a year ago were on the verge of producing ""an apparent peace agreement that was to begin with a ceasefire."" Then Shekau was designated a terrorist by the U.S. State Department and abandoned the talks. Sani believes Boko Haram targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government -- beginning perhaps with the release of Boko Haram followers from prisons. ""The fact Shekau said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible. Shekau's video is not going to be the last word from the group on the girls."" And Sani suggests the notion of selling the girls should not be taken literally. ""People don't buy girls in this part Africa,"" he said. But at least some of them may be traded for ransom money. Boko Haram has begun trading hostages for cash -- most notably in the case of a French family kidnapped in northern Cameroon last year and reportedly freed for some $3 million. It also threatens business leaders in the North with abduction or worse unless they pay up. The international outrage sparked by the abduction also serves Shekau. ""He doesn't care at all about international opinion but he knows it has put pressure on the government to reach out to him,"" Sani said. Just how that process might work is unclear, but Sani has called for a group of Islamic clerics and others to be set up to seek mediation. That would require recent laws banning anyone from having contact with Boko Haram to be waived. Few believe Boko Haram is going to wither away until the government addresses inequalities in the allocation of funds between the Christian oil-producing south and the Muslim north. Sani says the stakes could not be higher for the region. ""For now, Boko Haram's focus remains Nigeria, but as they become emboldened they will spread like a cancer throughout central and West Africa.""","Abubakar Shekau is ruthless when dealing with dissent among his followers .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Gustav left 22 dead in Haiti and the Dominican Republic before it pulled away from the countries Wednesday, officials said. A coffin is carried for one of eight people who was killed as Gustav hit the Dominican Republic on Wednesday. The storm is expected to pass between Cuba and Jamaica before heading into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm killed 14 people in Haiti, said Pierre Louis Pinchinat, deputy director of Haiti's Civil Protection Directorate. Authorities said eight more, including six children, were killed in a mudslide triggered by heavy rain in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Forecasters warned that Gustav, which was a Category 1 hurricane when it made landfall in Haiti on Tuesday, is likely to regain hurricane intensity by Friday. The forecast shows Gustav entering the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday or Sunday as a Category 3 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph (179 kph). However, hurricane movements are erratic, and long-range forecasts are subject to change. iReport.com: Send us your photos, videos . Pinchinat said many areas of Haiti are cut off from aid workers because roads and bridges are washed out. At least 300 people are in a shelter in one region, he said, and others are in shelters across the country. In the Dominican Republic, the mudslide occurred early Wednesday in the Guachupita neighborhood of Santo Domingo, officials said.  See flooding, damage caused by Gustav » . Marino Vasquez stood crying over the coffin of one of his children. iReport.com: Storm takes young lives in Santo Domingo . ""I don't have anybody anymore,"" he said. ""I lost my entire family.

Photojournalist and iReporter Juan Fach documented the scene, not far from the main metropolitan area in a poor part of the neighborhood called Jarro Sucio, or Dirty Pot.  Watch vehicles stranded in flooding in Santo Domingo » . The children drowned in a river that ran alongside the settlement; the two women were killed when a mountain of rock and mud tumbled onto their wooden houses, he said. The bodies were taken in a car to a nearby church, where counselors attempted to console their relatives. More than 1,300 people were staying in shelters, and another 4,400 displaced people were staying elsewhere, the government said. In all, 1,140 houses were damaged, and another five were destroyed, officials said. As of 11 p.m. Wednesday, Gustav's center was about 205 miles (330 km) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and 100 miles (161 km) south of Guantanamo, Cuba, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was moving west-southwest at about 8 mph (13 kph) and is expected to turn west on Thursday and west-northwest on Friday. ""On the forecast track, Gustav should pass between Jamaica and the southeastern coast of Cuba on Thursday,"" the hurricane center said. ""However, any deviation to the left of the forecast track could bring the center of Gustav very near Jamaica."" Gustav's maximum sustained winds were near 45 mph (75 kph), with higher gusts. ""Slow strengthening is forecast once Gustav moves away from Haiti, and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two,"" the hurricane center said. A Category 1 hurricane has maximum sustained winds of at least 74 mph (119 kph). See projected path » . Michaele Gedeon, president of the Haitian Red Cross, said that 180 people were in a shelter set up in a mayor's office in southeast Haiti. The storm has destroyed the roofs of more than 100 homes, Gedeon said. Gustav is expected to produce rainfall of 6 to 12 inches over Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, with isolated amounts up to 25 inches possible, forecasters said. The heavy rain could trigger flash floods and additional mudslides. Computer models show Gustav heading for the U.S. Gulf Coast, arriving anywhere from western Florida -- which is already waterlogged from last week's Tropical Storm Fay -- to Louisiana, where cleanup and repair efforts are ongoing three years after Hurricane Katrina. Katrina killed more than 1,800 people when it slammed into the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, flattening towns on the Mississippi coast and flooding portions of New Orleans, Louisiana. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, saying he wanted the state to be prepared in case Gustav hit the state, declared an emergency for Louisiana on Wednesday. ""We are going to hope for the best, but we're preparing for the worst,"" Jindal said. The federal government said it is stepping up its preparations, ensuring that supplies will be ready for distribution along the Gulf Coast and readying disaster teams, among other actions. Concerns about Gustav's approach were partially to blame for an increase in oil prices Wednesday, analysts said. Oil platforms in and around the Gulf account for more than one-fourth of U.S. oil production. A tropical storm warning still was in effect Wednesday night for . Hurricane warnings remained in effect for parts of Cuba. Hurricane watches were in effect in Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and the Cuban provinces of Las Tunas and Holguin. Hurricane watches mean hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area in 36 hours. U.S. troops on the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were keeping an eye on Gustav and ""reviewing destructive weather plans and procedures,"" said a statement from the Pentagon. Facilities housing detainees on the base ""are capable of withstanding hurricane force winds and rain,"" the statement said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday reinstated a federal ban on gun possession for people previously convicted of certain domestic violence misdemeanors. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the opinion for the 7-2 majority. The 7-2 vote was authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who read a portion of the ruling from the bench in a strong, steady voice. It was her second day on the bench after undergoing pancreatic cancer surgery February 5. The opinion was a defeat for gun rights supporters, who had challenged groups fighting domestic violence over which ex-felons should be allowed to buy and keep firearms. At issue was whether a federal law blocking gun possession for those convicted of a ""misdemeanor crime of domestic violence"" should apply as well to someone convicted of a general misdemeanor, such as simple battery, which may have been committed against a spouse, child, or other relative. The ambiguity in the federal language and whether it could be applied retroactively was at the heart of the legal debate. ""Congress sought to apply the firearm ban to all persons convicted of domestic-violence offenses, whether or not their [state] statutes of conviction happen to contain a domestic-relationship element,"" wrote Ginsburg, who said the rule could be applied retroactively. The case involves Randy Edward Hayes, who pleaded guilty in a West Virginia court in 1993 to a misdemeanor battery charge for slapping his then-wife Mary Ann with his hand during an argument. The conviction led to a year of probation. More than 10 years later, police responded to a 911 call of a domestic assault occurring at the home Hayes shared with his girlfriend. Deputies responded and, in a search of the house, found an unloaded Winchester rifle under Hayes' bed. Hayes was charged with obstruction for lying about whether a gun was in the home, and with domestic battery, another misdemeanor. The battery charge was eventually dropped, but the federal firearms violation stuck. His lawyers claim he could not be convicted in federal court of the weapons violations because the original state conviction did not include a domestic relationship element. Only 17 states had misdemeanor domestic violence provisions when Congress passed the Federal Gun Control Act in 1996. West Virginia, like many states before and since, often prosecuted such cases as simple assault or battery. Crimes classified as felonies automatically trigger the gun possession ban. A federal appeals court ruled for Hayes. The high court in November's oral arguments had criticized the language of the federal law, which Justice Anthony Kennedy lamented was a ""mess."" In dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, found the federal law ambiguous at best, as it applied to the various state statutes on domestic violence. ""An individual should not go to jail for failing to conduct a 50-state survey or comb through legislative history,"" wrote Roberts. ""Ten years in jail is too much to hinge on the will-o'-the-wisp of statutory meaning pursued by the majority."" The Ginsburg-led majority, however, agreed with the government's position that Congress clearly wanted to include misdemeanor battery in domestic relationships, even if an abuser was not specifically convicted of that offense. Gun rights groups say the amendment championed by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat, was the first time gun ownership was prevented because of a misdemeanor conviction. ""Why are men with clean histories except for one domestic dispute punished like hardened criminals who mug strangers on the street?"" wrote Phyllis Schlafly for the conservative Eagle Forum, which filed a legal brief with the high court supporting Hayes. ""The answer is that the feminist agenda calls for domestic-violence laws to punish husbands and fathers above and beyond what can be proven in court under due-process procedures."" But opponents said the names of thousands of dangerous abusers could be purged from mandatory federal criminal background checks if the law is diluted. ""The Supreme Court should follow the will of Congress and protect domestic violence victims and law enforcement officers who risk their lives stopping abusers,"" said Paul Helmke, head of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Handgun Violence. ""We should not make it easier for dangerous abusers to get firearms.""","Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote opinion for 7-2 court majority .

"Washington (CNN) -- The national battle over guns is headed to the states in a major way. Already groups supporting more gun restrictions have been active at the local level. And now for the first time in almost two decades, the National Rifle Association is attempting to coordinate the recall of a top state legislator over his role in the passage of new gun restrictions, CNN has learned. The focus of the NRA campaign is Colorado State Senate President John Morse. He is facing a petition drive to initiate an election to recall him because of legislation passed this year in Colorado requiring universal background checks on sales of all firearms in the state, as well as a ban on the sale of ammunition magazines greater than 15 rounds. Morse told CNN he knew that local gun groups were going after him, but did not know at the beginning the NRA was involved. ""It was a grassroots effort for a little while, but when that didn't take at all, it was clear they were getting money from outside. And I wasn't the least bit surprised the NRA was behind it,"" Morse said. In a mailer obtained by CNN, the NRA Political Victory fund wrote to a ""Second Amendment Supporter"" in Colorado that ""your NRA is coordinating a recall effort with the Basic Freedom Defense Fund to put Senator Morse on the ballot for a special election and vote him out of office."" The NRA wrote that Morse ""led the charge to pass extreme and onerous anti-gun state legislation in Denver,"" adding that ""responsible gun owners and sportsmen will be forever burdened by his misguided leadership in the Colorado Senate."" Morse said it was important to remember that Colorado was ""ground zero"" for two of the nation's worst mass shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton in 1999 and last July's massacre at a movie theater in Aurora. ""We addressed [tighter gun regulations] this session, but this is what we get for that response,"" said Morse. The NRA mailing suggests members sign a petition for a recall election. The drive has a June 3 deadline and 7,178 signatures are needed to mandate a recall ballot. With gun control efforts stalled in Washington following the failure of a proposal in the Senate to expand background checks, the move in Colorado suggests that the fight is now turning to the states. Some political observers suggest that these local battles over gun laws could end up gaining the type of attention, fundraising and ferocity that marked the failed 2012 recall election of GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Such scenarios could pit national groups like the NRA against advocates like Mayors Against Illegal Guns led by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg just as corporate interests, such as the Koch brothers, squared off in Wisconsin against national labor unions. Christy Le Lait, the campaign manager for Morse, tells CNN that the ""NRA is investing in these recall races to send a message to every other local official to not pass any other gun safety measures or else the NRA will come after you as well."" The NRA would not comment publicly, deferring to local Colorado gun activists involved in the petition drive. The NRA was involved in fending off the recall of Walker, though that was not a fight about gun laws. It also was involved in the successful recall of California Gov. Gray Davis, though that too was not a fight about guns. In 1994, the NRA led an effort to recall Democratic California state Sen. David Roberti, who had pushed a law to ban some types of semiautomatic assault rifles in that state, though that effort was unsuccessful.","FIRST ON CNN: NRA state focus follows Senate rejection of tougher gun control proposal .

"(CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates on Saturday expressed concern about a German court's decision to release an alleged Israeli agent being investigated in connection with a Hamas leader's murder in Dubai. The suspected agent, who often uses the alias Uri Brodsky, is under investigation for helping obtain a false German passport allegedly used by one of the killers in January. The UAE's foreign ministry said it's worried about Brodsky's release on bail and his freedom to return to Israel during the probe, the state-run WAM reported. Brodsky still faces a possible trial in Germany . ""The UAE seeks assurances that Brodsky is in no way connected with the murder of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in Dubai in January of this year,"" ministry official Abdurahim Al Awadhi said in a statement. ""As this may relate to a serious crime committed in Dubai, the UAE expects full and close cooperation from the German authorities and will continue to pursue the matter through diplomatic channels,"" the statement said. Dubai is one of seven emirates within the United Arab Emirates. Rainer Wolf, a spokesman for the state prosecutor's office in Cologne, Germany, told CNN that the judge decided that keeping Brodsky in custody was excessive considering the severity of the charges and released him on bail. Brodsky was arrested in Poland two months ago on a European warrant as part of an investigation into the killing. That warrant accused him on two counts: espionage and forgery. Poland granted Germany's request for extradition but on the condition that it would only be for the forgery charge. Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of the Palestinian group Hamas' military wing, was found dead in January in his hotel room in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Police believe he was killed the night before and suspect the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence unit, was behind the assassination. Several countries including Ireland, the United Kingdom and Australia have kicked out Israeli diplomats after concluding Israel had probably forged their countries' passports as part of the operation. Dubai police have identified 33 suspects in al-Mabhouh's killing. Most of the suspects are believed to have acquired faulty passports to go to Dubai and then fled to other far-flung locations, police said. Israel has maintained there is no proof linking it to the doctored passports or the killing of al-Mabhouh. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israel Army Radio in March that there is certainly no reason to think that the Mossad and not some other intelligence agency of another country operated there.","United Arab Emirates concerned about release of alleged agent .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- A highly anticipated test designed to measure pressure within BP's ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil well finally began Thursday, and for the first time in nearly three months, oil stopped flowing into the Gulf. The move was lauded by a variety of officials as a positive step, accompanied by a strong note of caution that the cutoff was simply part of the test, as BP and government experts try to assess how the well is holding up. The test got under way after two days of delays, first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as BP replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line. The data are being particularly closely scrutinized at six-hour intervals. Higher pressure readings mean the well is containing the oil, while lower pressure means some is leaking out. The ""well integrity"" test could end after one of the six-hour periods, if the results are disappointing. But it could go on for 48 hours. The longer it goes, the better indications are that the well is holding with a custom-made sealing cap. BP cautioned that the oil cutoff, while welcomed, isn't lilkely to go beyond the 48 hours. Valves are expected to open after that to resume siphoning oil to two ships on the surface, the Q4000 and Helix Producer, as government and BP officials assess the data and decide what to do next. Two more ships are due to join them in coming weeks, bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels of oil a day, more than high-end estimates of how much oil had been leaking. ""It felt very good to see no oil going into the Gulf of Mexico,"" BP Senior Vice President Kent Wells said in a briefing. He said company officials are ""obviously very encouraged"" but they are ""trying to maintain a strict focus"" on remembering the whole purpose of the test, which is to gather data and decide how to proceed. ""I don't want to create a false sense of excitement,"" he said. ""We want to move forward and make the right decisions."" And BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said on CNN's ""Situation Room"" that while no leaks were apparent, ""It's way to early to celebrate."" Retired Adm.Thad Allen, who is overseeing the government's response to the spill, said in a statement it ""remains likely"" that sending the oil to containment ships will be the avenue officials decide to pursue after the test, until the ultimate solution is readied -- sealing the well by pumping mud and cement through one of two relief wells being drilled. The wells are expected to be completed in August. The second one serves as a backup to the first. In some earlier briefings, Allen had been mentioned the possibility of leaving the cap closed, after the test. Allen said experts also will examine options for shutting off the well again temporarily, if there's a hurricane. Meanwhile, from state and local officials around the Gulf region, there were warnings that the cleanup from the spill could take years. ""Hallelujah. It's a step in the right direction,"" said Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, who's been outspoken about the damaged caused by the spill. But he noted, ""My goodness. This have taken us three months. We've been hurt, and hurt badly."" Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindall said in a statement he was ""cautiously optimistic"" as the test proceeds. But he said, ""Work to revitalize our coast won't be done until our waters and our shores are completely clean and our wildlife, our communities and our coastal industries are 100 percent restored."" Florida Governor Charlie Crist sounded a similar note, stating, ""While I am pleased that oil no longer is flowing freely into the Gulf of Mexico, there is more work to do to help families, businesses and communities on the Gulf Coast as they recover from this disaster."" BP's stock jumped on word that the oil flow had been cut off, as part of the test. The stock rose $2.74 a share, more than 7 percent, to close at $38.92. Earlier this month, it traded below $30 a share. The oil stopped flowing shortly before 2:25 p.m. CT, according to Wells. And a series of cameras some 5,000 feet below the surface clearly showed the halt -- a far different scene from the images day after day of a relentless flow. The stacking cap, lowered in place earlier this week, has never been deployed at such depths or under such conditions and, therefore, there were no guarantees on how well it would contain the oil, BP said. In the test, BP closed off -- one by one -- the valves on the cap system through which oil could escape. If at any time the pressure is deemed too low -- meaning that oil is escaping through another source in the breached well -- the testing would stop, according to Allen. Allen compared low pressure in the well to a leaky garden hose that dribbles out water with your thumb pressed hard on the nozzle, Allen said. The catastrophe in the Gulf began when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded April 20, killing 11 workers and triggering the relentless spill. Allen said the cap was not designed to permanently shut in the well -- it was meant to move to a four-vessel containment system and assure redundancy in the event of a hurricane. But he had said in earlier briefings there could be a huge side benefit if the oil can be contained -- a ""twofer,"" as he called it. As for the relief wells, BP pumped drilling mud into them to mitigate risks during the pressure testing. Oil recovery was also stopped Wednesday ahead of the integrity test but resumed while BP was fixing the problem with the leaking choke line. It was stopped again with the testing under way.","NEW: Thad Allen says it ""remains likely"" oil will be sent to surface ships, after test .

"(CNN) -- A mental health evaluation has been ordered for a Maryland mother accused of stabbing two of her children to death and wounding two others while attempting an exorcism, authorities said Tuesday. A judge ordered Zakieya L. Avery, 28, and another woman, 21-year-old Monifa Sanford, to undergo the evaluations this week to determine whether they are competent to stand trial, Capt. Marcus Jones of the Montgomery County Police Department said. Avery and Sanford have both been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder in connection with the stabbings at a Germantown residence. Norell Harris, 1, and his sister, Zyana Harris, 2, suffered fatal stab wounds while their siblings, ages 5 and 8, were hospitalized with injuries, authorities said. Police said they found the four children Friday morning after a neighbor called 911 to report suspicious activity at the home. The neighbor reported seeing a car with a door open and a knife next to it. Investigators believe the two women were performing an exorcism, a ritual aimed at defeating purported evil spirits or demons. Avery, according to Jones, allegedly formed a group called ""Demon Assassins"" because she believed that by doing so evil wouldn't take over their lives. ""The purpose was to get rid of the devil, the evil spirits,"" Jones said. Police are searching for two men who are believed to also have been members of the group, he said. Sanford's attorney, Edward Leyden, said he has no information regarding the allegations that his client was a member of the exorcism group. ""This tragedy is a universal one,"" Leyden said. ""...The family of the victims is devastated, and all the members of Ms. Sanford's family are devastated."" Leyden said he want his client to undergo the mental health evaluation to determine issues of competency and mental delusions. Avery's attorney did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. Police were initially called to the home Thursday over reports of an unattended child in a car. By the time they got there, the child was not in the car and no one came to the door, authorities said. After the neighbor's call, authorities notified county child protective services and asked them to follow up. It's unclear whether they did. Both women are being held without bond.

"(CNN) -- According to the conventional wisdom, lame duck presidents can't do very much. The popular image is that they are killing time, maybe grabbing a beer with the locals, until the new guy or gal comes to town. There are many reasons why the lame duck period is so daunting. Presidents can't scare their opponents with the threat of what they will do in or after the next election, while opponents are prepared to double down in their obstruction to destroy the legacy of the White House and prevent a departing president from making gains that will benefit his party. For voters, gone is the thrill of the original election. Now they are well aware of all the president's flaws and failures. At the same time, members of the president's party in Congress are reluctant to take any more big risks for their leader given that he will soon be goneâ€”and hopefully they will not. But the truth is that a lot can happen in the final years of a presidency. The notion that this is dead political time doesn't hold water. While all the obstacles facing presidents in the lame duck period are very real, there are a number of factors that can allow a president to make significant progress at this key moment. A crisis is the most important factor. Stuff happens in politics, and sometimes a crisis creates a window of opportunity for presidential action even when Congress has been gridlocked for long periods. When major crises occurâ€”whether economic, humanitarian, natural or national security--presidents can find that public pressure is so great for government action they can twist and turn Congress into action. This has happened many times. Most recently, President George W. Bush was able to implement the surge in Iraq when his policies in 2007 seemed to be failing. Even though the public had turned against him and Congress came under Democratic control in 2006, the Iraqi civil war created room for action. When the bottom fell out of financial markets in fall 2008, Bush was also able to push through the TARP program that bailed out the banks and restored some stability to financial markets. On the surface President Obama faces a crisis in the Middle East and Eastern Europe that will further drag him down. This weekend he reached out to Israeli Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu to try to encourage efforts for peace in the Middle East. Many people are skeptical that the president will have much luck achieving any kind of breakthrough. But if Secretary of State John Kerry can manage to broker a cease-fire, combined with some broader accord that stabilizes the situation in the Middle East, this could be considered one of the President's greatest triumphs. And if Obama can bring international pressure to bear on Russia and its allied rebels to a point that President Vladimir Putin backs off from his aggressive path, this too could prove to be a credit to the President's record. On domestic policy the multiple court decisions that continue to raise questions about the Affordable Care Act could create an opportunity for President Obama to go back to Congress to fix and strengthen the legislation. International diplomatic pressure is a force that can operate outside the normal political cycle. Sometimes actions by foreign leaders can emerge to provide huge opportunities for effective leadership. This was certainly the case with Mikhail Gorbachev, who pushed hard to complete negotiations over the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 even as President Ronald Reagan faced intense push-back from the right. The result was that Reagan regained his standing after the disastrous impact of the Iran Contra scandal and in 1987 signed an agreement that is considered one of his most important achievements. Today, with world events so chaotic, President Obama would be eager and receptive to any new voice that emerges from the tumult to help achieve peace. Midterms can also push elected officials toward agreements. Voters can shift the political winds in Washington. If Republicans do extremely well in 2014, as conservatives hope, the results could embolden the GOP and perhaps frighten Democrats into deals on issues like border control. If Democrats do better than expected, holding back the traditional losses that usually take place, they could end up causing fear among Republicans that they need to make some deals or they will do even worse in the 2016 election. President Obama could use that kind of leverage to push through the immigration reform plan that has eluded him. When the GOP only scored meager gains in the 1998 midterm elections, which came at the height of the effort to impeach President Bill Clinton, Republicans came out fearful that they had gone too far and were losing ground as the party of extremism. In Clinton's final years he was able to reach some deals with the Republican Congress on deficit reduction that bolstered his own standing. Finally, part of how the lame duck period unfolds will depend on how much political risk President Obama is willing to take to get things done, either through executive action or the legislative process. It is possible that in these final years a president can lose some of the inhibitions that shaped his time in office to take a chance on bold moves that upset his own party. In 1968, when President Lyndon Johnson was trying to get a 10% tax surcharge through Congress that would help finance the Great Society even while continuing the war in Vietnam, congressional conservatives insisted on steep spending cuts that were intolerable to liberals. After announcing in March 1968 that he would not run for re-election, Johnson agreed to the cuts and obtained the revenue he needed. In 1980, after having lost to Ronald Reagan, Senate Democrats agreed to a series of compromises on legislation to protect 100 million acres of land in the Alaska wilderness, realizing they would get a much worse deal after Reagan was in the White House, to pass a bill that became a landmark of environmental protection. As his second term begins to wind down, President Obama could, for instance, continue to move aggressively by using executive orders to achieve more progress on climate change. He could also return to discussion of some kind of deal on Social Security and Medicare that he has been talking about for years, even though it would certainly anger the base of his party. He could tackle some issues, like urban poverty or campaign finance reform, that he has mostly put aside since taking office. So watch out for the lame duck period: President Obama's supporters should be a little more optimistic about what can happen in the next few years; while his opponents shouldn't be so confident that they will rule the roost. History shows that the next few years could be a highly creative and significant period in Obama's presidency. Just when things seem most desperate, presidents have sometimes found the space they need in the closing months of their term to make gains.

"(CNN) -- Two years later, the story of Osama bin Laden's death remains a high-interest topic. Here are some of the key stories we've published since the world's most-wanted terrorist was killed, from the first breaking news story to the latest disputes over what happened that day. News breaks . President Obama announced bin Laden's death shortly before midnight ET on May 1, 2011, more than an hour after the Internet and social media began exploding with reports of his demise. You can see here how the news unfolded on our live blog, including video of Obama's historic announcement and jubilant celebrations across the United States. The main story that followed, which announced the end of the decade-long manhunt, had more than 21,000 comments and nearly 130,000 Facebook recommendations. The news also set what was then a Twitter record as people posted an average of 3,400 messages per second. The aftermath . In the days and weeks following the raid, more details would be released about how it all went down. How did the U.S. know bin Laden was there? Who took part in the mission, and who knew about it? Why was bin Laden killed instead of taken prisoner? Over time, some of the details initially put out by the White House were clarified or changed. Some are still disputed today. There were several other headaches for U.S. officials to deal with. There was a full-throated debate about whether to release grisly photos of bin Laden's body to the public. But in the end, Obama, not wanting to incite further violence, chose to keep the photos classified. ""We don't need to spike the football,"" he told CBS News. The killing also created tension that needed to be smoothed over with Pakistan, which was outraged that the United States chose to carry out the bin Laden mission there without first informing its leaders. And then there was the downed helicopter U.S. officials hoped to retrieve from bin Laden's compound because of security concerns over the stealth technology of its unusual tail assembly. A few days after the raid, U.S. officials unveiled videos of bin Laden that were recovered in the raid. You can watch all of them here. Perhaps the most well-known video of this stash shows a hunched-over bin Laden, draped in a blanket, using a remote control to watch television. Also taken in the raid were documents, disks, thumb drives, computers and other intelligence that would be pored over for evidence of further terrorist plots. Years later . After bin Laden's death, much praise was heaped on the elite Navy SEALs who carried out the raid: the anonymous ""quiet professionals"" who live by a code to keep their sensitive missions secret. But one former member of the team, Matt Bissonnette, detailed the mission in his 2012 best-seller ""No Easy Day."" The book started a debate about honor, ethics and cultural values in the military; the Pentagon said Bissonnette included classified material in the book and didn't follow protocol for pre-publication review. The raid was also portrayed in the film ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" which focuses on the bin Laden manhunt and was nominated for five Academy Awards. Three U.S. senators -- Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin and John McCain -- called the film ""grossly inaccurate and misleading,"" especially the movie's suggestion that harsh interrogations helped find bin Laden. The filmmakers responded by saying the film condensed 10 years of intelligence work into a 2Â½ hour film. This year, Esquire magazine published a profile on a Navy SEAL who said he was the one who shot bin Laden. His account contradicted some of the details in Bissonnette's book. Another SEAL, however, told Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, that the Esquire story is ""complete BS."" Reflecting on the two-year anniversary of bin Laden's death, Bergen said the U.S. forces may have killed the man, but they did not kill his ideology. Al Qaeda has now morphed into a ""loose jihadist ideological movement"" that spawned the Boston marathon bombing, Bergen said, and it is this ""Binladenism"" that is still very much a threat to Americans.","It has been two years since Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces .

""There is no protection,"" said the gay rights activist, conceding that there is some hypocrisy in campaigning for gay rights while concealing his homosexuality. He refrains from answering his partner's telephone calls or talking about him at the office, he said, even going through the trouble of creating two albums of vacation photos, one with his partner and one that excludes his partner to show people at work. ""You're at-will employment. So they could point blank say I don't want a gay person working under me. I'm going to let you go. I'm not saying that my managers would do that, but you never know."" Such fears appear to be echoed by others in the LGBT community, where according to a recent study by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group, 53% of LGBT workers in the country hide their sexual identity at work and 35% feel compelled to lie about their personal lives while at the office. Another joint study by Deloitte, a consulting and financial services firm, and New York University, found that 83% of lesbian, gay and bisexual workers reported ""covering"" a part of their sexual identity at work. ""It's really downplaying the parts of ourselves that are either our identity or our experiences,"" said Christie Smith, managing principal of the Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion and one of the authors of the study. ""The LGBT community is the population that is most impacted by this concept of covering, hiding their identity when they come to work. They're completely denying, if you will, their sexual identity in order to conform."" Of course, there are also LGBT individuals who are not out of the closet because they feel their sexuality is private and doesn't need to be discussed at work. Apple CEO Tim Cook publicly acknowledged Thursday that he is gay, becoming the only CEO of a Fortune 500 company to announce his homosexuality while at the helm of a major company. ""I don't consider myself an activist, but I realize how much I've benefited from the sacrifice of others,"" Cook wrote in a Bloomberg Businessweek column. ""So if hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy."" Cook's announcement triggered Twitter users to make #proudtobegay a trending topic for several hours. Many people used their 140 characters to celebrate the news, and some saw it as an important moment. ""Proud of Tim Cook for using his voice and his influence to help others,"" tennis legend and openly gay athlete Billie Jean King wrote. ""So proud of tim cook. knowing the apple CEO is gay will comfort and inspire so many young people who are afraid. maybe it already has,"" tweeted Tech Crunch reporter Jordan Crook. The news comes a month after President Barack Obama's executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation, which was welcomed by the LGBT community. The presidential initiative helps to reinforce a changing social and legal landscape where, according to the Human Rights Campaign, 91% of Fortune 500 companies have policies that promote diversity and protect employees against discrimination. Inclusion good for business . Making policy translate to culture is an evolving challenge, says Todd Sears, a former investment banker who founded Out Leadership, a strategic advising company geared toward helping companies focus on LGBT inclusion. ""We have become so politically correct that a number of senior leaders are afraid to say anything because they don't want to say the wrong thing,"" Sears said. ""But, point in fact, that is the exact wrong thing to do. What I encourage senior leaders to do is say, 'I am learning. Can you help me? I am going to make a mistake; I want you to help me figure out that I should say sexual orientation not sexual preference.'"" Sears says he is encouraged by the strides he sees companies taking. ""I actually think corporate America is faster than the federal government, than any state governments, because corporate America sees the business bottom line impact of this,"" he said, noting that the LGBT market represents about $800 billion in spending power. ""It's not just the LGBT market; it is the ally market. It's the people who care about LGBT people,"" said Sears. ""There are economic consequences to discrimination, and you see that play out in the marketplace."" Key to increasing inclusion at the office, Sears says, is retaining talent. ""It definitely is a deciding factor where I go next. It definitely weighs in on my decision to stay. I mean, just knowing that you have the security and those protections built in is really important,"" Jason said. ""Regardless of who I am outside of work or who I identify as sexually, I've worked to always prove myself as a valuable employee and member of the team."" Inclusive policies are not enough to persuade Brandon to come out at his job, where he is a project manager for a medical research firm. ""Policy doesn't necessarily create safety,"" said Brandon, a transgender man. The 33-year-old leads a team of 10 associates and recently opted to work from home, in part because he found it too stressful to go to an office for fear that he would be outed. ""The main reason is I don't know whether there would be a negative effect,"" he reasoned. ""I can't risk that. It feels too much like a roll of the dice."" 'I'm not ashamed of who I am' Brandon's employment came after an exhaustive nine-month search that included interviews with 20 different companies. In every interview except with his current company he was open about his transition from female to male. ""It's better to not be out,"" said Brandon, who is convinced that being open about his transgender identity and activism may have turned off potential employers. Brandon's concern was backed by a 2011 Harvard study that found in some states, there was significant discrimination against openly gay applicants, with gay job applicants approximately 40% less likely to be offered a job interview than their heterosexual counterparts. Brandon has been with his company for six years, and at this point he's not ready to tell his co-workers that he is transgender. That often leaves him feeling lonely and isolated at work. ""I may be perceived as a strange 'other.' That's sad and hurtful,"" he said. ""It's such a huge risk. If I come out, I can't go back. It's a one-way door."" Still, it's a door that Brandon may soon walk through, as his yearning to become a parent is greater than his fear of being outed. Brandon, who was born a woman, is considering having a child. A pregnancy would force Brandon out of the closet, as he still routinely meets with his team. ""It's not about shame. I'm not ashamed of who I am. It's more about logistically navigating a world that I know to be untrustworthy, and even with policy in place, it's fickle."" Life decisions like marriage could prompt Jason to come out, too, but until then he hopes that policy at work will change to reflect the growing social culture of acceptance. ""Maybe I'll be the first. We'll see if the time is right and the venue is right. I mean someone has to step up eventually. ... The tides are slowly turning in our favor."" CNN's Poppy Harlow, Vivian Kuo and Dorrine Mendoza contributed to this story.","""Jason"" says he keeps 2 photo albums; work album excludes photos of him and boyfriend .

"(CNN) -- Let me bring you up to date in Kansas City: . The home football team pulverized the New England Patriots on national television Monday night, its crowd making so much noise, quarterback Tom Brady of the visitors must have felt his eardrums were about to explode. As for the home baseball team -- uh, well, if you think Kansas City's football crowd was loud on Monday, you should've heard the crowd with K.C.-at-the-bat on Tuesday. Here's what happened, in case you missed it. I fear you MIGHT have missed it, because: (1.) This was a Kansas City Royals baseball game, which doesn't normally attract a whole lot of TV viewers outside our fine states of Missouri and Kansas, and (2.) The score was 7-3 in favor of the Oakland Athletics in the eighth inning, so perhaps by then you had changed your TV channel to CNN or some other fine network. Anyhow, doom and gloom seemed imminent for the really overdue Royals, who had finally made it to the Major League Baseball playoffs for the first time since way back in 1985. I felt disappointment and wasn't sure why. I have nothing against Oakland, a first-rate baseball team and town that hasn't won a World Series since way back in 1989. I am not anti-A's. I just felt lousy for those true-blue, Royal-loyal, long-suffering Kansas Citians. Ahh, but then: . Lorenzo Cain hit a single to make the score 7-4. Billy Butler singled to make it 7-5. Eric Hosmer hustled home on a wild pitch to make it 7-6. As you might imagine -- like I say, in case you weren't watching -- K.C.'s crowd went as wild as that pitch. In the ninth inning, Nori Aoki of the Royals hit a ball to deep right field. It enabled a bubbly Jarrod Dyson to race excitedly from third base and make the score 7-up. In the 12th inning, after giving up a run and again looking as done as a flame-broiled steak, K.C. cooked up a masterpiece. Salvador Perez, a 24-year-old catcher from Valencia, Venezuela, came up with a walk-off single for an unlikely 9-8 Kansas City victory. It touched off a celebration -- if not in Venezuela -- that definitely had people dancing in the streets from Dodge City to Topeka to Independence to Branson. It was one of those sappy, happy endings that reminded you of how enjoyable baseball can be. Because it's always so much better when everything's on the line, when it's not just a Tuesday night in May or June but a genuine, nerve-racking, no-tomorrow-if-you-lose October game that looks completely lost before being magnificently won. Like a lot of Americans living far, far away from our heroes of the hour, I wouldn't know Salvador Perez or Nori Aoki or Lorenzo Cain if any of them walked into this room right now to bring me an autographed ball. I now find myself, overnight, appreciative of them, of all those kool K.C. kids, for treating us to this majestic Royal engagement. When they play the Los Angeles Angels next in these American League playoffs, their names will be as familiar in my household as those of Albert Pujols, Mike Trout and Josh Hamilton of the Anaheim gang, each decidedly more famous in Baseball, USA. Thirty years ago (I being a seriously old dude), I flew to Kansas City for a league championship series. The names of those Royals were not household ones -- Darryl Motley, Steve Balboni, Don Slaught -- but it was a pretty solid ball club. It had above-average pitching and a third baseman, George Brett, in his prime and on his way to the Hall of Fame. Loss, loss, loss: three strikes and the 1984 Royals were out, eliminated by the Detroit Tigers in a best-of-five series in the blink of an eye. But baseball was on the upswing in Kansas City. A year later, hopelessly behind to the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS and again to the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, the relentless Royals became kings of the baseball world. They stayed alive with a thrilling ninth-inning rally for a 2-1 win in Game 6, then took Game 7 of the 1985 World Series by clobbering the Cards 11-0. Kansas City partied, baby! Then never did again. No more championships. No more October playoffs, even. Combine that with no Super Bowls in the 1980s, '90s or 21st century from the Chiefs, no pro hockey or basketball, plus the added rub of watching the fans of that other Missouri baseball team (St. Louis) cheering and high-fiving and watching strutting Clydesdales year after year. Everything was definitely NOT up-to-date in Kansas City, which apparently had gone as far as it could go. Things looked bleak. As dark as when the local team was known as the Kansas City Athletics in the late 1950s and carpetbagger ownership began looking for a way to move it to the West Coast before the Brooklyn Dodgers or New York Giants could beat them to it. As bad as when K.C. kept trading top players like Roger Maris and Clete Boyer to those damn Yankees for practically nothing in return. As maddening as when owner Charlie O. Finley did move the whole shebang to Oakland in 1968, leaving Kansas City temporarily without a team. Lawmakers led by Sen. Stuart Symington pressured baseball into giving K.C. a replacement team, pronto. Thus were born the Royals, whose first game on April 8, 1969, was a victory in 12 innings. Not as awesome a 12-inning victory as Tuesday night's, but a nice win nonetheless. It was the dawn of a new era of Kansas City ball, one of powder-blue road uniforms instead of garish green-and-gold ones, one of division championships from 1976-78 and a World Series appearance in 1980. A lot of impressive players came along, Frank White, Willie Wilson, Bud Black, Bret Saberhagen -- the mighty Bo Jackson wore the Royal blue for a while. Everything dried up. Free-spending owners turned into penny-pinchers. Valuable properties like Johnny Damon, Carlos Beltran and Zack Greinke played, but never stayed. Embarrassing records piled up, 64-97 one year, 62-100 another, a gruesome 56-106 season in 2005. Would the poor Royals never be flush again? Well, while fans elsewhere were distracted by Derek Jeter's long goodbye in New York, or by the Baltimore Orioles' rise, or by the Texas Rangers' fall, or on the successes of the affluent Los Angeles teams and the comparatively picayune Pittsburgh one, a heartwarming story was developing in the heartland. Kansas City was hanging in there, holding its own against the rich Tigers and Yankees and Red Sox and all those other big-budget operations. Tuesday night's triumph in the American League playoff opener turned more than a few Americans into brand new Royal backers, you can bet on that. Baseball fans coast-to-coast woke up Wednesday morning buzzing about Kansas City, something that doesn't happen very often. ""When's the next Royals game?"" somebody out there must be asking right about now. Thursday night in Anaheim is the answer, at 9:07 ET, 6:07 PT, and that'll be 8:07 in Kansas City, for all of you there ready to make some more noise.

"(CNN) -- In case anyone had a shadow of a doubt that most Harvard students are precocious, smart, if not learned, we hear from the lips of Harvard's Dean of Undergraduate Education, Jay M. Harris, that nearly all the students at Harvard are indeed above average -- so much so that the median grade given is an A- and the most frequent grade awarded is an A! What are we to make of the news? Well, first of all, this is not exactly news. Harvard and many elite colleges across the country have witnessed the creeping ivy of grade inflation for quite some time -- a situation that has just about eliminated failure as a possibility. It makes one wonder why the school bothers giving grades at all. In the mid-1970s, when I was a dean at Boston University, there were rumors that a certain professor was indiscriminately awarding a final grade of A to all his students. That was unusual back then when most professors graded on the bell curve and only a handful of the best students received an A. Some actually failed and most received grades of B or C. But in the case of this particular professor everybody got an A. As a test, I surreptitiously enrolled a fictitious student into the roster of his next class. This ""nobody"" never came to class, never wrote a term paper and never took an exam. At the end of the semester the mysterious student received an A. That led to a discussion with the professor. In a tone of righteous indignation he claimed I had overstepped my bounds to play such a trick on him. With righteous indignation I claimed that he had underperformed as a professor by acting in a reckless manner, grading his students with careless abandonment. Steam came out of both our ears. I believed his actions were a mark of failure in academic responsibility. Grades serve several purposes. They are a tool that measures a student's progress in relation to others in a class; they allow financial aid and scholarship committees to assess merit; and they culminate in a 4-year overall performance record in the form of a college transcript. Academic strengths and weaknesses are discovered over a period of time. To some extent Harvard's faculty have abandoned their responsibilities to their students as well as to those who wish to judge their students: Admission officers at law and medical school; faculty selecting graduates to mentor them for advanced degree programs; employers deciding between applicants for jobs. Decades ago, professors were often characterized by their students on the severity of their grading. Professor Smith is a tough grader -- no one gets an A. Or, Professor Jones is an easy grader -- no one fails. What can be said today? All the professors are easy marks as well as easy markers. Why give everyone an A? When the admissions office puts together a freshman class full of high school valedictorians who have perfect grades and SAT scores, there is no doubt they are bringing capable students to the campus. But the power has shifted from the faculty to the students and a new form of entitlement on the part of students has developed. If students are paying $55,000 a year, they may feel they have paid for the As in dollars as well as sense. Is there an unspoken academic transaction that is filtering into the university landscape now that tuition prices are in the stratosphere? Has higher education morphed into a consumer business in which the customer is always right? It seems like it. First, universities have to compete for students in the marketplace. Then faculties do the same after students enroll. Professors want to be popular. They want good ratings from students at the end of semester reviews just as the students want good grades from them. Gut courses, once the exception, have become more common. Faculty tenure, promotions and raises may turn on such matters right along with publications and other measures. University life, long a contact sport, has been upgraded to a blood sport. It's become a ""dog-eat-dog"" business in which departments try to fill quotas for majors. And then there are the parents who are quick to speak out if they think their sons or daughters are under appreciated. Is there a solution that can stop grade inflation? Yes, of course. In 2004, Princeton readjusted their grading system instructing the faculty not give more than 35% of their undergraduate students A or A- grades, and apparently Yale is currently discussing a similar adjustment. Harvard faculty should construct a ladder that has a rung at the bottom, middle and top. Last week, I had the privilege to chair the Rhodes Scholarship selection committee for the D.C., Maryland, North Carolina district. We interviewed 13 semi-finalists and selected 2 award winners. All 13 were exceptional; the final decision came down to the splitting of hairs. Out of the 32 Rhodes Scholars named across the United States, Harvard students came away with 6, an impressive outcome however one slices the pie. Perhaps they are all A students. But now we know many Harvard students receive As. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Joel Trachtenberg.","The most frequent grade given at Harvard is A and the median grade is A- .
Stephen Trachtenberg: Grade inflation can be stopped; just look at Princeton .
He says it seems that higher education has morphed into a consumer business .

"(CNN) -- Patience, it is said, is a virtue. If that's the case, then the scientists involved in the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission have been very virtuous indeed. After all, the men and women involved in the project have waited most of their scientific careers -- through years of planning and construction, not to mention the 10-year journey of the Rosetta spacecraft -- to see the Philae lander land on Comet 67P Churyumov Gerasimenko. And now they can enjoy the fruits of this amazing adventure, which has landed (albeit a little bumpily) and has been returning data. Rosetta was an enormously ambitious and technically risky project. However, overall, it has been a great success so far, with a number of ""firsts"" for ESA that have not been achieved by any other space agency -- it has chased a comet across the solar system, rendezvoused and then achieved orbit. Landing a probe on the surface like this has been a huge challenge: working in a low gravity environment with poor knowledge of the nature of the comet surface. It was unclear even if it would it be a solid body or a loose collection of material. And there are plenty more challenges ahead. For a start, although data has been collected from the orbiter since August, and the first images are now being received from the lander, it will take many more months and possibly years for Rosetta to realize its full scientific legacy. However, even as the initial excitement over the technical success fades, we will gradually begin to understand the building blocks of the solar system. It is this reality that really speaks to the value of such a project. Comets are pristine material largely unchanged since the planetary system was formed. It is thought that they may be the origin of most of the water found on Earth, and could even have brought complex organic molecules -- the potential raw material for the emergence of life -- to its surface. Just as the Rosetta Stone was the key to unlocking the secrets of Egyptian writing, so the Rosetta space mission will answer some of the fundamental questions about our origins. This potential is being unlocked not by a single-nation space agency, but one that is a collaboration of 20 countries, including European Union, non-EU and several former Soviet Union countries. Yet while it has just celebrated its 50th birthday, the ESA has often operated in the shadow of NASA. For example, the media frequently talk about NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, with little or no acknowledgment of the partnership with ESA. (From a European perspective, it has therefore been particularly welcome to hear the generous acknowledgment of the Rosetta achievements by NASA leaders). All this means that while ESA has had significant successes in the past, the extent of the Rosetta's success represents a timely ""coming of age."" And, in a world that often seems to be mired in conflict, Rosetta is not just a technical and scientific success, but also a political one. Space research is one of the best examples of peaceful international cooperation and of the ability of humans to do marvelous things when they work together towards a common goal. I am not the only one to have worked on several successful space projects during my career, and to have made many friends around the world as a consequence, often in countries that would have once been regarded as political rivals (or even some that still are). China, a major space power in its own right, is a great example of this -- the ESA and China are currently planning a first joint space science mission as the basis for future collaborations. And this might be the biggest lesson that we can learn from Rosetta -- that as future plans for space research and exploration missions inevitably become more ambitious (and more expensive), the need for agencies to work closely together will increase. If they are smart and forward thinking, then politicians and governments will do what they can to enable this, because if they are successful, we might finally realize the goal of so many of us in the field of achieving truly global cooperation in space, cooperation that will benefit all of humanity.","Rosetta space mission a huge success: Martin Barstow .

"(CNN) -- A former security guard told CNN on Monday that he was unjustly fired after he took pictures of President Barack Obama's motorcade during a visit to Atlanta in September. Kenneth Tate worked for a private security firm when President Obama visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on September 16. He told CNN's Brooke Baldwin in an exclusive television interview that he stuck to his assigned duties and tried to take photos after he was done escorting President Obama. Members of Congress were upset when the media reported last month that Tate had a .40-caliber handgun while in an elevator with the President. That report, coupled with news of an incident in which a man jumped a fence and made it into the White House, led to the resignation of Secret Service Director Julia Pierson. Tate said he was issued a weapon by his security firm on the morning of the President's visit, but no one told him it was a violation of Secret Service protocol for him to carry a gun, he said. Tate's lawyer, Christopher Chestnut, said his client was fired unjustly for leaving his post. ""He should never have lost his job for doing what he was supposed to do,"" Chestnut said. He added that Tate is not a felon, contrary to prior media reports. Tate said he was supposed to take the President to two different floors of one of the CDC buildings. ""Those tasks I carried out,"" he told CNN. He said he also was asked to escort some Secret Service agents to the roof and other locations . A federal official with knowledge of the investigation into the case said Tate was supposed to stay on the elevator and left to take pictures. The CDC asked for him to be reassigned for violating his post order, the official said. Chestnut disagreed with the assertion that Tate violated his duties. ""There was no assigned post. His post was for the entire building,"" the attorney told CNN. The fired worker told Baldwin he only took photos when the detail was over and did not take any images while on the elevator, as had been reported. The New York Times, which also interviewed Tate, reported that when he took pictures of the President's limousine, the Secret Service became upset. So did his bosses, Tate told the Times. They spoke with him to the side and then the Secret Service took him into a conference room. ""I was upset. I'm nervous because I'm like, I don't understand what's going on,"" he told the Times, explaining to the newspaper that he had taken pictures of dignitaries before. He said he deleted the photos and CDC officials took his badge. It had been a great day up to then, Tate told CNN. Like the President, he is from Chicago and he had been very proud to work on Obama's detail. They even shook hands when the President, his aides and their Secret Service detail got on the elevator. Chestnut wouldn't be specific about what legal action they plan to pursue, saying only, ""We anticipate seeking justice for Mr. Tate."" The CDC didn't comment. CNN also reached out to Professional Security Corporation, the security company that employed Tate, but didn't hear immediately back. Secret Service director testimony omits elevator incident with Obama at CDC . CNN's Vishal Mapara and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Fired security guard tells CNN he stuck to his assigned duties .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Transportation on Tuesday fined Asiana Airlines $500,000 for failing to assist families following the crash of Asiana flight 214 in San Francisco in July. The Korean airline was slow to publicize a phone number for families, took two full days to successfully contact the families of three-quarters of the passengers and did not contact families of several passengers until five days following the crash, authorities said. The half-million-dollar penalty is the first time the DOT has issued a fine under a 1997 law that requires airlines to adopt and adhere to a ""family assistance plan"" for major accidents. Three of the 291 passengers were killed and scores were injured when the Boeing 777 struck the seawall at San Francisco International Airport and tumbled down the runway. ""In the very rare event of a crash, airlines have a responsibility to provide their full support to help passengers and their families by following all the elements of their family assistance plans,"" Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement. ""The last thing families and passengers should have to worry about at such a stressful time is how to get information from their carrier."" In the DOT order, Asiana said its job was complicated by the limited number of workers at San Francisco's airport and other circumstances. Injured passengers were sent to 13 different area hospitals, and there was no list prepared at the time to help the airline track passengers. Hospitals also were reluctant to release information to the airline due to privacy laws, the airline said. Asiana released a statement after the DOT fine was announced saying that it ""provided extensive support to the passengers and their families following the accident and will continue to do so."" Under the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act of 1997, foreign air carriers assure the Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board that they will adhere to a ""family assistance plan"" in the event of aircraft accidents resulting in a major loss of life. Among other things, airlines must publicize and staff a toll-free telephone number to take calls from families, notify families as soon as practical and commit sufficient resources to carry out the family assistance plan. According to the DOT, Asiana failed to widely publicize any telephone number for family members of those on board, and the only number generally available to the public that family members could call was Asiana's toll-free reservations line. Asiana publicized a phone number established by another entity 18 hours and 32 minutes after the crash, the DOT said. Locating this phone number on Asiana's website required significant effort, the DOT said, and the reservations line did not include a separate menu option for calls related to the crash, requiring callers to navigate through cumbersome automated menus. Asiana also took two days to send a sufficient number of trained personnel to San Francisco, and initially lacked an adequate number of staff able to communicate in the languages spoken by the flight's passengers, the DOT said. According to the DOT, $400,000 of the penalty is due within 30 days. Up to $100,000 will be spent on multiple industry-wide conferences and training sessions to provide others with lessons learned from the Asiana crash aftermath.","Asiana Airlines is fined $500,000 for inadequate aid to crash victims' familes .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Three men charged with sexually exploiting Cambodian children are being brought back to the United States to face prosecution, the Justice Department announced Monday. The men are among the first charged under an international law enforcement initiative specifically targeting Americans traveling to Cambodia for the purpose of sexually abusing children. The initiative, Operation Twisted Traveler, is an effort by the Justice Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on sex tourism. ""The men charged in this investigation apparently thought they could pursue their abhorrent desires by leaving the United States to prey on children in another country, but they were sadly mistaken,"" U.S. Attorney Thomas P. O'Brien said in a statement. ""We are now working closer than ever with officials in other nations and concerned private parties to take every effort we can to identify and prosecute sex tourists, as well as to provide every protection we can to the world's children."" Ronald Boyajian, 49, Erik Peeters, 41, and Jack Sporich, 75, are each charged with international travel and engaging in sexual contact with minors, a charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 30 years, according to the Justice Department. They are slated to make their first appearances in federal court on Tuesday, the Justice Department indicated in a news release. The defendants are charged with international travel and engaging in sexual contact with minors, a charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 30 years for each of their alleged victims, according to the department. They are charged under the federal Protect Act, enacted six years ago to strengthen federal laws relating to predatory crimes against children outside U.S. borders, the department added. The three defendants were apprehended, according to Immigration and Customs officials, as a result of information provided by the human rights organization International Justice Mission and the group Action Pour les Enfants, which combats child exploitation. All three men have been previously convicted of sex offenses in the United States, the Justice Department noted in its statement. ""These types of cases are disturbing not only because young, defenseless children were victimized in unspeakable ways but also because the defendants went to such lengths to engage in their dark activities overseas,"" O'Brien said at a news conference. He highlighted the case against Peeters, who was convicted on child molestation charges in 1990. ""Our case against Mr. Peeters outlines evidence of him allegedly molesting Cambodian boys, paying them small amounts of money -- $5 to $10 -- and possibly taking digital pictures of his young victims while they were naked,"" O'Brien noted. He said Peeters molested at least three boys in Cambodia over the course of several months. One of the boys was 12 years old when the abuse is said to have started. Boyajian is said to have ""engaged in sexual activity with a 10-year-old Vietnamese girl in an area outside Phnom Penh frequented by child sex tourists known as 'Kilo 11,' "" the Justice Department statement said. Sporich, according to Action Pour les Enfants investigators cited in the government's criminal complaint, repeatedly hosted three Cambodian boys at a residence outside the city of Siem Reap. The complaint states that Sporich ""was known to drive his motor bike through the neighborhoods while dropping Cambodian (money) on the street in order to meet kids."" The new charges ""clearly demonstrate to the Cambodian people that the United States will not tolerate this type of abuse,"" said Carol Rodley, the American ambassador to Cambodia. ""These cases not only signal to the Cambodian victims our commitment to justice, but they will also act as a powerful deterrent for those individuals who are contemplating traveling to Cambodia to engage in illegal sexual activity with minors."" The International Labor Organization estimates that at least 12.3 million adults and children are victims of forced labor, bonded labor and sex slavery each year. Cambodia is one of several countries recently added to a U.S. ""watch list"" because of what a State Department report calls a worsening human trafficking record in that country.","Operation Twisted Traveler is crackdown on U.S. sex tourism in Cambodia .

"(CNN) -- On Twitter, even the best intentions can lead to disastrous results. That's what happened to the NFL's New England Patriots this week, when the football team's attempt to reward their followers on Twitter turned into a social media manager's worst nightmare. It all began Thursday morning, when the Patriots tweeted they were celebrating reaching 1 million followers by thanking fans with ""custom digital Pats jerseys."" The ""custom digital jersey"" was actually a photo of the back of a Patriots jersey displaying a fan's Twitter handle where the player's name appears. So if your Twitter handle is, say, @ILoveCookies, you got a tweet from the Patriots account that included a photo of the jersey with @ILoveCookies on the back, along with a thank-you note. But what if the Twitter handle contains a racial slur? The Patriots didn't think that through. When a Twitter user with the name @IHateN*****ss asked for a jersey of their own, the Patriots cheerfully responded. ""@IHATEN*****SS Thanks for helping with 1 million followers!"" the tweet said, along with the promised photo of a Patriots jersey bearing @IHATEN*****SS on the back. The tweet stayed up for about an hour, to the incredulity of those online who spotted it. Soon after, the tweet was removed and the Patriots issued an apology. The Patriots' fiasco is the second major social media fail we've seen this week. Comedian Bill Cosby, who is facing allegations of rape, learned that encouraging Twitter to use his photo for a meme did not go the way he expected. Although Cosby has denied the allegations, people still mocked him by creating their own meme images that included rape jokes. Check out the gallery above to see more major social media blunders.","The New England Patriots had a social fail on Thursday .

"Washington (CNN) -- Former Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison knew her window to run for president had closed. That moment passed when then-Gov. George W. Bush, a fellow Texas Republican, ran for and won the presidency in 2000 and served two terms, the lawmaker told CNN. She was a senator with aspirations to a higher office who was also in the process of adopting two children. ""The timing wasn't right for me. Even if he served four years, then maybe. But eight years and Texas fatigue. Then I had children, so...,"" she said, her voice trailing off. Wednesday marks the 95th anniversary of Congress' approval of the 19th amendment to the Constitution, guaranteeing women the right to vote. But all these years later, no woman has ever been named a major party's presidential nominee. The path to the presidency is especially challenging for Republican women and it contrasts sharply with Democrats who -- as buzz grows around Hillary Clinton -- may be poised to nominate the first female presidential candidate of either major party. Primary problems: GOP women struggle to come out on top . Four of the five women who are currently governors are Republicans, and four of the past six presidents previously were governors. Still, GOP women's names are seldom mentioned among top-tier potential presidential hopefuls for 2016. Sure, nods are given to retiring Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's failed 2012 presidential bid. And there's a perennial hope among some conservatives that former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will run, though she's said she has no interest in the position. But when mention is made of Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico, or New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, it's often couched as ""she would make such a good running mate,"" not in a way that is on par with male candidates, former Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, told CNN. ""Women should naturally be considered for the highest office in the land,"" Snowe said. ""The bench is too small"" Democratic women in Congress far outnumber Republicans -- 16-4 in the 100-seat Senate and 62-17 in the 435-seat House of Representatives. In each of the past 10 election cycles, GOP women have won a smaller percentage of primary elections for U.S. House seats than have their Democratic counterparts, according to a study by Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, and only twice -- in 1994 and 2010 -- have more Republican than Democratic women run in primaries. ""It's the concept of the pipeline. If the women aren't in the offices we draw on for the presidency, the bench is too small to choose from,"" said Debbie Walsh, director of the Rutgers center. Even when they do seek office, studies have shown that conservative women in particular have had a tougher time getting the networking and financial support -- either from within the party or from outside groups -- needed to mount successful bids, Walsh said. While there are a number of well-heeled groups, such as EMILY's List, which back candidates with progressive stances, there are fewer such groups targeting conservative women, the Rutgers study found. SarahPAC, the political action committee of former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has supported a number of conservative women candidates, including New Hampshire's Ayotte in 2010. This year, the PAC is supporting Joni Ernst, a Senate candidate from Iowa who won her primary on Tuesday, among other women. SHE PAC, another conservative women's group, is supporting Mia Love, the former mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, in her second bid for the U.S. House. Love narrowly lost in 2012 to incumbent Jim Matheson, who is not seeking re-election. The group is also supporting Monica Wehby, an Oregon physician running for Senate, among other candidates. Both Love and Wehby won their primaries. CNN Poll: Majority say GOP out of touch with women . The other challenge female candidates to federal office face is an ""ideological shift to the far right among the Republican primary electorate,"" the study found. This shift has meant Republican women who might be moderate on such issues as abortion rights are less likely to survive primary fights in conservative districts. The results: fewer Republican women headed to Congress and a shallower pool of presidential contenders down the road. The Republican Party is keenly aware of its problems in both recruiting and supporting female candidates and attracting women voters. The party performed an autopsy of sorts after huge losses among women, minorities and young voters in the 2012 presidential election. GOP's soul-searching leads conflicted party to double down . The party concluded it needed to beef up its outreach operations and has spent millions on efforts such as Project GROW, which seeks to identify and support more female candidates for the midterm elections, and ""14 in 14,"" a program aimed at wooing more women voters in key states. ""We've come together with the other GOP campaign committees ... to set up programs to get more women involved in our party,"" said Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. ""We've done things like recruit more women operatives to be involved and have a seat at the table with candidates, message-training and specific voter contact efforts."" The proof is in the numbers . But some senior Republican women say that despite plenty of lip service paid to elevating women within the party, representation at the federal level is paltry, and the performance trend in primaries shows fewer Republican women are winning in those races than just two decades ago. ""It's unfortunate that there's this attitude and perception within the Republican Party that are more aspirational when it comes to women,"" Snowe said. ""The Republican Party hasn't done the groundwork to build a strong bench of Republican women to launch a presidential candidacy."" ""Women have to put a step forward"" as well, Snowe said, to better ensure that they are in the running for the nation's top political post. Senate balance of power could shift on women candidates . However, doing so involves tough choices, Hutchison said. ""We do end up with a great amount of responsibility for our families. Being out campaigning for weeks and months at a time is difficult. The women in the Senate struggle with this, with questions of, 'Do you move your children to be with you, or do you leave them back home?'"" Hutchison said. ""That makes it harder for us to say, 'Yes, I'm going to run for president and go to New Hampshire, Iowa, and South Carolina for weeks on end' -- especially if they are in office already and away from their families. To add that to it is very difficult."" ""Whereas, no matter what we say, men have wives and they can leave more easily,"" she said. Though they may disagree with her political views, Republican women often give Hillary Clinton kudos for her political skill. ""Republican women have to do what Hillary Clinton is doing. We have to steal the playbook of what she is doing,"" said Crystal Wright, an editor and blogger with ConservativeBlackChick.com. Winning requires building strong coalitions, fundraising and surrogates, Wright said. ""Look at what Hillary has done in each campaign she has run. ... She's a good example of a case study for how women should model their efforts for running for office.""","So far, there are no women's names on the GOP's 2016 presidential short list .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. airstrike in Syria appears to have killed a key French jihadist who is part of the militant Khorasan Group, a U.S. defense official said Thursday morning. The strike happened overnight Wednesday near Idlib, according to the official, who has access to the latest information about the strikes. The U.S. military fired at a vehicle it believed carried David Drugeon, a skilled bomb-maker in his 20s who also has ties to core al Qaeda members in Pakistan, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Khorasan Group is made up of senior al Qaeda leaders who have moved into Syria. Later Thursday morning, the U.S. military's Central Command announced that five U.S. airstrikes targeted the Khorasan Group in Syria on Wednesday night. Drugeon was not mentioned in the announcement. But the command said that it has ""initial indications that (the strikes) resulted in the intended effects."" The airstrikes hit terrorists and destroyed or severely damaged several Khorasan Group vehicles and buildings, the command said in a news release. The military said it believes the buildings were used for meetings, bomb-making and training. The strikes happened in the area of Sarmada, Syria, the military said. Sarmada is about 18 miles (30 kilometers) northeast of Idlib. The United States targeted the Khorasan Group with a series of strikes in Syria in September. Those attacks came amid intelligence that suggested the group was plotting against a target in the U.S. homeland as well as other Western targets, a senior U.S. official told CNN at the time. Converted bomb-maker's beginnings . Dangerous operative . Intelligence indicated that Khorasan was in the final stages of planning terrorist attacks in the West, including against American aviation. Sources said that among the devices Khorasan's bomb-makers were developing to try to beat airport security were bombs made out of clothing dipped in explosive solution and explosives concealed in personal electronics. U.S. officials told CNN's Barbara Starr and Pamela Brown in October that Drugeon may have been actively involved in these efforts, which also involved technology transfers from al Qaeda's master bomb-maker in Yemen, Ibrahim al Asiri. In July, the Transportation Security Administration banned cell phones without electronic charge from airplane cabins in response to the intelligence, much of it fragmentary, that was coming in on the plans. Drugeon's knowledge of explosives, European background and access to Western fighters in Syria makes him arguably one of the most dangerous operatives in the entire global al Qaeda network. Path to radicalization . Drugeon was born in 1989 in a blue-collar and immigrant neighborhood dotted with social housing on the outskirts of Vannes on the Atlantic coast of Brittany, according to Eric Pelletier, a reporter with L'Express who has extensively reported on Drugeon and shared his findings with CNN. By all accounts, Drugeon had a very normal childhood. His father was a bus driver and his mother a secretary and committed Catholic. He had an elder brother who shared his passion for the French soccer team Olympic Marseilles and he got good grades at school. But like a significant number of others who later took the path to radicalization, his parents' divorce when he was 13 was traumatic. Drugeon began acting out, and his grades at school nosedived. He began hanging out with a group of young Muslims in the neighborhood who espoused a fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. Before he turned 14 he converted, changing his name to Daoud. ""Drugeon was radicalized over a period of several years. A local imam played a key role. He was part of group of about a half-dozen Salafi Muslims in the town,"" Pelletier told CNN. By 2010, Drugeon was on the radar screen of French security services and had made several trips to Egypt to learn Arabic and more about Islam. He funded the trips by taking driving jobs. In April that year, he slipped away from France for good, traveling via Cairo for the tribal areas of Pakistan, to join the jihad against U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Journey to Syria . According to Pelletier, French intelligence established that Drugeon joined a small al Qaeda subgroup known as Jund-al-Khilafah, based in the Miran Shah area. Drugeon first learned how to make bombs in the tribal areas of Pakistan, and over time became skilled in making explosives. He took on a new fighting name ""Souleiman"" and made several forays into Afghanistan, according to Pelletier. Drugeon is believed to have left Pakistan sometime in 2013 or very early 2014, and to have traveled to Syria to join up with the Khorasan group. A significant number of al Qaeda operatives were making the same journey, convinced that Syria now offered a better sanctuary away from the sight lines of U.S. drones. U.S. officials told CNN they believe Drugeon has been heavily involved in facilitating the movement of fighters to and from Europe, and in planning attacks in Europe.","U.S. military says five airstrikes against Khorasan Group apparently had ""intended effects""

"(CNN) -- Conspiracies abound, Alex Jones will tell you. Bankers pull the strings on world governments to solidify their power. Companies are harming you and ducking responsibility. Antidepressants are ""suicide mass murder pills."" President Barack Obama is using drones against Americans. And the collapse of the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001, was engineered by the government. Now, he's attacking CNN host Piers Morgan, depicting the British native of being a ""red coat"" out to step on Americans' rights and calling for his deportation. In recent segments on Morgan's show, Jones accused him of wanting to take Americans' guns, hurling insults at Morgan in between shouted arguments. ""You're a hatchet man of the new world order. You're a hatchet man,"" Jones told Morgan on Monday. ""And I want to say this right here, you think you're a tough guy? Have me back with a boxing ring in here, and I'll wear red, white, and blue, and you can wear your Jolly Roger."" It's just all in a day's work for Jones, who simply sees himself as a bulwark against efforts by everyone from the Gates Foundation -- run by Microsoft founder Bill Gates -- to conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh to undermine the free world. Rolling Stone once called him ""the most paranoid man in America."" In a commentary on his website, Jones objected to the use of the word ""paranoid,"" but otherwise corroborated the accuracy of the Rolling Stones article, which described an extreme distrust of prominent world institutions, leaders and media figures. Jones, who started out on one radio station in 1996, espouses his theories on a three-hour daily syndicated radio program he says is carried on 140 stations. It also streams over the Internet and listeners also can dial in by phone. Jones also appears as a guest on ""Conspiracy Theory"" with former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, as well as on Fox News, Russia Today and mainstream television networks and cable stations in the United States and Britain, according to his Genesis Communications biography. He's cranked out more than 15 films, according to his website biography, all espousing predictions of a dire future. Titles warn of a coming ""Police State,"" the impending ""Fall of the Republic"" and the undermining of American society by Obama -- who Jones says is paving the way for world dominance by corporations and banks. He also has a YouTube channel and two websites -- Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com -- but they nearly duplicate each other in format and content. Jones' official biography on Infowars cites Thomas Jefferson and George Washington as influences and describes him as ""a dedicated and aggressive Constitutionalist"" defending the Bill of Rights. That includes support for the Branch Davidian church, which gained notoriety during a 1993 shootout and ensuing 50-day standoff with federal agents in Waco, Texas. Later, Jones led an effort to rebuild the church, according to his biography. His aim with his radio show, website and films is to convince and warn, intensely. ""They say the pen is mightier than the sword,"" Genesis Communications touts, ""but in the case of Alex Jones, the microphone is mightier than depleted uranium."" The Anti-Defamation League says Jones surpasses conservative radio host Glenn Beck for anti-government hostility, placing both on the ""extreme fringes."" In 2009, Psychology Today said Jones hand picks facts to drive home his theories. It posed the question: ""When does incredulity become paranoia?"" ""Information is the conspiracy theorists' weapon of choice because if there's one thing they all agree on, it's that all the rest of us have been brainwashed,"" writes psychologist John Gartner. Their theories range from ""suspicion to full-on paranoia,"" he writes, and they see arguments to the contrary by others as attempts to cover up the evidence. Jones, of course, doesn't see it that way. Arguments in favor of gun control, for instance, are nothing but blunt efforts to demolish democracy and usher in a new age of totalitarianism. ""They've taken everybody's guns but the Swiss and the American people,"" he told Morgan Monday. ""And when they get our guns, they can have their world tyranny while the government buys 1.6 billion bullets, armored vehicles, tanks, helicopters, predator drones, armed now in U.S. skies, being used to arrest people in North Dakota.""","Alex Jones espouses conspiracy theories over more than 100 radio stations .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- An emotional Oscar Pistorius apologized Monday to the family of Reeva Steenkamp, the girlfriend he killed on Valentine's Day last year, saying he woke up thinking of them and praying for them every day. ""I would like to take this opportunity to apologize -- to Mr. and Mrs. Steenkamp, to Reeva's family -- to those who are here today who knew her,"" Pistorius said as he took the stand for the first time at his murder trial. ""I can't imagine the pain and the sorrow and the emptiness that I have caused you and your family. ... I can promise you that when she went to bed that night, she felt loved,"" he said, his voice breaking as if he was fighting back tears. It was the first time he has spoken in public about Steenkamp's death, which he says was an accident. He pleaded not guilty to murder when the high-profile trial opened last month. Steenkamp's mother, June, sat stony-faced in court as South Africa's onetime Olympic golden boy choked out his statement. Judge Thokozile Masipa also betrayed no emotion as Pistorius spoke but did once ask him to talk louder, saying she could hardly hear him. Monday was the first day of the defense phase of the trial, following three weeks of prosecution in March. Pistorius, who says he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder in his house in the dark, testified that he has been suffering nightmares since the killing and wakes up smelling blood. He told the Pretoria court that he is afraid to sleep, and ""if I hear noise, I wake up just in a complete state of terror."" He said he is on medication, including an antidepressant and sleeping aids. Earlier, the first defense witness, pathologist Jan Botha, talked about the wounds Steenkamp suffered when Pistorius shot her and about when she last ate. The South African amputee sprinter put his head in his hands as Botha said that the shot that hit Steenkamp's arm was ""akin to a traumatic amputation"" and that she died ""fairly quickly after sustaining the head wound."" Botha went first because of ""family health reasons,"" Roux said, breaking with the South African legal custom of the defendant testifying first. He said Botha was the only defense witness who will go ""out of order."" Childhood remembered . Pistorius, 27, is accused of intentionally murdering Steenkamp, 29. The defense team will call 14 to 17 witnesses, Barry Roux, Pistorius' lead lawyer, said as he opened his case. The prosecution rested its case on March 25 after 15 days and 21 witnesses. Oscar Pistorius on trial: Explore each side's case . Pistorius took the stand late Monday morning after the pathologist finished his testimony. Roux spent much of the day trying to build up a picture of Pistorius as a dedicated athlete, responsible person and devoted Christian who was ""bowled over"" by his love for Steenkamp. Pistorius was also prompted to talk about his awareness of crime, including having come to the aid of victims of crime. Talking about his childhood, Pistorius said his mother kept a firearm in a padded bag under her pillow. His father was often not around, and Pistorius said his mother would sometimes wake her children up, thinking they were being burgled. He said she was very supportive of him and ""never made me feel any different from the rest of the kids."" ""Everything I learned in life, I learned from her,"" he said. He spoke about her death when he was 15 and attending boarding school. He did not know she was sick until he got a call asking him to come visit her at a hospital, he said. Later, he got a call from doctors telling him to come immediately and arrived when she was on her deathbed. She died 10 minutes after he arrived, Pistorius testified. She had encouraged him to be a normal child and participate in sports despite his disability, he said. Roux took him through his athletic triumphs, including his success as a Paralympic sprinter, but also highlighted times he felt vulnerable or afraid. He was badly injured in a boating accident in 2009, he said, which left him ""a lot more vigilant about losing my life ... more fearful."" And he said he cannot stand still without his prosthetics on. ""I don't have balance on my stumps,"" he said. ""I can't stand still on my stumps."" That could be a key to his defense. He says he fired his gun because he would have been unable to defend himself or run away when he heard what he thought was a burglar. Roux asked for court to adjourn for the day about 20 minutes early after Pistorius testified that he did not sleep the previous night. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel seemed to be on the verge of objecting when Masipa intervened, saying, ""He does look exhausted."" The trial is due to resume Tuesday morning. Trial to last until mid-May . Pistorius admits that he killed Steenkamp, firing four shots through a closed door in his house in the early hours of February 14, 2013. Three hit her, with the last one probably killing her almost instantly, according to the pathologist who performed the autopsy. But Pistorius says he thought she was a nighttime intruder in his pitch-black house and believed he was firing in self-defense. The trial, which began on March 3, is scheduled to continue until the middle of May. Pistorius first achieved global fame as an outstanding double-amputee sprinter who ran with special prostheses that earned him the nickname ""Blade Runner."" Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials. In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years in prison. Pistorius also could get five years for each of two unrelated gun indictments and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces. If he isn't convicted of premeditated murder, the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide, a crime based on negligence. The sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge's discretion. Reeva to Oscar Pistorius: 'I'm scared of you sometimes' Gory details lend Oscar Pistorius trial a 'CSI' flavor .

"(CNN) -- Juan Pablo Galavis, the latest star of ABC's ""The Bachelor,"" has gone from stud to dud faster than he could hand out his final rose. The former pro soccer player and first Latino ""Bachelor"" in series history was initially adored by the show's fan base, who saw Juan Pablo, 32, as a sweet, romantic single father searching for ""everlasting love."" His appearance on the 18th season of ""The Bachelor,"" which debuted in January, was so hyped that ABC dubbed the month ""Juan-uary"" in his honor. But even before Monday night's season finale and surprising ""After the Final Rose"" post-finale special, Juan Pablo was being called ""the worst 'Bachelor' ever"" -- which is saying a lot, because this franchise has had some doozies. (See: Womack, Brad.) So how did Juan Pablo pull off such a rapid downfall? In six easy steps: . 1. Made controversial comments about marriage and sexuality . By the third episode, Juan Pablo was already losing viewers. The reality star, who'd previously appeared on ABC's ""The Bachelorette,"" was asked at a network party whether he thought it would be ""good at some point to have a gay or bisexual bachelor."" Juan Pablo then gave a long response that included statements like, ""I don't think it is a good example for kids to watch that on TV,"" and, ""There's this thing about gay people. ... They're more pervert in a sense."" We should note that Juan Pablo, who's lived in Venezuela, does have a language barrier, and when he apologized for offending anyone he said that he'd chosen the wrong words. Whether his true meaning was lost in translation or not, the comments left a cloud over the rest of the season. 2. Caused one woman to accuse him of being a 'narcissist' and an 'a***ole' After the scandal over his views on sexuality, Juan Pablo plowed ahead through his options on ""The Bachelor."" By the time he narrowed the 27 women vying to be his next bride to the final few, at least one of the contestants, Andi Dorfman, couldn't stand him. After spending time in ""the fantasy suite"" with Juan Pablo, Dorfman said she ""could not wait"" to get out of the show. ""I saw a side to him that I didn't really like,"" she said during that episode. ""There's a difference between being honest and being an a***ole."" Later, Dorfman explained that she was ""turned off"" by him and his ""borderline narcissistic"" perspective. Watching the ambivalence some of the contestants developed for Juan Pablo -- including from Sharleen, another contestant who decided that he wasn't what she was looking for in a mate -- didn't help the athlete win any ""best 'Bachelor'"" awards. 3. Caused another woman to cry . His interactions with the women on the show only went downhill, as one of the final two ladies, Clare, accused Juan Pablo of saying an overtly sexual comment to her when the cameras stopped rolling during a helicopter ride. ""As the helicopter's landing, we have a rare moment together with no cameras, nobody there with us and Juan Pablo leaned over and whispered something to me,"" Clare said. ""He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. It was insulting, it was offensive and it just made me feel awful."" To make matters worse, Clare is also the same woman who broke down in tears after Juan Pablo told her he regretted a late-night swim session with her. Although she made it into the final two, Juan Pablo didn't propose to Clare -- and then commented aloud how glad he was that he didn't. 4. Didn't propose during the final show . We already know what happened to Clare, but the other final woman, Nikki, ""won"" this season only by a technicality. Juan Pablo picked out an engagement ring but then refused to put it on her finger because he wasn't ""100% sure"" he wanted to propose. (The ring is now reportedly with ""Bachelor"" producers.) 5. Refused to say the 'L' word . Similarly, Juan Pablo was just as evasive about his relationship with Nikki on Monday's ""After the Final Rose"" special. When ""Bachelor"" host Chris Harrison asked him directly whether he was in love with Nikki, Juan Pablo replied, ""I'm not going to answer that question."" His potential future fiance, at least, isn't bothered by his inability to express his devotion verbally. ""It's not that he doesn't tell me -- it's like in his actions,"" Nikki said. ""I know that he does (love me). I know that he cares about me a lot."" Viewers at home don't know that, though. As TV Without Pity put it, ""Congrats to #TheBachelor for the most horrifically strange and uncomfortable #AfterTheFinalRose in franchise history."" 6. Got celebrities to hate him . ""OMG i want to stab this narcissistic idiot... PAINNNNNNN,"" Kirstie Alley tweeted on Monday. ""I HATE THIS A***OLE!!! He is a jerk!!!! STRAIGHT UP!!"" Kristin Chenoweth agreed, chiming in, ""Isn't he a disappointment?"" To ""Bachelor"" fans, apparently so.","Juan Pablo Galavis has had a rapid downfall as ""The Bachelor""

"Beijing (CNN) -- When an old widower from the central Chinese city of Wuhan went into hospital last summer because of a persistent high fever, he was diagnosed with the AIDS virus -- and made national news. The man, in his late 70s, had frequently hired prostitutes after his wife died, and doctors believe he contracted the HIV virus -- which can eventually develop into full-blown AIDS -- through unprotected sex, the official Xinhua news agency reported. With the population rapidly aging, more than 10% of China's 1.3 billion people are now over the age of 60, census figures show. Improving living standards mean many Chinese are living and remaining sexually active for longer. But now the threat of HIV/AIDS looms large over a segment of Chinese society not previously known for a high prevalence of cases: senior citizens. What is HIV/AIDS? Among new HIV-positive cases nationwide, those over the age of 50 accounted for almost 15% at the end of 2009 -- a sharp rise from less than 8% just four years earlier, according to a recent report by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The center said most patients were male and contracted the virus through unprotected sex. The United Nations has estimated 780,000 people will be living with the AIDS virus in China by the end of this year and more than half of them are unaware of their condition. Chinese officials acknowledge the real figure may be higher, particularly among the elderly. West must not give up on AIDS fight . ""It's very hard for us to obtain an exact number due to our limited ability to monitor and report the epidemic situation in this age group,"" Hao Yang, deputy director of the Health Ministry's disease control bureau, told a health seminar in Beijing last year. ""Older people are more prone to having medical conditions that require surgeries and hospitals are stricter on pre-operative checks -- that's how many of them are notified of their HIV status for the first time."" Researchers say the lure of easy sex with prostitutes -- the average price paid a relatively modest $5.5 -- and the lack of safe sex knowledge among their generation have exposed an increasing number of Chinese senior citizens to the danger of HIV/AIDS. Another 30 years of AIDS? Hao said his ministry had already started including the elderly in its HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention campaigns, which previously targeted only younger people and high-risk groups like migrant laborers and sex workers. But many activists view the government effort as inadequate in dealing with a burgeoning problem, especially as senior citizens diagnosed with the AIDS virus tend to face far greater difficulties and discrimination in China than their younger counterparts. ""Traditionally the elderly are the respected members of family and society, but once infected with HIV, they become a disgrace and face harsh moral judgments,"" said Zhang Biao, whose non-governmental organization AIDS Care in China has counseled elderly patients in southwestern China for five years. ""People of their age are usually pillars of their households, taking care of both their parents and children,"" he added. ""But instead, these patients now have to rely on their families to support them financially and psychologically."" Others echo Zhang's sentiment, adding that elderly patients remain neglected in state-sponsored AIDS treatment and prevention programs. ""Currently AIDS patients are required to provide proof of residence and employment to receive basic care at public hospitals,"" said Yu Tian, a volunteer with Shanghai-based NGO Leyi. ""But many elderly patients are either unemployed or unable to work due to their medical conditions -- making them ineligible for subsidized antiviral treatment."" Activists have called on the government to overhaul its HIV/ AIDS policy and allow NGOs to receive more international funding and cooperation. ""We are willing to work with other experts to reach out to the elderly and teach them the concept of safe sex,"" said Yu. ""There's so much room for improvement in this area.""","More than 10% of China's 1.3 billion people are now over the age of 60 .
Among new HIV-positive cases, people over 50 account for almost 15% in 2009 .
United Nations has estimated 780,000 people will be living with the AIDS virus in China .

"(CNN) -- Rio's Olympic bid coup on Friday may have the lyrics to ""Copacabana"" playing on a loop in your head, but it's still too early to squeeze into a Brazilian bikini -- you can't even book a flight to the 2012 Olympic Games in London yet. Rio de Janeiro beat out Chicago, Madrid and Tokyo for the 2016 Olympics. Travel experts said the flame has to go out in one city before moving on to the next. The Winter Olympic games haven't yet begun in Vancouver, so if you're thinking about a trip to London's July 2012 Olympics start looking for deals as early as next year, and for Rio, you'll have to wait until 2014. ""We anticipate that we'll have packages for London by April of next year,"" said Don Williams, vice president of sales and marketing at tour operator Cartan Tours. ""The demand in London will be pretty good because of location, and we'll be price sensitive because it is an expensive city."" As for individual event tickets for the London games, merchandise isn't expected until 2011, said Jet Set Sports president Mark Lewis. Jet Set Sports and its partnering wholesalers sell the tickets in phases, Lewis said, starting about 18 months before the Games' start date. For the best selection, sign up for e-mail alerts so you can pre-register in late Spring and the company will send you an email when tickets are available for purchase. Jet Set Sports also offers packages that include accomodations with event tickets. Tour companies, on the other hand, place airfare, accommodations for four to five nights, tickets to select events, transportation and translation services, plus a few meals into one neat -- and more expensive -- package. Many also offer extension tours to other spots in the region, so you can fit in sightseeing as well. Cartan Tours is offering pre-reservations for the London Games for those who are dead set on being in London in July 2012. By signing up and plunking down a refundable $250, you can be one of the first to select a travel package, which vary in cost depending on length of stay, airfare and hotel. Packages for Beijing ranged from $4,000 to more than $9,000, and Williams said there's always an initial rush to purchase as soon as flights and tickets to the host city become available. So if you're so intent on the Olympics that you've already planned your vacation days, definitely start researching now, said Sports Traveler owner Anbritt Stengele, who is also pre-reserving customers for 2012 London trips. ""The reason why we started so early is because we had a huge interest in London,"" Stengele said. ""I thought that 2010 in Vancouver would be a huge interest for people, but coming right off the Summer Olympics in Beijing, we already had people asking us what we could do for 2012. The response has been very strong, and Beijing did us some favors by putting on a tremendous show, so the Olympics is looking very appealing."" There's been so much interest, Stengele had to limit the number of early reservations. ""We had close to 400 people for Beijing, and we brought over a lot of staff and we hired a lot of people on site for translators. Unfortunately, there's only so many people that our company can travel. [For London] we will have to limit it, because there's a limited amount of hotel rooms and transportation."" Accommodations in Rio are already causing concern for the tour operators, despite the fact that hotels in the area, like the Windsor and Sheraton, have barely begun planning for what is sure to be an astronomically large event. ""We look at the city and see what accomodations are available,"" Williams said. ""In Beijing, bed and breakfasts weren't an option. But London will have plenty of options -- it has the most out of any city I've worked on. [But] I think Rio is going to be a challenge because there are fewer hotels in Rio than London or Beijing; it'll be a challenge to get adequate accommodations for the event sponsors and the public."" It's also a concern for Stengele, who's hoping the 2014 World Cup will help prepare the city for the 2016 Olympics. ""With London, we have options in surrounding areas,"" she said. ""But in Rio, there are a lot of areas that are very rundown; I'd be concerned with people booking on their own to book in a place that's not safe. But we do have the World Cup in 2014, so maybe by 2016 there'll be more hotels."" Vic Walia, a spokesperson with Hotels.com, isn't concerned about a lack of accomodations, but does want the London or Rio-bound to know that they'll have to contain their excitement for a few more years. ""With London, right now we're only taking stuff through October 2010,"" Walia said, adding that Rio bookings are a long, long way off. ""But,"" he said, ""we do have inventory in Rio now and we have an office in Brazil, and we're always adding new hotels to our network. By the time 2016 would rolls around, our hotel network should expand."" Similarly, airlines don't sell airfare to either host city until about 11 months beforehand -- for flights to London for July, 2012, start looking around June of 2011. But for Rio, you won't be able to book until 2015 at the earliest. Nonetheless, Stengele said, ""the flight is crucial. There aren't a lot of options for Rio. I'm hoping because of the Olympics and the World Cup, they'll have to open up more air flights, because with fewer flights, that's how the cost skyrockets."" Tim Smith, an American Airlines representative, said there isn't a plan to create new flights to the region just yet. ""Generally, that would be done fairly close-in to the event,"" Smith said. ""We watch the volume of bookings as they come in and the timing of the travel requests and then add additional flights on specific days and times as necessary."" However, he added that ""it seems safe to predict we will likely add flights on certain days given our large presence in the Brazil market."" Bottom line? Sit tight, sign up for ticket email alerts and go ahead and spring for that Brazilian wax -- even if you are about six years early.","Planning to go to an Olympic Games destination should start two years in advance .
Event tickets are available about 18 months prior to the start date .
For the 2012 Games in London, you can pre-reserve tours now .
If you're interested in going to Rio in 2016, you'll have to wait until after 2012 ."
"(CNN) -- Benjamin and Kristi Strack lay dead on their bed. On the floor near them lay the bodies of three of their children, from 11 to 14 years old. There were no signs of trauma, no indication of toxins in the air. But beside each body there were cups with liquid inside. These details come from court documents obtained Thursday by CNN related to the deaths of the five Utah family members, documents that hint at a potentially deadly cocktail including the powerful prescription drug methadone. Based on this evidence and perhaps more, one of the court documents states that one detective on the case ""believes the property and evidence described above is evidence of the crime or crimes of homicide."" Authorities in Springville, Utah, acknowledged Thursday that the recently released information has ""re-ignited interest"" in the investigation into the Stracks, whose bodies were found September 27. ""The various affidavits written so that officers could fully investigate this tragic event seem to have raised additional questions as to the events that occurred that night,"" the Utah city's public safety department said in a statement. Chief among those questions: Who is responsible for the deaths? And why did they die? There are no firm answers yet, though the court documents made public this week do shed some light on what authorities know and believe. Documents: Empty bottles of methadone, cold and flu meds . One of them describes how a biological son of Kristi Strack and the son's girlfriend noticed the house was unusually quiet that late September evening and that the master bedroom door had been locked. Once inside, they and eventually police officers came upon the eerie scene. The parents were in their bed, while the children were around it ""covered in bedding up to their necks."" ""Officers reported there was a red liquid substance coming from the mouth of Kristi Strack,"" a police detective wrote in an affidavit for one search warrant. ""All of the occupants of the home were non-responsive. Next to each of the victims was a cup/drink with a liquid inside."" Detectives fairly quickly concluded the family members' deaths were due to ""poisoning,"" though exactly what killed them hasn't been officially determined. The Springville public safety department said that might not be known until late November, when the state medical examiner is expected to release autopsies. The fire department has concluded, however, that ""there was no carbon monoxide leak"" and ""no toxic levels of any kind inside the home,"" according to an affidavit. Everything in the home was found ""to be in good working order."" An affidavit for another search warrant, filed in early October, discussed other evidence found in and around the South Springville duplex. A black bag put in an outside trash can, for instance, contained ""10 opened and empty boxes of nighttime cold and flu medication consistent with generic NyQuil"" and ""two empty boxes of allergy relief medication consistent with generic Benadryl."" Inside the home, authorities found empty bottles of liquid methadone -- a synthetic narcotic used in the treatment of heroin addiction. The methadone bottles had come from a drug treatment clinic, authorities said. Methadone contributes to nearly 1 in 3 prescription painkiller deaths in the United States, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention findings from 2012. Police: 'Probable ... deaths were not accidental or natural' The official documents don't point a finger at any person, in particular, who might be behind the deaths. Yet authorities -- who continue to investigate, including looking intently at things likely a laptop computer and cell phones found at the Strack's home -- believe that the entire thing was intentional. The court documents note that it wouldn't be normal for the three children -- son Benson Strack,14; daughter Emery Strack, 12; and son Zion Strack, 11 -- to go to sleep inside their parents' bedroom, since they had their own rooms. And a police officer wrote, in one affidavit, that ""with the placement of the bodies, it would appear somebody had to position the bodies after they were deceased."" ""It is probable that these death(s) were not accidental or natural in any way,"" the officer added. In a statement given Thursday to KSTU, another CNN affiliate, relatives of the Strack family said the release of the documents ""was shocking to our family and unfortunately it begins to confirm our suspicions."" The statement did not elaborate, beyond adding: ""We are upset about this new information and are struggling as we are forced to relive this horrible tragedy."" CNN's Holly Yan, Joe Sutton and Kate Conerly contributed to this report.","Two parents and three children are found dead in Utah .

"(CNN) -- There won't just be a new winner next season on ""American Idol."" Most everything about the show may be new. Weeks after Randy Jackson announced his departure from Fox's long-running music talent show, two of his fellow judges -- Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj -- followed him out the door Thursday. That leaves only one ""Idol"" judge left in crooner Keith Urban -- for now. News of Carey's departure came out first Thursday, in the form of a tweet posted on her official account that stated she was saying ""goodbye 2 idol"" (and, simultaneously, announced a new world tour). Players behind ""American Idol"" -- namely Fox, FremantleMedia and 19 Entertainment -- confirmed her departure in a statement. ""Mariah Carey is a true global icon -- one of the most accomplished artists on the planet -- and we feel extremely fortunate that she was able to bring her wisdom and experience to the 'American Idol' contestants this season,"" they said. ""We know she will remain an inspiration to 'Idol' hopefuls for many seasons to come."" Minaj followed up a short time later with a tweet of her own, making her exit official, also after a lone season. ""Thank you American Idol for a life changing experience! Wouldn't trade it for the world!"" the rapper wrote. ""Time to focus on the Music!!! Mmmuuuaahhh!!!"" After this tweet, Fox, FreemantleMedia and 19 Entertainment issued another statement saying they ""understand and respect her decision"" in light of ""her extremely busy career."" ""Nicki Minaj is a superstar who brought a level of honesty and passion to 'American Idol' and who had a tremendous positive impact on so many contestants this season,"" they said. The two performers had been brought on following the exits of judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler, hoping to bolster the show's ratings. ""Idol"" had topped the Nielsen charts as America's most watched program for eight years running. But that streak ended in 2012, and since then the show's producers have made several changes. This season's finale was earlier this month. Carey and Minaj, though, ended up generating headlines more for their reported tiff than they did for bringing in more viewers. Both of them join Jackson, who had been the only judge remaining from the program's 2002 debut. Earlier this month, he announced he had voted himself off the show. ""It's been a life-changing opportunity, but I am looking forward to focusing on my company, Dream Merchant 21, and other business ventures,"" the musician and producer said.","NEW: Minaj ""is a superstar who brought ... honesty and passion,"" show's producers say .

"(CNN) -- Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko hailed exit poll results of Sunday's parliamentary elections, saying the projected outcome gives ""a powerful and irreversible backing to Ukraine's path to Europe."" Final poll results are expected later in the week. In a statement published on the Ukrainian presidential website, Poroshenko said ""more than three quarters of voters powerfully and irreversibly supported the course towards Europe."" Poroskenko said he expects a new coalition to be formed soon and that the majority of voters favor his peace plan and want a political solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt and U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Daniel Baer said in a joint statement that they observed ""democracy in action"" as Ukrainians cast their ballots in Sunday's parliamentary elections. ""Today's vote is yet another step in Ukraine's democratic journey,"" the statement said. No vote in separatist-controlled Ukraine . Parliamentary elections were called last winter after protests in Kiev caused former President Victor Yanukovych to flee the country, along with some members of Parliament. Poroshenko was elected president in May.

"(CNN) -- The family of Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national who died of Ebola at a Texas hospital, has reached a confidential settlement with Texas Health Resources, according to family attorney Les Weisbrod. In September, Duncan traveled to Texas from Liberia and began experiencing Ebola symptoms which prompted him to go to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. He was misdiagnosed and sent home, both the Duncan family and Texas health authorities have said. Duncan was hospitalized days later, tested for Ebola and then began receiving care. Part of the settlement, Weisbrod said, entailed honoring Duncan's memory with the creation of a memorial fund intended to raise money that will go to help victims of Ebola in West Africa where the virus has hit communities the hardest. ""We know that this has been a terribly sad, difficult and trying time for Mr. Duncan's family and friends, and they will continue to be in the hearts and prayers of the entire Texas Health Presbyterian family,"" the hospital said in a statement about the settlement. The Texas Health Dallas Thomas Eric Duncan Memorial Fund, which Weisbrod said would be described in detail later, will be run by a Duncan family member and Texas Health Resources, according to the lawyer. Josephus Weeks, Duncan's nephew, will be helping to oversee the fund, he and Weisbrod told reporters at a press conference at the attorney's Dallas office. The attorney also said that the Duncan family received a private letter of apology from Texas Health Resources. ""As part of the healing process, we have again extended our sincere apologies to the family and shared our regret that the diagnosis of Ebola Virus Disease was not made at the time of Mr. Duncan's initial Emergency Department visit,"" the hospital statement said. Weeks praised Texas Health officials for trying to make ""this situation a better situation."" ""We lost one but we can save a thousand,"" Weeks said, referring to people he hoped the foundation would be able to assist. There have been 13,268 reported Ebola cases in eight affected countries since the Ebola outbreak began, with 4,960 reported deaths, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of these cases have been in three West African countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

"Washington (CNN) -- Menachem Zivotofsky is a 12-year-old boy without a country -- he's a U.S. citizen born in the city of Jerusalem. There lies his dilemma. The U.S. State Department, in an unusual exception, will not allow his family to list ""Israel"" as the nation of birth on his American passport. The Supreme Court will decide whether granting this ""small"" gesture on behalf of a child half a world away-- and others like him-- would disrupt the Obama administration's ongoing efforts to secure a binding, lasting peace settlement for the troubled region. Oral arguments in the separation of powers dispute are set for Nov. 3. At issue is whether a federal law that explicitly directs the State Department how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a passport impermissibly infringes on the president's power to recognize a foreign sovereign. ""There have been 50,000 Americans in the last 10 years that were born in Jerusalem, and many of them would like to have 'Israel' indicated as their place of birth in the passports,"" said Sarah Cleveland, a Columbia University Law School professor, and until recently a counselor on international law at the State Department. ""But this is also an extremely important geopolitical issue and a very sensitive foreign relations issue for the United States."" The high court case is Zivotofsky v. Kerry, but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world, and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence: Jerusalem. Its name translates as ""City of Peace"" to some and ""Holy Sanctuary"" to others. It is Israel's largest city and its capital, though that is not recognized by the United Nations and most of the world community. Divided into East Jerusalem (populated mostly by Muslims) and West Jerusalem (populated mostly by Jews), the city spans more than 48 square miles, with about 775,000 people. The terms ""East"" and ""West"" come layered with political, social, religious, and geographic questions-- amorphous, often misleading terms, symbolic of the larger struggle for control and recognition of all that this city represents. Some use the terms ""Jewish"" or ""Arab"" Jerusalem to refer to the sections. The Old City is the heart of the region, a holy symbol to the three major Abrahamic religions-- Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. That tiny area-- just a third of one square mile-- contains the Temple Mount, Western Wall, Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Dome of the Rock, and al-Aqsa Mosque. It is believed to have been first settled in the fourth millennium BC, and according to the Bible, it was established as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel around 1000 BC by King David. It has been destroyed twice-- and attacked, besieged, and captured more than a hundred times. Canaanites, Hebrews, Arabs, Greeks, Romans, Persians, crusaders, Turks, and the British have all laid claim to the land. Its status today remains one the thorniest issues blocking a comprehensive Mideast peace agreement, with both the state of Israel and the Palestinian people claiming sovereignty. During the 1948 war, the western part of the city was annexed by the newly formed nation of Israel, and the eastern part annexed by Jordan. The eastern part was then captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. It considers East Jerusalem part of its ""undivided capital,"" but most of the international community deems the annexations illegal and a part of Palestinian land. The Israeli government is based there, but no foreign embassies. The city is home to Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky. The couple and their two oldest sons were born in the United States, but the family migrated to Israel a decade ago, and in October 2002 the youngest, Menachem Binyamin was born. ""We're very proud of the fact that he was born in Israel and that we live in Israel and it's the modern state of Israel,"" Ari Zivotofsky told CNN. ""Religiously and historically, that's very significant."" The father said his son-- who has been at the center of this legal fight for 11 of his 12 years-- frequently reminds his siblings he is the one Zivotofsky born in their current home. He is preparing for his Bar Mitzvah. Just three weeks before Menachem was born, the United States Congress gave American citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says ""Place of Birth."" President George W. Bush signed the bill, but issued an executive ""signing statement"" indicating he would not comply. The law, he said ""impermissibly interferes with the president's constitutional authority to conduct the nation's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch."" So the State Department's official Foreign Affairs Manual still reads: ""For a person born in Jerusalem, write JERUSALEM as the place of birth in the passport. Do not write Israel, Jordan or West Bank for a person born within the current municipal borders of Jerusalem."" It is not the first time the Congress and White House have clashed over the region. The American Embassy remains in Tel Aviv despite U.S. lawmakers' objections. The boy's mother made the ""Israel"" request about two months after his birth, but embassy officials refused. His passport in fact shows his round, innocent face, and just ""Jerusalem"" is listed as his place of birth. ""That's been the State Department's practice, the general rule for American citizens born abroad is that their passport lists only a country of birth,"" said Alyza Lewin, the Zivotofsky's lawyer. ""So if a citizen is born for instance in Paris, it says France. If they're born in Tel Aviv or Haifa, it says just Israel. If you're born in Jerusalem, instead of saying the country, the city is listed-- just a city-- Jerusalem."" The attorneys for the Zivotofskys have framed their case as a modest request, one that does not implicate the president's foreign policy power. They are asking the high court not to decide a political question, but simply tell the administration to enforce the law, for the sake of a little boy. ""It is a very personal case. What's at stake is their deep personal pride and sense of identification with the state of Israel, and their right, given by Congress, to express that, on the passport,"" said Nathan Lewin, who will again argue the family's case before the high court. ""That pride, and the national pride of others, is clearly what makes that region as much front page news as it often is. But I don't think that this case itself is asking for any kind of broader determination than allowing these individuals that opportunity."" The government is thinking of the bigger picture. State Department officials would not comment on the record on a pending case, but President Obama has acknowledged the stalled peace process has created divisions both in that region and in the United States. ""Palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state; Israelis should know that their basic security concerns will be met,"" he said in a May 2010 speech. ""I know that these steps alone will not resolve this conflict. Two wrenching and emotional issues remain: the future of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian refugees. But moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair, and that respects the rights and aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians."" The justices in 2012 had allowed the Zivotofsky's legal claim to proceed, and will now confront the larger questions: whether the congressional law steps on the president's foreign policy power. ""It's one of those issues that people probably find remarkable that it hasn't been addressed before,"" Cleveland said. ""Because, presidents have been recognizing states and governments for 200 years. Congress generally has acquiesced in what the president has done. There has been very little conflict over the exercise of that power traditionally, other than in, for example, the Taiwan [conflict with mainland China] and, in particular, over Jerusalem. This is an issue that has been a festering source of tension between Congress and presidents for decades."" The family again plans to attend the court session in Washington next week. Choosing a home, and being able to decide what to call it may seem like a fundamental right. But nothing is so easy when Jerusalem is mentioned. The Zivotofskys say they recognize the geo-political complexity, but think in this case, in this judicial forum, the solution is simple. ""Whatever else they decide whatever else, the bigger issues, that's for them to decide,"" said Ari Zivotofsky. ""What we request is just exactly what the lawsuit says, implement the law and write in the passport that my son was born in Israel."" A ruling from the high court is expected in a few months.","Boy is a U.S. citizen born in Jerusalem .
The State Department won't allow the use of 'Israel' as a birthplace on U.S. passports .
The Supreme Court will hear the case Nov. 3 ."
"(CNN) -- His was a suicide with a macabre twist. In February, former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson shot himself in the chest, but not before leaving behind a note requesting his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players. The plaintive note read, ""Please, see that my brain is given to the NFL's brain bank."" Today, scientists announced that Duerson's brain tissue showed ""moderately advanced"" evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma. ""Dave Duerson had classic pathology of CTE and no evidence of any other disease,"" said Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist with the Bedford VA Medical Center, and co-director of the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. ""He had severe involvement of areas that control judgment, inhibition, impulse control, mood and memory."" CTE has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players thus far studied at the center. Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both. The picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that trauma could be causing brain damage. A brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia. Except the cases of CTE have shown this progressive, dementia-like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs in the 70s or 80s. Mike Webster, an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers whose CTE  was also diagnosed posthumously, was 50 when he died. John Grimsley, a nine-year NFL veteran who played most of his career with the Houston Oilers, was 45, and Duerson was 50. Scientists at Boston University have found evidence of CTE in the brain of an athlete as young as 18. ""To see the kind of changes we're seeing in 45-year-olds is basically unheard of,"" said McKee in an earlier interview with CNN. Duerson suffered a minimum of 10 known concussions during the course of his career, some of them involving loss of consciousness, said Dr. Robert Stern, co-director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. Symptoms that nagged Duerson after he retired from the NFL in 1993 were typical of cases such as Webster and Grimsley, including problems with impulse control, an increasingly short fuse and headaches. Duerson's ex-wife said that while playing professionally, the head trauma he bore on the field would become plain after games ended. ""Sometimes he would come home with extreme headaches,"" said Alicia Duerson during an interview with CNN in February. ""We would meet after the game and he would want me to drive because he felt dizziness or he just didn't feel stable."" Alicia Duerson said that several years before he died, her husband had been extremely bright, articulate and gifted. But as time wore on, he began to lose those faculties. Duerson began to have trouble forming coherent sentences and spelling. Alongside cognitive and emotional problems, a business that he established after his NFL career was failing. The tragic culmination of his problems was his suicide February 17 of this year. ""We do seem to be seeing an increased rate in athletes who have early and moderate stage CTE,"" said McKee, adding the caveat that the Boston University sample is autopsy-based and therefore inherently biased. Duerson's death, and specifically the decision to shoot himself in the chest, apparently to avoid damaging his brain tissue, shocked members of his family and the football community. Duerson's is the first case in the CTE narrative in which a player ostensibly took his own life to have his brain studied. ""It's important for people to understand that it does not help our research or our mission of the CSTE to take their own lives because they fear they have this disease,"" said Stern. ""The future will lead to successful treatment of this disease."" Duerson's son Tregg said the analysis of his father's brain -- the answers to questions about his death -- has given the family a measure of closure. ""It is my greatest hope that his death will not be in vain and that through this research his legacy will live on and others won't have to suffer in this manner,"" said Tregg Duerson.","Dave Duerson had classic pathology of CTE and no evidence of any other disease .

"(CNN) -- People in Kansas and Oklahoma expected to shiver because of the coming cold wave, but nobody prepared for the shaking caused Wednesday afternoon by an earthquake of magnitude 4.8.

"(CNN) -- If Elana Meyers Taylor makes bobsled history this season, her husband will have been the driving force. Meyers Taylor, 30, won Olympic silver at Sochi 2014 -- but had a whole new world open up to her last month. Her sport decided, for the first time, to let women pilot four-man bobsleds. Until now, women have been restricted to their own two-person event. Meyers Taylor and Kaillie Humphries, the Canadian friend and rival who beat her to women's gold in Sochi, had been dreaming of this change. ""I didn't know if it would ever be possible to race and compete in four-man,"" Meyers Taylor told CNN. ""Kaillie and I had already been planning a match race -- just the two of us, each driving a four-man sled. ""We had no idea the FIBT (bobsled's world governing body) would allow us to do it in official races. It's crazy-fun, fast, and a whole new ball game."" In October, Meyers Taylor got the news that four-man was opening up to female pilots and set about putting together her team. Conveniently, she is married to an experienced bobsled brakeman. Nic Taylor met his future wife on the phone, in 2011, when she was working for the U.S. bobsled federation and he had just completed tryouts. Their conversation was supposed to be about his paperwork. ""It was crazy,"" he recalled. ""I wasn't sure who she was, at all. But we were on the phone for hours, into the evening, and I was walking around laughing like I was on the phone to an old friend."" By 2013, Taylor was begging FIBT boss Ivo Ferriani to pull some strings: he wanted to propose to Meyers, as she then was, during the podium ceremony at the end of that year's World Championships, where Meyers had won silver. Ferriani played along and Taylor surprised Meyers in front of the TV cameras. On April 24 this year, the two were married in a ceremony attended by Humphries and other leading bobsledders. They even shared a secret bobsled handshake during their vows -- but neither had any idea they would be racing together, for real, six months later. 'Like driving a truck' Taylor, who spent several seasons in the US bobsled team, now works as a coach at the World Athletics Center in Arizona. When they heard about the chance to race together, the pair dropped everything. Taylor found time to step away from his new job and back into the world of bobsled racing. ""We're recently married, we're starting this whole new chapter of our lives -- with an apartment and all these things going on -- then we find out about this four-man thing and we're scrambling to see how we can make it work,"" said Meyers Taylor. Trials to make the U.S. four-man team were set for Saturday, November 8, in Park City, Utah. By the start of that week, the Taylors had assembled their team. Elana would be the pilot and Nic the brakeman, with rookie Dustin Greenwood and Adrian Adams filling out the sled. They would be up against the likes of Steven Holcomb, who piloted the US to four-man gold at the Vancouver Olympics four years ago. Never mind four years. The Taylors had four days to prepare. ""I had four days' training, doing three runs each day,"" admitted Meyers Taylor, laughing. ""And it really was a different experience. ""I'm so much more stable in corners than I am with a women's (two-person) sled, but mistakes in the four-man sled -- because of the weight -- have much bigger results, so there is much less room for error. ""People say a two-man sled is like driving a racecar, and a four-man is like driving a truck. And it feels that way."" The Taylors had been together in a sled before. They once held an informal race against U.S. team-mates Holcomb and Katie Eberling, dubbed the ""co-coed championships,"" which improbably ended in a tie. But what surprised Taylor was the way his wife let no pressure show as she fought -- with minimal training -- for a place on the U.S. four-man squad. ""The closest thing I can relate it to is an NFL quarterback,"" said Taylor. ""You'd have a Tom Brady, you'd have a Peyton Manning and you'd have an Elana Meyers. ""Pre-race, each driver has their signature style. A lot of the guys get really worked up, like entering a football game, but Elana's laughing the whole time, which is awesome. ""It just takes a little getting used to. There are guys yelling and grunting and screaming, and Elana's just sitting around and laughing, ready to go."" Fastest and strongest . That laughter masked nerves. ""The first run in a four-man sled was one of the most nerve-wracking I've had in my life,"" said Meyers Taylor. ""You get this feeling in bobsled, like a combination of excitement, anxiety and pure nervousness, and you get that combination only very few times. ""I remember having it the first time I drove down Whistler's track. I assume I'll have that feeling the first time we go to Altenberg, Germany, which is one of the more difficult tracks on tour. ""And I definitely had that feeling going into driving a four-man. I got to the bottom and was laughing hysterically."" The end product? Third place at U.S. national trials, behind Holcomb and two-time Olympian Nick Cunningham. The top three get places on the U.S. team. Mission accomplished. Part one, at least. Part two is trickier. To reach the leading World Cup circuit -- and race against Humphries in what promises to be a historic four-man battle -- Taylor needs to compete in five qualifying races. That means finding a substantial sum of money. ""I was already planning on competing in four races on two tracks (in North America), and was hoping to get a waiver out of the last race,"" she said after the selection races. ""But that now looks unlikely, which means I have to go to France for a race in December. ""I need about $10,000 to complete that trip. The goal now is to get to France. Somehow."" Not only that, Meyers Taylor will need a new lineup. Her husband's job in Arizona means, despite helping her to qualify for the team, he almost certainly cannot go with her. On the bright side, he still gets to feel involved. He coaches at the World Athletics Center. She trains at the World Athletics Center. One of his athletes is, you guessed it, his own wife. ""We spend a lot of time together and he puts me through some pretty brutal workouts,"" said Meyers Taylor. ""When we go home, I'm like, 'You could have given me an extra 10 seconds to rest, you know. It didn't have to be like that.'"" Her husband laughed off that assessment. ""It's more me having her do less, instead of more,"" he said. ""She's one of the most motivated people I've ever met in my life. ""That's one of the things that made me fall for her so far. She keeps driving forward."" Meyers Taylor, who spent the summer playing rugby sevens and still harbors an ambition to return to that sport for Rio 2016, is convinced she can take on the men and win. ""The biggest disadvantage is the weight. Steve Holcomb, who is one of the top pilots in the world, weighs around 235 pounds, whereas I'm 175,"" she said. ""But I""m really not too concerned about it. Kaillie (who also qualified for the four-man at her national trials) and I are two of the fastest, and strongest, female pilots in the world. We have outpushed some of the men before and there's no reason to think we can't hang with some of them now. ""We are going to have to drive better than them, because of our slight push disadvantage against some of the top competitors, but we're all about it -- and we're all for it.""","Four-man bobsled racing now open to female pilots for the first time .

"Sioux Falls, South Dakota (CNN) -- Josiah's Coffee House and Café is a must-go destination for melt-in-your-mouth fresh baked goods and a perfect cup of coffee. And the guy behind the counter isn't your average restaurateur. He was once one of the most elite Democratic political strategists around. ""It's something I've always dreamed of doing,"" Steve Hildebrand told us as we sat on stools in his restaurant. After a quarter of a century in politics -- most recently as President Barack Obama's 2008 deputy campaign manager - he washed his hands of it all. Like many voters this election year, he's fed up with both parties. ""I'm pretty angry at the way Congress is managing our country,"" Hildebrand told us. ""Whether that's my Democratic party or their Republican party, they're not getting my help. I don't want to help them,"" he said emphatically. But his political expertise -- especially with the Obama campaign - helped make his business boom. ""I don't pretend to know how to market a restaurant but I do know something about social media from all that we were doing in 2008, so we built a lot of our reputation, we built a community on Facebook and Twitter and other social media outlets,"" said Hildebrand, who added that the café has 7,100 people on its Facebook page, and has done no paid advertising. Josiah's has become a salon of sorts to talk about -- what else -- politics. A bipartisan group gathers every morning at 7:30. It includes Dave Munson, a former Republican Sioux Falls mayor. ""We've known each other for years, since we were kids, so we just come down here, get together and talk about things that interest us,"" Munson said. Hildebrand says it's a relief that prominent Republicans come in the door, since he spent so many years working aggressively to defeat their candidates. Another way political campaigns were good training for the restaurant business is the long hours. The cafe is open seven days a week and Hildebrand comes in at one in the morning on Tuesdays to do the baking. It's a fresh start for a recovering political strategist, and a good thing for locals and visitors alike, because the food is objectively delicious.

"(CNN) -- Voters rejected a ban on late-term abortions in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a proposal believed to be a first on a city level. Referenda putting abortion on the ballot have been tried on the state level. But what Albuquerque did Tuesday night makes it unique among cities. If the proposal had passed, it would have banned abortion after 20 weeks -- with a few exceptions. It would also have opened a new frontier in abortion wars, which are traditionally tackled at the federal and state levels. With all 50 centers counted, 45% of voters were for it and 55% against it, according to the New Mexico secretary of state website. Despite the defeat, anti-abortion activists said the battle is far from over. ""Pro-lifers in Albuquerque and elsewhere should not feel discouraged about the defeat of the effort,"" said Father Frank Pavone, the national director of Priests for Life. ""It is a brilliant strategy and we will see to it that this effort is introduced in other cities and states."" The municipal election followed an emotional campaign that included national groups. Over the summer, anti-abortion activists gathered thousands of signatures to force a special election that will ban late abortions and make no exception in the case of rape and incest. It made an exception if the woman's life was at risk. Both sides have plastered the airwaves and newspapers with ads making their case. The defeat came the same day the U.S. Supreme Court refused to stop Texas from implementing a part of a new abortion law that requires doctors to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they're providing abortion services.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- One person was killed and at least 12 were injured Saturday when more than two dozen rockets fired by Gaza militants slammed into Israeli cites. It's the latest in the ongoing tit-for-tat violence between Israel and militants over the past three days. The fatality occurred in Beer Sheva, according to Eli Bin, an emergency official in the region. Four people were seriously injured and two suffered moderate wounds when rockets struck a house and car. An unknown number of trauma injuries were being transported to the hospital, Bin said. Hamas militants in Gaza claimed responsibility for a volley of rockets that struck Ofakim, 25 kilometers west of Beer Sheva. Two children and a man were injured when one of the rockets directly hit a building, Bin said. Hamas' armed wing, the Izzedine al Qassam Brigades, said it fired four long-range Grad rockets at Ofakim. A long-range missile struck the Israeli port city of Ashdod, injuring three people, authorities said. The attacks followed overnight airstrikes that targeted what Israeli security officials said were militant sites in Gaza. Earlier in the day, Hamas announced it was ending a two-year truce with Israel. ""There is no truce with the Israeli occupation under the continuation of committing massacres against the Palestinian people without justification,"" according to the statement from the Izzedine al Qassam Brigades, which was broadcast on a Hamas-run radio station. ""We call for groups to join in calling against the crimes of the Israeli occupation."" The latest violence began Thursday with a string of deadly terror attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers and was followed by Israeli strikes in Gaza. Israel said Saturday that its airstrikes are ""in response to the terror attacks executed in the proximity of Eilat on Thursday, and the rockets fired from Gaza at Israel since."" ""The IDF holds the Hamas terrorist organization solely responsible for any terrorist activity emanating from the Gaza Strip,"" the Israeli statement said. The series of attacks and airstrikes have increased tensions in the region, and comes just a month before the Palestinians plan to make a bid for statehood in the United Nations. Israel believes the attacks had their roots in Gaza, but were coming out of the neighboring Egyptian region of Sinai. Egypt denies the allegation, saying it has been cracking down on terror groups in its portion of the Sinai. The Popular Resistance Committees in Gaza, whose leaders were targeted in Israel's initial airstrike Thursday, and Hamas have denied involvement in the recent attacks on Israel. Hamas has said Israel was looking for a pretext to attack Gaza. Hamas, which controls the Palestinian government in Gaza, has maintained what it has described as a de facto truce with Israel since late 2008. But it has carried out attacks targeting Israelis in response to what it has described as acts of Israeli aggression. Hamas is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. Three men were injured in the attack on Ashdod, which occurred about 6 a.m., said Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri. She said the men who were injured were Palestinian laborers illegally working in Israel. Overnight, the Israel Defense Forces targeted what it said were two tunnels it saw used by militants in Gaza to launch attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers, the IDF statement said. The IDF also said it struck a weapons storage facility in southern Gaza and another militant site. Israel seized the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and other territory during the 1967 Six-Day War. President Barack Obama earlier this year called on negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians to be based on border demarcations pre-dating the 1967 war. On Saturday, the Mideast Quartet -- the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, and Russia -- issued a statement voicing its concerns over ""the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation"" and the group of negotiators ""calls for restraint from all sides.""

"CLARENCE CENTER, New York (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday praised Beverly Eckert, the widow of a September 11 victim and a prominent post-9/11 activist, who was one of the passengers who died in a plane crash outside Buffalo, New York. Sean Rooney and wife Beverly Eckert in an undated photograph. ""Beverly lost her husband on 9/11,"" Obama said, ""and became a tireless advocate for the families whose lives were forever changed on that September day."" A resident of Stamford, Connecticut, Eckert was the widow of Buffalo native Sean Rooney, who died at the World Trade Center. Obama's words underscored the shock and grief from friends, family and acquaintances over the news that Eckert was aboard the Continental Connection Flight 3407. The turboprop plane crashed Thursday, killing all 49 aboard and one person on the ground. ""Tragic events such as these remind us of the fragility of life and the value of every single day. And one person who understood that well was Beverly Eckert, who was on that flight and who I met with just a few days ago,"" Obama said in brief remarks. Obama met Eckert at a gathering of September 11 victims' families on Friday. Valerie Lucznikowska, a member of September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, said she, Eckert and another woman traveled to Washington for the meeting. Lucznikowska said Eckert asked Obama whether the group would have ongoing meetings with his administration. Obama said there would be, even though they wouldn't necessarily be with him. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, Eckert co-founded Voices of September 11, an advocate group for survivors and families. Eckert had a reputation as a strong campaigner of September 11 families, involved in protests leading to more land for a ground zero memorial, working on the September 11 Commission's Family Steering Committee and pushing for a victims' families compensation fund. She was traveling to Buffalo for a celebration of what would have been her husband's 58th birthday. Eckert planned to take part in presenting a scholarship award at Canisius High School that was established in honor of her late husband, who was an alumnus, according to the school's president, John Knight. Obama mentioned the scholarship plans in his remarks Friday. ""In keeping with that passionate commitment, she was on her way to Buffalo to mark what would have been her husband's birthday and launch a scholarship in his memory. She was an inspiration to me and to so many others, and I pray that her family finds peace and comfort in the hard days ahead,"" Obama said. Lucznikowska, whose nephew died in the World Trade Center attacks, said she was ""horribly saddened by this news."" ""I would very much like to honor her. She was truly a wonderful person. She was someone who was trying to make society better."" Eckert backed Peaceful Tomorrows' effort to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and end the military commissions there, Lucznikowska said. The group elaborated on this stance in a signed letter to Obama, and Eckert gave a presidential aide a separate letter listing her own concerns, Lucznikowska said. Knight said Canisius High postponed the scholarship presentation, set to occur at noon Friday, for two students entering the high school next fall. He said Eckert also had been active in a capital campaign fundraising effort. ""She struck me as a wonderful, beautiful person who clearly wanted to do something to remember her husband in a way that would have an everlasting impact on our community,"" Knight said. Gordon Felt, president of the Families of Flight 93 Inc., the plane that crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on September 11, also expressed his grief. ""We note with deep sorrow the passing of Beverly Eckert in the Buffalo plane crash. She was a 9/11 family member who brought to light issues of importance to all of us -- and to all Americans. We extend our condolences to her family and to all those who loved her. She will be missed."" Jay Winuk, a September 11 organizational leader who lost his brother in the World Trade Center, said that although he did not know Eckert personally, ""it is clear that she was a terrific advocate for the 9/11 family community.""

"(CNN) -- Moderate Islamist Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh has gathered support from the left and the right since he was ousted from the Muslim Brotherhood over his decision to run for the Egyptian presidency. Now running as a respected independent in Egypt's first democratic presidential election, Abol Fotoh says the pillars of his program are to strengthen democracy, freedom and respect for human rights, and to ensure everyone is treated fairly under Egyptian law. Those ideals are backed by a long history of opposition to the regime of President Hosni Mubarak, said Dr. Omar Ashour, director of Middle East Studies at the University of Exeter and a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution in Doha, Qatar. Abol Fotoh was among those who first demonstrated in Tahrir Square on January 25, 2011, Ashour told CNN from Cairo, and he has maintained his commitment to the popular revolution since. He is now winning support from people from across the political spectrum, from far right, ultraconservative groups all the way to revolutionaries, Ashour said. ""What brings them together, all these very different groups, is this will for changing the status quo and (an) understanding that the current civil-military relationship is very much skewed, with too much power in the hands of the military,"" Ashour said. Abol Fotoh has also shown he can stand tough when he needs to, which suggests he will stick to his campaign promises, Ashour said. Among those promises are a determination to tackle the corruption that permeates Egyptian society and to restore the independence of the judiciary. He has also pledged to bring to justice those responsible for killing protesters involved in the demonstrations of the past year, Ashour said. A poll published this month by the Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies showed Abol Fotoh placing second behind rival Amre Moussa, and suggested he did particularly well among more educated voters. Starting Wednesday, Egyptians will head to the polls for the historic election. In an interview with the Middle East-focused magazine Enigma, posted on his official website, Abol Fotoh talks about the need for Egypt's new president to be ""flexible on issues of religion"" and able to ""maintain the country's safety and independence."" His own strength as a candidate is rooted in his four decades in public and political life, he said. After becoming politically active while a medical student in the 1960s, Abol Fotoh continued his political engagement through the following decades. He was arrested twice for his involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood, in 1981 and again in 1996, when he was detained for five years. He was jailed again in 2009, this time for six months, for his part in efforts by the Arab Doctors' Union Relief Committee for Gaza to take medicines into the Gaza Strip. An internal reformer, he had already planned to leave the Muslim Brotherhood before the group suspended him last year, he told Enigma, because he felt it should focus on its social and educational activities rather than a political role. While his relations with the Muslim Brotherhood remain bad, that break with the organization is part of his very broad appeal, said Khaled Elgindy, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Abol Fotoh's ""big-picture"" thinking, moving beyond the tension between the religious and secular to the country's future, has proved popular with young people and secular revolutionary types, Elgindy said. He also holds slightly more liberal views on social issues than most in the Muslim Brotherhood. At the same time, Abol Fotoh appeals to the ultraconservative Salafi groups on political grounds because he is no longer part of the Muslim Brotherhood but is still an Islamist, rather than secular, contender. ""The Salafis see the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat to them not only because they are both competing for Islamist constituencies, but as a broader threat as a potential monopolizer of the political process,"" Elgindy said. ""The Muslim Brotherhood don't like to share the ball."" As a result, the Salafis are willing to overlook their ideological and philosophical differences with Abol Fotoh and back him. Many liberals also see him as a more viable candidate than some of the revolutionary leftists, Elgindy said, and so are rallying behind the independent as the ""least worst option"" for them. ""He has been very critical of Egypt's military rulers, so he is seen as someone who is acceptable but can still shake things up,"" Elgindy said. When it comes to the ballot box, Abol Fotoh's success may depend on how widely the revolutionary or liberal vote is split, with other candidates such as Khaled Ali also appealing to that constituency. But he has made clear that he is a champion of peaceful change and wants to see Egypt's revolution continue on a true path toward democracy.","Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh is backed by Egyptians from the right and left .

"(CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales said Saturday that he was suspending the work of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Bolivia and that the government will take control of its activities in the war on drugs. Bolivian President Evo Morales, seen last month, says his government will control its anti-drug activities. Morales made the remarks in a speech in a remote part of Bolivia, carried on national television and radio stations. The announcement comes more than a month after Morales kicked DEA agents out of the country's coca-producing Chapare region, saying the government could no longer protect them amid a growing revolt. At least 30 people died in the violence, and Morales accused Washington of fomenting the unrest. Bolivia and the United States each expelled the other's ambassadors in September as well, and Morales launched a verbal assault against the U.S. government at the United Nations General Assembly. For its part, the United States accused Bolivia of not doing enough to stop the flow of drugs out of the country. Last month, President Bush said he had proposed cutting off special trade deals with Bolivia ""until it fulfills its obligations."" As he left Bolivia after his expulsion, U.S. ambassador Philip Goldberg warned the Bolivian government that reducing ties with Washington was ""a grave mistake."" Morales' accusations that the United States had helped foment the violence in his country are ""false and baseless,"" Goldberg said in September, and Morales ""insulted us."" The DEA has not been officially notified of any suspension or expulsion, spokesman Garrison Courtney said Saturday. He would not say how many agents are in Bolivia for security reasons but said it was not a significant presence. ""If this is true, it is an unfortunate situation,"" Courtney said. ""We've been working with our counterparts for over 30 years and have a tremendous working relationship with our Bolivian counterparts."" The violence broke out in September as Morales, the nation's first Indian president, battled an autonomy movement in the natural gas-rich eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Pando, Beni and Tarija. The movement was triggered by Morales' pledge to redistribute wealth from the eastern departments to the country's poorer highlands. Some of Latin America's leaders have supported Morales. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, long a critic of Bush and the United States, expelled the U.S. ambassador from Caracas in solidarity with Bolivia and recalled his own ambassador from Washington. In late October, Bolivia's Congress approved an agreement between the government and opposition leaders to hold a referendum on a constitution that would grant more power to the nation's Indian majority, according to the Bolivian Information Agency, or ABI, the state news agency. To spur the negotiations, ABI reported, Morales agreed to seek only one more term as president. The agreement followed weeks of negotiations between the government and political opponents, including the governors of the eastern provinces. CNN en Espanol's Felipe Barral and CNN's Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","Evo Morales says he has suspended DEA's work in Bolivia .

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN) -- A day after Britain's military launched its first airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, the question is: Who will be next to join the U.S.-led coalition in its air campaign against the extremists who have seized a swath of Iraq and Syria? As Turkish soldiers and tanks took up position along the border with Syria on Tuesday, Turkey's government put a motion before its Parliament asking for authorization to take military action against ISIS -- the terror group that refers to itself as the Islamic State. Lawmakers are expected to debate the measure in a special session Thursday before voting, according to Anadolu, Turkey's semiofficial news agency. Australian aircraft started flying over Iraq in support of allied operations Wednesday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Parliament in Canberra. But the government is awaiting an invitation from Iraq before a final decision is made on whether to commit Australian forces to airstrikes, he said. The Australian mission consists of inflight refueling and electronic surveillance in support of the United States and others. The retired U.S. Marine general tapped to coordinate the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS said there is an opportunity for broad cooperation in the fight, even as the countries involved struggle to define their roles. ""It's actually an important moment where so many countries from so many different backgrounds share that view (that ISIS poses a threat to the region), that this is an opportunity to create partnership across those lines of effort that would achieve real effect,"" John R. Allen told CNN. Poll: Americans back airstrikes, oppose use of U.S. troops . Airstrikes rain down . The United States could use the help. The airstrikes have already cost it close to $1 billion, according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a military think tank. That number will only rise as costly munitions are used -- and could soar further if more U.S. forces are committed to the operation. The U.S. military said Tuesday that it was the busiest day for airstrikes against ISIS since the military campaign began, with 28 total, including the two UK strikes. More strikes were carried out Wednesday by the United States and a partner nation, the U.S. military said, including around the predominantly Kurdish town of Kobani in Syria, known in Arabic as Ayn al Arab. Other strikes hit ISIS targets in Iraq northwest of Mosul, near the Haditha Dam and northwest of Baghdad. Tuesday, British planes helped Kurdish troops who were fighting ISIS in northwestern Iraq, dropping a bomb on an ISIS heavy weapon position and shooting a missile at an armed pickup truck, the UK's Defense Ministry said. An initial assessment indicates both strikes were successful, according to the ministry. Britain joins the United States and France as countries that have hit ISIS in Iraq with airstrikes, while Belgium and Denmark have also said they also will provide planes. Of those nations, only the United States -- in partnership with some Arab countries -- have struck ISIS positions in neighboring Syria. When the first coalition airstrikes came in Iraq and Syria, Turkey's absence was noted. Turkey has said it is offering support to the U.S.-led coalition targeting ISIS, but it has stopped short of joining the 40-some countries that make up the group. Syrian town fears massacre; Obama admits underestimating ISIS . Blast hits school . In Syria, where a 3Â½-year-old civil war rages on between government forces and rebel groups including ISIS, twin blasts struck Wednesday near a school in the nation's third-largest city, Homs. The death toll has climbed to 39, with at least 30 children between the ages of 6 and 9 killed, according to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The toll was confirmed by the London-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which collects information about civilian casualties in the country. An explosives-packed car was detonated minutes before a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of the school Wednesday, Syria's state-run SANA news agency said. The blasts were timed to coincide with students leaving school, to inflict maximum casualties, it said. The neighborhood that was attacked is predominantly Alawite, a religious minority that is a Shiite offshoot to which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad belongs. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. It was the first such attack in months in Homs, once at the heart of the anti-Assad revolution but now firmly back under government control. Images that aired on state-run Syrian TV showed gruesome images of the aftermath of the blasts, including body parts scattered across a neighborhood in chaos. Ban described the attack on children as ""an act of utmost depravity,"" according to a statement released by his office. Refugees flood into Turkey . Turkey's debate over whether to step into the fray comes as the flood of refugees from Syria has escalated, with 150,000 people fleeing to Turkey in recent days. Meanwhile, ISIS fighters armed with tanks and heavy weapons advance on Kobani in northern Syria, destroying villages in their path. Two Kurdish fighters told CNN that three airstrikes were carried out around Kobani early Wednesday, two to the east and one to the west of the town. If ISIS takes Kobani, it will control a complete swath of land from its self-declared capital of Raqqa to the Turkish border, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. It has been fighting for months, capturing portions of northern and eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic state, or caliphate. Pro-ISIS sympathies simmer in Jordanian city . And Sheikh Hassan, of the Syrian Kurdish National Defense committee, who is in Kobani, said fighting continues to the east, west and south of the town, with neither side having taken more ground. Kurdish fighters and ISIS militants are also exchanging fire near the Syrian village of Siftak to the west of Kobani, south of the Turkish village of Karaca, Kurdish fighter Alan Minbic said. Opinion: To beat ISIS, focus on young people . Meanwhile, police officials in Kirkuk, northern Iraq, told CNN that a motorcycle rigged with explosives detonated in a village in northern Kirkuk on Wednesday. At least two people were killed and 11 injured. Two roadside bombs exploded in a commercial area in Mahmoudiya, about 19 miles (31 kilometers) south of Baghdad, police officials in the capital said. At least three people died and 18 others were injured. CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Irbil, Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote in London. Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- On September 11, 2001, when thousands of innocent men and women lost their lives, tens of thousands more came to their assistance. We as a nation saw greater acts of heroism than we could have imagined: First responders from all over New York and all over the country came to ground zero to save lives, provide proper burial for lives that were lost and assist in the enormous effort to clean up and recover from that devastating attack on our nation. Tragically, in the nine years since the attack, more than 30,000 responders and survivors from across the country have had to be medically treated because of their exposure to ground zero toxins. They are waiting for Congress to pass legislation to ensure that they can continue to get the care they need. Our 9/11 heroes didn't think twice that day. Bound by duty, a love of our nation and their fellow Americans, they joined hand in hand with heroes from every corner of America to come to our rescue. Now, it's long past time we came to theirs. Nine years ago, no one could have imagined that our nation would ignore our duty to the 9/11 heroes. Nine years ago, no one could have imagined that our country would leave these heroes behind. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act would finally provide monitoring and treatment for World Trade Center responders and community members who are suffering, and for those who traveled to ground zero from all across America. The legislation would establish the World Trade Center Health Program within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to provide permanent medical monitoring and treatment for WTC-related conditions to responders and community members. The program administrator will establish a nationwide network of providers so that eligible individuals who live outside of the New York area can reasonably access monitoring and treatment benefits where they live. These eligible individuals are included in the caps on the number of participants in the responder and community programs. One often overlooked aspect of the legislation is its level of accountability and transparency for the disbursement funds. It will terminate the six billing systems created in the chaotic aftermath of September 11, and establish a third-party administrator, who will set reasonable rates, track expenditures and enforce eligibility requirements. And the legislation reopens the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund to cover economic damages and losses for individuals who became ill after the original December 22, 2003 deadline. The bottom line is that this should not be a partisan fight. We have an undeniable, moral obligation to provide our 9/11 heroes with all the care they need. Heroes like NYPD Officer Robert Helmke, who died from Stage IV metastatic colorectal cancer caused by inhaling and swallowing toxins at ground zero. He was 43. Robert worked many tours of duty at ground zero. He ate food and unknowingly inhaled toxic substances while working. At no time while working at ground zero was he instructed to wear a breathing apparatus, nor was he told that the air was unhealthy. Stage IV metastatic colorectal cancer is a form of cancer in the upper GI tract, and it is very rare to see it in a man so young. He was told that treatment would not cure him, only help him live longer. In his own words, he reacted to his diagnosis: ""Talk about crushing news! My wife and I sat in the car and cried, and I asked her what did I ever do to deserve this. ""On July 11th, 2006, I had major surgery to remove two tumorous parts of my small colon and have radiation on the large tumor in my liver. Before my surgery, I had four chemotherapy treatments, and was in the emergency room three times to be treated for dehydration before finally having to go on an all-liquid diet and intravenous feeding. ""I have a wife, Greta, and two young children, Garrett and Amelia, who have seen my health worsen since participating in the WTC recovery. My favorite things in life are slowly being taken away from me. My work, food, helping others and caring for my family."" Officer Helmke died on July 28, 2007. And the longer we delay this bill, the more heroes like Officer Helmke we risk losing. The U.S. House of Representatives passed this bill in September and now it's time to keep our promise to 9/11 heroes and pass this bill in the U.S. Senate. We can't afford to wait any longer. I'm urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what they know is right and support this legislation. Republican leaders from around the country have stepped forward, including former Republican presidential candidates. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said, ""This is something that most Americans want. Something that Republicans like me want. These are people, after all, who were hurt and harmed because of the worst attack in the history of this country. They're entitled to more consideration than this."" And former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said, ""Every Republican should vote for this bill."" The men and women who lived through and came to our rescue on 9/11 were not Democrats or Republicans or independents. They were Americans first and foremost, and so were the people they saved. It's time for us in Congress to honor their sacrifices by coming together as Americans and keeping our promise to provide them with the care they need to save their lives.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The only man recognized as a survivor of both atom bombs dropped in Japan at the end of World War II has died. Tsutomu Yamaguchi died Monday after a battle with stomach cancer. He was 93. He had long been a certified ""hibakusha,"" or radiation survivor, of the August 9, 1945, atomic bombing in Nagasaki. In March 2009, the Japanese government confirmed that he had also survived Hiroshima three days earlier. On that day, the U.S. B-29 bomber Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb nicknamed ""Little Boy,"" which exploded over Hiroshima at 8:15 in the morning. Yamaguchi happened to be in the city on a business trip for his employer, Mitsubishi Shipyard. Many years later, he recalled the bombing in a story that appeared in the British newspaper The Times. ""It was very clear, a really fine day, nothing unusual about it at all. I was in good spirits,"" he said. ""As I was walking along, I heard the sound of a plane, just one. I looked up into they sky and saw the B-29, and it dropped two parachutes. I was looking up into the sky at them, and suddenly ... it was like a flash of magnesium, a great flash in the sky, and I was blown over."" Badly burned, Yamaguchi returned home to Nagasaki only to experience horror again. ""My double radiation exposure is now an official government record,"" Yamaguchi told reporters last year after his official recognition. ""It can tell the younger generation the horrifying history of the atomic bombings even after I die."" About 140,000 people perished in Hiroshima and an additional 70,000 in Nagasaki. Many of those who survived suffered a lifetime of radiation-related health problems, including cancers. Yamaguchi lost his hearing in his left ear in the blasts, and suffered from acute leukemia, cataracts and other bomb-related illnesses in subsequent years. Yamaguchi spoke publicly about his experiences and appealed for the abolition of nuclear weapons at venues such as the United Nations. He was visited in his hospital room in Nagasaki last month by filmmaker James Cameron, who wanted to discuss ideas for a film about nuclear weapons, the Japanese newspaper Mainichi reported.","Man exposed to two atom bombs at the end of World War II has died .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- Free James Willie Jones! The world is upside down. The act of children bullying the vulnerable has become so common that many adults no longer seem to notice or care, much less do anything to stop it. But when a video clip on YouTube shows a father defending his daughter from bullies, some people go ballistic. What used to be considered unacceptable is now thought to be normal, and what used to be normal is now unacceptable. Jones is facing two misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing a school function. He was released from jail after posting a $2,000 bond. It's all because, three weeks ago, the 42-year-old father from Lake Mary, Florida, stormed onto a school bus and -- in a screed captured on video -- threatened the bus driver and some of the students with bodily harm. ""Now everybody sit down; sit down,"" Jones says on the tape. And then, addressing his daughter: ""Show me which one. Show me which one."" The girl points in the direction of a group of students, which Jones then approaches. He told them: ""This is my daughter, and I will kill the [expletive] who fought her."" He also threatened the bus driver. Jones obviously behaved badly. But he was trying to do the right thing. He didn't board that bus to bully students as some have suggested. This isn't a story about a grown man terrorizing kids for the fun of it. He was there to defend and protect his 13-year-old daughter, who had been terrorized by real bullies who -- according to what Jones told deputies -- teased his daughter, spat on her, poked her, pushed her, smacked her on the back of her head, twisted her ear and shouted rude comments at her. They even threw a liquid-filled condom at another girl, and fragments hit Jones' daughter. According to the sheriff's report, this abuse eventually drove the girl, who has cerebral palsy, to have an emotional breakdown and threaten suicide. Meanwhile, the officials at Greenwood Lakes Middle School have taken a break from PE and PTA to do a little CYA. School spokeswoman Regina Murray Klaers told The Associated Press in an e-mail that Jones did not share with school administrators any concerns about his daughter being bullied. Jones' wife, Deborah McFadden-Jones, told the AP that she left messages with a school guidance counselor but that she never heard back. As the father told Kiran Chetry, co-host of CNN's ""American Morning,"" when he learned of the abuse, he acted on instinct. ""She finally opened up and told me what was going on,"" Jones said. ""And from there, you know, being a dad just loving my daughter ... and just loving all my kids, you know. ... [At] that point, my heart broke when I [saw] her standing there ... [she] wasn't going to get on the bus crying. And a dad is a dad. And I was going to be her protector that day."" That's what this was: A father protecting his daughter. And if that little girl couldn't rely on her dad to protect her, just whom in this world is she supposed to rely on? At an emotional news conference this week, Jones acknowledged that his behavior was wrong and apologized for it. ""If you see the tape,"" he said, ""I feel like I was backed up against the wall as a parent. I just didn't know where else to go."" Yet, Jones said, parents should not follow his example. ""We definitely don't want to promote that,"" he said. ""We don't want vigilantes going on buses, threatening kids, because kids have rights too."" Oh yeah, as Americans, we have rights. We know all about our rights. We assert our rights. We don't think twice about hiring lawyers to defend our rights. But what we have trouble with is the other half of the social contract: responsibility. That includes the responsibility to treat one another with dignity and respect, and not prey on those who can't defend themselves. And the responsibility of parents to raise good kids who don't get their jollies from causing classmates mental and emotional anguish. And the responsibility of school officials to take seriously the idea that they act in loco parentis (in place of parents) and that our children's safety rests in their hands. Jones' attorney has said she is hoping to get the charges against him dropped. She has even offered to have her client give speeches against bullying as a form of community service. The attorney is half right. The charges in this case should be dropped -- immediately. And I'd like to see charges filed against the teenage bullies. In an ideal world, we'd also charge their parents for bungling the job of raising these kids. But Jones shouldn't waste his time giving speeches about bullying. Instead, he should lecture audiences about something that is really important to our society and that a lot of people don't know how to do but that he seems pretty good at: parenting. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: YouTube video shows dad yelling at kids who bullied his daughter on bus .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- More than 1,300 pounds of explosives were packed into a construction truck that detonated outside an Islamabad hotel, killing 57 people, including two Americans and a diplomat, officials said Sunday. A truck burns at the gate to the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad before a larger, deadly explosion Saturday. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the Saturday attack at the Marriott Hotel ""is the biggest attack, volume-wise"" in Pakistan in seven years. Two American military personnel who worked for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad were among those killed, the U.S. military said. A Lithuanian and the Czech Republic's ambassador to Pakistan, Ivo Zdarek, also were among the fatalities, police superintendent Sheikh Zubair said. The suicide truck blast injured 266 people, including 11 foreigners, according to Malik.  Watch guards scatter after an explosion » . British Airways temporarily suspended its flights to Islamabad as a result of the security situation, according to an airline spokeswoman who did not want to be named. A Sunday night flight has been canceled, and the airline is reviewing its operations for later in the week. British Airways operates at least three flights a week to the Pakistani capital out of London's Heathrow Airport. At a news conference in Islamabad on Sunday, Pakistani authorities released security video of the blast, showing a small explosion inside the truck before the larger, deadly explosion. Watch the truck bomb caught on tape . In the video, a large truck crashes into the security gate, sending one security officer scurrying for safety. Then, as security guards approach the truck, the top of the vehicle explodes and the security guards flee. A small cloud of smoke appears above the truck, which is engulfed in flames minutes later. One of the security guards tries to put out the fire with a hand-held extinguisher, to no avail. The guards then walk away, and the camera freezes on the burning truck. Pakistani officials said the blast apparently disrupted electricity to the area, causing the closed-circuit television camera to malfunction. No arrests have been made in connection with the attack, Malik said Sunday, adding that militants in Pakistan's tribal regions are suspected of orchestrating the attack. ""I am not in a position to tell you who has done it, but [in] all the previous investigations, all the roads have gone to South Waziristan,"" he said. South Waziristan is one of Pakistan's seven tribal areas where Taliban and al Qaeda militants are active. At the bombing site, video showed a deep crater in the pavement where the bomb detonated. More than a dozen cars were reduced to twisted steel. The crater was 24 feet deep and nearly 60 feet wide, Malik said. The blast also caused a natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five-story, 258-room hotel on fire, police said. The blaze quickly engulfed the entire structure.  Watch a witness describe walking over bodies » . Most of the fatalities appeared to be drivers, who were waiting with their cars outside the Marriott, and hotel security guards, Geo TV's Hamid Mir said. The hotel, where a standard room costs more than $300 per night, is near the compound that contains the Parliament building, the prime minister's house, the Supreme Court and the presidency. The blast occurred about 7:50 p.m., after the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan, Malik said. Trees were felled by the explosion, which occurred hours after newly elected President Asif Ali Zardari addressed a joint session of Parliament and promised to root out terrorism.  Watch the scene the morning after the blast » . A few hours after the attack, Zardari addressed the nation on television, saying he knows the pain of terrorism after his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was killed in December on the campaign trail. ""My heart cries tears of blood. I can understand your pain. I want to ask you to turn this pain into your strength,"" he said, describing extremism as ""a cancer, which we will finish."" ""In the holy month of Ramadan, no Muslim can act in this way. These people are not Muslims,"" he said. ""I appeal to all democratic nations to help us get rid of this menace."" The Marriott, a Western brand-name hotel, has been the site of attacks in the past.  See where the attack occurred » . Malik said authorities had received a threat against Parliament two days ago. ""We had taken all security measures,"" he said. ""There was heavy security in the city."" Located near the diplomatic section of the city and heavily guarded by police and the military, the hotel is popular among tourists and had been packed Saturday night. Any vehicle entering the facility is searched, its underside checked for bombs, before it is allowed to pass through heavy steel gates.  Watch bombing victims rushed into hospital » . The British High Commission in Islamabad said six British nationals -- five adults and one minor -- were injured in the attack, including three commission members. A Pakistani staff member of the commission was also injured, it said. A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry said six Germans in the hotel were slightly hurt in the attack, and that all embassy personnel were accounted for.

"Washington (CNN)  -- President Obama has asked the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a rule that would prevent hospitals from denying visitation privileges to gay and lesbian partners. The president's Thursday memo said, ""There are few moments in our lives that call for greater compassion and companionship than when a loved one is admitted to the hospital. ... Yet every day, all across America, patients are denied the kindnesses and caring of a loved one at their sides."" Gay and lesbian Americans are ""uniquely affected"" by relatives-only policies at hospitals, Obama said, adding that they ""are often barred from the bedsides of the partners with whom they may have spent decades of their lives -- unable to be there for the person they love, and unable to act as a legal surrogate if their partner is incapacitated."" When Lisa Pond collapsed during a family vacation in Florida three years ago, her partner of 17 years was kept away from her hospital room. Janice Langbehn begged and waited for hours to stand by Pond's bedside at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, but it wasn't until her partner's sister arrived that she got any information. In the end, the person Pond was closest to was relegated to a waiting room as she died from an aneurysm. ""To hold Lisa's hand wasn't a gay right, it was a human right,"" Langbehn told CNN on Thursday. Obama requested that the regulation make clear that any hospital receiving Medicare and Medicaid funding, which includes the vast majority of U.S. hospitals, must allow patients to decide who can visit them and prohibit discrimination based on a variety of characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender identity. Read the president's memorandum (PDF) The president listed widows and widowers without children and members of certain religious orders among those who suffer under the policy. The memo was welcomed by gays and lesbians, who have used the restrictions on hospital visitation as an argument in favor of same-sex marriage. ""In the absence of gay people being able to legally marry in most jurisdictions, this is a step to rectify a gross inequity,"" said David Smith, an executive at the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights group. ""Because without gay marriage, much more inequities exist. It should be applauded."" Smith said the organization had been working with the Obama administration for months on the request, and that it was sparked by the case of an Olympia, Washington, lesbian couple who were kept apart as one died from an aneurysm while hospitalized in Miami, Florida. The rule would help hundreds of thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families, he said. Obama's memo also requires the HHS regulations to guarantee hospitals honor all patients' advance directives, which include stipulations such as who should make health care decisions if the patient isn't able to do so. The memo also directs the department to look into any other health care barriers that pose challenges to such families and make recommendations to the president on them within 180 days. He pointed out that North Carolina recently amended its Patients' Bill of Rights to give each patient ""the right to designate visitors who shall receive the same visitation privileges as the patient's immediate family members, regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the patient."" Delaware, Nebraska and Minnesota have adopted similar laws, the memo said. For Langbehn, a call from Obama about the order was a humbling experience. For years, she pressed the Florida hospital for an apology, and never got one. On Thursday, she received an apology from the president for how her family was treated. The key part of the new rule would be that patients would have the right to pick their ""circle of intimacy,"" Langbehn said, which means her partner ""didn't die in vain."" CNN's Anderson Cooper, Devon Sayers and Samira Simone contributed to this report.","Rule sought to allow gays, lesbians to visit hospitalized partners .

"(Oprah.com) -- Are you looking forward to the season ahead? With Shivers of anticipation? Or just shivers? Robin Monheit gathered O's best gift buying advice and got even more tips from style experts Jesse Garza and Joe Lupo, authors of Life in Color (Chronicle). We can't reach out and put a finger on the bow, uncork the wine, or tuck you in for a well-earned nap, but with these 10 steps, we can help you find the perfect gift for each and every one of the perfect people on your list. Step 1: Start Now . ""Or yesterday!"" says Joe. Jesse points out that a number of stores are having sales already. We discovered that many department stores and electronics stores have begun markdowns, and other companies, like Barnes & Noble, will take 5 percent off if you preorder. Check the cashback page at Bing to shop sales and find online coupons. Step 2: Make a Gift List . Be a proactive shopper, not a reactive shopper. ""Start a list of the people's names you have to buy for, and write down a gift idea or at least a store that represents them,"" Joe says. That way, when you do start shopping—online or at the mall—you'll be thinking of the person first, not the gift. For inspiration, you can look to O editors' picks, find presents grouped by personality on Gifts.com, check your friends' wish lists on Amazon.com, or get the whole family on Giftag.com to easily make and share lists. Oprah.com: Oprah's favorite things 2011 . Step 3: Know Your Limits . Ask yourself, ""What is my budget for the holidays?"" Then break the total down by person. Financial expert Suze Orman recommends taking a serious look at your finances to come up with that number: How much is your mortgage or rent? Do you have credit card or student loan debt? If you figure out your monthly expenses and compare that with your income, you'll have a better idea of what you can afford this holiday season. Another tip is to narrow your list to as few stores as possible, says Donna Smallin, author of The One-Minute Organizer Plain and Simple. ""If I'm shopping online, I'll get toys in one place, because the shipping will cost less,"" she says. ""Also, if you charge all holiday purchases to one credit card, you'll have a convenient record of exactly how much you spent."" One often overlooked shopping expense is transportation. ""Carpool with a friend or a relative, make a day of it,"" Jesse says. ""It's better to have someone to bounce ideas off, and you'll get it done together. "" Step 4: Comparison Shop Like a Demon . ""Go online and search for gift ideas before you hit the pavement,"" Jesse says. You'll get an idea of what's easier (and cheaper) to buy online and know what you can only get at a store. ""The beauty of shopping early is being able to compare,"" says Jesse, who found a gift for a $100 less than the store next door. Try PriceGrabber.com, BizRate.com and DealHack.com to compare online. Oprah.com: 18 drugstore gifts for everyone on your list . Step 5: Go in the Morning, Late Night, or Early in the Week . ""People forget stores hours are extended. You definitely want to go as late as possible or as early as possible,"" Joe says. ""Mondays are great shopping—they're typically quieter."" Do not attempt to shop on Black Friday. In 2003, at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, every one of the more than 12,500 parking spaces was filled by 2 p.m. We say stop the madness and stay home. Step 6: Enlist the Professionals . ""Make relationships with salespeople,"" Jesse says. ""They'll keep an eye out for you. Some will even do presale—meaning if an item is scheduled to go on sale later in the month, they'll ring it up at that price."" Then when you're at the store or in the mall, be direct. ""They're there to help you,"" Jesse says. ""Tell them how much you want to spend—you have to bottom line it for them."" If they're a good salesperson, he says, they'll be up to the challenge. Oprah.com: 22 (new!) ways to get a great deal on anything . Step 7: Channel Your Inner Negotiator . If you're not shopping at a major retailer or chain store, don't underestimate the art of bargaining. When a salesperson gives you a price, your next move is to ask, ""Is that the best you can do?"" You might then counter with ""And if I pay cash?"" With these two little sentences, one O editor managed to get $200 off an antique mirror in a wrought iron frame and $150 off a pair of delicate, gold Victorian earrings. You'll likely have the most success at independent jewelry stores and electronics stores and flea markets. Step 8: Schedule a Get Ready Day . The best way to avoid 67 trips to the post office, 7-Eleven, and CVS is a Get Ready Day. Purchase postage stamps, wrapping paper, tape, and ribbon; pick up prescriptions and cold remedies; stock up on pantry staples and refreshments. If you'll be mailing presents, either start collecting boxes now or split a bulk order with friends from the huge selection of decorative shipping materials found at USBox.com. ""It's a good idea to use web sites that will wrap and ship for you,"" says Joe, ""especially if you're traveling—you don't want to have to check bags. Make sure to send it out early and use UPS ground [to save money]."" Oprah.com: 16 ways to make an incredible impact with less than $15 . Step 9: Remember the ""Magic Factor"" Whether it's a Starbucks card or a cashmere sweater, the way it's packaged or wrapped counts. ""Now, more than ever, it's about being smart and being creative,"" Jesse says. Put a small trinket in a big box with a beautiful bow, and it will be more fun to open up. Joe and Jesse's other piece of advice is to think about what stresses out a friend or family member, and pick something that relieves that anxiety.

"(CNN) -- One of the prosecutors in the Casey Anthony trial said Wednesday there could be perjury charges against Casey's mother, Cindy Anthony. Cindy Anthony testified that she was responsible for Internet searches on the family's home computer for information about chloroform. But records indicated she was at work at the time. Prosecutors had alleged that Casey Anthony, 25, killed her daughter, Caylee, in 2008 by rendering her unconscious with chloroform, putting duct tape over her nose and mouth so she would suffocate, or a combination of the two acts. Asked by NBC's ""Today Show"" whether legal action will be taken against Cindy Anthony for allegedly perjuring herself on the witness stand, Jeff Ashton responded, ""I think there could be. That will be a decision made by another branch of our office."" Ashton himself is leaving his post, proceeding with a retirement that he had delayed to take on the Casey Anthony case. The trial ended Tuesday with Casey Anthony acquitted of murder, manslaughter, and child abuse in the death of her daughter. She was convicted of lying to police, a misdemeanor that usually results in no jail time. Asked by NBC whether he would pursue Cindy Anthony for perjury if he were staying, Ashton responded, ""I honestly don't know. That would be a very, very difficult decision to make. As a prosecutor -- I've been a prosecutor for 30 years -- I hate to say this, but you're somewhat accustomed to family members trying to help their fellow family members. So you're kind of used to that. ""This, of course, was a rather important, you know, deception, if you will, that obviously was proven to be so by the other evidence. What they do with it is going to be a difficult decision that I'm glad I don't have to make."" Ashton was on HLN's ""Dr. Drew"" Wednesday evening at 9 p.m. ET. Holly Hughes, a criminal defense attorney analyzing the Casey Anthony trial for CNN, said she believes ""they've got enough evidence to prove"" perjury, but ""from a personal, human standpoint, I don't think we're going to see it happen. ""Remember, no matter what we think of Cindy Anthony, she is a victim here. She is a grieving grandmother. ... So we know that she truly truly loved that little girl and misses her. And, at this point, all she was trying to do was save her daughter's life and it worked. So at this point I think any prosecution is going to look like sour grapes.""

"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- The woman in the photograph's face is almost entirely covered by an ornate mask-like piece of traditional Saudi jewelry. Almost like a niqab, it leaves only her eyes showing. Perhaps surprisingly, she is also wearing an industrial hard hat and safety jacket, and the photo is called ""I Am A Petroleum Engineer."" It is one of a series by the Saudi artist Manal Al-Dowayan commenting on the jobs that Saudi women do. ""We have this debate in Saudi about women's employment, and some people say women should only work in jobs that 'suit their nature,'"" said Al-Dowayan. ""It's a completely irrational discussion because who decides what suits their nature? I started photographing amazing women working in all kinds of jobs to show that the argument is invalid."" Other photos in the ""I Am"" series feature a Saudi woman doctor, computer engineer, TV producer, scuba diver, architect and interior decorator, all in similar poses with their faces partly covered. Al-Dowayan challenges Saudi customs in other works too. For ""Esmi (My Name),"" she asked hundreds of women to write their names on wooden balls, which she strung from the ceiling. It was her way of breaking taboo that prevents men from saying the names of women in their lives. Despite the controversial nature of her work, Al-Dowayan says she has had very little negative reaction at home. ""Whenever I do a work, people around me and my galleries get very worried, but in reality there's incredible room for dialogue in Saudi Arabia. ""These are issues that have been discussed many times, and I'm just bringing them into contemporary art,"" she said. Al-Dowayan is one of 17 Saudi artists featured in the Edge of Arabia exhibition, which this year was shown in Jeddah for the first time after appearing in cities around the world since 2008. It is the first major contemporary art exhibition ever shown in Saudi Arabia. ""Saudi art is absolutely booming,"" she said. Many artists are gently pushing at boundaries and limits of expression in the socially conservative country. At Edge of Arabia, Ahmed Angawi built a giant ball from 3,600 microphones. He wants to place the microphones out on the streets of Jeddah, his home city, for a year to collect people's random thoughts. ""In my mind, I was thinking, if I gave a microphone to Jeddah, what would Jeddah say?"" he said. ""What would it express?"" ""You need to talk and engage to get people involved to evolve as a society. People are afraid of talk. Much more, we should be afraid of silence."" But, he says, freer expression in Saudi will come as part of a gradual change. ""I firmly believe in change. But I firmly believe (in) change with an essence. You want it to be very natural. Sometimes fast change will affect people wrongly in the region."" The Edge of Arabia show came under the banner We Need to Talk, and was aimed at encouraging dialogue between artists and the community. ""Our aim is to deliver a message,"" said curator Mohammed Hafiz, 36. ""We want to let the world know what Saudi Arabia is all about, through the eyes of its artists. We know that we have a voice that we want people to listen to. We have thoughts and experiences to share."" Beyond Edge of Arabia, there are signs that the art scene is on the up and not afraid to say what it thinks. More on Inside the Middle East: Gaza music students find smart ways around travel ban . Alaa Balkhy, a 23-year-old designer running a business called Fyunka, selling bags, T-shirts and notebooks, believes that Saudis are finally becoming proud of their own arts and culture. ""People are starting to appreciate each other within Saudi society and the art scene,"" she said. ""If you see something made in Saudi people relate to it now. ""It's very new. It's growing and it's amazing how fast it's growing. ""We are trying to put a positive Saudi on the map. We really want to change the stereotype, and step by step we are doing it."" Balkhy's first design was a bag called ""Daddy I want a Birkin,"" an ironic nod to Saudi's love of shopping for luxury goods, such as the expensive Hermes Birkin bag. Her designs are now sold through an online boutique in London, as well as in nine Gulf countries. She said: ""People are pushing the limits, but doing it step-by-step so people don't get a big shock at once. ""We don't have much freedom of expression or freedom of speech, but it's amazing how people are saying what they want to say through social media and blogs, whether it's a video, a YouTube show, an article, a design piece or an artwork. ""People will always find a way to express themselves. It's human nature to want to say what's on your mind. ""If people can't express themselves directly, they will do it indirectly."" More on Inside the Middle East: My Syria, by 'greatest living' Arab poet . In addition to the limits to expression, Balkhy faces practical restrictions through the ban on women driving and the guardianship laws, which means she must get permission from her father to travel and for many other daily activities. ""There are a lot of challenges to running a business when you are a girl in Saudi,"" she said. ""I imagine it would be easier if I could drive, but I'm proud that I've achieved so much without. ""My dad gives me all the permission to travel I need, but it saddens me that some girls have so much potential to creating something, but their families and society are so limiting. ""I'm 23 and my little brother is 18, but in Saudi he is a grownup and I'm not.""","Edge of Arabia show in Saudi Arabia for the first time after three years touring the world .

"Washington (CNN) -- Obamacare -- the law that refuses to die -- is suddenly under attack again. Republicans will take full control of Congress in January and repealing Obamacare will almost certainly be one of their first priorities. The GOP is seizing on leaked tapes in which MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, an architect of the law, said the ""stupidity of the American voter"" and a ""lack of transparency"" were vital to its passage in 2010. And, perhaps most importantly, the Supreme Court is poised to rule on subsidies that are central to the law. ""We have to take it very seriously. It is hard to predict how the Court will ultimately decide,"" said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group that campaigns to sustain Obamacare. It's a surprising turn of events for an issue that had seemed to move to the back burner in recent months. The law has already survived one key Supreme Court challenge and millions are now insured because of the legislation. And the issue, which was expected to dominate this year's elections, took a back seat to fears about Ebola and ISIS. The next round of open enrollment for Obamacare begins Saturday. The Supreme Court poses the gravest threat after agreeing to hear a challenge to the crucial tax credits that subsidize health coverage purchased on federal exchanges. In what amounts to a tussle over language, the suit contends that the law permits subsidies to be dispersed only through state exchanges. But 35 states rely on federal exchanges to market health insurance — in many cases because Republican governors who oppose Obamacare refused to set up marketplaces. To reach consumers in those states, the federal government offers a market place and subsidies. But if the Court rules next year that those federal subsidies are illegal, it could throw the entire health care system into chaos, threaten millions of health plans and send the entire law into a ""death spiral."" Chief Justice John Roberts, who outraged conservatives by saving Obamacare from a previous Supreme Court challenge in 2012, may again be the crucial swing vote. But there is a chance that even an adverse ruling would not end Obamacare's life. Harvard Law Professor Einer Elhauge says some states, to protect themselves against possible health care chaos, might finally decide to set up their own arrangements or partner with the federal exchange. ""The prospect of that disruption is sufficiently problematic that I would not be surprised to see a lot of states adopt exchanges,"" said Elhauge, who authored a book on the original Obamacare Supreme Court case. Obamacare also faces a political assault from resurgent Republicans devoted to the mantra : ""repeal and replace."" Because so many party candidates vowed to eliminate the law during their election campaigns, Republican leaders in the House and the Senate are under pressure to schedule votes to do just that. But the votes will be largely symbolic. Though they captured the Senate, Republicans are still short of the 60 votes needed to overcome Democratic filibusters. And even if they did put a repeal bill on the President's desk, there is zero chance he would sign it and destroy his own proudest political achievement. So, as a fallback plan, opponents of Obamacare will likely try to tear it down bit by bit, possibly by attaching bills amending it to must-pass legislation. Plans are piling up. Paul Ryan and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are teaming up to produce a plan to ""deliver quality affordable health care coverage to American families,"" a spokesman for the Wisconsin lawmaker told CNN. Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch has a market based health care plan he wrote with Sens Richard Burr and Tom Coburn. ""Conservatives should ... take advantage of opportunities to repeal any part of the law and replace it with better policies that empower Americans, not Washington,"" Hatch wrote in USA Today on Wednesday. Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon and health policy expert, warns GOP hopes of repealing Obamacare are not realistic until there is a Republican in the White House but told WPBI radio last month conservatives should ""systematically strip away the worst parts of Obamacare."" But some conservatives want a more radical approach, and recommend repealing Obamacare by using the budget tool reconciliation, which requires only 51 votes — and, ironically, was used to pass the law in 2010. But again, Obama would be ready with this veto pen. Some adjustments to the law could draw some Democratic support. They could include a repeal of the delayed employer mandate requiring large firms to provide health care and changes to rules requiring companies to provide insurance to employees that work more than 30 hours a week. Some Democratic senators from red states are eying a repeal of the tax on medical devices , which raises $29 billion over the next decade to finance the cost of insuring more Americans. But conservatives might be end up frustrated because none of the fixes that have a chance of becoming law will seriously undermine Obamacare as a whole. ""The parts you could chip away out probably are not going to destabilize the legislation. It gets through with a few bits knocked off — but it is still there,"" said Stuart Butler, a health care expert and senior Brookings Institution fellow. Republican lawmakers determined to kill Obamacare may also find themselves under pressure from the corporate health firms which have spent millions of dollars adapting to the new law are are worried about more disruption. But Obamacare's capacity to ignite controversy is undimmed. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell couldn't keep a smile off his face on Thursday when discussing the leaked Gruber tape. ""What this insider is saying confirms that they were spinning tales from the beginning — that they did not tell the truth about ObamaCare,"" McConnell said. House Speaker John Boehner's office said Gruber's comments proved Obamacare was rammed through Congress with ""arrogance, duplicity and contempt for the will of the American people."" A test also awaits on Saturday with the debut of the second open enrollment period for Obamcare, with advocates desperate to avoid website and other teething problems of last year. The White House is backing efforts, which include mobile apps and targeted social media advertising, to recruit more ""young and invincibles"" — people who are least likely to sign up for coverage but who are needed to offset older, sicker patients to make the system work. The number of sign-ups in the three month enrollment period are likely to play an important role in the political debate going forward. Federal officials last week projected that between nine and 9.9 million people would be signed up to Obamacare in 2015, lower than the 13 million number previously projected by the Congressional Budget Office.","New challenges have arrived for President Barack Obama's top domestic achievement .

"Indian Trail, North Carolina (CNN) -- At every corner and every stoplight in this town some 15 miles southeast of Charlotte, the signs staked in the ground have one message: ""Homes ready now."" Brandon Oaks, Taylor Glenn, Shiloh Trace -- each subdivision off Wesley Chapel Road has new homes or ready-to-build plans, priced from the $180,000s to the $300,000s. Construction and for-sale signs are part of the scenery. Everybody here is new to North Carolina census tract 203.17, one of the fastest-growing places in the fastest-growing county in one of the fastest-growing states. The tract is a slender strip between Orr and Potter roads, bordered for four miles on the east by Wesley Chapel Road, and power lines to the west. The Census Bureau estimates there were 499 people on this sliver of Union County in 2000. Ten years later, it counted 5,353, an increase of more than 970%. Tracts are designed for U.S. Census Bureau counts and usually contain 2,500 to 8,000 residents; one tract might cover an entire county in a rural area or a few blocks in a packed city. Tract 203.17 is new, a narrow section carved from a space that was bigger and less populated 10 years earlier. The new subdivisions in 203.17 are filled with people from Florida, New York, Michigan and nearby Charlotte. They cling to their favored traditions of home and ditch what's less convenient. Residents sip sweet tea while they wait for Brooklyn-style pizza. Few have lived here long enough to have allegiances in the Carolina versus Duke rivalry, but many pay for big TV packages that will broadcast the sports teams they grew up with. They like what this place is selling: Granite countertops, two-car garages, fresh sod, wide sidewalks and ever-higher numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms. Better still, it's got easy access to the city, mild weather, good schools and low taxes, just 14.5 cents on every $100 for most residents in 203.17. But there are questions they're all trying to answer. When do you stop being a Floridian, a New Yorker or a Michigander, and start being a North Carolinian? If we're all new here, who are we at all? U.S. Highway 74 East . North Carolina's population exploded in the last 10 years, especially around Charlotte's booming (then busting) financial industry. ""We're it,"" said James H. Johnson Jr., a professor at the University of North Carolina's Kenan Flagler Business School and director of the Kenan Institute's Urban Investment Strategies Center. ""We are the cat's demographic meow. We are a real migration magnet."" ""Gargantuan homes,"" Johnson said, are the hallmark of western Union County in the last decade, when wheat, corn and soybean fields finally yielded to subdivisions and U.S. Highway 74 traffic. Most of tract 203.17 lies within the city of Indian Trail. The town was incorporated in 1907 but was little more than a stopping point between Charlotte and the Union County seat, Monroe. ""In the late '60s, maybe early '70s, when I was kind of a kid, it was just a little pit stop,"" said Jeffrey Goodall, a Union County-raised resident of tract 203.17. ""There was a little par three golf course. It had a little train depot 50 or 100 years ago. There was nothing much."" It still has a golf course, but the city has long outgrown ""nothing much."" Indian Trail's census count jumped from 1,942 in 1990 to 33,518 in 2010. Last year, for the first time, the city's population edged out county seat's by 721 residents. Goodall, 56, returned to Union County in 2005 after retiring from a military career that moved him through 15 states. His parents had stayed in Union County, and  taxes on Goodall's home in Broward County, Florida, were uncomfortably high. Goodall and his wife settled in to the Brandon Oaks subdivision -- the heart of tract 203.17 -- and by 2007, he'd been elected to the Town Council. As the rare Carolina native in town, people look to him for history, background and explanations of this place they've all chosen. Neighbors laugh about their accents, most of them different and almost none of them a Southern drawl. Families here attend churches, or synagogues, or mosques. In the 2000 Census, 36 of the 499 people in 203.17 identified themselves as Latino, 10 as Asian and six as black. Among the 5,353 counted in 2010, there were 584 Latinos, 118 Asians and 803 blacks. Goodall said he sometimes looks around and wonders what the people here can possibly share. Everybody comes from a different place, with different values, traditions and ideas about the best way to live. But then, there's a reason everybody found this place. ""No matter how different I think I may be,"" Goodall said, ""everybody's got something in common: They moved here."" Wesley Chapel Road . On a sunny Saturday afternoon, just inside a subdivision entrance off Wesley Chapel Road, the sidewalks are strewn with bikes and strollers. Cars are constantly pulling over to trade 50 cents for a plastic cup of lemonade. The neighbors laugh at the ice cream truck playing Christmas tunes. Parents here all seem to remember childhoods when dozens of kids ruled tidy suburban streets. Moms and dad say these new sidewalks look more like their memories than the aged or empty ones they left behind. Several said they've convinced their parents, brothers, sisters and friends to move down to Indian Trail, some of them close enough to be in the same census tract. It'll never be Long Island, but when your mom moves down the street and the bagel shop opens for business, you can start to convince yourself that this is home. Trouble was, as neighborhoods sprung up, Indian Trail didn't keep up, Town Council members said. Residents referred to themselves not by their city or county, but by the name of their subdivision -- ""I'm from Brandon Oaks,"" or ""We live in Sheridan."" A couple of years ago, sensing that people didn't identify with the place as a whole, they paid a company to create a logo and motto for the city: ""Crossing Paths."" Next, they tried to build places where people really could get together beyond school gyms and grocery store aisles. ""People are moving here now and they're saying 'Where are the restaurants? Where's the entertainment? Where's the parks, the services?'"" said Indian Trail Town Manager Joe Fivas, who moved to Indian Trail from Michigan. He's got the delicate task of deciding what this population of thousands should handle for itself, what it should contract out, and how to pay for it. That means they're inventing public works in the city, but still paying for outside police protection. Existing services are stretched to the limit -- but they'd happily make room to build a few clothing stores or a Chili's. In 2010, Union County residents voted to start allowing alcohol sales, and Indian Trail just opened its first package store. To nobody's surprise, but some people's disappointment, business is great. Several new residents said they like the new grocery stores and the new Bojangles, but a family-friendly, sit-down bar and restaurant would be a huge get. Till then, the town has its new amphitheater and community space, Crossing Paths Park. They organized the first concert there, and swiftly experienced their first rainout. But people came back the next week for a bluegrass-themed evening. Kids ran around with temporary tattoos that read ""I (heart) IT."" It felt like something big had happened. ""People were really longing for a sense of identity. It was a large town, but there wasn't anything that that said 'Indian Trail,' "" said Gary D'Onofrio, a Town Council member who moved from Long Island to a subdivision inside tract 203.17. ""You can't always identify exactly what it is, but you know it when you see it, 'This is home.' "" Potter Road . Farther down Wesley Chapel Road, the area stops looking like a community-wide open house. There are a few new houses, but more with peeling paint, crumbling foundations and tangled front-yard gardens. In the farthest reaches of tract 203.17, mostly outside the Indian Trail city limits, there are no official logos or branded street names. Susie McCoy and her husband, Kenneth, first moved to their 5-acre lot on Potter Road more than 30 years ago. Since then, they've had their own kids, adopted more kids, added grandkids, a couple dozen goats, miniature horses, pet pigs and a three-legged toy dog. She likes having a Chick-fil-A and entertainment a little closer to home. With more money flowing into the county, she believes the school system only gets better, and in a more diverse class, the kids are introduced to more points of view. But there's much to miss about the old, less cluttered 203.17: . An even quicker commute to work in Charlotte, on roads empty of traffic and noise. The neighborly belief that a pig roast is a party, not a fire hazard. Kids that can toddle around without shirts or shoes. Horses and chickens grazing and pecking wherever they please, without fear of becoming a petting zoo. Skinny-dipping in the pond across the road. Green fields, green grass, green trees. First-name greetings at the store. Knowledge of who needs a prayer and who can offer one up. While others were finding themselves here, she felt like she was losing herself. ""I'm no longer a person,"" McCoy said. ""I'm just a number on the road."" But home is wherever her children are, all of 'em, the ones she birthed and the ones she took in when their first homes failed them. It's wherever her husband can Dr. Dolittle all the sick and broken animals that find their way to their yard. ""Inside's home,"" she said. ""Outside's not."" She's already got another place picked out, miles away from 203.17. It's just across the South Carolina state line, on 15 undisturbed acres on a dead-end road. Like all her new neighbors, she thinks maybe she can build a new home some place else. Curt Merrill contributed to this report.","North Carolina census tract 203.17 grew 970% in 10 years .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius prosecutor Gerrie Nel wants the South African track star sent for independent psychiatric evaluation, he said Monday, in a move that could delay the athlete's murder trial for a month or more. A psychiatrist testified Monday that Pistorius has an anxiety disorder stemming from his double amputation as an infant and his unstable parents. He's depressed now and feeling guilt from having killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, defense witness Dr. Meryl Vorster said on the stand. Nel responded by comparing the athlete's mental state to post-traumatic stress disorder and saying the law required psychiatric observation. The prosecutor's extremely unusual move is essentially an effort to maneuver the court into considering an insanity or ""capacity"" defense even though the athlete's legal team is not mounting one, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. Phelps, a criminologist and law lecturer at the University of Cape Town, said she had never seen this done before. Pistorius' lead defense lawyer, Barry Roux, is fighting back, saying Nel is oversimplifying the law. The question was left unresolved when court adjourned for the day. Nel is due to submit his application on Tuesday after both sides have finished questioning Vorster. The psychiatrist took the stand Monday morning for the defense, going all the way back to when the disabled sprinter was 11 months old. Pistorius would have experienced the amputation of both of his legs below the knee at that time as a ""traumatic assault"" because he was too young to speak or understand what was happening to him, she said in court. His parents then put pressure on him to appear normal, and his mother abused alcohol at times after she and Pistorius' father divorced, she said. She raised him and his siblings ""to see their external environment as threatening"" and ""added to the anxiety,"" Vorster said. Pistorius earlier testified that ""Everything I learnt in life, I learned from her."" Reasonable? The defense is trying to show that Pistorius made a genuine and reasonable mistake and responded reasonably on the night he killed Steenkamp, 29, a model and law school graduate. Pistorius, 27, admits that he fired four bullets through a closed door in his house, killing Steenkamp, but says he thought he was protecting himself from a burglar. Whether the judge believes he acted reasonably could mean the difference between a verdict of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, and an acquittal, according to Phelps. If Pistorius is convicted of murder, he faces at least 15 years in prison, and possibly life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at the discretion of Judge Thokozile Masipa. Vorster said the athlete's general anxiety disorder meant he felt that his safety was threatened even when objectively it was not, she said. And she said he was ""devastated that he killed his girlfriend."" Steenkamp's mother, who has been in court for most of the trial, was not there Monday to hear the evaluation. Fight or flight . Vorster also addressed the question of why Pistorius took his gun and went toward the sound of what the thought was danger rather than trying to get away. Because of his disability, she said, when he faces a fight-or-flight situation, he cannot flee, so his instinct is to fight. Nel then pressed the psychiatrist on whether Pistorius was mentally ill and whether he could distinguish right from wrong. She said he could. Many people have general anxiety disorder, and it does not imply that one has lost touch with reality, she said. The psychiatrist took the stand on day 30 of a high-profile trial that has gripped South Africa and much of the world. She could be the last witness. Roux said last week that he expected to wrap up his case Tuesday. New psychiatric evaluation could push the end of the trial a month or more away. When the defense is done presenting its evidence, both sides will make closing arguments, and then Masipa will retire to consider her verdict. South Africa does not have jury trials, but she is being assisted by two experts called assessors. Nel has fought aggressively to show that Pistorius argued with Steenkamp before killing her. The trial has seen Pistorius break down repeatedly, crying, wailing and sometimes throwing up as the court sees and hears evidence about Steenkamp's death. Vortser said the athlete's physical distress was real. He listened with his head lowered as the psychiatrist testified Monday. Earlier evidence has included graphic photos of the wounds; testimony from neighbors, friends, police and pathologists; and the actual door through which Pistorius fired four hollow-tipped bullets on the fateful night. Argument or error? There is no dispute that Pistorius shot and killed Steenkamp in his home early on the morning of Valentine's Day 2013. Nel tore into Pistorius over five days in court in April, saying the Paralympic medalist had argued with Steenkamp and killed her on purpose. He tried to force Pistorius to look at a picture of Steenkamp's head after the shooting, accused Pistorius of being selfish and possessive, and said he refused to take responsibility for his actions. The defense team is seeking to cast doubt on the state's case and needs only to show there is a reasonable doubt that Pistorius meant to kill Steenkamp. Masipa must decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a terrible mistake or whether he murdered Steenkamp intentionally. Live blog: Pistorius on trial . Pistorius is arguably the world's most famous disabled athlete, known as the ""Blade Runner"" for the carbon-fiber blades he runs on.

"Washington (CNN) -- More airports around the United States will soon allow passengers to go through security without removing their shoes, light jackets, and belts. The Transportation Security Administration is expanding its expedited screening program called PreCheck to 60 new airports by the end of the year and is increasing the number of lanes for the program at the 40 airports that currently offer it. PreCheck passengers also can leave laptops and small liquids in their carry-on luggage. Right now only very frequent fliers invited by their airlines and passengers who are members of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's trusted traveler programs can participate. TSA says later this year it will launch an application process to allow passengers who want to join PreCheck to pay $85, verify their identity and provide fingerprints at an enrollment center. Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways and Virgin America currently participate in the program. JetBlue and Southwest will begin taking part when they are ""operationally ready,"" according to the TSA. PreCheck is part of a larger effort by TSA to move to security based more on risks that certain passengers may pose. ""As TSA continues to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to transportation security, we are looking for more opportunities to provide the most effective security in the most efficient way possible,"" TSA Administrator John Pistole said in the news release announcing the expansion. To see the list of participating airports, go here.","The TSA will allow pre-screening at 60 more airports, expand it at 40 current airports .

"(CNN) -- When is a touchscreen not a touchscreen? Increasingly, it's when your smartphone reads your eyes, gestures and movements to perform basic functions without tapping the screen at all. That was Samsung's point Thursday with the rollout of the new Galaxy S IV, the latest from the company's flagship line and the first Android-based phone to seriously challenge Apple's iPhone for dominance in the mobile market. The phone will be available on all major U.S. carriers by the end of April. From reading to Web surfing to answering calls, the new handset will give users the ability to use the phone sometimes without even needing to hold it. Consumer Reports, after a hands-on with the device, declared that while it ""falls short of being revolutionary, it brims with clever capabilities."" Chief among those capabilities, the iconic product reviewers said, are its touch-free features. ""You can do a lot with the Galaxy S 4 without ever touching it,"" wrote Mike Gikas, who demoed the device. ""The only other phones that can do this are Samsung's jumbo-screen Galaxy Notes, but those require you use an S Pen Stylus, which the S4 does not have."" The non-touch feature that probably will get the most use is Air View, which lets you simply hover a finger (or, we suppose, any alternate body part) over the camera sensor to get a larger pop-up. It works with e-mail, photos and videos, calendars and the Galaxy's backed-in version of Flipboard, the news-aggregator app. This is similar to what users of the Galaxy Note can already do, but it doesn't require the S-Pen stylus. Layered on top of that is Air Gesture. Users don't even have to be holding their phone to use this. Simply swipe a finger through the air sideways and you can toggle from screen to screen, or up and down to scroll through something you're reading. Air gestures also can be used to answer a phone call. Again, all of these movements are tracked by the phone's front-facing camera. Smart Pause is an advance on a feature already available on the Galaxy S III. It was rumored that the new phone would read eye movements, but instead it's the user's head that triggers this feature. It's designed to tell when you're actually looking at your screen, keeping its sleep mode from kicking in when you are and shutting down to save battery life when you're not. Now, Smart Pause also will pause a video if you look away. ""When (you're) watching a video and suddenly someone calls you and you get distracted, the video automatically stops without pressing a thing,"" Lee Young Hee, executive vice president at Samsung Mobile, said at Thursday's event. Smart Scroll builds on that feature. While you're looking at the screen, you can tilt the phone backward or forward to scroll up and down. ""While the ability to scroll by tilting a phone is a feature we've seen on some earlier Android models, its automated activation is new,"" wrote Gikas of Consumer Reports. ""I found this capability worked better than I thought it might, engaging quickly whenever I stared at the screen."" And there's good news for owners of the Galaxy S III. Samsung vice president Nick DiCarlo told PC Magazine that they'll be getting some of the IV's software upgrades. ""Anything that we can do that's not dependent on hardware like infrared, we'll definitely bring to all the flagship devices,"" he said. The question, of course, is whether users, even those excited about the phone and its new hardware and software, will actually use the gesture controls. Nilay Patel, managing editor of tech blog The Verge, told CNN that he suspects the S IV's camera upgrades will be more significant. ""It feels very gimmicky,"" he said of the hands-free features. ""The tricks about tracking your eyes and waving at the screen, I don't think anybody's really asking for that stuff."" What do you think about the new Galaxy phone's features? Let us know in the comments.","Samsung's Galaxy S IV comes with a spate of no-touch features .

"(CNN) -- Portuguese football legend Eusebio is in a stable condition after being admitted to hospital with bronchial pneumonia on Wednesday, his former club Benfica reported. The 69-year-old, known affectionately as the ""Black Panther"" and one of the most talented players of his generation, is being kept at the Hospital da Luz in Lisbon as the illness has affected both lungs. ""He spent the night as well, and he is stable. From the clinical point of view (his condition) is stationary,"" the hospital's medical director Jose Roquette told reporters in quotes carried by Benfica's website. ""There was no significant improvement in inflammatory parameters, analytical or radiological findings. So we continue with appropriate therapy and we hope this is resolved quickly."" Roquette said Eusebio, who was the top scorer at the 1966 World Cup when Portugal finished third, would likely remain in hospital over the festive period after coming out of intensive care. ""This is not a situation that one can guarantee how long will it take to evolution, but admit it will take some time. We will give more information in due course. Most likely it will extend beyond Christmas, ""he said. Roquette said Eusebio's wife and daughters had come to the hospital, but other visitors had been restricted. In 2007, he had surgery to unblock arteries which carry blood to the brain. Eusebio played for three North American Soccer League teams in the twilight of his career, but is best known for his exploits in 15 years at Benfica where he scored 638 goals in 614 appearances up until 1975. ""We wish a speedy recovery to Eusebio and also to express that the whole Portuguese football family is behind him,"" the Portuguese Football Federation said in a statement. ""Eusebio is a symbol of Portuguese football. It will take a lot of strength to overcome this difficulty, but he has honored Portugal for many years with his distinguished presence, including as ambassador of the national team."" Born in Mozambique, which was then a Portuguese territory, he scored 41 goals in 64 appearances for his adopted country. At the 1966 World Cup he scored two goals as Portugal eliminated defending champions Brazil at the group stage, then netted four times in an incredible quarterfinal comeback against North Korea as his side rallied from 3-0 down to win 5-3 in one of the tournament's most famous matches. Eusebio scored again in the semifinal against England, but the hosts won 2-1 before beating Germany in the final.","Eusebio in intensive care after being admitted to Lisbon hospital with pneumonia .

"(CNN) -- A group of fans who support Russian soccer giant Zenit St Petersburg has unveiled a manifesto urging the club not to sign black players. The Landscrona group posted the ""Selection 12 manifesto"" on its website Monday, prompting the club to issue its own statement to CNN emphasizing its policy of diversity and tolerance. Zenit spent a reported $103 million on black players Hulk, from Brazil, and Belgium international Axel Witsel in September. The Brazilian striker's arrival has caused problems within the squad, with Zenit captain Igor Denisov dropped to the reserve team after complaining about Hulk's arrival and the wages he commands. Racism row shines light on Serbian football . In a detailed letter on its website, Landscrona stated their opposition to Zenit signing any players who are black or gay. ""We're not racists but we see the absence of black players at Zenit as an important tradition."" the letter said. ""We are against representatives of sexual minorities playing for Zenit. ""For us it is crucial (Zenit) has retained its own identity, and not turned into an average European team, with a standard set of foreign players. ""We only want players from other brotherly Slav nations, such as Ukraine and Belarus as well as from the Baltic states and Scandinavia. We have the same mentality and historical and cultural background as these nations. ""Any other continents except Europe, should not be a priority for (Zenit). This does not mean that it is a taboo. But flying to Latin America only makes sense if we honestly and professionally tried everything possible to find a player in the region, Russia and Europe."" Russian soccer has been troubled by incidents of racism in recent years, with former Brazil player Roberto Carlos being abused while playing for Anzhi Makhachkala. The defender asked to be substituted in a game in 2011 after picking up a banana that was thrown at him from the stands. The media attention given to Landscrona's letter comes as Russia continues its preparations to host the 2018 World Cup. Zenit responded with a statement, sent to CNN World Sport, stating the club does not ""support archaic values."" It read: ""FC Zenit has always been distinguished by its tolerant approach to players of various nationalities and confessions, and has always had diversity in its side. Football grapples with anti-Semitism storm . ""Furthermore, our club has millions of fans from all continents of the world. St. Petersburg is an open city which historically has united various cultures. ""Zenit invites players to the team exclusively thanks to their sporting qualities and achievements, not based on their nationality or skin color. The club's policy is aimed at development and integration into the world football community. We do not support archaic values. ""We continue to be sure that fighting all manifestations of intolerance is the only principle for development of our club, football, and sports as a whole in the world."" It is the latest racism controversy to blight European football in recent months. Italian club Lazio was fined $52,000 by UEFA following racist chanting by its supporters during the Europa League fixture with Tottenham in September. The Serbian Football Association was fined $105,000 following an Under-21 match in which opposing players from the England team said they were racially abused. Meanwhile, In the English Premier League West Ham vowed to ban for life any fans found guilty of anti-Semitic chanting during their match at Tottenham in November.","Fan group states opposition to Russian club Zenit St Petersburg signing black players .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic has plenty of reasons to feel on top of the world -- but one more victory at the ATP World Tour finals will mean he ends 2014 as the leading ranked player on the planet. The current World No.1 cruised past Stan Wawrinka in straight sets in his latest group match on Wednesday to secure his second successive victory at London's O2 Arena and take his astonishing indoor record to 29 matches without defeat. Djokovic, who got married and became a father for the first time earlier this year, lost his serve in the opening game of the contest before roaring back to claim victory with the style and panache with which his admirers have become so accustomed. ""It was a great match, no question,"" Djokovic said in his post-match interview. ""The opening three games were quite long but after that I managed to get back in the first set. I swung through my shots and he made a lot of unforced errors. He wasn't close to his best and I succeeded very well with what I wanted to do."" Not once has a singles tie at this year's tournament made it to three sets and this never looked likely to become the first. This 6-3 6-0 triumph in just over an hour meant the crowd was treated to yet another one man show. And yet, Wawrinka could scarcely have made a better start to the contest, breaking his opponent in the opening game and consolidating by serving to take the second. But from there on it was all Djokovic as the Serb star reeled off 17 of the next 18 points. In fact, Wawrinka only managed to win another four points in the opening set and just the seven in the second. The seven-time grand slam winner is hoping to win his third consecutive title in London and it would take some showing to stop him. Djokovic has won 59 of his 68 matches this calendar year and is 17-5 against the world's top 10 players. He can seal the end of year No.1 spot when he faces Tomas Berdych in his final group game on Friday. Berdych bounces back . In the day's other game, Berdych cruised to a 6-3 6-1 victory over U.S Open champion Marin Cilic. Berdych, who was beaten in his opening match by Wawrinka, required just 74 minutes to see off a disappointing Cilic. The Czech could yet qualify for the semifinals with victory over Djokovic in his final group game. ""I think today was more about fighting and getting through it,"" Berdych said. ""It's not my first year. I have the experience of losing the first match in the past and I know how to come back. I think that was the biggest difference. ""I just want to try to bring my best tennis and we'll see what happens. I hope I can have a great match."" Cilic has endured a difficult time at the finals having lost both of his matches in straight sets. The 26-year-old, who has won just six games in his two matches, made 30 unforced errors during Wednesday's defeat. ""It's disappointing to play like this. I was not expecting it. But my body feels a little bit tired on the court,"" Cilic told reporters. ""Especially with these guys at this kind of level, even small mistakes, or if you're not at your best, the outcome is not going to be going in your favor."" Thursday's action sees Roger Federer take on Andy Murray, while Kei Nishikori will be hoping for a second victory at this year's tournament when he faces Milos Raonic.","Novak Djokovic defeats Stan Wawrinka in straight sets .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the enclaves of Richmond, Virginia, the political and ideological dividing line is a highway. On one side of Interstate 195 is Windsor Farms, a wealthy community designed to look like an English village. It is home to a historic country club and its residents are 75% Republican, according to an analysis by the Cook Political Report. On the other side of the highway is Carytown, a community that prides itself on its urban chic shops and restaurants. It held a craft beer festival this past weekend and its residents are 75% Democrat. ""Clearly one side of the city of Richmond is very old money and conservative and on the other side of the street, it's a very progressive college community,"" said David Wasserman, U.S. House editor for the Cook Political Report. ""This is a fairly recent development. We've never seen this type of polarization on a neighborhood level to such a degree and it's only increasing."" The growth in the number of Americans who sort themselves into communities like Windsor Farms or Carytown, consistently express either liberal or conservative views and the disappearing overlap between those two groups illustrates why the country â€” and the Congress -- is so divided, according to a new study by the Pew Research Center. ""Voters are plenty to blame for the current predicament they complain about,"" Wasserman said. ""People want to live next to others who share their political and cultural values. It makes it easier for politicians to gerrymander because voters are already presorted."" And that type of redistricting means a more hyper-partisan class of voters is more likely to send like-minded, hyper-partisan lawmakers to Washington to represent them, political analysts said. It's your fault: How our 'tribes' help create gridlock in Congress . The Pew report found that increasingly, the most politically active and engaged Americans are opting to live in ""ideological silos,"" communities peopled with like-minded individuals who passionately hold on to partisan views and eschew those whose opinions differ. Among the report's findings: . Why does this matter? Because, as the report points out, over the past 20 years, ""partisan animosity has increased substantially"" â€” more than doubling, in fact. The most politically engaged Americans are most likely to see only the rightness of their own positions and view the opposing sides ideas as ""so misguided that they threaten the nation's well-being."" Meanwhile, the majority of Americans, those who hold more centrist views, are content to sit on the sidelines, staying out of the political fray, the Pew report found. This is a recipe for legislative gridlock, political demographers and analysts said. Lynne Cheney: Partisanship is a Madisonian principle . Think of it as a ripple effect, Bill Bishop, co-author of ""The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America is Tearing Us Apart,"" told CNN last year. ""Like-minded groups, over time, become more extreme in how they're like-minded,"" he said. This means in order to be considered a ""good Democrat"" or ""good Republican"" citizens, and the lawmakers who represent them, are pressured to think and vote only in a certain, partisan way, political demographers and analysts have found. And woe the person who votes against the group-think. Take for example, Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, whose 7th Congressional District includes Windsor Farms. His opponent, Dave Brat, a political newcomer and economics professor was able to use Cantor's openness to considering a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants as an example of how the veteran lawmaker was out of touch with his conservative base. Cantor lost the Republican primary on Tuesday by double digits. Down but not done: Cantor's loss not end for immigration reform . Cantor had been ""taking conservative position after conservative position after conservative position, but almost 100% wasn't enough for these folks,"" CNN political analyst John Avlon said.","Politically engaged Americans are increasingly partisan, according to a new Pew poll .
Hyper-partisanship at the local level eventually leads to hyper-partisanship in Congress, experts say .
Those who trend more moderate are also less likely to be politically-engaged, the Pew poll found .
All of these factors have create gridlock on the Congressional level, experts say ."
"(CNN) -- Brazil's national football team may have been smoked on the pitch by Germany, but now government officials are claiming a 2014 FIFA World Cup victory of another sort. According to figures released this week by Brazil's federal government, the World Cup was a triumph for the country's transportation and tourism industries. ""We lost the trophy, but Brazil won the World Cup,"" said Aloisio Mercadante, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff's chief of staff, in a statement. ""Brazil showed that they know how to win, lose, host and celebrate peace with respect and a 'make yourself at home' atmosphere that won the world over."" According to government figures, 1 million foreign tourists visited Brazil during the month-long event, far exceeding its pre-Cup projection of 600,000 visitors coming to the country from abroad. About 3 million Brazilians traveled around the country during the event, just short of the expected 3.1 million. Additionally, according to the government, of the million foreign visitors, ""95% of them said they intend to return."" ""We were saying that we would host the World Cup of World Cups,"" said President Rousseff in a statement. ""Indeed, we staged the World Cup of World Cups. ""We had one problem, our match against Germany. However ... we beat the pessimistic predictions and hosted the World Cup of World Cups with the immense and wonderful contribution of our people."" Not everyone on board . The government's assessment of the World Cup's impact on travel was significantly more enthusiastic than a report last week in the Wall Street Journal that called the event ""a bust for Brazil's domestic travel industry."" Citing figures from the Brazilian Airline Association, that story projected total air travel in Brazil falling 11% to 15% during the World Cup compared with the same period in 2013. The story blamed hiked-up prices and large crowds for scaring off domestic tourists. Economists who study the impact of large sporting and other events on local and national economies tend to be less sanguine than the governments that host them. ""Every time you get a World Cup tourist you get one less regular tourist,"" Dr. Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist and economics professor at Smith College in Massachusetts, tells CNN. ""Generally speaking, the World Cup does not benefit the host's tourism industry."" Zimbalist says it's doubtful Brazil's international tourism profile will experience long-term positive impact as a result of the World Cup. He points to heightened media coverage around the event that focused on ""unsavory conditions"" facing the country, such as violence, poverty, pollution and social unrest, as illustrated by public demonstrations against the huge amounts of public funds spent on new infrastructure. Furthermore, he said, the World Cup won't provide sustained promotion for the smaller of the event's 12 host cities. The Amazonas city of Manaus is an example. Zimbalist cited public money spent on a stadium that will eventually become underutilized. Rather than inspire coverage of the beauty of the surrounding Amazon, media reports tended to focus on the new facility and the conflict that surrounded its construction. ""It's very hard to see how that's going to promote tourism in Manaus,"" says Zimbalist. More where that came from . Turning mega-sporting events such as the World Cup and Olympics into proxy tourism campaigns remains an uncertain enterprise. Some cities continue to reap the benefits of hosting. Barcelona has seen a tenfold increase in tourist numbers since it hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics. Meanwhile, a decade after hosting the 2004 summer games, Olympic venues in Athens have become decaying ghost towns. For now, it's unlikely there will be enough time to assess the long-term economic impact of the World Cup on Brazil's economy in advance of the country's next huge event -- the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.","Germany?

Equatorial Guinea will host Africa's top football tournament between January 17 and February 18 after striking a deal to replace Morocco. CAF, the Confederation of African Football, announced the decision on Friday following Morocco's refusal to host the tournament. Morocco had cited fears over Ebola, the deadly disease sweeping across parts of Africa, as the reason to postpone the event until 2016. CAF rejected that proposition and expelled Morocco following its refusal to host the competition. It signals a remarkable turnaround in Equatorial Guinea's fortunes following the team's suspension from the competition for fielding an ineligible player earlier this year.

"(CNN) -- Two men were found guilty in Saudi courts this week for, among other offenses, messages they posted on Twitter. On Monday, one Saudi man was sentenced to 10 years in prison for using Twitter to encourage protests and undermine the country's leadership, according to Saudi Arabian state news agency SPA. ""The accused had sent invitations via Twitter to participate in protests and gatherings against the Kingdom,"" read SPA's statement, quoting Saudi Justice Ministry spokesman Fahad Al-Bakran. Al-Bakran added how the unnamed man, already serving a three-year jail sentence, was convicted of utilizing websites that are ""hostile to the government and that promote deviant ideologies."" Saudi officials often use the phrase ""deviant ideologies"" when describing al Qaeda or al Qaeda-linked groups. On Sunday, another man, accused of insulting King Abdullah and inciting protests via social media sites like Twitter, was sentenced to eight years in jail. According to SPA, he's also barred from travel and from posting messages on social media sites for eight years after his release. The man, also unidentified by SPA, was found guilty of ""inciting relatives of Saudis arrested for security reasons to protest their imprisonment by tweeting and via posting videos on sites like YouTube."" Al-Bakran added the man had been arrested once before for similar offenses, but was released after signing a pledge never to do so again. Both sentences come just days after Saudi Arabia officially declared the Muslim Brotherhood to be a terrorist organization. On Friday, the country's Interior Ministry announced that the Brotherhood, as well as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Al-Nusra Front and other groups had been formally designated terrorist organizations. American detained in UAE over parody video speaks out . The statement also detailed the country's new, comprehensive anti-terror legislation, warning any Saudi or foreigner residing in Saudi Arabia they could be sentenced to heavy jail terms for joining extremist groups or fighting alongside them. Many, however, maintain the new laws are a barely disguised effort to quash dissent, pointing to the fact that Friday's Interior Ministry statement also criminalized atheism, more specifically, any Saudi or resident of Saudi Arabia ""propagating atheist ideologies by any means, or questioning the principles of Islamic faith."" ""It's unfortunate that the statement comingles the (Saudi) government's ongoing intent to severely limit freedoms of expression and religion with its efforts to counter extremism and terrorism,"" said Dwight Bashir, deputy director for policy and research with the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom. ""It reinforces longstanding concerns that the Saudis will spare no expense to crush dissent,"" Bashir told CNN, ""and punish non-conforming views, even if the views are protected by internationally-recognized human rights."" Bashir called the move to criminalize atheism ""very troubling,"" adding it was ""consistent with the way the Saudis masquerade 'insults to religious feelings' as a way of garnering support for other laws that seek to counter religious extremism and name specific entities as terror groups."" Saudi Arabia, which has jailed several prominent reform activists in the past two years, is consistently singled out and criticized for its human rights record. In a statement from late February, Adam Coogle, a Saudi researcher for Human Rights Watch, wrote the new anti-terror legislation has ""created a veneer of legality for ongoing human rights abuses by Saudi criminal justice authorities."" ""The terrorism law,"" added Coogle, ""is a vague, catch-all document that can -- and probably will -- be used to prosecute or jail anyone who criticizes the Saudi government and to violate their due process rights along the way.""

"(CNN)  -- Sad but true: Much of what we do online, we do for vainglorious reasons. We tweet a joke not only to make others laugh, but also to watch the sweet RTs come rolling in. We post a link not just to start a discussion or expand our Facebook friends' minds, but also to rack up the comments and likes. So when someone lifts our content without credit -- even just a link or gem we found in the morass of the interwebs -- we are rightfully angered. Look, one of the Web's greatest powers is its sheer volume, the seemingly infinite library of well-argued political views, vivid picture galleries, real-time citizen journalism and ""Tron"" fan trailers. And what our social networks bring to the table are reapers and curators who help point us to the best content. Finding (or coming up with) cool or hilarious stuff and sharing it with others is a skill, one that should be appropriately lauded with that sweet ego-building nectar we call credit. We're not about to delve into the ins and outs of intellectual property law and copyright infringement and all that jazz. Nay, we're here to talk about the much milder offense of sharing content without a nod to the ahead-of-the-curve person who shined a spotlight on it in the first place. Now, this can get a bit tricky, since it's not always necessary, or even worthwhile, to give a citation. So let's review a few truths about reposting. 1. Some platforms make it effortless. On those platforms, you look especially jerkish for not giving credit. Twitter is a prime example -- the retweet function lets you share another person's quip or link with almost zero effort. So nabbing that Onion article or whatever and putting it in your feed as your own is just a bastardization of how the site's supposed to work. Forced citations are actually a big part of Tumblr's design, as founder David Karp explained last weekend at the Mashable Connect conference in Orlando, Florida. Some people decry the blog site's lack of a built-in comment function -- users wishing to add their commentary must ""reblog"" another Tumblr's post so that it shows up in their own blog, where they can add their biting remarks. The idea, Karp said, was to ask people to own up to their takes on others' work -- no anonymous flaming or trolling. 2. Viva la ""via."" Socially adept social networkers use ""via"" like mad. Just tweet or post or blog about the cool thing you stumbled upon and drop in ""via [the name or handle of the friend who shared it first, with a link to their relevant social network profile]."" A couple of exceptions: . A) If you heard about the link directly from the source, e.g. if you follow @cnntech and are excited about one of their stories, well, duh, the link itself will be giving the source proper snaps. B) If your friend gave credit to a tipster whom you don't know, no need to do serial citations (""AMAZING PUPPY VIDEO via @myfriend via @herfriend via @anotherrando."") It's a waste of space and those tertiary connections will never know. 3. Don't bother giving credit if the item is blowing up on the Web. Most recently, the share du jour was that unspeakably annoying Rebecca Black ""Friday"" video. If you posted such a thing after it'd bubbled up into a frenzy, you'd probably have eight different friends you could credit, all of whom just heard about it from someone else. Actually, if something is already reaching epic viral heights, don't add to the boring cacophony. Doing so only makes you look hopelessly out of the loop. Stand out by reposting something clever and relatively obscure. Or, you know, skip the ctrl-Ving altogether and say something original.","When someone lifts our content or reposts a gem we found without credit, we're mad .

"Washington (CNN) -- Even though there's been little change in gas prices recently, drivers could soon see changes in the look of the pumps they use to fill up. The Obama administration and the Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday they intend to phase out the rubber boots on gas pump handles now used to capture harmful gasoline vapors while refueling cars. The EPA says the vapor-capturing fuel pumps are redundant because more than 70% of all cars on the road today are equipped with on-board systems that capture the harmful vapors. According to the EPA, 31,000 affected gas stations in mostly urban areas where smog is a problem will each save $3,000 apiece once the ruling is fully implemented. ""We will remain vigilant when it comes to eliminating regulations that are not necessary or that impose unnecessary burdens on America's families and businesses,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement. Since 1994, gas stations that did not meet air quality standards have been required to use gas vapor recovery systems. The most obvious gas vapor recovery system for drivers is the rubber boot at the end of the fuel pump nozzle that fits directly over the gas tank opening. When drivers refuel, gas vapors can escape and contribute to smog and harmful air pollution. To combat the release of these vapors, most gas stations have installed special gas pump nozzles that include the rubber boot to block vapors from escaping. The EPA says the rubber fittings will be phased out as part of the new rule. The White House decision is the latest government-wide review of federal regulations. The White House said in a statement it hopes Thursday's move will save consumers and businesses almost $6 billion in the next five years. ""By streamlining some rules and eliminating others,"" said Cass Sunstein, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, ""we can save billions of dollars in unnecessary costs while continuing to protect the health and safety of the American people."" But for drivers, the decision will mean less hassle trying to get the rubber boot to fit over their gas tank opening. Motorcyclists and some recreational vehicle drivers have long complained that the environment-friendly gas nozzles were incompatible with their vehicles. Other areas highlighted in the White House's announcement include allowing states to replace traffic signs that were previously federally regulated, changing railroad regulations related to freight train travel, and changing certain regulatory reporting requirements for hospitals and doctors.","The Obama administration and the EPA intend to change the look of gas pump handles .

"Vieques, Puerto Rico (CNN)  -- Each day after work, Nanette Rosa takes her two daughters to feed their horses. It's their favorite part of the day -- a time they don't think about pain. ""It's really difficult for my mom to have two daughters with cancer,"" said 16-year-old Coral, the older daughter. ""Because sometimes she's got two of us in the hospital at the same time, and we both get sick at the same time. And sometimes she doesn't have anyone to help her, and it really affects her."" The Rosas live on Vieques, an American island off Puerto Rico. For nearly 60 years, the U.S. military used much of the island as a bombing range, dropping vast quantities of live bombs and missiles in weapons tests. Now, about three-quarters of the island's residents -- including Coral and her 14-year-old sister Inna -- are part of a lawsuit that claims the bombing range made them sick. ""There's a lot of people here dying of cancer,"" Coral said. ""I have my little cousin dying of cancer. I have my sister that has cancer. My boyfriend's mom died of cancer. His dad has cancer of the skin. A lot of people are suffering here of cancer, 'cause what they did here in Vieques."" As a toddler, Coral was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a cancer that afflicts younger children. Her mother says much of Coral's stomach and intestines had to be replaced as a result of the cancer. ""Almost everything is plastic,"" Nanette Rosa said. ""So when she eats certain foods, it produces diarrhea, which has caused dehydration. She gets sick a lot, and certain foods she cannot eat like regular people."" The operations have left Coral with a six-inch gash across her stomach, along with emotional scars. ""Sometimes I feel sad, 'cause everybody calls me 'plastic intestines,' "" she said. ""They say, 'Oh, you have a plastic belly.' And I tell them, 'You know what? If you were in this condition, how would you feel?' "" And doctors found a large tumor in Inna's mouth when she was 7. ""It was very swollen, and it looked like there was a big ball of gum in my mouth or a big lollipop,"" she said. ""I started having pain, and the only thing that would come out was blood."" Inna was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, a bone cancer. John Eaves Jr., who represents Coral, Inna and other islanders in the lawsuit against the federal government, told CNN, ""There is suffering throughout this island."" ""You cannot walk down the street on this island without counting every house and knowing two or three people on the street that have cancer, or have had cancer, or have died from cancer,"" Eaves said. ""But for me, the most disturbing thing is the number of children on this island that have terminal cancer."" Eaves, of Mississippi, has taken more than 1,300 hair samples from Vieques residents and had them tested for heavy metals. About 80 percent of the hair samples tested positive for heavy metals. Many of the results show levels of toxic elements in people that are literally off the charts -- the lines representing substances like lead, mercury, arsenic, aluminum and cadmium extend beyond the ""dangerous"" area and out of the grid entirely. ""These hair samples, I believe, are the strongest proof that the contaminants -- the things that were in the bombs, like the lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, aluminum -- are now in the people,"" Eaves said. Behind one of those charts is 7-year-old Taishmalee Ramos-Cruz, whose hair was tested when she was 2. Taishmalee's parents say she had been very sick, and they fear she may get sick again."" ""She looked like she had chemotherapy. She lost all her hair, and she had these spots on her legs,"" her father told CNN. ""She also had bad trouble using her fingers properly for a long time."" Eaves said he was not surprised to learn of the problems Taishmalee has experienced. ""Unfortunately, we have seen many children on Vieques with similar problems,"" he said. ""And she may still get sick again. We don't know if she will get cancer later."" Dr. Carmen Ortiz Roque, a Harvard-trained epidemiologist, has studied the Vieques population for years. She and other scientists have been deposed in the lawsuit. ""The human population of Vieques is by far the sickest human population that I've ever worked with,"" said Ortiz, who practices in San Juan. ""These people are very sick very early, and dying earlier. So something is happening there."" Ortiz has compiled statistics for the Vieques population that she and other scientists find alarming. ""It's astonishing,"" she said. ""They die 30 percent higher of cancer, 45 percent higher of diabetes, 95 percent higher of liver disease, and 381 percent higher of hypertension than the rest of Puerto Ricans."" Ortiz' findings are supported by and are now used by the Puerto Rico Department of Health as an indicator of health problems for the people of Vieques. She also found disturbing statistics on mercury levels in the Vieques population -- levels that are much higher than the rest of Puerto Rico. ""Twenty-seven percent of the women in Vieques have enough mercury to damage their baby's brain. That is very significant."" she said. ""This is very serious, given that mercury causes permanent damage and mental retardation in children and that the hair samples are a standard way of measuring this exposure in women in the reproductive age."" She said her sampling of children 5 and under in Vieques had ""at least six times higher levels of mercury exposure than children sampled in the United States."" Read comments on the high rate of illness on Vieques . Dr. John Wargo, a Yale University expert on the effects of toxic exposure on human health, said he believes contamination from the bombing range has caused illnesses among Vieques residents. ""The chemicals released on the island have the capacity to induce cancer, to damage the nervous system, to cause reproductive damage, mutations, genetic damage, and also to harm the immune system,"" said Wargo, who is slated to testify as an expert witness in the islanders' lawsuit. In 2003, scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded there was no link between the U.S. military activity on Vieques and the health problems suffered by the island's population. The scientists were from the CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances Disease Registry (ATSDR) division, which studies the nation's toxic superfund sites. Numerous scientists and federal lawmakers have since publicly criticized the 2003 report on Vieques. Howard Frumkin, director of the ATSDR, was grilled at a House science and technology subcommittee hearing last year over the effectiveness of the agency and its handling of the Vieques and other questionable sites. In a report released just two days before the March 12 hearing, the subcommittee found that ""time and time again ATSDR appears to avoid clearly and directly confronting the most obvious toxic culprits that harm the health of local communities throughout the nation. ""Instead, they deny, delay, minimize, trivialize or ignore legitimate concerns and health considerations of local communities and well-respected scientists and medical professionals."" And in November, a group of at least seven scientists, including Ortiz and Wargo, called on ATSDR to conduct more research on the Vieques. ATSDR later that month announced it would take a ""fresh look"" at Vieques and conduct new studies to determine whether the Navy's contamination at Vieques made people sick. In January, ATSDR's Frumkin was reassigned. In response to the islander's lawsuit, the U.S. government is invoking sovereign immunity, claiming the islanders do not have the right to sue the government and that there's no proof that the Navy's activities caused the widespread illnesses. For the sick residents of Vieques there is no time to lose. ""What I want is people to get medicine and help here,"" said Inna. ""I know how people are suffering in this island. I see people in the streets and poor people living like wild things. And there's kids dying on the street. It's not good.""","Vieques resident Nanette Rosa's two teenage daughters both suffer from cancer .

"(CNN) -- As the Russian hockey team imploded, Kiev exploded. Protests against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's administration had turned deadly, and Ukrainian athletes at the Olympics in Sochi, Russia, wanted to wear black armbands to commemorate the dead. Initial reports indicated the International Olympic Committee declined the request. Later, when a few Ukrainian athletes indicated they were leaving Sochi in solidarity with the protesters, IOC spokesman Mark Adams told reporters the decision against the armbands had been mutual, and the Ukrainians instead opted to observe a moment of silence in the Olympic Village: ""They weren't forbidden to wear armbands. ... They discussed what should be done, and they reached the conclusion there were other ways of marking this moment."" The muddled situation is par for the course when it comes to politics and the Olympics, where the positions of the Olympic committee are often contradictory. Already in Sochi, the IOC told skiers they could not wear helmet stickers honoring the late Canadian halfpipe skier Sarah Burke, and Norway could not wear black armbands to memorialize an athlete's brother who had trained with the team. To support such decisions, the IOC trots out Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter: ""No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted."" And in 2012, the IOC denied the Israeli delegation's request for a moment of silence in the opening ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the massacre in Munich, substituting instead a private ceremony -- but it had allowed a tribute in the ceremony to the victims of the London bombing attacks in 2005. And at the last Winter Games in Vancouver, the Georgian delegation was allowed to wear black armbands in the opening ceremony to honor luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who had died that day in a training run. Despite the IOC's nagging insistence it is apolitical, the Olympics have been fraught with politics since their inception. Avery Brundage, the only American ever to head the IOC, opposed a U.S. boycott of the Berlin Olympics in 1936 because ""the Olympic Games belong to the athletes and not to the politicians."" But as the entry to competition is based on national identity, the Olympics are inherently political. The Cold War magnified their political potential, providing a battlefield for the superpower struggle between communism and democracy to take place over medals, such as the controversial basketball final in Munich in 1972 in which the Soviets were given no less than three chances to make the game-winning basket over the United States, and the ""Miracle on Ice"" in 1980 when the United States defeated the Soviet Union in hockey. Sochi was ripe with politics in the months leading up to the Olympics, with controversies regarding the environment, corrupt budgets and stray dogs. Political oppression stood front and center, particularly in the imprisonment of members the women's punk band Pussy Riot and the anti-gay legislation that had made Russia a dangerous place for many. Some called for a boycott of these Olympics, while others agreed that it would be for the athletes to take a stand once there. With the Ukrainian situation, Sochi has become even more political, but not for the reasons anticipated. While transgender Italian activist Vladimir Luxuria has been detained in Olympic Park for her flags and rainbow attire, the athletes have mostly kept quiet. Early on, pictures of Alexey Sobolev's snowboard, adorned with the likeness of Pussy Riot, gave Bob Costas something political to talk about, while ski jumper Daniela Iraschko-Stolz, the first ""out"" athlete to win a medal in Sochi, expressed her disapproval of Russia's anti-gay laws. This past week, snowboarder Michael Lambert also chimed in, deeming Russia a problematic host because it ""has people suffer, shuts people up."" He speculated that perhaps only Scandinavia had the potential for a ""perfect"" Games. Above all, through the scandals, conflicts and corruption, the IOC sees itself as a peacemaker. But there are inconsistencies. In 1968, it pressured the U.S. Olympic Committee to take action against sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos after the duo raised black gloved fists during the victory ceremony of the men's 200-meter race to protest racial oppression. Four years later in Munich, the IOC did not wait for the U.S. Olympic Committee to take action, banning U.S. sprinters Wayne Collett and Vince Matthews for their ""disrespectful"" behavior on the podium. In Athens in 2004, the IOC failed to censure world champion Iranian judoka Arash Miresmaeili, who carried his country's flag in the Parade of Nations and then withdrew from competition after drawing an Israeli opponent. Yet it banned South Africa in its apartheid era and Afghanistan when the Taliban took power, pressured Saudi Arabia to field female athletes and has long recognized teams from Puerto Rico and East Timor and Palestinian territories as independent national delegations. In Sochi, IOC President Thomas Bach urged the Ukrainians to demonstrate how ""sport can build bridges and help to bring people from different backgrounds together in peace."" IOC member Sergey Bubka, the great pole vaulter who represented both the Soviet Union and his native Ukraine in competition, echoed Bach's sentiments on Twitter, urging his compatriots to remember the Olympic truce and lay down their weapons. Canada's Globe and Mail agreed, running the headline, ""Shadow cast over Sochi as Ukraine violence shatters Olympic truce."" What is confounding is the impression that until the most recent outbreak of violence in Ukraine, the Olympic truce was intact in these Games. The ancient Greeks invested in the Olympics as a diplomatic tool, as the spirit of ekecheiria stipulated laying down arms for athletic competition; they used sport to interrupt the progression of war. With the relatively recent creation of the Olympic Truce Centre, the IOC says it wants ""to encourage searching for peaceful and diplomatic solutions to the conflicts around the world."" Black armbands do not seem to fit within the IOC's definition of peaceful and diplomatic. And perhaps they will become unnecessary if the continuing violence can finally be quelled. But that does not mean we are left with sports without politics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy Bass.","Amy Bass: IOC mulled letting Ukraine athletes wear black armbands .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama plans to order the closing of the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay as early as his first week in office to show a break from the Bush administration's approach to the war on terror, according to two officials close to the transition. President-elect Barack Obama is expected to sign an order closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. One of the officials said it would be in keeping with Obama's campaign promise to shut down the prison through executive order, a move which was also pushed by last year's Republican presidential nominee, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona. ""The president-elect has repeatedly said the legal framework at Gitmo has failed to successfully and swiftly prosecute terrorists,"" said one of the officials close to the transition, who was not authorized to speak publicly about private deliberations. Such a move would reassure those concerned after Obama's recent public comments suggested he may not immediately shut the prison down. Watch what may delay Gitmo's closing » . ""It is more difficult than I think a lot of people realize and we are going to get it done, but part of the challenge that you have is that you have a bunch of folks that have been detained, many of whom who may be very dangerous who have not been put on trial or have not gone through some adjudication,"" Obama said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday when asked whether he would close the prison in his first 100 days. Obama also said he was trying to develop a process that ""adheres to rule of law"" but ""doesn't result in releasing people who are intent on blowing us up."" ""I think it's going to take some time and our legal teams are working in consultation with our national security apparatus as we speak, to help design exactly what we need to do,"" Obama said. ""But I don't want to be ambiguous about this. We are going to close Guantanamo and we are going to make sure that the procedures we set up are ones that abide by our Constitution,"" he said. The military prison at Guantanamo Bay is a major issue because for critics of the Bush administration, it has become a symbol of mismanagement and overreach in the war on terror. At his final White House press conference on Monday, President Bush was asked whether the military prison and harsh interrogation tactics have damaged America's standing in the world. iReport.com: What should Obama do first? ""I strongly disagree with the assessment that our moral standing has been damaged,"" Bush said. ""It may be damaged amongst some of the elite.

"(CNN) -- Ayman Kandeel grabs the producer of a television network and smacks the lanky young man, cursing angrily. He throws studio furniture at the camera crew. Then he turns his attention to the beautiful female anchor. Before she can duck, he slaps her across the face, leaving her curled up in a corner of the room. Kandeel is a famous actor in Egypt, but this is not a skit. He was victimized by a provocative new Egyptian television show called ""Alhokm Baad Almozawla,"" or Judgment After a Prank. On the program, Egyptian actress Iman Mubarak talks with celebrities under the pretense that the interview is for an Arabic-speaking German network. After an often tense dialogue on Egyptian-Israeli relations, the show crew dupes the interviewee into thinking they are actually on an Israeli TV station and begin provoking and taunting the subject. Reactions have included anti-Israeli slurs, desperate cries to leave and, as in Kandeel's case, physical assault. ""This is a candid-camera program, but it is different than any other candid-camera shows that can be shallow,"" said Haytham al-Feel, the show's creator. ""It explores a deep subject matter, and it covers an important gut-level issue. The issue is, of course, Egypt's relationship with Israel."" In one episode, panicked actress Dina Abo Elsoud spends nearly four minutes struggling to push away four men who are blocking the exit door and yelling ""We are Israelis"" at her. ""I swear to God I want to leave! Let me leave!"" Abo Elsoud whimpers as she breaks down into tears. Finally the crew shouts, ""You are on 'Alhokm Baad Almozawla.' Everyone clap. Give her a big round of applause!"" Abo Elsoud continues to cry for a few moments. Still shocked and petrified, she mutters, ""I just got scared they would kidnap me."" In another episode, actress Mayar al-Beblawi says all Israelis are ""real liars."" ""They keep whining all the time about the Holocaust or whatever it's called,"" she says. ""With all the Palestinians that you have killed, you are still whining about the Holocaust and its lousy figures?"" The heated rhetoric and violent assaults on the program have prompted a firestorm of international criticism and allegations of anti-Semitism. And with the election of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy after more than a year of political upheaval, the show's popularity has raised concern about the stability of Egypt's three-decade-old peace accord with Israel. ""The program 'Alhokm Baad Almozawla' results in inciting public opinion against peace,"" Ofir Gendelman, spokesman to the Arab media in the Israeli prime minister's office, remarked on Twitter. ""From our perspective, peace is fundamental and vindictive programs like this will not be broadcast in Israel."" The show also appears to be no laughing matter for the Israeli press, with critical headlines ranging from ""Audience applauds violent anti-Semitism on Egypt TV"" (Jerusalem Post) to ""Reality show reveals ingrained Egyptian hatred for Israel"" (Israel Today Magazine). But al-Feel said ""there is a difference between expressing hate for Israel and its politics and expressing hate for the Jewish people."" He said celebrities were happy to give consent so their footage could be aired on the show. ""Once the guests found out it was prank, they really loved the idea and enjoyed the show and agreed to be on it,"" he said. ""We felt there was an overwhelming sense of patriotism and pride in standing up for Egypt and the Arabs."" All of the episodes were taped before the show became one of the top five Ramadan programs on Egyptian television station Al Nahar. The show also boasts more than four million YouTube viewers, and the show's producers say the success shouldn't be overshadowed by the punches and the insults. ""We have produced 95 episodes, and in only three did the personalities attack the crew,"" al-Feel said. ""The normal reaction is for people to reject the dialogue because they were duped. ... Others refused to complete the interview because it was on an Israeli TV station and they boycott all relations with Israel, which is their right."" ""The program intends to deliver a message, and I believe the reaction by Israel is very natural,"" said Waleed al-Feel, chairman of the show's production company. ""A majority of Egyptians will boycott any interaction with Israel after its historical oppression of the Arab people. We are not against, however, the peace treaty with Israel. We are against the apartheid."" In post-revolution Egypt, the end to the censorship of the Mubarak regime has fueled a wave of original new content set to tackle taboo issues from sexual harassment to AIDS. But it also means the media community is less inclined to curb what might be offensive. ""In America and Europe, there is no censorship on cinema or TV. No topic is off-limits,"" said Haytham al-Feel. ""So why are people against our show? The show is an idea, and it is freedom of expression, and our guests also have freedom of expression to say what they believe.""

"(CNN) -- Western governments, including the United States, appear to be stepping up efforts to censor Internet search results and YouTube videos, according to a ""transparency report"" released by Google. ""It's alarming not only because free expression is at risk, but because some of these requests come from countries you might not suspect -- Western democracies not typically associated with censorship,"" Dorothy Chou, a senior policy analyst at Google, wrote in a blog post on Sunday night. ""For example, in the second half of last year, Spanish regulators asked us to remove 270 search results that linked to blogs and articles in newspapers referencing individuals and public figures, including mayors and public prosecutors. In Poland, we received a request from a public institution to remove links to a site that criticized it. We didn't comply with either of these requests."" In the last half of 2011, U.S. agencies asked Google to remove 6,192 individual pieces of content from its search results, blog posts or archives of online videos, according to the report. That's up 718% compared with the 757 such items that U.S. agencies asked Google to remove in the six months prior. Overall, Google received 187 requests from United States law enforcement agencies and courts to remove content from its Web properties from July to December, up 103% from the 92 requests the Mountain View, California, company received in the previous reporting period. In one incident cited in the report, a U.S. law enforcement agency asked Google to take down a blog that ""allegedly defamed a law enforcement official in a personal capacity."" The company did not comply with that request. In another, a separate law enforcement group asked Google to take down 1,400 YouTube videos (Google owns YouTube) because of ""alleged harassment."" And in Canada, the passport office asked Google to delete a YouTube video ""of a Canadian citizen urinating on his passport and flushing it down the toilet,"" according to the report. The tech company did not oblige either of those requests but did comply at least in part with 42% of the removal requests from the United States in the last half of 2011, the report says. That number is down considerably compared to previous reports; In the latter half of 2010, for example, Google said it complied with 87% of U.S. requests to remove content. The biannual transparency report, which includes data to July 2009, also indicates a rise in world governments' requests to take a look at the data Google collects about its users. And with those requests, Google tended to be much more likely to comply. In the last half of 2011, Google received 6,321 requests for user data from government agencies in the United States and complied at least in part with 93% of them, according to data released in the report. Those requests for information about Google users come as part of criminal investigations, Google says, and are not unique to the company. Google complied more frequently with U.S.-based requests for information about users than with requests from other countries, according to the report. It complied or partially complied with only 24% of such requests from Canada, 44% from France and 64% from the United Kingdom, for example. The number of user data requests Google received from the United States was up 6% over the previous six-month period and 37% compared with the last half of 2010. Google says this increase ""isn't surprising, since each year we offer more products and services, and we have a larger number of users."" In the report, the company adds: ""We review each request to make sure that it complies with both the spirit and the letter of the law, and we may refuse to produce information or try to narrow the request in some cases."" Writing at Forbes.com, tech columnist Andy Greenberg says that Google ""should be applauded for taking a strong stand against censorship"" but that ""the government's increasingly sticky fingers in Google's databases comes at a sensitive time."" ""Google has been criticized for failing to reveal much about its reported partnership with the National Security Agency following a Chinese attack on its systems in 2010,"" he writes. ""And the company has yet to take a stand on the House's recently-passed Cyber Infrastructure Security and Protection Act or its equivalents in the Senate, which are designed to give companies far more leeway to hand data over to government agencies for security purposes."" At Politico, blogger Dylan Byers says the report ""will certainly challenge any notions you might have about a free and unregulated Web."" Google says it hopes the data will offer a ""small window into what's happening on the Web at large.""","Google says government requests to remove Web content are way up .

"(CNN) -- At 12 years old, Jeff Hanson was struggling to see the world around him. ""He was walking off curbs and falling down staircases because he couldn't see that they were there,"" said his dad, Hal Hanson. Hanson had been diagnosed at an early age with neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that can cause learning disabilities and in his case an optic nerve tumor. When the tumor threatened to leave him blind, he underwent rounds of chemotherapy and 28 days of radiation. ""We talked to Jeff about it, and we made light of it. We didn't want it to scare him or make him feel threatened,"" his dad said. To lift his spirits, he started painting watercolors on note cards. ""It was sad to see this 12-year-old child go through treatment,"" said his mom, Julie Hanson. ""So one day we just took out the watercolors and note cards and Jeff started painting ... and that's when we recognized as parents that Jeff had a great gift for color."" ""It helped me a lot painting during chemotherapy and radiation because it was something to do. It was fun,"" Hanson said. That summer, Hanson started selling his note cards along with his mom's baked goods at the foot of their driveway in Overland Park, Kansas. ""In the beginning, it was a lemonade stand. And he thought he'd make a few dollars and have some spending money,"" his father said. ""But what we quickly realized was that he was making a lot of money."" By the end of the summer, Hanson had raised $15,000, which he gave to charity. He donated the money to the Children's Tumor Foundation to help research his diagnosis. ""It makes me feel really good that I was able to give it away and help others,"" he said. For Hanson, it was just the beginning. He went from painting watercolors on note cards to creating colorful acrylic art on canvases. Then he started auctioning his paintings at charity events. ""Each one of them is a labor of love. Each one of them is very special,"" said his mom. ""Nothing about them is mass produced."" In five years, Hanson has donated more than $350,000 from the sale of his paintings to more than 50 charities, most of them devoted to children's health. At a recent event for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Hanson sold one of his paintings for $15,000 during the live auction. The second bidder offered to pay another $15,000 if Hanson painted a second piece. ""In just minutes, Jeff raised $30,000,"" his mom said. ""He loves to chuckle and say the only thing that sold for more was a Corvette."" At 17, the sight-impaired teen doesn't plan to slow down any time soon. ""My goal for the future is to raise a million dollars for charity,"" he said. ""He's a young businessman trying to take his gift and use his paintings to invest in his visually impaired future,"" his mom said. ""At the same time, the philanthropic side of his business is exploding."" Hanson's art is on display at the Aloft Hotel in Kansas. Even some celebrities like Elton John and Billy Joel own his paintings. ""I love the way Jeff's paintings make me feel and the use of his bold colors and his texture,"" said Rachelle Craig, an art collector who owns one of his paintings. ""For this young person to be able to do what he has done, it's an incredible story. His story is the true art."" ""Everyone who hears his story and who sees his work finds their own hearts changed,"" said Adam Hamilton, senior pastor for the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kansas. ""I think they find themselves wanting to be more generous. They find themselves wanting to be more positive about life. They find themselves wanting to help other people.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. government auditors will review a program that allows airlines to avoid penalties for safety problems by self-disclosing them to the Federal Aviation Administration. The Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General, a watchdog, said on Tuesday that it would examine the voluntary initiative to ensure it is not being misused as happened previously in the case of a major carrier. Congress has requested the review. The FAA established the program in 2006 to increase safety by allowing airlines to spend resources to fix safety problems rather than spending time trying to settle disputes with the agency. Goal: Speedier trip through airport security . In a highly critical report two years later, the inspector general's office said FAA safety inspectors had grown too close with Southwest Airlines. The report said inspectors had allowed the carrier to repeatedly self-disclose violations of FAA repair orders, absolving it of any penalty without ensuring that the company had come up with a solution for the safety issue. The matter involved 46 Boeing 737s that had not been inspected for potential cracks, a problem that could have led to rapid cabin decompression and crashes. When Southwest discovered the lapse, FAA inspectors encouraged the airline to formally self-disclose the problem and allowed it to operate those planes on 1,451 flights for eight days, the inspector general's report said. Southwest later inspected the planes and found fuselage cracks on five, the report said. The company later was assessed a heavy fine by the FAA. The Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program is one of at least four self-reporting efforts the FAA has adopted to monitor the industry and its own employees to identify problems and trends and prevent accidents. Safety experts generally applaud voluntary approaches, saying they increase data available to researchers and can make systems safer if trends are found. The inspector general's office said its review would look at whether the airlines are meeting FAA requirements when filing reports and whether regulators are evaluating the industry's corrective actions. The FAA created a non-punitive reporting system for air traffic controllers in 2008 and expanded it this year to include employees who maintain radar installations and other systems. The FAA said that system has yielded enormous data and prompted corrective steps. Who's afraid to fly on September 11? Opinion: Airport Wi-Fi and mobile services are lacking .

"(CNN) -- Ai Fukuhara's face is a picture of concentration as she crouches over the table tennis table, batting ball after ball back to her opponent. As she rocks back and forth, executing every flick, chip and smash with lightning speed, it's easy to see why she says the game calls for a nimble mind as well as quick hands and feet. ""Table tennis is often compared to a 100m run while playing chess,"" Fukuhara told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It's really right. You have to think as well as move -- so not only does your energy get used up, but also your brain gets exhausted."" Despite being only 26 years old, Fukuhara is a veteran of the sport honing her game over the course of 16 years in the professional ranks and before that as a precocious amateur. The girl affectionately known as ""Ai-chan"" (her first name means ""love"" in English) shot to fame in her native Japan following a series of appearances on national television when she was a toddler. ""I started table tennis at three years and nine months old and I've been covered by the media since I was four,"" she explains. TV viewers marveled at the little girl from Sendai who could barely see over the top of the table but could hold her own against adult opponents. But it was her tears when she lost a points that most people remember, earning her the nickname ""cry baby."" Some of the footage, which can be found on YouTube, looks traumatic at times, but she recalls her early duels against TV opponents with a sense of fondness now. ""I was just putting my whole energy against them,"" she says. ""I was just enjoying surprising people. I wanted to win the game. I was happy that people cheered for me."" The performances helped lodge Fukuhara's name in the public consciousness and set the tone for a life devoted to table tennis. Today, Fukuhara trains for around six to seven hours every day and estimates to have completed more than 25,000 hours (nearly three years solid) of practice to date. This work ethic, instilled by her mother, Chiyo, laid the foundations for her rapid rise through the junior ranks. At five years old, she won her first national competition and turned pro at the age of 10 in 1999. Four years later, she was representing her country at the world championships in Paris where she reached the quarterfinals, before making history at the 2004 Olympics in Athens when, aged 15 years, 287 days, she became the youngest-ever female table tennis player to appear at the Games. A medal proved elusive at both Athens and Beijing four years later where she was afforded the honor of flag bearer for the Japanese team. But a silver medal in the team event in London in 2012 earned her and Japan their first-ever medal in table tennis since it became an Olympic sport in 1988. ""Everyone was so happy (back at home). I was amazed how pleased they were. ""I was happy to win the medal but I felt even happier to show my medal to the people, and people living in the disaster zone,"" she says referring to her hometown of Sendai, which was devastated by a tsunami in March 2011. There have been other triumphs at the table, notably five world championship bronze medals (four team and one mixed doubles), an individual bronze at the 2005 World Cup and a much coveted national title in 2012. Finally winning her national championships was one of her proudest achievements. ""I finally won at my 13th try -- the competition was hard for me mentally (because) I couldn't win it for such a long time."" Fukuhara has also made an impact off the table, helping to popularize the game in her homeland while also cultivating an avid following in China by competing in the country's Super League. She also speaks fluent Mandarin and was given an unofficial rubber stamp of approval when she played a few rallies against then Chinese President Hu Jintao during an official trip to Japan in 2008. Today, her popularity in China remains strong and so does the rivalry against the sport's strongest nation. ""Right now, the biggest goal is to beat China,"" she says. It's likely she will have to defeat them if she is to fulfill her childhood ambitions and claim gold at the Rio Olympics in just under two years' time. ""I want to be on the podium in both team and individual events there. I can't forget the view from the podium in London -- I feel so proud to see the Japanese flag being raised at (medal) ceremonies."" Fukuhara has defied the simplistic classifications that are frequently applied to child prodigies -- she hasn't become an all-conquering hero, yet, nor has she gone off the rails. Instead, she has trodden a middle ground, retaining a sense of perspective and satisfaction despite having done much of her growing up in public. ""I'm very proud that I've been able to continue playing table tennis for such a long time,"" she said. ""I can play thanks to the support of a lot of people. And what makes me happy is to see those people's delighted faces and share a joy of victory with them."" ""Seeing happy people gives me the most energy."" She just wishes more people would take up the game. ""Table tennis is such an interesting sport. It's fun to watch, but if you actually play you understand how great it is. If you ever get the chance, please pick up the racket and play!"" Read more: Exiled 'Lost Boy' who found refuge in running .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Wednesday unveiled a plan to create volunteer and service opportunities to help tackle some of the nation's most pressing issues, part of his weeklong focus on patriotism and national service. Sen. Barack Obama is expected to say President Bush failed to urge Americans to serve their nation after 9/11. ""This won't be a call issued in one speech or one program -- I want this to be a central cause of my presidency,"" Obama said in a speech at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs. ""We will ask Americans to serve. We will create new opportunities for Americans to serve. And we will direct that service to our most pressing national challenges."" He added, ""When you choose to serve -- whether it's your nation, your community or simply your neighborhood -- you are connected to that fundamental American ideal that we want life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness not just for ourselves, but for all Americans. That's why it's called the American dream."" Obama highlighted his time as a community organizer on Chicago's South Side and his stint heading Project Vote, a group that helped register 150,000 new African-American voters in the Illinois city, according to his campaign. ""I wasn't just helping other people. Through service, I found a community that embraced me; citizenship that was meaningful; the direction I'd been seeking. Through service, I discovered how my own improbable story fit into the larger story of America,"" he said. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also touched on the ""spirit"" of service witnessed after the September 11, 2001, attacks and take aim at the Bush administration's failure to capitalize on this opportunity to call Americans to service. ""We were ready to step into the strong current of history and to answer a new call for our country. But the call never came,"" he said. ""Instead of a call to service, we were asked to shop. ... Instead of leadership that called us to come together, we got patriotism defined as the property of one party and used as a political wedge ... we ended up going into a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged."" Obama also pressed the need to ""ease the burden on our troops, while meeting the challenges of the 21st century"" -- a plan he hopes will increase ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 Marines. According to Obama's campaign, the service plan will include: . Sen. John McCain also has touched on national service with a call to action on his campaign Web site.

"(CNN) -- Seventy-one years have passed since that ninth day of April, 1942, on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines, where we witnessed the defeat of a once-proud Army. It was where Gen. Edward King, commander of all U.S. armed forces on Bataan, told his men, ""We have no further means of organized resistance, we are low on ammunition, have virtually no medical supplies, and our food is all but gone. Our front lines are destroyed and both flanks severely weakened. The situation has become hopeless."" Then he continued, ""If I do not surrender all forces to the Japanese today, Bataan will be known around the world as the greatest slaughter in history."" Those haunting words of surrender, following the Battle of Bataan, drifted down to the fighting men and women on Bataan that sad day, which marked the worst U.S. military defeat in our nation's history. Gen. Douglas MacArthur planned to keep troops on the peninsula and Corregidor Island until the U.S. Navy could provide supplies and reinforcements. But, according to an Army history, the Navy was still in shambles after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, and no ships were capable of bringing reinforcements. Lacking supplies, the men on Bataan fought bravely for four months against the well-fed, well-armed Japanese military. The Japanese believed in the unwritten Samurai code of conduct, known as Bushido, which held that the true warrior was willing to die for the Emperor and would never surrender. King's decision to surrender was in direct conflict with an order he received from Gen. MacArthur. But he nevertheless ordered all of his troops on Bataan to lay down their arms and surrender to the Imperial Japanese. King told his men, ""You did not surrender; I ordered you to surrender."" Some 12,000 Americans and 58,000 Filipino soldiers were surrendered that day; records show that of the 70,000 men captured, more than 20,000 were patients in field hospitals, and the remaining forces were unable to perform effectively due to being impaired by malaria or dysentery. A POW's 'Tears in the Darkness' Of the 12,000 Americans, only about 1,700 lived to return home. The actual number is very hard to ascertain due to the large number killed on the Bataan March, with their bodies left on the side of the road or in the Pacific. Once the surrender took effect, the Japanese marched emaciated soldiers toward Camp O'Donnell, 65 miles away, according to the Army history. The march became known as the Bataan Death March, not just because of how many died, but because of the way they died. If you stopped, you were killed. If you had a malaria attack and had to stop for help, you were killed. If you had dysentery and had to stop to relieve yourself, you were killed. Without food or water, and with constant beatings, the march became unbearable. Seeking a drink of water from a caribou wallow resulted in dysentery, and drinking water from a free-flowing artesian well resulted in being killed. And how did they kill you? By shooting or bayoneting you, or by decapitation. And, in one instance, burying the soldier alive. The March was the beginning of three-and-a-half years of hell. If you survived the Bataan Death March, you were then sent to Japan on old Japanese freighters whose military officers refused to place Red Cross or POW markings on the ships -- thereby making them targets for American submarines and air forces fighter planes. The freighters were known as ""Hell Ships"" because they were attacked and severely damaged or sunk, by American fighting forces, leaving watery graves for thousands. If you survived the Bataan March, the POW camp in the Philippines and the ship to Japan, you were then placed into forced labor with some of Japan's leading industrial giants, and required to work in their mines, on their docks or in their factories. The companies failed to feed us adequately, failed to take care of our medical needs, and failed to stop the physical abuse that was orchestrated and carried out by the civilian workers of those same Japanese companies. The everyday beatings with shovels, hammers and pick-axes caused severe lifetime injuries to those of us who survived. U.S. to pay 'forgotten' Filipino World War II veterans . The U.S. military document we former POWs had to sign as we were released from our POW camp stated, ""You shall not discuss your experience as a POW with any source without prior approval from the War Department, doing so may result in severe penalties, or court-martial."" And the threat kept us quiet all these years. We have unfinished business with those companies who used and abused us American POWs during WWII. Just last year, after 70 years of waiting, we received Japan's apology for the ""inhumane"" treatment by the Japanese military, but we need an apology from those companies who allowed their employees to beat us on a daily basis for failing to work hard enough, work fast enough or bow low enough. We survivors want our honor returned, and one way to do that is through an apology issued by those companies who used and abused us during WWII. We have found that dying was easy: It's the living that's hard. As we recall this anniversary of the Bataan Death March, we acknowledge that although the Japanese stole our honor, deprived us the simplest necessities of life, and forced us into slavery, still our values remained intact and we never lost faith in our country or our God.

"(CNN) -- Ensuring a bustling aviation hub runs like clockwork is a challenging endeavor at the best of times. Doing so under a blizzard of thick snow, ice and freezing fog can only intensify the battle against the clock. Faced with these winter extremities for almost half the year, Oslo Airport has recruited a secret weapon to help meet its scheduling commitments -- the TV 2000 snow-blower. Weighing in at a mammoth 40 tons and with a price tag of just under $2 million, the giant snow-plow can clear a three kilometer runway in as little as 15 minutes. The TV 2000 can remove ""about ten thousand tons of snow an hour,"" said the airport's head of services, Henning Bratebeck. ""It pushes the snow with a plow, it sweeps the runway and it blows the snow to the side,"" he added. An array of smaller vehicles finish the job. There are only four such devices in the world, he added, and Oslo Airport has snapped up two of them. See also: Iceland bouncing back on tourism boom . Employing such advanced weather management systems make sense for an airport situated just a few hundred miles from the Arctic Circle. Winter stretches between October and April in Norway, with snow falling regularly during this period. According to Oslo Airport CEO, Nic Nilsen, this has pushed Oslo to become a leader in airport snow maintenance. ""We have winter six months a year, and we need to be able to handle winter operations more or less like summer operations,"" Nilsen says. ""This requires good planning, it requires a lot of resources, good procedures and a lot of training. ""(If not) we will more or less be out of business,"" he added. See also: The rise of airport dating . The TV 2000 is a key weapon in the fight to keep flights on time but, as Nilsen intimates, there are a host of other snow-clearing devices and tactics employed at Oslo Airport. This includes a rigorous de-icing process for aircraft and runways as well as a fleet of giant plows that follow the TV 2000 to clear the snow blown off runways. An extra 90 people meanwhile are hired by the airport just to assist with snow clearance during winter months. ""The idea is this (TV 2000) basically does the grunt work,"" Bratebeck explained. ""(But we also always) have 27 guys ready in case the snow starts falling."" As soon as ""the first flakes fall down we will drive out ... and (begin) the snow cleaning,"" he added. The effectiveness and military-like precision of this process becomes fully clear when compared to winter performance at other European airports. See also: Gulf airlines shaking up alliances . Few sites are exposed to the elements with such regularity, yet almost all find it hard to compete with Oslo's record on punctuality. Around 40 percent of flights were cancelled at Paris Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports on just one day in January this year. Frankfurt meanwhile was forced to close operations, leading to the cancellation of some 500 flights in the process. By comparison Oslo has only ever had to cease operations because of heavy snow twice since opening its doors in 1998. On both occasions operations were up and running again after a matter of hours -- although Oslo Airport is considerably smaller than those in London, Paris and Frankfurt. ""I think it's fair to say that after fourteen years we are in the position where we have a very solid and very good operation,"" says Nilsen. ""We are well prepared, know how to handle the situation, and we also have a policy of standardizing the fleet of vehicles, so maintenance and renewal is much more easy. ""(But) we know that one winter will always play different from the previous ones so we (will always) learn something new,"" he added.","Oslo Airport in Norway has a secret weapon in its battle against the winter elements .

"(CNN) -- From the pleated mini-skirt to varsity basics, fashion forecasters are predicting the school hallway will invade the fall fashion runway this year. Fashion forecaster WGSN, the official trend sponsor of the upcoming Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York City, offered a sneak peek of its 2013 fall runway predictions for women's wear on Tuesday. WGSN forecasts trends for mass market retailers like H&M, Target, Express, Tommy Hilfiger and United Colors of Benetton, among others, so the heavy volume stores can translate key looks into lucrative collections. Fashion Week: From runway to closet . This fall, designers are taking a turn for the athletic, said Jaclyn Jones, U.S. women's wear editor for WGSN, with luxe sweatshirts and varsity-style jackets that were the standard sign for going steady in the 1950s. Don't break out the frat boy college-emblazoned sweatshirt just yet, though. Even casual dress has its parameters, Jones said. Androgynous looks for women will be paired or layered over more feminine elements like flowing skirts and fit-and-flare dresses. Jones said designers will also update seemingly casual looks with distinctly dressier lace insets, sheer insets, jewels and sequins. The baseball-jacket trend gained traction with Alexander Wang in his spring 2011 collection. Jones said Wang is one of the top influential, trickle-down designers to watch this season, along with Marc Jacobs and Proenza Schouler. The vivid prints of Clover Canyon will be worthy of replication as well. Among the other trends to look out for this fall: cropped shirts, tapered pants, sheath dresses, cocoon (the ""it"" silhouette) jackets and wide-leg trousers. Last fall, it was all about the embellishments -- sequins, sparkles, beading, embroidery, even the return of the preppy monogram. This fall/winter season, designers aren't embellishing as much. They're getting back to basics with newer fashion-focused fabrics to use on revivals of '60s mod classics and '90s grunge. Jones said shoppers will see coated and bonded fabrics, and sheer chiffons backed by wool. ""We're expecting a lot of updates in terms of fabric. I think there's going to be a lot of double-faced fabrics, unusual combinations pairing delicates with more heavyweights. Coating with rubberized lace, metallic finishes on leather,"" Jones said. Designers also remain hell-bent on leather, incorporating it in allover silhouettes like leggings and skirts, or using it as a detail on sleeves, lapels and shoulders. ""The color palettes, print and pattern, and key details will define and differentiate the season,"" Jones said. Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week's fall 2013 collections kick off Thursday with a week's worth of runway shows and events.

"(CNN) -- The politics of oil and ecology have put President Obama between a rock and hard place, as he faces a decision on whether or not to permit construction of a new pipeline. The squeeze just got tighter with a new, negative environmental assessment. The Keystone XL pipeline will give America energy independence, thousands of jobs, important industrial infrastructure and won't cost taxpayers a dime, say proponents. Many of them are Republican lawmakers. It is dangerous, inherently filthy and must be stopped, say opponents, some of whom are Democrats who helped get the president elected. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency weighed in on the side of the environmentalists, weeks after the State Department came down on the side of the proponents. The EPA sent a letter to high officials at State, blasting the draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) it published in March that had reflected positively on the pipeline project. The environmental agency rated the DEIS as EO-2. It stands for ""Environmental Objections-Insufficient Information."" That could be seen as a C- on the EPA's grading scale. President Obama has promised to decide soon on whether or not to allow the TransCanada oil company to lay the 835 mile long Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Nebraska. While he has contemplated the pros and cons, powerful political forces have aligned on both sides of the argument. Arkansas spill strengthens arguments of Keystone foes . Economic pros . The Keystone XL would pump 830,000 barrels of oil sands crude per day through America's heartland, connecting crude producers in Canada with refineries and shipping companies in the United States. TransCanada would cover all the costs, proponents argue, making it practically a gift to the U.S. oil infrastructure. On its way to Nebraska, where it would connect with other, already existing pipelines, Keystone XL would pick up additional oil produced in Montana and North Dakota and stream it south, TransCanada said on its website. It would reduce ""American dependence on oil from Venezuela and the Middle East by up to 40 percent,"" TransCanada extols. Dirty air . It will produce too many greenhouse gases, the EPA said in its letter, and this needs to be amended, before the project goes forward. The Canadian crude in its raw form is mixed with sand. Extracting the oil and transporting it requires more energy than pumping crude out of a well. Thrusting it through long pipes increases the energy consumption. That higher energy use leads to greater greenhouse gas emissions, an increase of ""18.7 million metric tons (20 million tons) C02 ... per year when compared to an equal amount of U.S. average crudes,"" the EPA said. The state department's assessment concludes that just as much Canadian oil will make it to market, by train if necessary, if no pipeline is built, therefore there would be little additional ecological impact. The EPA argued that ""while informative"" that train of thought is out of date. In November: Protestors call on Obama to reject Keystone XL pipeline . Nasty spills . The agency is also concerned about oil spills, particularly since sands crude is different from conventional crude. It cites a 2010 pipe break in Michigan, which spurted out 20,000 barrels of sands crude. Some of it sank to the bottom of the Kalamazoo River and could not be completely cleaned up in three years' time, the EPA said. ""Spills of diluted bitumen may require different response actions or equipment,"" the letter stated. ""These spills can also have different impacts than spills of conventional oil."" The state department assessment did not address these issues and needs to require TransCanada to do more to monitor for oil leaks into ground water, the EPA criticized. Bitumen is the tar-like oil extracted from the sand. It is thinned with chemicals, so it can be pumped through pipelines. Nebraska beauty . State's assessment represents its second go-round with the Canadian company. It rejected a permit from TransCanada, last year, saying the route through Nebraska was too risky for the state's Sand Hills Region, a landscape of natural beauty. And it endangered the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides water to farmers and ranchers to raise livestock and grow crops. TransCanada came up with a new route, but the EPA said, it misses the mark. ""The alternative route in Nebraska has avoided most of the impacts to the Sand Hills Region, but still crosses the Ogallala Aquifer,"" the agency assessed. In its public reaction Monday, State indicated that the EPA's criticism was business as usual. It also anticipated public protest. ""The State Department has always anticipated that in preparing a Final Supplemental EIS it would conduct additional analysis and incorporate public comments received on the Draft SEIS,"" said press spokesman Patrick Ventrell. The politics . Keystone XL opponents have aligned themselves principally behind the greenhouse gas (GHG) issue, as the EPA acknowledged in Monday's letter to State: . ""It is this difference in GHG intensity - between oil sands and other crudes - that is a major focus of the public debate about the climate impacts of oil sands crude."" Obama's own former deputy press secretary is leading the charge to push the president to stop the pipeline. Bill Burton quit his job before the 2012 election to head up the super PAC Priorities USA, which worked for the president's reelection. In January, he joined the PR firm Global Strategy Group as an executive vice president. He is now representing a new coalition, ""All Risk, No Reward,"" which opposes Keystone XL. It goes after the additional greenhouse gases but also showcases the damage causes by spills to Americans in the heartland. Another group, 350.org, which wants to bring down carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere below 350 parts per million, is soliciting letters of protest to the state department. Nebraska's Republican governor Dave Heineman has approved the project, and Nebraskan congressman Lee Terry has called for the Keystone XL's construction in a Republican radio address. The pipeline ""is primed to give our economy a shot in the arm and make energy more affordable -- and it won't cost the taxpayers a dime,"" he argued. Terry spoke a day after an apparent pipeline rupture in the Arkansas town of Mayflower in late March, about 20 miles north of Little Rock. Black torrents of diluted bitumen flowed through the community, forcing the evacuation of 22 homes.","The State Department delivered an assessment positive of the proposed pipeline .
The EPA gives it a poor grade, says the ecological risks are too high .
Political forces are aligned for and against the pipeline's construction .
The president says he'll decide on whether or not to allow construction in coming months ."
"Washington (CNN) -- A new Senate bill is the first proposed legislation to curb so-called police militarization after the disturbances in Ferguson, Missouri. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, is sponsoring the legislation, which would block state and local police from receiving broad categories of military-grade equipment, including M-16 rifles, MRAP vehicles and camouflage equipment. He also proposes to require local police that have received such equipment in recent years to return it to the Defense Department. ""MRAP"" is shorthand for a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle, something usually associated with war zones. The legislation is a test of the strength of the congressional backlash against the much criticized heavy police response to demonstrations in the St. Louis suburb after the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. Televised images of camouflaged police in tank-like vehicles launching tear gas canisters and concussion grenades at protesters in Ferguson prompted criticism from both liberals and conservatives. President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder also criticized the heavy response, which they said appeared to inflame the disturbances, not quell them. Rand Paul: Police militarization, war on drugs are ""out of control"" The White House and Pentagon have announced reviews of the federal programs. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill, in whose home state the disturbances occurred, led a congressional hearing this month that scrutinized programs run by the Pentagon and the Homeland Security and Justice departments to help local police departments obtain surplus military equipment and buy new armor. The programs are mostly operated with the aim of helping local cities prepare for possible terrorist attacks. But cities aren't restricted in how they use the equipment, for instance using them in response to hurricanes and national disasters and to prepare for street protests. At the hearing, federal authorities said they didn't have ways to track what happens with the equipment once it is in the hands of local authorities, and in some cases the equipment has gone missing. Opinion: The real reason Ferguson has military weapons . It's not clear how much support Coburn, a conservative senator, will receive for his bill. But sentiment in Congress appears to support at least some changes to the current program. Coburn wants the Defense Department to seek congressional approval before transferring any new types of equipment under the surplus program and to maintain a public website that reports all transfers. The proposed bill would also restrict the Homeland Security and Justice departments' grant programs from giving money to cities to buy drones, surveillance equipment, ballistic helmets and lethal weapons.","Sen.

"Statesville, North Carolina (CNN) -- Dale Beatty and John Gallina are battle buddies. They both joined the North Carolina National Guard at 18. They've served together on missions at home and abroad. But both also bear mental and physical scars from their military service in Iraq: Beatty lost his legs to an anti-tank land mine, and Gallina suffered a traumatic brain injury. While Beatty was recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, members of his community offered to help him build a home for his family. The gesture deeply affected him, inspiring a new mission. In 2008, Beatty and Gallina founded Purple Heart Homes, a nonprofit that has modified or helped provide homes to 23 disabled U.S. veterans. Beatty was honored as a CNN Hero this year for his work helping veterans. He recently sat down to talk about his work, his friendship with Gallina and the unexpected roads they've traveled together. CNN: How did you and John meet? Dale Beatty: John and I met probably in 1996, in the National Guard. We were just two young, 18-year-old kids. ...Once you're in the military and you have a battle buddy, they're your battle buddy for life. He's been there every step of the way. We've done everything together. ... We grew up together in the service. And I don't think that's a new thing for anybody. My grandfather did it with his buddies in World War II. I think of us then, skinny little kids in green uniforms ... they don't even wear those uniforms anymore, so you know that's a long time ago. But it's cool to see where we've come. CNN: John had actually left the National Guard when you got orders to deploy to Iraq. How did he end up going with you? Beatty: I called and I said, ""Do you want a vacation?"" He's like, ""What are you talking about?"" And I said: ""We're going to Iraq. Do you want to go?"" He showed up a couple hours later (and) re-enlisted. That bond -- you can't let your friends go without you, if you can help it. We deployed in early 2004, and we were attached to the 1st Infantry Division. ...We did a lot of missions right alongside the regular Army: escorting convoys, searching houses, you name it. CNN: You were also injured together in November 2004. What happened exactly, and how did that impact your friendship? Beatty: We were on a patrol, part of combat operations on a supply route. This highway had been heavily mined in the past month with insurgent activity. There was always something going on, so we went out to kind of recon the area. The vehicle we were in -- John was driving -- we just went off the side of the road a little bit to avoid something. ... I remember seeing all the sand across the dash of the Humvee -- just like poof, pop -- go up in the air, and that was pretty much the last thing I remember. ...There were anti-tank mines in the gravel, so that's eventually how I lost both legs. ... I know he felt really bad about it for a long time, something that was not even his fault. He blamed himself a lot for my injury. ... John had those hidden wounds with traumatic brain injury and (post-traumatic stress disorder), and I saw him struggle. CNN: Your community helped you build your home. How was John involved in that, and how did that process inspire you to start Purple Heart Homes? Beatty: During the construction of my house, I was the contractor, my dad was my superintendent and John was kind of my confidant. ... He's been a custom builder since he was fairly young, so if I wanted to know about, ""What's the code issue on this specific thing? What's most cost effective solution?"" I would call, pick his brain and he always gave me good advice. Closer to the end, he moved back to Statesville and was able to help during the final build of the house. ... When my community was helping me, it really showed me the potential power and the effectiveness of groups within communities, especially when we're talking about veterans. ... My family really had the best-case scenario for a family that had been hurt that bad, and I knew, after meeting other veterans, that that wasn't the case for all of us. ... There's not as much help for (veterans) who weren't injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. ... John and I sat down and we started thinking about a nonprofit. ... I really wanted to create a group that could show people that there's thousands of veterans right here in our midst that could use help. That's really what led us to form our organization with the values and the mission that we have. ... Regardless of when you served, we're all the same. We're all veterans. Being able to empower communities to take care of even those gray-haired, distinguished veterans -- that's really what we're after. CNN: How does your experience serving in the military with John impact your working relationship? Beatty: The bond that you form doing the jobs and the dangerous missions we (did) is unbreakable. I might get mad at him, but I know we'll be able to talk in 15 minutes after that. We really make a good team. ... He's really the hard-driving pusher that tries to make stuff happen, and I'm the one who says, ""Hey, wait, let's think about that again before it happens."" ...We're an odd couple, but it works. ... John and I have really grasped this, and we're running with it as fast and as hard as we can. ...I'm glad he's still my battle buddy, and I'm glad we've been able to have this next chapter of our lives, doing good things and helping people out.","CNN Hero Dale Beatty helps build and modify homes for disabled veterans .

"(CNN) -- Blaring ads, arguments with co-workers, family and (former) Facebook friends. The cold nip in the air is already driving you over the edge, but presidential elections really make you want to bury your head in the sand. No need to flee the country without voting. The State Department and the Federal Voting Assistance Program offer guidance for U.S. citizens. But if you don't want to hear any more about it after that, a warm weather getaway might be just the ticket. If the elections don't go your way, hold onto this list. These places are great ex-pat havens. Eat Like a Local: Share your favorite spots . Tahiti . Tahiti is one of the most remote island chains in the world, a place where the peaceful lifestyle, luscious green mountains and deep blue waters fed the muses of painter Paul Gauguin, writer James Michener and many others. Patricia Schultz, author of ""1000 Places to See Before You Die,"" recently returned from French Polynesia's Tahiti, where she especially loved the island of Bora Bora. Even more places to see before you die . ""It takes about a minute to know it's the place to effortlessly drop off the map,"" she said via e-mail. ""Everyone greets you with 'Ia orana' - hello - and wears large, luscious flowers in their hair."" Schultz stayed in luxury at the Four Seasons, but she said there are ways to see Tahiti more affordably by staying on the outer island Huahine, for example, where ""tourism has been blessedly slow to arrive. Captain Cook might still recognize it."" Isla Holbox, Mexico . Mexico has long been an escape valve for Americans fleeing politics. Travel journalist Karen Catchpole and photographer Eric Mohl, an American couple whose website Trans-Americas Journey describes their ongoing six-year pan-American odyssey, recommend Isla Holbox, near Cancun, famed for its flamingo-filled lagoon. ""This car-free island is the place to flee and literally kick off your shoes. It's entirely possible to spend your time on the island barefoot,"" Catchpole wrote in an e-mail. ""The beach is perfect for long, lonely strolls and a surprisingly large Italian ex-pat community means the food is top-notch, particularly at Los Pelicanos, which served up some of the best Italian food we had during the 18 months we spent traveling in Mexico."" One top-rated lodging choice is tranquil Casa Sandra, a 17 room boutique hotel. Phuket, Thailand . Thailand hosted Leonardo DiCaprio's deserted island experience in the 2000 movie ""The Beach."" Phuket's beaches offer nice temperatures in November without the crush of tourist season's peak and neighboring ""James Bond Island"" is just one more step removed from the rest of the world. The island near Phuket, which is really called Ko Khao Phing Kan or Nail Island, was used as a setting for ""The Man With the Golden Gun."" Plus, the Phuket area is easy for foreigners, according to Pichaya Saisaengchan, an assistant director for the Tourism Authority of Thailand. ""It's one of the very few provinces, including Bangkok, where locals speak English."" One famous ex-pat is political film director Oliver Stone. The place is truly magical, say those in the know. ""When you put a seashell up to your ear in Phuket, you hear angels sing,"" said Michael Aumock, an American working for vacation home company 3rd Home. ""With impossibly clear blue water, great food, friendly locals and a strong exchange rate, I don't know why anyone would go anywhere else. Face your fears through travel . Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . Perhaps no other city has as beautiful a setting as Rio de Janeiro, with its forest-covered mountains and calm, sandy beaches. ""Rio in November is the perfect recipe to forget about the elections and enjoy a relaxed vacation. There's the traditional Brazilian food, excellent weather conditions, nonstop flights from most major U.S. cities for a reasonable price,"" said South America travel specialist Sandra Borello, owner of Borello Travel. Head to Belle Ã‰poque-era cafe Confeitaria Colombo, where Borello recommends ""ordering a caipirinha or two, to make you feel like a real Carioca, a native of Rio."" Reasonable hotel chains include Golden Tulip and Blue Tree, or splurge at the Copacabana Palace. Curacao . You won't run into your neighbor on the beach in Curacao, a mostly off-the-radar Caribbean getaway that mixes an island lifestyle with a liberal Dutch attitude. While November might be high hurricane season for most of the region, the island is out of the range of these tropical tempests, untouched by one in almost 160 years. There are more than 40 beaches lining its shores, along with about 60 diving spots, where visitors can see more than 600 species of fish in one of the Caribbean's healthiest marine environments. The streets of capital Willemstad are lined with Dutch colonial architecture swathed in palm trees: Imagine an Amsterdam bursting with tropical Miami Beach colors. If you're fleeing the elections, the locals completely empathize. They just held the first of their own in October as a newly autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, so they'll understand how you feel right now. Costa Rica . Costa Rica offers mountains, jungles and two coasts of beaches, on the Atlantic and Pacific. Jersey Shore native and former travel book publishing industry executive Megan Kennedy moved here and teaches English at Universidad Nacional Costa Rica in Nicoya and lives nearby in Playa SÃ¡mara, on the Pacific. Kennedy said she follows U.S. elections with ""a little distance from the noise, but I'm still concerned about democracy and the direction my country is headed."" Her new home is ""an incredibly beautiful spot, with a gorgeous beach, zip-lining, horseback riding, howler monkeys, cows and horses roaming the street."" Her community also has tourist amenities, ""but we're not overrun with chain restaurants and American-ized ideals of vacation. There's a mix of tourists from around the world, plus locals, which allows for interesting discussions!""","Heard enough of the election? Consider a sunny getaway .

"(CNN) -- A new crispness in the air. The red, orange and yellow of the leaves changing colors. The crunch of the first few leaves on the ground. On that inevitable march toward winter, there are still a few weeks for the casual and determined leaf peeper alike to enjoy the leaves changing color before they fall. Never mind that it happens every year. ""It's because it's fleeting is why it's new every year,"" says Mel Allen, editor of Yankee Magazine. In each of his 33 years at the magazine leaf peeping has been a fall cover story. First day of autumn: Share your photos with iReport . ""It's fall and the leaves are becoming beautiful; apple orchards; and the hawks are flying overhead. It's a sensual experience,"" he says. ""If you were to talk to someone in New Orleans who had had 33 Mardi Gras, they'd still be excited about it,"" says Allen. ""This is our party."" Different shades of red, orange and yellow . While evergreen trees such as pines and spruces have foliage that has evolved to survive extreme temperature changes, deciduous (broad-leaved) trees have evolved to drop their leaves and go dormant for the winter, says Ed Sharron, a science communication specialist with the National Park Service's Northeast Temperate Network in Vermont. ""It's such stark contrast,"" says Sharron, who's based at Marsh Billings Rockefeller National Historical Park in Woodstock, Vermont. ""There are different shades of green, of course, when you start to get that variation of oranges and reds and purples and greens all together. It's pretty spectacular."" Ed Sharron: Why leaves change color . Trees that ""have been stressed throughout the year by extensive drought or many other factors, they may decide to pack it in early and go dormant for the winter sooner than during a typical year,"" Sharron says. ""This could cause their leaves to fall off sooner or be browner than normal. Every year is different and you never can tell how good the foliage season is going to be until it's here."" The Northeast's most popular sites . Who cares if it's clichÃ© to say that first-time leaf peepers should drive New Hampshire's Kancamagus Highway; visit Woodstock or Smuggler's Notch in Vermont, or head north to Acadia National Park in Maine? ""There's a reason why they're so popular, and these are places I try to go to every year,"" says Jim Salge, a New Hampshire-based trained meteorologist and high school physics teacher who blogs about the fall foliage season for Yankee Magazine. If Salge has an extra day this year, he'll head to Dixville Notch in far northern New Hampshire, where the leaves are likely to peak by late September. ""The mountains are really jagged and have a feel unlike anywhere else in the Northeast."" Photos: Fantastic fall foliage . Between North and South . Northern and Southern trees meet peacefully at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, a National Park Service area that includes the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. ""In the Delaware Gap I think we have some of the best fall foliage,"" says Kathleen Sandt, a park ranger in the national recreation area. ""We are on the border of northern species that usually don't come down south and the border for some of the trees that grow in the southern region."" The gap is also home to trees living at different elevations. There are sycamores, elms, maples, poplars on a fertile flood plain along the river. At higher elevations, there are various types of oaks and maples to see as hikers head up toward the mountains. Tree spotters may be pleased to spot the American larch, a deciduous conifer that isn't found much farther south. It's a rare combination of a deciduous tree, which means it loses its leaves each fall; and a conifer, which has needles and cones. In the fall the larch's needles turn bright yellow and fall, like leaves. ""It grows in wetter areas in the park, and it's spectacular in the fall,"" Sandt says. Head north to Maine country . Fall is Wanda Moran's favorite season. The Acadia National Park ranger loves the cold and clear weather that is already coming to the Maine island. ""It smells like fall, the leaves start turning and it gets really pretty,"" says Moran, a Mainer by birth. ""It's a beautiful time to be here, and it's a nice hiking and biking time."" Prime leaf peeping season varies a lot throughout the state, she says. Trees are likely to change colors in Northern Maine during the last week in September, while central and Western Maine leaves will likely peak the first week in October. The coast usually peaks the week of Columbus Day and the week after, and Acadia will peak the second or third week in October. Moran's favorite spot at Acadia: ""Beech Mountain is a nice place to climb if you want to get up high. It's a pretty easy climb and you get beautiful views all together, looking way out into the ocean."" She also likes Baxter State Park and seeing the leaves on the drive from Ellsworth to Bangor on Route 1A. Leaf peeping out West . Although New England tends to dominate articles about leaf peeping, it's rumored that trees in colder parts of the rest of the United States also have leaves that change colors. As Colorado heads toward ski season, its national parks are starting to burst into fall colors. Rocky Mountain National Park is known for Trail Ridge Road, where aspen trees at lower elevations transform to gold among the evergreens. (Trail Ridge Road is also included in Peak to Peak, a state-designated scenic byway.) Colorado's White River National Forest, home to the heavily photographed Maroon Bells and 10 ski areas, is also packed with beautiful leaf peeping areas. It's also the current home of this year's Capitol Christmas Tree. Check the impressive evergreens out while they're still firmly rooted. Not surprisingly, New Mexico's five national forests also pack a lot of fall foliage at varying elevations. Carson National Forest is home to Wheeler Peak, which at 13,161 feet is the highest spot in New Mexico. Santa Fe National Forest's 1.6 million acres includes 13,103-foot-high Truchas Peak, within the Pecos Wilderness. Don't stress about ""peak foliage"" Many veteran peepers go searching for the perfect ""peak foliage"" moment in Vermont (or Maine or Massachusetts) when the leaves are the perfect combination of red, brown, orange and yellow, where the red farm house in the distance is perfectly in contrast and the apple cider tastes just crisp enough. ""It's a mythical term,"" Yankee Magazine's Allen says. ""There is no such thing."" Fifteen miles down the road, the leaves may have already fallen and another 15 miles down the road, the leaves may not be ready to fall. ""Think it of it as a continuum and make it a journey.""

"Paris (CNN) -- France's ex-First Lady, Valérie Trierweiler, is back with a vengeance. A few hours after her memoirs of her relationship with President François Hollande, called ""Merci pour ce moment"" (Thanks for the moment) hit the bookstands in France, a new poll showed that the President's approval ratings were in free fall, reaching the historical low of 13%. Some extracts had been leaked to the press the day before and Paris Match, Trierweiler's employer, had exclusively revealed the ""best pages,"" or rather the most damning pages about the President. On Thursday evening, her publisher revealed that in just a few hours of sales, her essay was doing three times better than Fifty Shades of Grey when it was launched. On Amazon, her book was selling like hot brioches, with one copy sold every five seconds. However, French political commentators, and for that matter the entire political class -- allies and foes alike -- dragged again to invade the privacy of the president, are clearly showing signs of farce fatigue and don't relish his ex-girlfriend's exercise in character assassination. They may have been amused back in January 2014 to learn of their President's gallivanting in the streets of Paris, on a scooter driven by a bodyguard, en route to his belle, actress Julie Gayet, but today, they are not impressed. The truth is that nobody comes out unscathed. Literature is perhaps the first casualty in this never-ending scandal, and on two levels. September is traditionally the literary season in France during which hundreds of new novels appear (600 this year) and vie for some space in the media. No doubt Valérie Trierweiler's book, by generating so much comment and covering so much space, will have ruined the prospect of many worthy first novels. Secondly, ""Merci pour ce moment"" reads like a cheap romance and is an embarrassment for a former Paris Match literary critic. A few examples: ""one day, a violent love blazed through my life like fire."" On their first kiss, in the middle of a cross-road in Limoges: ""It was indescribable, just like a scene out of a movie."" And the book's epitaph: ""I was not protected nor was I betrothed. I only hope I was loved as much as I loved."" Trierweiler is no Flaubert. On the revelation of the President's affair, Trierweiler keeps talking about ""betrayal,"" a word she also strangely uses to talk about Ségolène Royal, the mother of the President's four children whom Hollande left for her. In fact, Trierweiler was hoping for ""a scenario à la Clinton"" with Hollande ""apologizing in public and committing to never see Julie Gayet again."" Except we are in France and a French President doesn't apologize publicly for having had a fling. She was ready to forgive him, she says. When Hollande decides on the contrary to break up, he suggests to her to write a joint communiqué, but she refuses; he also asks her not to write a book about it all. What is very dubious about Trierweiler's exercise is that she claims her life at the Elysées Palace was like being on a reporting assignment and that is how she says she wrote her book. Only problem is, a reporter cannot be the main actor of the events he or she is supposed to be describing. Also, this is one version of events. We all know that a break-up has many sides; and that truth is the most elusive of concepts in love. Trierweiler herself comes out very badly: by dishing the dirt in public, she appears as she is, a scorned woman who can't get over it, full of revenge and full of herself. Did she ever think of France when she wrote her book? Did she think of the country's institutions? Couldn't she have waited until her former lover left the Elysées Palace? For a former First Lady, she shows little sympathy for her compatriots and her country. The greatest casualty however in this affair, is President Hollande and his image, which is now damaged beyond repair. In her 320-page bitter attack, she presents him as a liar, cold and cynic. She also writes that he mocked her modest origins, calling people like her family ""the toothless"". Not quite what you might expect from a socialist President.","Former French First Lady publishes book about her relationship with Francois Hollande .

"Washington (CNN) -- It should come to no surprise that Jim Messina, one of the masterminds behind President Obama's successful presidential campaigns, is ready for Hillary Clinton in 2016, but he also has a few Republicans he hopes will throw their hats in the ring. In an interview with Ozy's CEO Carlos Watson, Messina jokes that he's ""really rooting hard"" for Tea Party favorite Sarah Palin, before pledging his support behind Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. The full interview will publish on Ozy.com on Wednesday. As the co-chairman of Priorities USA Action, a super PAC already anticipating Hillary Clinton's run, Messina said a Clinton and Cruz race would be a ""wonderful gift"" for him. Get ready: 2016 starts now . When asked about Rand Paul's chances of securing the Republican nomination, Messina thought it was a far cry from reality. ""I think if you look at his statements and you look at his record he would be the most right wing candidate that any major party has nominated ... He is that far off the spectrum,"" he said. ""I think his chances of winning swing votes in battleground states are my chances of being the starting quarterback of the Denver Broncos."" GOP 2016 hopefuls weigh in on midterm results . Messina thinks the Republican tide that overtook the Senate last week isn't a paved path for them to get to the White House in two years. Obama's former chief of staff thinks the party will destroy its own chances of winning in 2016. ""They are having a fight for the soul of their party, which I think is going to be devastating to them,"" he said. ""If you look at the battleground states, more states are coming on the map for us. States that weren't competitive like Virginia, like North Carolina, Arizona's going to come in '16. I think [Clinton's] a good candidate in some of these places and can make Georgia competitive."" 2014: Did Hillary Clinton get her grove back despite Democrats' loss . Georgia has stayed a deep red state for decades, but Messina thinks Clinton has a chance if she manages to get white women, Latinos, and African Americans to the polls. More spending in the state can also play a decisive role. ""Barack Obama didn't spend a single dollar in Georgia either time and got 45 and 46 percent. And if you just look at the demographics -- I'm a math geek, right, I love data -- and data says that Georgia is going to make the same move that North Carolina made.""","Jim Messina said Republicans don't appear to have a clear front-runner like Democrats .

"(CNN) -- A Georgia man is heading to prison for nearly 10 years for his role in a credit card fraud gang associated with a website called Carder.su that is linked to $50 million in worldwide losses. Cameron Harrison, aka ""Kilobit,"" 28, of Augusta, Georgia, pleaded guilty to possessing more than 260 compromised credit and debit card numbers, which were recovered from his computer and email accounts following his arrest. He also admitted, according to the Department of Justice, that the Carder.su organization committed money laundering, narcotics trafficking and computer crimes. He said members tried to avoid detection by communicating through various encrypted forums, such as chat rooms, private messaging systems and virtual private networks. Harrison was identified when he purchased a counterfeit Georgia driver's license from an undercover special agent through the Carder.su network. During interactions with the undercover special agent, Harrison admitted he had been a vendor of counterfeit identifications in the defunct cyberfraud organization ""ShadowCrew."" Fifty-five individuals were charged in four separate indictments in Operation Open Market, run by Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Secret Service. To date, 26 individuals have been convicted and the rest are either fugitives or are awaiting trial. Harrison pleaded guilty to participating in a racketeer influenced corrupt organization, conspiracy to engage in a racketeer influenced and corrupt organization, and trafficking in and production of false identification documents.

"(CNN) -- Gregory Sancoff thinks he knows what the Navy needs, even before U.S. war planners do. The Navy, he says, needs Ghost. Sancoff is CEO of Juliet Marine Systems â€” maker of a futuristic-looking, 21st-century warship that he says can protect large Navy ships from attacks by small boats. Simply put, Ghost looks a lot like an F-117 ""stealth"" attack jet â€” on skis. A year after unveiling Ghost and pricing it at $10 million per boat, the Navy has unofficially expressed interest, Sancoff said, but nothing more. The 60-foot long Ghost is shown bristling with weapons in slickly produced Juliet videos while its stealthy silhouette slices effortlessly and ominously through the water. It surpasses 50 knots (57 mph) by surrounding each ski with a bubble of air that helps it cut through water much easier than regular boats. It's a concept called super-cavitation. Ghost can be operated by a three-person crew. But this vessel also performs without a crew if needed, operated by remote control from a nearby ship. It can deploy 18 special forces troops without drawing too much attention. If Washington isn't taking a close look at Ghost, Sancoff wants to know if it's because his firm is too small. ""Our country right now is not that aggressive when it comes to working with small, innovative, high-tech companies,"" Sancoff told CNN on the phone this week. ""I love to pose the question: Where are the Googles, the Microsofts, the Apples, in the defense industry?"" ""A lot of times the reason why small companies don't venture into it is because the barriers of entry are so difficult."" For its part, the Pentagon says there's no official ""requirement"" for Ghost. Translation: Before the Navy can contract to buy Juliet's Ghosts, war planners must tell Congress it's necessary for the nation's defense plan. Then the Pentagon would have to persuade lawmakers to shell out tax dollars to buy it. The Pentagon wouldn't comment to CNN specifically about Ghost. But Cmdr. Thurraya Kent, a spokeswoman for the assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition, told CNN in an e-mail, ""It's not procedure to procure a system without established requirements."" ""That said, industry input is encouraged and assists the [Department of the Navy] with innovation and the pursuit of emerging technologies,"" Kent wrote. Sancoff said his company is ""in constant communications with the Navy,"" but ""it's very, very difficult to get through to the decision makers at the Pentagon today."" Officials representing Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Japan have engaged in ""serious discussions"" about Ghost with Juliet Marine, Sancoff said. But so far, none have signed purchase contracts. It's unusual for a private contractor to build a near-fully functional prototype naval vessel long before the Pentagon has committed to a purchase. ""We understood really early on that when you bring something this revolutionary to the government, it's not going to be readily accepted. We knew we had to prove the technology worked to even sell it."" Clearly, Sancoff is deeply committed to his company's project. And he has been since 2000, when 17 sailors died in Yemen in the infamous attack on the Navy destroyer USS Cole. Al Qaeda terrorists in a small boat set off explosives near the Cole, revealing the threat that small, high-speed boats pose to U.S warships near coastlines. ""That showed every terrorist you can take very few assets and very little money and you can just about sink a Navy destroyer,"" Sancoff said. Now 14 years later, Sancoff said such attacks remain among the Navy's biggest threats. He's pushing Ghost as a deterrent to protect thousands of sailors who he said are still in harm's way in the Persian Gulf. Longtime Washington-based defense policy expert John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org told CNN, ""It's hard to see what problem [Ghost] solves that hasn't already been solved several other ways."" Traditionally the Navy ""hasn't had much use for such small craft,"" Pike wrote to CNN via e-mail, ""apart from inshore operations, since they generally don't operate well in the open ocean due to large waves."" Ghost is incredibly stable in heavy seas, Sancoff said, thanks to a gyroscope-stablized platform with sensors constantly monitoring and compensating for the rolling waves. ""One of the obstacles that we've had to face,"" he said, ""is that when you're introducing something so new as Ghost -- something that hasn't been done before, thought of before, that flies completely differently than any other vessel -- it takes time for the government to be able to understand and to adapt to it."" For generations it's been common for companies to take decades to develop and sell a successful weapons program to Uncle Sam. ""We set out to change that paradigm,"" he said. ""This is much more like you'd see a high-tech start-up develop their business."" That reminds Sancoff of another machine that the U.S. failed to embrace quickly. ""The Wright brothers tried to convince the secretary of war for years that an airplane was viable,"" Sancoff said, but, according to historians, ""initial negotiations went nowhere."" And we all know what happened after that.","Company offers Pentagon a fast, stealthy attack boat called Ghost .

"(CNN) -- Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" has risen once again. Starz is at work on a TV series follow-up to the classic horror franchise, which kicked off in 1981 with the namesake ""The Evil Dead."" In the first film, we were introduced to Bruce Campbell's Ash Williams, who takes an ill-fated vacation with friends to an isolated cabin in the woods of Tennessee. Within that cabin was the Book of the Dead, which unleashed some horrific demons -- and the start of a popular movie franchise. There have been two additional ""Evil Dead"" movies, plus a reboot in 2013. Starz's series is going to revive Campbell's Ash Williams, ""the stock boy, aging lothario and chainsaw-handed monster hunter who has spent the last 30 years avoiding responsibility, maturity and the terrors of the Evil Dead,"" the synopsis says. ""When a Deadite plague threatens to destroy all of mankind, Ash is finally forced to face his demons -- personal and literal. Destiny, it turns out, has no plans to release the unlikely hero from its 'Evil' grip."" The official title of the project is ""Ash vs. Evil Dead,"" and Starz is planning for 10 half-hour episodes. The best news is that Campbell's back as Ash, and Raimi's on board as a writer and director. Producer Rob Tapert is also returning to executive produce with Campbell and Raimi. ""'Evil Dead' has always been a blast,"" Raimi said in a statement. ""Bruce, Rob and I are thrilled to have the opportunity to tell the next chapter in Ash's lame, but heroic saga. With his chainsaw arm and his 'boomstick,' Ash is back to kick some monster butt. And brother, this time there's a truckload of it."" Added Campbell, ""I'm really excited to bring this series to the 'Evil Dead' fans worldwide -- it's going to be everything they have been clamoring for: serious Deadite ass-kicking and plenty of outrageous humor.""","Sam Raimi is producing an ""Evil Dead"" series on Starz .

"Sioux Falls, South Dakota (CNN) -- A dimly lit sports bar reading ""cowboy poetry"" is not exactly where you'd expect to find a candidate for U.S. Senate. But this was a campaign event Wednesday for Larry Pressler, a former Republican senator now running as an independent 18 years after he was voted out of office. He joined a meeting of the Badger Clark Poetry Society, of which is he a member, to get his campaign messages across with couplets and free verse. ""Take Care of Your Friends"" by the western poet Baxter Black was one of the poems he chose to read, saying it reflects what he is trying to do -- bring civility back to a broken Senate. Among the apropos lines in Black's poem, read by Pressler: . ""A hug or a shake or whatever seems right. It's a highpoint of giving, I'll tell you tonight. All worldly riches and tributes of men can't hold a candle to the worth of a friend."" Just in case it was a bit too subtle, Pressler hit it home with an explanation. ""In today's Washington you can hardly have a friend because you're categorized immediately. I've said that I think our leaders should be able to visit together, more civility should be returned to Washington, D.C,"" Pressler told the crowd of a couple dozen people. He also read a poem called ""Homecoming Queen,"" written by South Dakota poet M.J. McMillan, who was in attendance. ""Homecoming Queen"" is about a beautiful young girl whose life didn't turn out the way she had hoped, becoming an embittered 40 year-old a waitress: . ""Waitin' tables and cryin' the blues. Don't judge her too harshly 'till you've had the chance to walk a few miles in her shoes"" It was another campaign message -- that the former Republican cares about the underdogs -- those who need a second chance, or a second look. It was an off-beat event befitting an unusual candidacy. Pressler voted for Barack Obama twice, yet he contributed to Mitt Romney's campaign. ""I want to work with both sides,"" Pressler said in an interview following his poetry reading. Suddenly what was supposed to be a slam-dunk for Republican candidate Mike Rounds is more competitive, thanks in part to an anemic campaign and a scandal from his time as governor. Pressler's presence in the race has made it even more unpredictable, since he is a well-known figure, especially for older voters. Strategists in both parties believe he pulls votes more from Rounds than the Democratic candidate, Rick Weiland -- but both sides are going after him. ""I'm bad to Republicans and Democrats. That's reflective of what is happening across the board in the United States. You can't be a friend with anybody else and admit to it,"" Pressler told CNN. He supports Obamacare (with some changes) and opposes the standard GOP promise to eliminate the Department of Education. On abortion, he insists he does not believe Roe vs. Wade should be overturned, despite what appeared to be contradictory statements on the issue. It's no wonder he says he stopped being a Republican because it went too far to the right in this state. He says he donated $100,000 of his own savings to his campaign, took out another $100,000 loan and raised about the same. He only has one full time paid staffer, and two part timers and sends out his own press releases. Before he was defeated, Pressler served three Senate terms -- 18 years . This time around Pressler is vowing to only stay one term so that he is beholden to no outside special interests. ""Today's United States Senators spend about 52% of their time raising money, either for themselves or their colleagues for the next election. I will not have a next election. This is my last campaign, win or lose, and if I were in the Senate it would be a glorious job because I wouldn't have to raise money,"" Pressler told us. He won't say which party he will caucus with if he does pull off a win -- thanks to advice from Maine's Independent Senator Angus King. ""He said it's a very appropriate thing for an independent not to say which side you're caucusing with. That's the approach he took, and the reason is then I would be running as just another Republican or Democrat,"" Pressler said. Since Pressler was defeated in 1996, he has spent a lot of time still in Washington -- another line of attack from opponents, especially Republicans. But he makes no apologies for that, but also insists he spends ""half to three quarters"" of his time in South Dakota. He is quite realistic about his chances for re-election saying ""its going to be tough."" But, he insists, it's about the ""journey"" rather than the destination.","Larry Pressler is a former Republican now running as an independent Senate candidate.
