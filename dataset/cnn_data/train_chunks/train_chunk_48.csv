"Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Another person has been added to the list of suspects in the January killing of a Hamas leader in a Dubai hotel, bringing the number of identified suspects to 27, two sources told CNN on Monday. Twenty-six of the 27 were carrying European and Australian passports, authorities have said. The sources, an official familiar with the investigation and a police source, did not say which nation issued the passport the suspect used. Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing, was found dead January 20 in his Dubai hotel room. Police believe he was slain the night before, allegedly by the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit Mossad. Earlier Monday, sources in Dubai said two of the suspects ultimately entered the United States after al-Mabhouh's death, confirming a story originally reported by the Wall Street Journal. But a national security source in the United States cast doubt on that report. Federal authorities ran the two names -- Roy Allen Cannon and Evan Dennings -- through databases and found no indication that anyone with those names or using those names entered the United States after the Dubai killing, the U.S. source said. The Dubai sources said the suspect identified as Dennings, carrying an Irish passport, went to Zurich, Switzerland, immediately after the slaying, then entered the United States on January 21. The suspect identified as Cannon entered the United States on a British passport on February 14, the sources said. Both should have been required to provide fingerprints and a picture upon arrival in America, the sources said. On Sunday, Dubai's police chief said he is ""100 percent sure"" that the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit Mossad is behind al-Mabhouh's death. ""The Mossad needs to be ashamed of its actions,"" said Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim. ""They sent 26, 27 persons to assassinate one man who was involved in the capturing and killing of two Israeli soldiers."" Hamas has said al-Mabhouh was behind the 1989 deaths. Israel has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, however, told Israel Army Radio earlier this month, ""There is certainly no reason to think that the Mossad and not some other intelligence agency of another country operated there."" Lieberman has also said only ""media reports"" link Israel to the slaying. Asked about the case Saturday by CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak repeatedly declined to comment. Earlier Sunday, police said toxicology results showed that al-Mabhouh was injected with succinylcholine, a drug used to relax muscles during surgery or as an anesthetic, before he was suffocated. Signs indicated that al-Mabhouh resisted as he was being suffocated, police said. Family members were told earlier that police had found blood on a pillow. Authorities have also said the killers left some of al-Mabhouh's medication next to him in an apparent effort to make the death appear natural. But ""the medication left next to him in the room has nothing to do with the killing,"" Tamim said Sunday. However, authorities have recovered evidence including DNA, he said. ""The DNA evidence is quite important and will help us with the investigation."" The 27 suspects are believed to have acquired false passports to travel to Dubai for the killing, then scattered to several far-flung locations afterward. Tamim said Sunday not all the suspects have fraudulent passports -- ""We know some of the names are real."" The total of 27 does not include two Palestinians previously arrested in Jordan and returned to Dubai. Tamim said one is not believed to be directly involved in al-Mabhouh's death, but ""he is wanted by one of the Palestinian factions in the Palestinian territories and he is sentenced to death and that's why we will extradite him."" He declined to discuss anything about the other Palestinian. Twelve of the suspects used British passports, police said. Six suspects used Irish passports, four used French passports, three used Australian and one used a German passport. Also Monday, the sources said the UAE central bank is working with other nations to track funding and 14 credit cards -- issued mostly by a United States bank -- used by the suspects in different places, including the United States.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- Haiti's capital seemed to spring back to life Wednesday, more than a week after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake flattened many parts of the city and killed tens of thousands. Electrical power was still out most places, but traffic lights were functioning and chaotic traffic clogged many streets. Aid trucks, some guarded by blue-helmeted United Nations peacekeepers, were seen leaving the airport. Water trucks also were spotted in parts of Port-au-Prince. ""There's energy in the air,"" said Haitian-born J.B. Diederich, who lives in Miami but returned to Haiti for a few days after the earthquake. More U.N. convoys were seen moving through the city than in previous days, and so could vehicles for large nongovernmental organizations. Latest updates | Twitter | Full coverage . Haitian police seemed to take a more active role, directing traffic and getting out of their vehicles to deal with some problem or other. For several days after the earthquake, heavily armed police officers were often seen speeding by in their trucks but did not seem to stop or do much. There also seemed to be more street vendors Wednesday. Some banks and wire-transfer companies plan to open Thursday, as do some stores, Diederich said. To be certain, Port-au-Prince still has a ways to go. But on Wednesday, the city seemed ready to leave the tragedy behind. A way out for U.S. citizens . Any U.S. citizen who wants to leave Haiti on a U.S. military transport aircraft can do so simply by going to the airport and applying for voluntary departure at a State Department office placed on the tarmac. About 5,000 people have left in the past week, an official said. iReport: Search list for missing and found . The service is available to U.S. citizens or anyone escorting a U.S. citizen who is a minor. Although the flights are initially free, the U.S. will try to recoup costs from individual passengers. The cargo planes would return to the United States empty if they weren't transporting citizens. Cubans wait with no way out . A handful of Cuban citizens stood in a line next to the U.S. State Department tent at the airport while about 100 U.S. citizens were processed for a flight Wednesday afternoon. The Cubans wanted out, too, but there were no waiting planes. There weren't even any indications that a Cuban plane would arrive at all. Impact Your World . ""Here everyone resolves their problems, and we don't even have a way to get home,"" said a woman who did not want to give her name. None of the three people interviewed by a CNN reporter would give their names.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- A large crane used to load and unload containers from cargo vessels, was bent, twisted and leaning toward the water at the main port for Haiti's capital city on Thursday. Roads leading toward the city from a dock normally used for offloading ships were impassable, buckled about 5 feet high by Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake. Three vessels loaded down with medical supplies, food, clothing and water for earthquake victims had nowhere to dock and offload, according to a Haitian shipping company who provided them. Meanwhile, so many aid planes had landed at the Port-au-Prince's airport that a bottleneck was created, and space to unload aid items was at a premium. Some planes were held in the air because there was no space to land and unload them. The Haitian government stopped accepting flights Thursday because ramp space at the airport in Port-au-Prince was saturated and no fuel was available, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown. The FAA put a ground stop in effect, meaning the United States was not granting takeoff clearances for Haiti until it was notified space was available. ""There is one big problem,"" said Raymond Joseph, Haitian ambassador to the United States, on CNN's ""Amanpour."" ""The aid is coming now and getting to the Port-au-Prince airport. And it's not getting out, because of the road system."" He said he hoped the United States and other nations would bring in equipment to help clear the roads. In addition, he said, the airport was overcrowded. ""And that is due, probably, to the fact that the control tower fell ... but we understand that the U.S., especially the Defense Department, was putting up an emergency control tower."" Weary Haiti continues search for survivors . State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday afternoon that U.S. military air traffic controllers were running Port-au-Prince's airport, per an agreement with the Haitian government. However, the government was in charge of airspace, Crowley said. Earlier Thursday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said the quake's aftermath represented ""a major humanitarian disaster."" He said the international goal is to save as many lives as possible within the first 72 hours following the quake. Ban called the outpouring of global support ""one of the most heartening facts in this otherwise heartbreaking story."" Nations worldwide were sending doctors, medical supplies, medicine, food and water, as well as security personnel and troops. French President Nicolas Sarkozy suggested the world use the crisis in Haiti as an opportunity to help the nation move out of its difficult economic situation, and is calling on leaders of several nations to set up a conference to discuss Haitian reconstruction and rehabilitation. One of two U.S. military cargo planes carrying a 30-member assessment team arrived at Port-au-Prince airport Wednesday evening to assess Haiti's needs. One of the team's first jobs is to get the airport working enough to handle aid flights from around the world. Also Thursday, the United Kingdom announced it would provide $10 million for relief efforts. Belize, Brazil, China, Chile, Spain, Canada, Israel, Iceland, Ireland, the United States and Morocco were among the many other countries offering aid. Global agencies also were assisting. The World Bank pledged $100 million in emergency funds. The World Health Organization was dispatching personnel to Haiti Thursday morning, with a priority of identifying hospitals functioning well enough to treat the injured and coordinate an international health response. After relief organizations found themselves tripping over one another following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, they decided to coordinate their efforts with those of non-United Nations organizations in what is called the ""U.N. Cluster System."" In the system, the World Health Organization plays the lead coordinating role for health; the U.N. high commissioner for Refugees or the Red Cross does it for shelter; and the World Food Programme does it for food, according to Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications. The United Nations was releasing $10 million from its Central Emergency Relief Fund, as well as mobilizing an emergency response team. Ban said he had appointed Assistant Secretary-General Edmond Mulet to Haiti to direct the emergency response from Haiti. One Chinese and two U.S. search and rescue teams were arriving Wednesday, he said, with more expected Thursday. Impact Your World: How you can help . Former U.S. President Bill Clinton urged people to donate to www.clintonfoundation.org/haitiearthquake. ""Anybody who sends us money, we're just going to move it into those supplies quickly,"" he said. He urged world leaders who have already made a commitment at a Clinton Foundation donors' conference to ensure they had fulfilled it. ""Most countries are way behind on fulfilling it,"" he said. ""They [Haitians] need your help now."" Ban said the United Nations will issue a ""flash appeal"" on Friday. The U.N. defines a flash appeal as a tool for structuring a coordinated humanitarian response for the first three to six months of an emergency. However, officials are trying to figure out how much to request, Ban said. ""It is very hard at this time to have an exact estimate."" The Red Cross promised $10 million in aid, along with supplies such as tarps, mosquito nets and cooking sets. The World Food Programme was airlifting 86 metric tons of food, enough for more than 500,000 meals, including ready-to-eat food and high-energy biscuits, it said. Doctors Without Borders said in a statement it has treated more than 1,000 people since the earthquake, operating out of open-air hospitals, and its primary concern is ""the overwhelming numbers of people who need immediate treatment and major surgery."" Food, water and shelter materials are also in short supply, said the organization. http://www.clintonfoundation.org/haitiearthquake/ . Numerous other aid groups -- Islamic Relief USA, AmeriCares, UNICEF, the International Rescue Committee and the Salvation Army, among others -- were also contributing to relief efforts. UNICEF relief worker Guido Cornale told CNN that in Jacmel, a city southwest of Port-au-Prince, UNICEF was providing clean drinking water to those affected by the quake and has distributed 2,500 kits that can be used to set up kitchens in camps set up by the government to house victims. Aid also came from other, more unconventional sources. The Jolie-Pitt Foundation, started by actors Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, donated $1 Million to Doctors Without Borders; the New York Yankees donated $500,000, Major League Baseball $1 million. And the American Red Cross and musician Wyclef Jean's Yele foundation were accepting donations by text message -- $10 by texting ""Haiti"" to 90999, and $5 by texting ""Yele"" to 501501. The donations will appear on cell phone bills. And businesses including UPS, Google, Coca-Cola, Lowe's, the Bank of America Charitable Foundation and Wal-Mart each pledged at least $500,000 for relief efforts.

"London, England (CNN) -- The iconic Abbey Road music studios made famous by the Beatles are not for sale, the music label that owns them said Sunday, after days of speculation that they were. It is seeking a partner to help pay for upgrades, according to Terra Firma, which controls EMI, owner of the recording studios. ""EMI confirms that it is holding preliminary discussions for the revitalization of Abbey Road with interested and appropriate third parties,"" Terra Firma said. But that does not mean the studios are for sale, it added. ""In mid-2009, we did receive an offer to buy Abbey Road for in excess of £30 million (currently about $46 million), but this was rejected since we believe that Abbey Road should remain in EMI's ownership,"" the music company said in a statement. The studios became world famous when the Beatles were photographed crossing the road there for the cover of their album ""Abbey Road."" But it's not only where the Beatles recorded ""All You Need is Love"" and numerous other songs, but where much of Britain's best known music of the 20th century was laid down. Rock stars Pink Floyd and Cliff Richard, composer Sir Edward Elgar, and the movie soundtracks for ""Star Wars"" and the ""Harry Potter"" films were recorded there. English Heritage, a cultural institution, is considering plans to list the studios as a site of national historic importance, Terra Firma said. That would give it protected status. ""EMI ... supports such a listing as an appropriate way of protecting our world famous music heritage site,"" the company said Sunday. Terra Firma bought EMI in 2007. Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Cats"" and one of Britain's richest men, is ""very interested"" in buying the studios, a representative said Friday. ""He first recorded there in 1967 with Tim Rice. Andrew has since recorded most of his musicals there,"" said the representative, Jenni Pain. ""He thinks it is vital that the studios are saved for the future of the music industry in the UK. Abbey Road has such great facilities, with three major recording studios, and Andrew has probably brought more musicians to record there than anyone else, because it has the capacity to record large orchestral productions."" CNN's Per Nyberg and Morgan Neill contributed to this report.","EMI, the music label that owns studios, says it's holding talks for revitalizing them .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The United States plans to appeal a federal judge's dismissal of charges against five Blackwater security guards accused of killing 17 people in Baghdad in 2007, Vice President Joe Biden announced Saturday. Speaking at a joint appearance with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani in Baghdad, Biden said he was ""disappointed"" with the ruling, and that the Justice Department would file the appeal next week. ""The United States is determined to hold accountable anyone who commits crimes against the Iraqi people,"" Biden told reporters. The September 2007 shootout in Baghdad's Nusoor Square left 17 Iraqis dead and two dozen wounded. The killings led Iraq's government to slap limits on security contractors hired by Blackwater, now known as Xe, and other firms. An attorney representing one of the five defendants in the case said he was disappointed by Biden's announcement in Iraq, saying it was motivated by ""political purposes"" as opposed to legal reasoning. ""This is not how the Justice Department announces its intentions in any case,"" said David Schertler, attorney for Dustin Heard. ""We had no idea that the vice president was going to announce a political decision."" Last month, U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina found that the government's case was built largely on ""statements compelled under a threat of job loss in a subsequent criminal prosecution,"" a violation of the Fifth Amendment rights of the five men charged. ""In their zeal to bring charges against the defendant in this case, the prosecutors and investigators aggressively sought out statements the defendants had been compelled to make to government investigators in the immediate aftermath of the shooting and in the subsequent investigation,"" Urbina wrote in a 90-page decision. Federal prosecutors ""repeatedly disregarded the warnings of experienced, senior prosecutors assigned to the case"" in doing so, he found. Urbina also sharply criticized prosecutors and federal agents who developed the case, calling their explanations for using the guards' statements ""all too often contradictory, unbelievable and lacking in credibility."" ""In short, the government has utterly failed to prove that it made no impermissible use of the defendants' statements or that such use was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,"" he wrote. Schertler, Heard's attorney, said Urbina's ""reasoning is sound and will hold up in appeal."" The men were guarding a State Department convoy moving through western Baghdad when the shooting began. The company said its contractors came under attack, but Iraqi authorities called the gunfire unprovoked and indiscriminate. Each of the now-former guards -- Paul Slough, Evan Liberty, Dustin Heard, Donald Ball and Nicholas Slatten -- faced 14 counts of manslaughter, 20 counts of attempted manslaughter and one count of using a firearm in the commission of a violent crime. Prosecutors requested that charges against Slatten be dropped in November, but Thursday's ruling dismisses the counts against all five. ""We're obviously pleased at the decision dismissing the entire indictment and are very happy that these courageous young men can begin the new year without this unfair cloud hanging over them,"" Slough's lawyer, Mark Hulkower, said at the time of the dismissal. A sixth guard, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty in 2008 to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. CNN's Dan Lothian and Samira Simone contributed to this report.","Five Blackwater security guards accused of killing 17 people in Baghdad in 2007 .

"(Coastal Living) -- New Orleans without music? That's like Venice without canals -- and just as hard to imagine. Music weaves New Orleans' past with its present, and the infinite jazz variations -- from the ethereal warble of classic Dixieland to the tuba-powered street funk of brass bands -- serve as a soundtrack to this storied city. The best way to keep New Orleans music alive? Visit. New Orleans music sounds sweeter today, and here's why: In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, few were certain the streets would resound as they once did. It's not that clubs flooded and venues were wiped out -- many were on high ground and survived just fine -- but the rising waters took out much of the city's affordable housing and its tourism industry. That uncertain future made it unclear whether pass-the-hat musicians and hardworking club regulars would be able to regain their footing in the city. But several groups took the lead to ensure that musicians would still have a home in New Orleans. Locally revered nightclub Tipitina's earmarks its proceeds to help musicians return to town and to put musical instruments back into the flooded schools. Harry Connick Jr. and Branford Marsalis, two New Orleans natives, partnered with Habitat for Humanity to build the Musicians' Village in the Upper Ninth Ward. Today, this cluster of colorful shotgun-style cottages, located an easy bike ride from the French Quarter, is gradually being filled by musicians (and others) as volunteers continue to travel here to build the houses. CoastalLiving.com: Beyond Bourbon Street . While some still debate whether the music scene has fully regained its pre-storm luster, there's no denying that anyone who shows up hungry for the famous New Orleans sound will leave sated. You can still stroll the French Quarter or nearby Frenchmen Street and pass dozens of clubs where languid notes wander out into the muffled, humid air, pause for a moment, and disappear into the night. The best way to keep New Orleans music alive? Visit. And bring your friends. Go to clubs. Here are four not to miss. Snug Harbor Jazz Bistro has the feel of a speakeasy -- you enter through a low-ceilinged bar into an open performance space that's at once intimate and grand. With live music nightly, this is a good spot for classic, straight-ahead jazz. Expect talents such as Ellis Marsalis (father of Branford and Wynton), Charmaine Neville (a member of New Orleans' first family of music), and powerhouse trumpet player Irvin Mayfield with his New Orleans Jazz Orchestra. CoastalLiving.com: Gulf Coast Eateries . Three decades ago, a handful of local musicians was dismayed that piano legend Professor Longhair had no place to showcase his talents. They acquired a bar Uptown (it's about a 10-minute cab ride from the French Quarter), and renamed the venue after the Professor's signature song. Today Tipitina's, a spacious, two-level club in a boxy yellow building marked by a Dixie beer sign, attracts local and touring musicians ranging from inimitable songwriter-composer Allen Toussaint to rising stars such as Troy ""Trombone Shorty"" Andrews. Seating is nonexistent -- assume you'll be standing the whole show --but the open space works to your advantage on Sunday evenings, when Tip's hosts a Cajun dance party, with the emphasis on dance. For the gold standard of New Orleans performance venues, visit Preservation Hall. Carved out of a 1750 Creole residence in the heart of the French Quarter, it's had the self-appointed mission of preserving local music since 1961. The audience lines up on the sidewalk, crowds in (it's one of the few places in town to enjoy music without smoke), then taps their feet along with bands schooled in the old ways of New Orleans. Great local musicians perform regularly, all linked by their devotion to traditional music. Thursdays are typically brass-band nights, where the ""big"" gets put in ""big New Orleans sound. When people imagine a laid-back New Orleans jazz club, they're thinking of a place like Donna's Bar and Grill. Smoky and utterly un-self-conscious, the corner bar sits on a fringe of the French Quarter where few tourists happen by. Inside, it's too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. Black-and-white photos of venerable New Orleans bands hang unevenly on the walls. But the music! It showcases a revolving cast of local greats, with Monday gigs by George French and vocalist Germaine Bazzle, and rollicking appearances by barrelhouse piano player Tom McDermott. Arrive before the show to get one of the handful of seats at the bar or in front of the low stage, grab a cold beer, then let the music take you away. It's not too early to plan a trip to New Orleans for the French Quarter Festival, featuring more than 150 musical performances on 18 stages. The event runs April 17-19, 2009.

"(CNN) -- There was a phrase, or so we have long been told, that was heard in occupied Europe during World War II. It was often said as a whisper, the story goes. It had the sound of a prayer. The words were so simple, but to people who were feeling utterly abandoned and who needed help, those words meant so much. Four words: . ""The Americans are coming."" Sometimes we forget about the power of those words, and about how, for so long, they defined the real meaning of what this country, at its best, could be. Sometimes, in the midst of all the bad news, in the midst of the mistakes this country inevitably makes, we lose sight of how much the people of the United States are counted on by those in need. Which is why the humanitarian efforts in Haiti this month, in the wake of the earthquake, have been a reminder of who we are when we strive to find our finest selves. The relief efforts have been an international undertaking; the heartache on the streets of Haiti has summoned compassionate and heroic assistance from around the globe, all of it deserving of praise and gratitude. But the United States has been at the forefront, as it has so often seemed to be in so many places when hope was in short supply. It is almost beyond imagining to think what has been in the terrified minds of the citizens of Haiti who have been without water, without food, without a way to rescue their trapped and dying children. When there is nothing left to depend on, when all is desolation and despair, what must the hungry and the hurt wish for as they look into the empty distance? Someone to care. Someone to travel many miles, with the will and the means to heal. The slowness with which medical supplies and water and heavy equipment have reached the people of Haiti has been thoroughly reported. Some of the results of the relief effort have been troubling, beset by bottlenecks and breakdowns under arduous conditions. But this is not about the frustrations in getting the job done. It is about the American impulse to help. There is nothing particularly controversial, these days, about pointing out the failings of the United States. You can say just about any derogatory thing about the U.S., and it's not especially shocking. We're used to hearing it. Already, as the tragedy in Haiti continues to unfold, there have been pockets of harsh criticism of America's efforts to help. French Cooperation Minister Alain Joyandet alluded to the United States ""occupying"" Haiti instead of assisting it. It is not the first time the United States has been chastised, and it will not be the last. The history of the U.S. involvement in Haiti has not always been a happy or unsullied one. But perhaps we can take just a moment to think about the honor that is inherent in being the ones who, at junctures like this one, are counted on -- the ones who show up, every time. During World War II, those four words -- ""The Americans are coming"" -- referred to the armed forces who had traveled across the ocean to liberate the people the Nazis had enslaved. In times of natural disaster, the context is different. In Haiti the words refer to the 82nd Airborne, yes, but they also refer to the American doctors who are volunteering their time and risking their own safety to soothe the pain of people they had never before met. The words refer to the American volunteers assisting at Haitian orphanages, not giving up on the children who have no families to comfort them. The words refer to the American search-and-rescue teams who work past the point of exhaustion as they seek signs of the living among the rubble, and they refer to the Americans back home who, during difficult economic times in the U.S., have donated their money to help people who, for now, have no way to say thank you. The focus of the news will shift soon enough -- that shift has already started. There will be other crises, other major stories. We, as a country and as individuals, will continue to be imperfect. There will be political squabbles and high-decibel partisan fights. We will at times focus on the trivial and the coarse. At such times, we might do well to pause and recall the sound of those four words. And to let the words remind us that, when we set our souls to it, we still can aspire to be the hope of the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Haiti aid operation continues tradition of U.S. helping around the world, says Bob Greene .

"A Chinese court has sentenced four people to death for their roles in last year's deadly riots in the western city of Urumqi, state media said Tuesday. The sentences for the defendants were to be carried out immediately. They were charged with ""extremely serious crimes,"" said state-run Xinjiang Daily. The newspaper said a fifth person, who was also sentenced to death, was granted a two-year reprieve. Several others were given varying jail sentences, including life imprisonment. They were on trial for incidents of ""vandalism, burning and serious violence,"" the newspaper said. Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region, was shaken last July when long-simmering resentment between minority Uyghurs and majority Han Chinese erupted into riots and left more than 200 people dead.

"(CNN) -- Retired basketball icon Michael Jordan bought a majority share of the NBA's Charlotte Bobcats, officials said Saturday. Jordan, who was already a minority owner of the team, headed a group that bought a majority share of the team from businessman Robert Johnson, Johnson said in a statement. Johnson said he has signed a ""definitive agreement"" to sell majority interest of Bobcats Sports and Entertainment to Michael Jordan and MJ Basketball Holdings, LLC. The deal is subject to NBA approval. Details on the purchase price were not available. Jordan has overseen the team's basketball operations in recent years. He won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls. Johnson, who founded BET and sold it to Viacom for $3 billion in 2001, announced that he had been looking for someone to buy earlier this year. His fortune was depleted by an expensive divorce, but in a 2009 interview with CNN, Johnson estimated his net worth was still $1.1 billion. Johnson's resume is full of firsts: BET was the first African-American owned company traded on the NYSE. He was the first African-American billionaire in the United States. And, in 2002, he became the first African-American majority owner of a professional sports franchise.","Michael Jordan buys controlling stake in Charlotte Bobcats franchise .

"(CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Thursday that a new Middle East -- one ""without Zionists and without colonialists"" -- was quickly emerging as regional bonds grow stronger by the day. The hard-line leader made the comments after a meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus on Thursday. ""The whole world should know that Iran will stand behind the Syrian nation to the end,"" Ahmadinejad said in remarks aired on Iran's state-run Press TV. ""Regional bonds are very strong."" His comments came during a two-day visit to Damascus that follows efforts by the United States to weaken ties between Iran and Syria. President Obama recently nominated veteran diplomat Robert Ford to be the new ambassador in Damascus, ending a five-year diplomatic hiatus there and sparking talk of a renewed relationship. But Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has tempered the thawing of relations by saying that Washington remains concerned with Syria's close ties to Iran. ""No one has enlightened her to comment on regional issues,"" Ahmadinejad said, slamming Clinton's statements as interfering. ""The whole U.S. government has no impact whatsoever on regional relations."" Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen over Iran's nuclear program, which Iran insists is intended for civilian use but the United States believes is intended for developing weapons. Assad voiced strong support for Iran and brushed off U.S. sentiment. ""I find it strange how they talk about Middle East stability and at the same time talk about dividing two countries,"" he said. The meeting between Assad and Ahmadinejad sparked a harsh reaction from Israeli President Shimon Peres. ""The time has come to speak the truth,"" he said in a written statement. ""The problem in the Middle East is not the Palestinians. The Palestinian problem will be resolved through the peace process in Israel. The central problem in the Middle East is Iran's attempt to reach hegemony over the Arab lands."" ""The source of the problem is Ahmadinejad's megalomania. Assad must choose what he wants -- to join the Iranian camp of evil and terror or to make peace with Israel,"" he said. He called on Assad to sit down with Israel to reach a peace agreement.","Iran's Ahmadinejad, Syria's Assad pledge mutual support .

"(CNN) -- Sachin Tendulkar confirmed his status as one of cricket's all-time great batsmen on Wednesday, adding the highest individual one-day international score to his list of world records. The 36-year-old became the first player to score a double-century in the 50-over format as India thrashed South Africa by 153 runs in the second match of the series in Gwalior to take an unassailable 2-0 lead. Tendulkar surpassed the previous record of 194, which was jointly held by Pakistan's Saeed Anwar and Charles Coventry of Zimbabwe, to take his record total of runs to 17,598 in 442 one-day internationals played. He passed three figures for the 46th time, and has now scored 17 more one-day centuries than his closest rival Ricky Ponting of Australia. Tendulkar, one of India's most popular sporting heroes, also holds the records for most runs and most centuries in the five-day Test format. ""I don't know how to react to this,"" he told reporters after being presented with a silver bat to mark his 20 years in the sport. ""I would like to dedicate this double hundred to all the people of India who stood with me for the last 20 years. I really appreciate their support. This is for all the people in India."" Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hailed his teammate, with whom he added an unbroken 101 at breakneck pace. ""Even when he's tired and can't play the big shots, he's very clever to use the pace of the bowler,"" Dhoni said. ""It's very difficult for the bowlers, they don't know exactly where to bowl, so I think he batted really well."" Tendulkar made only four in India's victory in the first match on Sunday, but batted throughout the home team's innings of 401-3 as he made exactly 200. Tendulkar put on 194 for the second wicket with Dinesh Karthik after the early departure of Virender Sehwag for nine with the score on 25. Tendulkar scorched to his 50 from only 37 deliveries before Karthik became Wayne Parnell's second victim, having made 79 off 85 balls with three sixes. Yusuf Pathan matched Tendulkar's ferocious scoring rate as he clubbed 36 off 23 deliveries, adding 81 with the man known as ""the Little Master."" Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni then joined in with a rapid 68 off only 35 balls, hitting four sixes, while Tendulkar reached 200 with a single off Charl Langeveldt in the final over. As well as three sixes, he hit 25 boundaries -- the most in any individual one-day innings -- in his 147-ball knock. South Africa set the record for highest run chase of 438-9 against Australia in 2006, and needed to score the third biggest mark to overhaul India's total. But the tourists did not get close, being dismissed for 248 with 7.1 overs left in their allocation. A.B. De Villiers top-scored with an unbeaten 114, his fifth one-day century, but the Proteas' next best was 34 from opener Hashim Amla. Recalled seam bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth took three wickets for India, while Ravindra Jadeja, Pathan and Ashish Nehra claimed two victims each.","Sachin Tendulkar becomes first player to score a double-century in 50-over cricket .

"(CNN) -- Rosie O'Donnell and spouse Kelli Carpenter ""are working through their issues"" and ""nothing else will be said"" about rumors the couple is splitting, according to O'Donnell's publicist. Rumors have been swirling that Kelli Carpenter, left, and Rosie O'Donnell are splitting. Online buzz about the Carpenter-O'Donnell marriage grew louder this week after O'Donnell did not give a clear-cut denial in a USA Today interview on Tuesday. The former talk show host's publicist echoed her non-denial in a statement to CNN Wednesday. ""They are a family and will remain a family forever and are working through their issues,"" publicist Cindi Berger said in an e-mailed response. ""Nothing else will be said."" O'Donnell and Carpenter were married in a private ceremony in San Francisco, California, Mayor Gavin Newsom's office in February 2004. The city of San Francisco issued the couple a marriage license two weeks after Newsom said his mayoral responsibility not to discriminate trumped a state law banning such marriages. O'Donnell said on her wedding day that she was inspired to make her longtime relationship with Carpenter official by ""vile and vicious and hateful comments"" made by President George W. Bush that week. Then-President Bush announced that week that he would seek a Constitutional amendment to mandate that same-sex couples not be allowed to marry.

"ROME, Italy (CNN)  -- American college student Amanda Knox told an Italian courtroom Friday that she was at the home of her boyfriend the night her roommate was killed two years ago, her attorney said. American college student Amanda Knox, 21,  testifies Friday at her murder trial in Perugia, Italy. When she later was told that her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher, was found dead, Knox said in Italian, ""I was like, 'No, no, how can this be?' "" Knox, a 21-year-old from Seattle, Washington, testified that she was at her boyfriend's apartment, smoking marijuana, on the night Kercher was killed. Both Knox and the boyfriend are charged with murder and sexual assault in the case. She said she later gave a confused and conflicting deposition to police because she was confused by the questioning and felt pressure from the investigators. She testified that on the night of November 1, 2007, when Kercher was killed, she was at her boyfriend's house all night and not at home, where Kercher's body was found the next day.  Watch Knox take the stand » . Knox is scheduled to resume testifying Saturday, when prosecutors plan to question her. The trial opened January 16. After her testimony Friday, Knox's father, Kurt Knox, said he thought his daughter did well on the stand and predicted that her innocence would become more apparent as the trial continues. Kercher family attorney Francesco Maresca, however, said the Knox on the stand Friday was a different person from the Amanda Knox seen at a preliminary hearing. She questioned who the real Amanda Knox is. On the stand Friday, Knox said she was with her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, on the night of November 1. She said she checked her e-mails at his place before the couple had dinner, watched a movie, smoked a marijuana joint, made love and fell asleep. In the morning, Knox testified, she went home to the villa she shared with Kercher to take a shower. That's when she noticed a series of ""strange things,"" including dried blood in the sink and on the bath mat, unflushed feces in the toilet and a locked door to Kercher's room. The door to the villa had been left open, too, but Knox said she figured one of her housemates had simply stepped out quickly for an errand or to go for a run. She said she called out but nobody answered. When Knox got back to Sollecito's house, she told him about the strange things, and he suggested they call the police, Knox testified. Sollecito called his sister, a member of the Carabinieri, the Italian military police, Knox said. They returned to the girls' villa to check whether anything had been stolen, Knox said. Once there they met Knox's other roommate, Filomena Romanelli, and the Italian Postal Police.  Watch Knox in court » . As Knox stood outside, police went in and began shouting and banging down Kercher's door, Knox said. Between trying to understand what police were saying and having Sollecito translate for her, Knox testified that she got a confused picture of what was going on. She sat in Romanelli's car to warm up, and that's when she heard Kercher was dead, Knox said. ""I closed in inside myself,"" Knox testified in Italian. Continuing in Italian, but using English phrasing, she said, ""I was like, 'No, no, how can this be?' "" Kercher's body was found half-naked in her bed November 2, 2007. Prosecutors have said Kercher, 21, died in a ""drug-fueled sex game"" with Knox and Sollecito, now 25. An investigating judge found that Kercher died fighting off a sexual assault. A third person, Ivory Coast native Rudy Hermann Guede, was convicted of murder in a fast-track trial in October and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He is appealing the verdict. Defense attorneys are expected to argue that sloppy police work tainted the physical evidence. Kercher suffered a knife wound to the neck. In court papers, prosecutors alleged that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her. Prosecutors have said that they have physical evidence placing the defendants at the scene and that the suspects gave investigators confusing and contradictory statements about their whereabouts the night Kercher died. Knox first said she was at the house she shared with Kercher but then changed her story, according to court records. Sollecito said he was never at the house but was at his apartment, watching a movie on his computer with Knox. Later, he told investigators he did not remember whether Knox was with him the entire night. Knox, wearing a short-sleeve white top, beige trousers and a ponytail, testified that she gave a November 6 deposition to police that was confusing because she felt pressured and intimidated by the way police were conducting the investigation. Another reason that Knox cited for giving a confused and conflicting deposition is that she did not realize that police planned to interrogate her that day. ""The declarations were taken against my will, and they were taken in a state of confusion and pressure by the police,"" Knox testified before a packed courtroom, filled mostly with members of the media. Knox testified that an interpreter was there and encouraged her to remember facts, which led her to say things that she later retracted. She said police repeatedly called her a liar and mistreated her. When an attorney pointed out that police offered her tea at the end of questioning, he said it indicated that they treated her well. ""No,"" Knox replied firmly. It was that confusion that led Knox to hand-write a statement November 7 laying out all that she knew and didn't about the slaying. ""I know I didn't kill Meredith. That's all I know for sure,"" Knox wrote in the statement, widely reported in the news. ""That night, it seems to me I was in Raffaele's house,"" she wrote. ""After dinner I noticed the blood on Raffaele's hands, but I was under the impression it was blood from the fish."" On the stand Friday, Knox said she wrote the statement of her own will. ""I was not sure what was my imagination and what was my reality,"" she said. ""Therefore I was confused. I knew I had to write this statement, so I made it clear when I signed that I was confused."" Knox, who testified in both English and fluent Italian, is also being sued by local bar owner Patrick Lumumba for defamation of character. He was arrested early in the case but was released for lack of evidence. Knox worked at his bar and initially told police that Lumumba was present when Kercher was killed. On November 10, more than a week after the slaying, Knox told her mother from jail that she felt bad and felt responsible for Lumumba being behind bars. Asked by Lumumba's attorney Friday why she didn't share that information with police -- knowing it might cast doubt on his guilt -- Knox said it was because she didn't feel comfortable answering their questions. ""Quite frankly, I didn't have a good relationship with either the police or the public [prosecutor], because even he tried to suggest the answers I should give,"" Knox testified. The trial is taking place in Perugia, a university town about 115 miles (185 kilometers) north of Rome. A panel of eight judges is hearing the case. The trial has drawn more than 140 journalists from 86 news outlets to the courthouse in Perugia. The presiding judge, Giancarlo Massei, has barred cameras from the courtroom and said he could completely close portions of the trial dealing with the most graphic sexual assault allegations.","American student Amanda Knox takes stand in well-publicized murder trial in Italy .

"HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- Director Antoine Fuqua, the force behind films such as ""Training Day"" and ""Shooter,"" turned his focus to creating CNN's exclusive short film ""From MLK to Today,"" which airs at 7 p.m. ET Monday. Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua, 43, says he didn't believe he would see an African-American president in his lifetime. Before flying off to the Sundance Film Festival to premiere his latest action-thriller, ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" starring Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke and Don Cheadle, Fuqua, 43, stopped by the CNN newsroom in Hollywood to discuss the making of this film. He outlined his vision for the piece, which chronicles America's civil rights journey from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Barack Obama. CNN: As a filmmaker, you work with people like Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. Why are you sitting here in our edit bay doing this project? Antoine Fuqua: Because it's Martin Luther King, and because it's Barack Obama's story. And because it's CNN. It's important to be a part of history, and a part of inspiring people today. I think this is one of the biggest times in my life -- besides my children. So why wouldn't I be here? What else would I be doing except flying to Sundance to promote my movie! [Laughs]  Watch a clip from ""From MLK to Today"" » . CNN: You were born in the '60s, so you were very young during the civil rights movement. You were barely out of diapers when Martin Luther King was assassinated. Fuqua: I am familiar with the history because I love history. African-Americans -- I feel we cannot ever forget our past. Not in an angry or negative way -- just to know where we come from, so we get a better sense of where we're going, and how to get there, and what not to do. I don't think you can ever forget Martin Luther King and many other people who sacrificed, whose names we don't even know. CNN: What do you remember from your childhood? Fuqua: I remember being afraid at times. I remember the Black Panthers. When I was a little boy, the men that were around me were part of a movement. There was a lot of tension. There were a lot of weapons around. There was talk of FBI. I was a little kid, you know -- 6, 5 years old. I didn't really know what it meant. But there was a lot of fear -- a lot of fear of police, or of leaving your neighborhood. CNN: Did you experience much racism growing up in Pittsburgh? Fuqua: I remember a lot of racism. I mean, we used to get beat up by the police. We used to go to certain areas, and cops would slap you around, and grab you by your collar and treat you a certain way. I remember getting on a bus and drivers would treat us disrespectfully, assuming we were going to misbehave. And we were just going to school. I got into fights at school. ... No real reason, except for color of the skin. I don't think they even understood really. CNN: Did you understand? Fuqua: Not really. I didn't really understand it. I was used to it. I had an understanding of it at that age, which was I was black and they were white, and I was poor and they had money. CNN: Did you think there were certain things you couldn't accomplish because you were black? What about being a director? Fuqua: When I was a little kid, I used to sleep in my grandmother's basement, and I would read magazines, and books and things -- and I would dream of places I would go. I remember thinking, ""Well, if it's just a matter of money to leave my neighborhood, then I have to make money."" Then I read something about craftsmanship -- which is not a word you used often in that time in the ghettos. If you learn a craft, then you can make a living for the rest of your life. So I went to school to be an electrical engineer. And when I was in school, I took a Baroque art class. They were talking about Caravaggio, who was a Baroque painter. Now he was from the streets in Italy, and he used to paint these very provocative paintings of people he lived with on the streets -- beggars, and prostitutes and things. It reminded me of my world -- in the sense of being a young kid on the streets, growing up, seeing a lot of provocative images that I was probably too young to see -- and I would express them, and I would do little illustrations or I would paint on a wall. Then I started to study [Akira] Kurosawa, who was a painter as well as a director. I saw his movies -- ""The Seven Samurai"" and all that -- and I thought, ""Wow, that's even more interesting, because it's a moving picture and you get to tell a story."" CNN: And now you're telling the story of Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. Did you ever think you'd see an African-American president of the United States? Fuqua: Never. Never. Not in my time. I thought somewhere down the line it would happen, but not in my time -- because I still deal with racial situations. Sometimes people don't do it blatantly. They'll say something, or they'll behave a certain way when I know they don't normally behave that way. As a director, you run into walls where they say, ""Well, it doesn't translate well overseas. You know, you need to have a white movie star in it."" There's some truth to that. So if Hollywood's not ready to embrace more stories about African-Americans -- and that's based on the money that the movies make -- then would the country really be ready to embrace a president? You know, the CEO of the country? And obviously, we are. We are ready. CNN: As a director, you have this story about an unbelievable presidential election, where a first-term senator wins. Would you have cast Barack Obama in that role? Fuqua: In a heartbeat, in a heartbeat. He's like a movie star. Look at the guy. He's dashing, he's charming, he's got a little swagger about him. He reminds me of Denzel in their way. [Fuqua directed Washington in the 2001 action-thriller ""Training Day.""] I was with Denzel over Christmas, and they're very similar -- their mannerisms at times. CNN: In the short film you're directing for us, you've drawn the parallel between Obama and Martin Luther King. Fuqua: It is the passing of the torch between Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. I think Barack Obama is the ""dream."" I mean, we're all the dream. I think it's a bigger picture than one man. CNN: What's the message you want to convey with your short film? Fuqua: Hope. A sense of the past. But more than anything, I would love people to walk away feeling like we've just begun.","Director Antoine Fuqua is filmmaker behind CNN's ""From MLK to Today""

"(CNN) -- Residents of a Belleville, Illinois, neighborhood were still shaken Monday after a small plane crashed the day before, killing two aboard and destroying a house. ""I think everybody is still in shock,"" said Deah Bischoff, who lives near the site of the crash. ""I think we're all just walking around and looking and trying to absorb what happened."" The single-engine plane crashed about 6:30 p.m. Sunday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. No one on the ground was hurt, the FAA said. The National Transportation Safety Board had no comment on its investigation into the crash before a news conference Monday afternoon. The wreckage site is adjacent to an airstrip, but the pilot was heading for St. Louis Downtown Airport, about six miles away, according to the FAA. Residents near the airstrip are accustomed to planes in the neighborhood. Many can park their private planes in hangars adjacent to their homes. They're like garages for cars, except they're hangars for planes, said Bischoff, who, along with her husband, owns a few antique aircraft. But the familiar sound of a plane overhead this time was menacing. Bischoff said she was eating dinner with her husband and children when she heard a loud screeching. ""It shook our house, and the next thing you knew, there was a large boom,"" she said. The plane also hit the house's hangar, which sheltered two planes, Bischoff said. Explosions erupted, and they watched as flames shot into the air. Bischoff's husband, Roy, ran out with other neighbors to check on the couple living in the crushed house, she said. The couple was out to dinner, she said. Neighbors saved the three Labrador retrievers inside, Roy Bischoff said. But he wished he could have saved the two people aboard the plane, he said. ""There was almost nothing, there was no recognizable part of an airplane around,"" he said. The crash could have been even worse, Deah Bischoff said. Of the houses close by, the neighbor's home was the only one with no people inside at the time of the crash, she said. CNN's Khadijah Rentas contributed to this report.","Two aboard single-engine plane died; no one on the ground was hurt, FAA says .

"Mission Viejo, California (CNN) -- When Marty Kubicki received a text message that his wife, Aahmes, and two teenage daughters, Olivia and Alexis, were alive in Haiti, he was overwhelmed with relief. ""I felt like an enormous burden had been placed off me, but at the same time I knew that they were OK. I always felt they made it,"" he said. Groups of church members have been volunteering at an orphanage for nearly six years, since church members Bill Manassero, his wife Suzette, and Jim Duggan opened the center. But by Friday there was chaos at the Maison De Lumiere Orphanage in Haiti as 11 American missionary volunteers were trying to find a way to leave after severe shortages of food, water and medicine sparked anger in people they had been trying to help. ""People are becoming hostile at the missionary workers and we now find ourselves desperately trying to get them out,"" said Mike Maiolo, senior pastor of the volunteers' home church in Mission Viejo. He said he had received urgent messages from Haiti that everyone wanted to leave. The Kubickis and the others from Mission Viejo Christian Church arrived in Port-Au-Prince a week ago to help assist nearly 100 abused and abandoned children at the orphanage. The facility sustained heavy damage in the earthquake but no one was killed, he said. Within hours of the quake, the volunteers became de facto nursing assistants after word spread that Maison De Lumiere was serving as a makeshift triage center. ""Lots of doctors and nurses have been coming by the facility because word's gotten out, so there's all these people being pulled out of rubble and they're assisting and attending to the injured as best as they can,"" Marty Kubicki said. Judy Beltis left her husband, six daughters and five grandchildren in California when she came to Haiti on January 8. Moments after the walls and shelves around her collapsed, she found herself attending the injured and working to save lives, said her husband, Paul. ""This is a mom who couldn't put a Band-Aid on her kids when they had a cut finger because she was so squeamish, and now she's dealing with whatever needs to be done,"" he said. On Thursday, the family was assured that Judy Beltis was safe and protected. ""I'm going to urge her at some point to come back and get a little rest and restoration, but I know she'll want to head right back,"" said daughter Jaime. But that was before Maiolo received the urgent messages late Thursday. He said the situation had deteriorated to the extent that no one felt safe going outside the compound. Contact with his missionary members in Haiti has been limited to occasional text messages, Internet streaming and e-mail, he said, and his volunteers have not been able to reach U.S. State Department officials. ""The world around us is in such need when something like this happens and we've got to be there for them, but at the same time, there must be a quick way to get them out when there is nothing more to give,"" Maiolo said.","Situation turns chaotic for 11 American volunteers at Maison De Lumiere Orphanage .

"(CNN) -- Mourners packed into a church in Illinois Monday to remember a woman whose death made headlines worldwide. At the St. Rita of Cascia Shrine Chapel in Chicago, a funeral was held for Dawn Brancheau, a SeaWorld trainer who died last week after a killer whale dragged her underwater at Shamu Stadium in Orlando, Florida. A memorial service for the 40-year-old will take place in Orlando, Florida, at a future date, according to the Blake Lamb Funeral Home. Brancheau had wanted to be an animal trainer from the time she visited SeaWorld as a 9-year-old, her sister Diane Gross said last week. ""It was her dream job,"" Gross said. ""She loved the animals like they were her own children. ... She loved what she did."" Brancheau was pulled underwater Wednesday at SeaWorld Orlando, when a 6-ton killer whale named Tilikum grabbed her ponytail. A source at SeaWorld said the whale dove deep underwater after seizing Brancheau. Trainers had to wrangle the animal into a smaller pool before they could retrieve her body about 40 minutes later. The same whale was linked previously to two other human deaths. Tilikum and two other whales were involved in the 1991 drowning of a trainer at a marine park in Victoria, British Columbia. The trainer fell into the whale tank at Sealand of the Pacific and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched. In 1999, Tilikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld, the apparent victim of the whale's ""horseplay,"" authorities said then. Labor Department spokesman Mike Wald said the safety and health agency is looking into whether Occupational Safety and Health Administration workplace standards were violated in Brancheau's death. The agency will complete a report within six months, he said. If workplace infractions are found, OSHA will propose financial penalties, Wald said. If that happens, the company could accept the penalties and make needed workplace changes or appeal the penalties before an OSHA review commission. Inspectors also are looking into the incident from an animal-welfare perspective, said David Sacks, an Agriculture Department spokesman. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service wants to know whether federal standards were violated in the exhibiting of warm-blooded mammals. SeaWorld shows with killer whales resumed on Saturday.","NEW: Mourners pack Dawn Brancheau's funeral at church in Chicago, Illinois .

"Editor's note: Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, world-renowned HIV/AIDS researcher who has been on the forefront of battling the disease since it was discovered, previews his speech to this week's International AIDS Conference. Dr. Anthony Fauci is cautiously optimistic that eventually some AIDS/HIV patients will be cured. WASHINGTON (CNN) --   This week, more than 25,000 people from the global HIV/AIDS community are in Mexico City, Mexico, attending the XVII International AIDS Conference. I am pleased to be among them. This is the first International AIDS Conference to be held in Latin America, a region hard-hit by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, but also a place where exceptional scientific and public health advances have been made. The theme of the conference is Universal Action Now, which stresses the need for scientists, policymakers, activists and other concerned citizens everywhere -- in rich countries and poor ones -- to work even harder to defeat a scourge that already has claimed more than 25 million lives. We have made considerable progress against HIV/AIDS, not only on the scientific front, but also with regard to the political will, funding and essential public health efforts on the ground that are delivering medicine, care and prevention services. However, much remains to be done, as 2.7 million people worldwide were infected with HIV in 2007.  Watch more on the International AIDS Conference » . In the United States, the rate of new infections continues at an unacceptably high level, especially in the African-American community. In my home city of Washington D.C., a staggering 5 percent of the population is infected with HIV, a rate that rivals those in sub-Saharan Africa. Eighty percent of my infected neighbors in Washington, D.C., are African-American. Throughout the United States, we are seeing a resurgence in HIV cases among men who have sex with men of all races, with African-Americans again hardest hit. Despite what you might hear, the AIDS pandemic is still raging. Many hundreds of presentations at the conference are dealing with important research on the basic biology of HIV and its disease-causing mechanisms; the complex immune responses to the virus; and advances in tools to diagnose, treat and prevent HIV. My talk on Wednesday, is called ""Looking to the Future: New Directions in HIV/AIDS Research"" and will look at all these issues, and the many challenges (and opportunities) in AIDS science. But I hope to leave the audience with at least a tentative answer to an important question I get all the time: Will we ever have a cure or a vaccine for HIV? Despite our considerable success in managing HIV infection and improving the length and quality of life for people living with HIV, there is no well-documented case of anyone being truly cured of HIV disease. This is because HIV is unlike virtually any other virus in its ability to hide from the immune system in protected cellular sanctuaries that we call ""latent reservoirs."" We know that these reservoirs are established within days of infection, and even our most potent combinations of anti-HIV drugs are unable to purge the virus from these hiding places, even in people who have been on therapy for a decade or more. If you take a patient off his or her anti-HIV therapy, the virus hiding in these reservoirs springs back, and soon billions of viruses are renewing their assault on immune system cells and other organs. Photos chronicle AIDS treatment worldwide . Our best hope for eradicating HIV from the reservoirs may be to diagnose and treat people aggressively very early in infection, before the reservoirs have become too large. Our laboratory and other groups are testing this approach with intensive regimens of new drugs that prevent the virus from entering cells or from inserting its genes into a cell's DNA. Even if the virus is not completely eradicated, such early, intense treatment, perhaps with the help of immune-boosting drugs, might keep the reservoir small -- and the immune system strong -- thereby allowing a person to come off therapy. This would be a ""functional"" cure. Other approaches are being pursued as well. A cure is critical to our attempts to ultimately contain the pandemic. Currently, for every person put on therapy, two to three people are newly infected. As antiretroviral therapy is at present a lifelong commitment, it is extremely unlikely that we will have the logistical or financial capacity to reach and treat -- indefinitely -- everyone who requires antiretroviral therapy. As we search for a cure, we should of course continue our efforts to provide proven, lifesaving antiretroviral drugs to every person who needs them, regardless of where they live. Many promising avenues of prevention are being discussed in Mexico City, but none is more essential than an HIV vaccine. HIV vaccine development has been frustrating and challenging for a number of reasons, including the fact that the virus mutates rapidly, hides from the immune system, and targets and destroys the immune system cells that are successful in fighting and clearing most other viruses from the body. With HIV we will have to do better than nature if we are to develop a vaccine; HIV is unlike the situation with other viral diseases such as measles and influenza, where we have been able to mimic natural infection and induce protective responses with vaccines. My institute and many other organizations around the world are working on this problem, and advances are being made. For example, we have made progress in identifying the structures on the virus to which infection-fighting proteins that can neutralize HIV -- so-called neutralizing antibodies -- bind. Now, our challenge is to turn these structures into vaccines, and conduct the clinical trials that prove they work in people. My complete talk will be available as a webcast at the conference Web site, but let me give you the quick bottom line: I am cautiously optimistic that we will be able to cure some patients under certain circumstances, and I am also cautiously optimistic that we will develop a vaccine that will protect some people against HIV infection, or slow the progression of disease in some patients who do get infected. Meanwhile, we need Universal Action Now to accelerate the exceptional momentum of the past few years -- particularly during the past year -- in delivering proven tools of HIV prevention and therapy to communities around the globe. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.","More than 25,000 people expected at the International AIDS Conference .

"(CNN) -- There was no space on the Inca Trail. ""Estás seguro?"" I pleaded with dormant Spanish, or ""Are you sure?"" in English. I was sitting face to face with the ninth Peruvian salesman that day to offer the same answer. He was positive. No space on the Inca Trail, entering Machu Picchu via the Sun Gate, but his alternative trek was the real deal, he said. Machu Picchu was rediscovered in 1911 by Yale University professor Hiram Bingham. I said, ""Gracias,"" grabbed my bag and went trudging out the door and back into the rain. At this point, I could not remember the smile I wore just hours before as I boarded my New Year's Eve flight and watched Atlanta grow smaller below me -- four days trekking in the Andes, a new adventure! That smile had vanished, the woman who grinned it, gone. In its place, a miserable downtrodden troll with fiercely angled brows, standing in the middle of the Plaza de Armas in Cusco, Peru -- with no Inca Trail booked. As a wind-follower, I always try to make travel arrangements as I go. I lay out rough plans, cities and dates, and see what adventures may come. The Inca Trail, however, does not afford such luxury. Over the years, the Inca Trail has become more a sales feature for adventure companies than a tranquil or mystical journey. The frat party of historic treks, it often comes fully equipped with booze, crowds and disgusting bathrooms. Similarly, the Inca Trail also has a maximum capacity before doors to the public close. Years of feet trampling Inca steps led the government to institute a 500 person per day limit in 2002 on the historic trail -- including trekkers, guides and porters -- to prevent over-saturation of the trail and to maintain the sanctity of the sites. As I entered company after company, each promising slight variations of alternate treks for drastically different prices, I nearly hung up my poncho and headed home. That is, until I finally swallowed my wind-follower pride, opened a guidebook and tracked down some of the recommended operators. This proved a worthwhile endeavor, as Cusco is a maze of adventure agencies among a few trek operators. Agencies sell customers to operators, collecting profits and, oftentimes, unsatisfied travelers. Once I learned I couldn't have the journey, I grew even more set on keeping the destination. Determined to stay Machu Picchu-bound and only able to squeeze in a short trek by this point, I opted for an alternate-Inca hybrid trek. The two-day Inca joins the traditional Inca Trail a short distance from the Sun Gate, the path the Incas took into Machu Picchu. Though it carries the Inca name - -and the 500-person regulation -- it arrives at the Sun Gate in the evening, sacrificing the most sought after sunrise view. It also does not include camping or any of that delicious, trek-cooked food. My two-person group ate bag lunches, spent the one night in Aguas Calientes, the base city to Machu Picchu, and looked on enviously at Inca Trail trekkers sharing beer, some grilled alpaca and a game of cards at the final rest stop where the trails unite. If I had looked beyond my Inca-only vision, I would have discovered that the Inca Trail is just the tip of the Peru trekking iceberg -- literally iceberg if you go during low season. Several alternate treks land right in Aguas Calientes that can be booked mere days in advance. Though these treks do not enter Machu Picchu through the Sun Gate, many locals and travelers prefer alternate routes through quiet villages and isolated peaks, as they offer an often less expensive, more serene, untouched vision of Peru.  See a map of the area around Machu Picchu » . Salkantay is the most frequented Inca Trail alternative. This trek is usually recommended for people who can't get on the Inca Trail, but still want a similar experience. Traditionally five days/four nights, it leads trekkers up Salkantay Mountain (one of the highest peaks in the Andes of Peru at over 20,000 feet) and passes by some Quechuan communities and lesser-known Inca ruins, traversing everything from snow-capped mountains to hot springs. However, as it has become increasingly known as the alternate trek to the Inca Trail, the serene views of the trek often compete with crowded trails and camping sites. While Salkantay offers a glimpse at Quechuan communities, the Lares trek offers a full panorama of the Quechuan lifestyle. Against a picturesque landscape, this four-day/three-night trek is famous for the textile villages it enters along the way. It ascends 13,000 feet, crosses two peaks, hot springs and lakes, and it offers a spectrum of regional animals to view, including llamas, vicuñas, alpacas and chinchillas. However, since the trek gained popularity five years ago, ""It has become a little more touristy. It has lost a little bit of its initial essence and purity,"" said Silvia Rico, general manager of Enigma Adventure Tour Operator. For those seeking even more of an adventure, Choquequirao is the ideal trek. This nine-day/eight-night trek passes the two largest Inca sites in the Cusco region: Machu Picchu and Choquequirao. The latter is a huge archaeological complex that is only about 30 percent excavated and thus has endured minimal tourist foot traffic. Surrounded by the Salkantay mountain, the trek dives into the Apurimac River canyon and passes waterfalls, villages, Inca ruins and frequently condors. It does have one major drawback: before continuing on to Machu Picchu, trekkers must backtrack the two days' journey it takes to arrive at Choquequirao, resulting in some repeated views. For solitude and serenity searchers, the Vilcabamba trek is ideal. ""Total isolation. There's nothing like doing a trek when there's no other people,"" says Michelle Graham of Llama Path Tours, as she describes why Vilcabamba is her favorite of the alternate treks. This trek enters the last refuge of the Incas, Vilcabamba, and like Salkantay, offers spectacular diverse views ranging from tropical jungles to snowy peaks. Unlike Salkantay, however, this trek combines Inca history with little interference from tourist passersby. Families, older people, and travelers who simply don't have the time can arrive in Aguas Calientes by train and continue up to Machu Picchu either by bus or by ascending the five-mile trail. Some companies offer jungle tours, in which cycling is combined with trekking. However, as with all treks, be aware of agencies that set up tourist traps with dilapidated bikes that turn into broken bikes and extra charges on the bill. Regardless of the trek you choose, the dry season -- from April through October -- is the ideal time to make the journey. Many tour companies don't operate these treks during rainy summer months. December through February are the worst (Excellent choice on my part). Though I never intended to fly to Peru for a two-day trek, once I wiped away the fog on my optimism lenses, I realized that many of the alternate treks to Machu Picchu are just as worthy of fame as the legendary Inca Trail. So I packed my backpack, laced my boots and wrapped myself in layers of water-resistant clothing. I trekked into the landscape where history meets present day. When I arrived at the hidden Inca city in all its breathtaking beauty, everything else was just icing on the llama.","There's a 500 person per day limit on the historic Inca Trail .

"Editor's note: Bishop T.D. Jakes is founder and senior pastor of The Potter's House of Dallas, Texas, a multiracial, nondenominational church with more than 50 outreach ministries. ""It is a victory for democracy that proves that our country provides possibilities for all people,"" writes Jakes. (CNN) -- Last night, I like most Americans of all stripes, watched with visible goose bumps as history was made. I sat with my 13-year-old son and looked from the screen to his eyes as Sen. Barack Obama became the first African American in history to lead a U.S. major-party ticket when he claimed the nomination for the Democratic Party for president of the United States. I congratulate Sen. Obama on this historic accomplishment. I thank him for accepting the torch that was lit by our forefathers and proudly carrying it through the darkness of our struggles, trials and tribulations, bringing light and hope to a new generation, and for facing all those who said ""No"" and ""You can't win,"" or ""It will never happen,"" and firmly, proudly, defiantly saying, ""Yes I can!"" However, what I really hope people take away from that night is that this is not just a victory for African Americans, it is a victory for democracy that proves that our country provides possibilities for all people. It is also a sign that a metamorphosis is in progress. Today we saw that Americans respect experience, but are interested in change. I hope that we can somehow merge the best ideas of our differences and emerge with a president who epitomizes our highest and best ideals. While it remains unclear where we are going, last night proves that we as a people have moved beyond business as usual. I congratulate not just Sen. Obama on his victory, but the country on this landmark event that has shattered a past all too often filled with reasons to separate us as opposed to a voice of reason to unite us. The victory cup does not rest on the shoulders of the senator alone, but to all those who have been able to lift the conversation from petty racism, antiquated cut-throat politics, and fear-based campaigns to the larger issues of how we would like to see our country led into the future and ultimately how our country will be remembered. As the days and discussions of this political season continue, it is my sincere hope and prayer that we do not sink back into the abyss of political pettiness that has plagued our country and our lives for so many years. I am grateful to Sen. Hillary Clinton for giving, through this campaign, a chance for my daughters to see that their femininity is not a liability. Today both my sons and daughters came to understand that their ethnicity isn't viewed by progressive Americans as a limitation or a liability. iReport.com: Readers' feelings on Obama . For me it was almost déjà vu as I sat with my son. I remembered a little over 40 years ago watching the famous King speech with my dad. Similarly, I watched with my youngest son last night as a historical moment unfolded. He and I saw the dreams of slaves come true as the sons of slaves and the slave owners clapped their hands in one progressive sweep. As I drifted into sleep, all I could see was the twinkle in my son's eyes. His eyes were illuminated with possibilities, and his heart was filled with the potential of what is attainable for qualified, competent people of all types who prepare themselves intellectually and are well vested with a divine sensitivity to the ""fierce urgency of now!""

"Hanford Nuclear Site, Washington (CNN) -- The federal government has set aside nearly $2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up Washington State's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site, once the center of the country's Cold War plutonium production. That is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received, which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent. The facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south-central Washington, an area roughly half the size of Rhode Island. It was built in the 1940s as part of the ""Manhattan Project"" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II. Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built. During the Cold War, Hanford was a buzzing hive of activity, eventually becoming the main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program. Decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere. Today, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town and those involved in the clean-up project say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds. There are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down, and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge. The stimulus money will reduce the clean-up time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford. ""It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,"" Peschong said. ""Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner, years sooner."" The money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time. ""I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world, [I] thought I'd be there for 20 years,"" Gill said. ""We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant, [and] those jobs aren't jobs you just read the paper and get."" It is clear by watching Gill's team perform their time-consuming daily tasks that Hanford won't be decontanimated quickly. The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear. They break down contaminated equipment through a ""glove box,"" allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead-lined gloves. Each time a worker removes their hands from the gloves, they must be wanded down by a colleague checking for any radiation exposure. The large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. A report by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted. The Hanford clean-up ""has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress,"" according to the report. Gerry Pollet, who runs a Hanford watchdog organization, says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste. But he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed. ""You are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the clean-up and the environment,"" said Pollet, who heads Heart of America Northwest. ""They are picking the low-hanging fruit, the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities. But that doesn't cost $2 billion. ""Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds and you would expect to see real progress for clean-up [to] happen with those dollars."" While debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used, the Tri-Cities area that surrounds the Hanford site -- which includes Richland, Kennewick and Pasco -- is reaping the benefits of the clean-up boom. Hanford began receiving stimulus dollars in March 2009, which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn. The Tri-Cities area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Washington State, and the housing market has barely been affected by the recent economic downturn, according to the Tri-Cities Industrial Development council. Ken Brutzman, who owns a local office furniture store, said his business was ""at a standstill"" last year before the orders from Hanford contractors started pouring in. Brutzman had to hire six temporary workers, two of which he may keep on full time, to deal with the boom in business. ""We are on track to have best year ever,"" Brutzman said. His business has been in his family for three generations and will likely stay profitable for several more generations since the Hanford clean-up project is expected to take another 40 years. ""It has my manufacturers raising their eyebrows saying, 'Wow how does that guy do that?'""","$2 billion being spent to clean up Hanford nuclear site in Washington State .

"(CNN) -- A two-time world lawn bowls champion has been banned from top-level competition and fined after being found guilty of match-fixing. Gary Lawson, one of New Zealand's most successful bowlers with a joint-record 10 national titles, has been suspended for six months and fined $NZ5,000 ($3,500) following an incident at a tournament last year. It means he is likely to miss out on selection for this year's Commonwealth Games in India. The New Zealand fours team, of which Lawson was the leader, was accused by Canada of deliberately losing a match against Thailand at the Asia Pacific Championships in Kuala Lumpur last August. New Zealand were defeated 17-15, having already qualified for post-section play, and Canada alleged the Kiwis lost on purpose to earn a more favorable quarterfinal draw. The subsequent investigation has caused a furore in a genteel sport most often seen as a recreational pursuit for retirees. Lawson's teammates Jamie Hill, Shayne Sincock and Shannon McIlroy were fined $NZ1,000 each ($700) but avoided a suspension. A Bowls NZ judicial committee laid the blame at the 43-year-old Lawson's feet. ""He was the skip and was literally and figuratively calling the shots. We are satisfied that the idea to lose the 17th end would have come from him,"" it said in a statement on Wednesday. ""From what evidence we have, it is our opinion that once the Canadian complaint was referred to it, Bowls NZ not only proceeded with due expedition with the only course available to it but also was at pains through its counsel to provide all other requirements in a timely manner. ""The delays that occurred subsequently were to a very large degree brought about in an effort to make sure that the respondents, at each stage of the proceedings, were not denied natural justice."" Lawson, who won two world titles on home soil in 2009, last month blamed Bowls NZ chief executive Kerry Clark for blowing the incident out of proportion. ""The Canadians needed to beat Thailand otherwise they were going to miss out on the quarters. When it didn't happen, they put a protest in. But it was always an informal protest and they didn't want it to go further,"" he told Radio Sport. ""Kerry Clark turned up the next day, and he's the guy who pushed it -- he pushed it at World Bowls level with coach Dave Edwards, and at the end of the day it got blown way out of proportion. ""This is about Kerry Clark himself -- he doesn't like me and I think he hasn't done a very good job. It's just a shame he's used this to have a crack at me.""","Two-time world lawn bowls champion Gary Lawson banned from top-level competition .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN)  -- A bomb scare that affected about 100 flights at Munich Airport in Germany on Wednesday may have been a false alarm, German police told CNN. Police launched a huge manhunt Wednesday after a passenger appeared to flee from security officers when his laptop computer bag tested positive for explosives, they said. Police originally said authorities wanted to take the man in for further testing after his bag set off suspicions, but he ran. They said a bomb squad was testing the bag to see if it really contained explosives. But authorities later said the man may simply have been in a hurry, grabbed his things and left the airport. They do not have the laptop case, they said. They are still trying to find the man, they said, but are no longer describing the search as a huge manhunt. Police earlier said they were reviewing airport security videos to try to figure out where the man went. It was not clear if that was what caused them to change their evaluation of the situation. Police did not know which flight the man was booked on. Part of the airport was shut down after the suspect fled, but was later reopened. All planes in the area of Terminal 2, where the incident took place, were evacuated and all luggage was removed, police said. The passengers had to leave the secure area and be rescreened, an airport representative told CNN, adding that the airport was otherwise operating normally. About 100 flights were affected by the security measures. Some were canceled and others were delayed, the airport said, adding that activity has slowly begun to return to normal. The airport Web site was still showing some delays to flights leaving Terminal 2 several hours after the incident. The incident took place as a United States Senate committee debated the foiled Christmas Day attack aboard a plane bound from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Detroit, Michigan. The committee chairman, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, said it is ""infuriating"" that the December 25 suspect, Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, was able to board the plane in the Netherlands with a U.S. visa. Janet Napolitano, secretary of homeland security, said AbdulMutallab ""was not on the no-fly list, which would've flagged him to be prevented from boarding, nor was he on the selectee list, which would've flagged him for secondary screening."" ""Furthermore, the physical screening performed by foreign authorities at airports in Nigeria and the Netherlands did not detect explosives on his body,"" Napolitano said. ""As this incident underscores, aviation security is increasingly an international responsibility."" She said top Homeland Security Department officials are embarking on a multicontinent tour to meet with international counterparts about airline and airport security. She said she would leave Wednesday evening for Spain and a meeting with European Union officials.

"Lakewood, Washington (CNN) -- Whoever fatally shot four police officers Sunday in a coffee shop outside Tacoma, Washington, may have been wounded by one of the victims, police said. Authorities are trying to determine who killed four Lakewood police officers in the shop in neighboring Parkland on Sunday morning. Investigators are checking with area hospitals to determine whether the gunman sought treatment after the shooting, Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said. ""There's ... evidence that a Lakewood officer fired some shots, and we hope he hit him,"" Troyer said. Troyer said authorities are seeking Maurice Clemmons, 37, of Pierce County as a ""person of interest."" He did not identify Clemens as a suspect. Authorities identified the victims as Sgt. Mark Renninger, 39; Officer Ronald Owens, 37; Officer Tina Griswold, 40; and Officer Greg Richards, 42. The officers were sitting in the coffee shop before the start of their shifts when a gunman shot them at about 8 a.m. PT, Troyer said. The shop is a place where area law enforcement officers regularly gather to share information, he said. The attacker walked to the counter as if to order coffee before he pulled a gun out of his coat and fired, Troyer said. Two of the officers were ""executed"" as they sat at a table, another was shot when he stood up, and the fourth was shot after struggling with the gunman all the way out the door, Troyer said. ""After, we believe, some of the officers were shot, one of them managed to fight his way with the suspect ... all the way out the the doorway until he was shot and died of a gunshot wound,"" Troyer said. Sunday's incident was the first time the Lakewood police department lost any officer to a shooting. Two employees of the coffee shop and other customers inside Forza Coffee Company were unharmed, Troyer said. One employee fled through the back door when she saw the shooter pull out his gun, he said. ""As you can imagine, they are traumatized,"" he said of those inside the coffee shop. ""Some are in shock."" Investigators have not come up with possible motives, police said. Families of the officers have been notified, Troyer said. All of the officers were in uniform, wearing vests and had marked patrol cars parked outside, he said. Police are looking for one man in connection with the attack, though authorities are not ruling out the possibility that a second person was involved, Troyer said. A $10,000 reward was offered for information leading to an arrest, he said. Surveillance tapes from multiple location are being reviewed. Authorities were conducting searches in numerous locations, and dogs had been brought in to attempt to track the shooter, Troyer said. Investigators believe Clemmons, the person of interest, ""is intentionally avoiding us,"" Troyer said. Clemmons has ""extensive violent criminal history from Arkansas, including aggravated robbery and theft,"" the sheriff's department said in a statement. He also was recently charged in Pierce County in connection with the assault of a police officer and the rape of a child, according to the statement. According to a local prosecutor in Arkansas and past articles published by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, a repeat offender named Maurice Clemmons had his 95-year prison sentence commuted in 2001 by then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Huckabee cited Clemmons' young age -- 17 at the time of his sentencing -- when he announced his decision, according to newspaper articles. ""It was not something I was pleased with at the time,"" Larry Jegley, who prosecuted Clemmons for aggravated robbery and other charges in Pulaski County, Arkansas, told CNN Sunday. ""I would be most distressed if this is the same guy."" Jegley said he was told Sunday by ""media and police agencies"" that the former Arkansas inmate was the same man being sought in Washington state. Some tips have come in, and investigators were following leads, one of which turned out to be ""an unfortunate hoax,"" Troyer said. A Tacoma man called ""multiple people"" claiming to be the gunman, though authorities determined the man was lying. The man was arrested and now faces obstruction charges, Troyer said. A couple of blocks surrounding the coffee shop were cordoned off. Several other police agencies were on scene to assist. Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire, in a statement, said she was ""shocked and horrified"" at the shootings. ""I offer whatever support is needed to the Pierce County Sheriff in their search for the perpetrator,"" Gregoire said. Lakewood is about 40 miles south of Seattle and 10 miles southwest of Tacoma. See a map of where the shootings took place . Bystanders gathered outside the Forza Coffee Company, some of them in tears as they spoke to CNN affiliate KING. The coffee shop is on the edge of McChord Air Force Base. Spokesman Bud McKay said the base was not shut down, but security was ramped up around the perimeter as a precaution. The military has offered assistance to police, he said, but it has not been requested.

"Sargodha, Pakistan (CNN)  -- The mother of one of the five young men arrested in Pakistan told CNN Thursday that her son was in that country to get married, not to plot terror attacks as Pakistani police have alleged. The FBI was in Pakistan on Thursday interrogating the men, who some U.S. and Pakistani law enforcement officials have identified as Americans, according to Usman Anwar, head of the district police of Sargodha, about 120 miles south of Islamabad. The five had been reported missing from Virginia, and police are confident they were planning terrorist acts, Tahir Gujjrar, deputy superintendent of police in Sargodha, told CNN on Wednesday. Pakistani authorities said they believe the young men tried to connect with militant groups. In an interview with CNN, Subira Farouk said her son, Umar, was one of the young men detained in the case. She said her husband also was arrested, which would bring to six the number of people in custody. Police confirmed they have six people in custody, not five, as was originally reported. Farouk said her son would never plot a terror attack. She described him as a business student at George Mason University in suburban Washington. Farouk said she and her husband went to Pakistan to arrange a marriage for their son, who surprised her by traveling from the United States. The arrests came after a raid Wednesday on a home in Sargodha, Gujjrar said. Investigators found laptops and maps of Pakistan containing highlighted areas that correspond to regions where terrorists have been active, Anwar said. It is too premature to link the men with any terrorist organizations, he said, but preliminary investigations suggest they had sought to link up with the Jaish-e-Mohammed and Jamaat ud Dawa militant organizations. Neither group showed interest, he said. President Obama said Thursday that he envisioned ""a series of investigations"" into the arrests. ""I think the details are still forthcoming,"" Obama said. ""There will undoubtedly be a series of investigations surrounding these events, so I'd prefer not to comment on them at this point."" Farouk said her son mentioned that he planned to go to a conference with friends. She said she did not hear from him, grew concerned and began calling his friends' parents. That's when she realized that he and his friends were missing. She said she thought they had been kidnapped. Their families contacted the Council on American Islamic Relations and U.S. law enforcement authorities. Farouk said the authorities advised her to stay in Pakistan. Later, Farouk said she got a call from a relative in Pakistan who said her son was in the country with several friends. She said she was relieved, thinking her son had surprised her, but then authorities arrested her husband, her son and his friends. The U.S. law enforcement official said none of the five missing men had shown up on law enforcement's radar before they were reported missing. Authorities believe their intent was to wage jihad overseas rather than in terrorist acts in the United States, the official said, but ""there is still a lot of uncertainty about what they were up to.""

"(CNN) -- That Australia is once again defending itself against claims of racism is not surprising. Harry Connick Jr. gave the comedy skit a zero mark. That the cause of the furor is a childish, inappropriate racial 'joke' is even less of a surprise. Australian popular culture has a long held an often embarrassing tradition of wrapping racism in supposed humor. Movie star and singer Harry Connick Jr. condemned on air an Australian television skit featuring a group of performers who wore blackface to impersonate the late pop star Michael Jackson and his brothers. Connick was a judge on the Australian variety show ""Hey Hey It's Saturday,"" when the blackface group ""Jackson Jive"" performed ""Can You Feel It"" wearing huge black wigs, blackface and one spangled glove each. The Michael Jackson impersonator wore whiteface. In the 1950s a popular song lampooned a 'misfit' Aborigine whose 'boomerang won't come back.' Popular entertainer Rolf Harris was even less sensitive in a verse of his song ""Tie me kangaroo down sport"" proclaiming that on his death one of his friends could free his captive Aborigines: ""Let my Abos go loose, they're of no further use, so let my Abos go loose."" A famous Australian illustrator known as Joliffe made his fame and fortune in a long-running cartoon depicting Aborigines as dim-witted, thick browed, naked, creatures from the stone age. It is not just indigenous Australians who have borne the brunt of these so-called jokes.  Watch Connick's reaction to the 'blackface Jacksons' » . After World War II a new wave of immigrants arrived from southern Europe. Australians unused to such foreigners with odd sounding languages and strange smelling food quickly labeled the new comers 'wogs.' In the 1960s a popular film ""They're A Weird Mob"" mocked one of these immigrants for his poor English and strange customs. He finally wins approval by marrying his boss' daughter, a good Anglo Aussie, learning to swear and drink copious beers. There are just a few quick examples -- there are many, many others -- of how Australians use mockery and humor to disguise their discomfort with so-called 'outsiders.' The use of humor for a long time reflected official government policy that also scorned foreigners and Aborigines. Australian settlement in the 18th century was rooted in racism. Indigenous Australians were deemed not even to exist. British law proclaimed the continent Terra Nullius or empty land, extinguishing in an instant tens of thousands of years of Aboriginal occupation and ownership. Aborigines were dispossessed, often violently, and basic human freedoms, and rights to equal education, employment and welfare benefits denied. It was not until 1967 -- almost 200 years after European settlement -- that the law was changed to officially count Aborigines in the census as human beings and no longer included amongst the flora and fauna! For most of the last century Australia pursued a 'White Australia Policy.' It was designed to limit immigration only to those of white skin. In the first half of the century nearly 80 percent of all immigrants came from the United Kingdom. Despite being geographically in Asia, Australians generally viewed Asian people with suspicion dubbing them the 'yellow peril.' In the words of one of the prime ministers of the time Harold Holt ""Australia must be kept preponderantly British in its institutions and compositions of its people."" Immigrants, Holt conceded, ""offered much"" and in return they must simply ""become Australian."" For many that too often meant being forced to laugh along with jokes at their own expense. Times though, thankfully, have changed. The 'White Australia Policy' has long been consigned to history. Aborigines have struggled for and won a measure of equality of law and opportunity. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd last year apologized to Indigenous Australians for past mistreatment and injustice. Humor too has changed. A new generation of Australian comics from China, Vietnam, Italy, Greece and Lebanon have turned the tables; laughing at themselves and 'Anglo Aussies.' Comedian Joe Dolce scored a worldwide hit with his song 'Shaddap-a-your-face' a ditty spoofing his Italian broken English. A Greek-Australian comedy group filled theatres throughout the country with its play 'Wogs Out of Work.' Humor can be a great leveler. One of Australia's prouder traditions is egalitarianism, a nation where princes and paupers can on a simple human level meet each other as equals. Humor, in the right spirit pricks our pomposity, makes a virtue of our differences and reveals our common humanity. The ham-fisted 'Jackson Jive' routine achieved none of that.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- A French judge has issued an arrest warrant for U.S. cyclist Floyd Landis for allegedly hacking into the computer system of the French anti-doping agency's laboratory, the agency's president said Tuesday. Investigating Judge Thomas Cassuto issued the warrant January 28 for the alleged hacking of the lab's computer system in 2006, said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the assistant prosecutor of the tribunal in Nanterre, near Paris. It was not immediately clear why the judge was issuing the warrant after more than three years. Landis, 34, was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France win and suspended from cycling for two years after he tested positive for synthetic testosterone, a banned male sex hormone. Oscar Pereiro of Spain inherited the 2006 title after Landis was disqualified. Landis appealed, maintaining the French laboratory made errors in his case. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, which handles international sports disputes, upheld the ban and the decision to strip him of his title in June 2008. The warrant relates to the computer system of the AFLD, the French anti-doping agency that conducted drugs testing at the Tour, said AFLD President Pierre Bordry. The International Cycling Union, which governs the sport worldwide, has dropped the AFLD as the anti-doping agency for this year's Tour de France, though the decision has nothing to do with the Landis case, union spokesman Enrico Carpani told CNN. The decision had to do with comments Bordry made after the 2009 Tour, Carpani said. A new anti-doping agency has yet to be chosen for the 2010 race, he said.","Landis allegedly hacked into French anti-doping agency's computer system .

"(CNN) -- In a rare move, a senior cardinal spoke before the pope's Easter Mass address at the Vatican on Sunday, saying the pontiff maintains the support of Catholics around the world ""who do not let themselves be influenced by the gossip."" ""Today, with you are the cardinals from the Roman Curia, all the bishops and priests around the world,"" said Cardinal Angelo Sodano, former Vatican secretary of state and the dean of the College of Cardinals. Speaking at the beginning of the Easter Sunday ceremony, Sodano did not specifically mention the sexual abuse scandal that has engulfed the Catholic Church in recent months. But his remarks clearly referred to those who have criticized Catholic leaders, including Pope Benedict XVI himself, for not having done much more during his years as a top official. Sodano said the pope has the support of those who work in schools, hospitals and care centers, including 400,000 priests. ""Also with you are the faithful who do not let themselves be influenced by gossip,"" Sodano said in Italian, using the word ""chiacchiericcio,"" which means chatter or gossip. ""May the Lord continue to sustain your mission at the service of the church in the world."" In his Easter message, the pope did not address the scandal that encompasses high-profile abuse cases in several countries including Ireland, France, the United States, Mexico and his native Germany. More and more people have come forward complaining that as children they were victims of abuse by religious leaders, and that the church did little or nothing to stop it. Some Catholic leaders took the opportunity Sunday to condemn the Roman Catholic hierarchy. ""The lives of survivors of child sexual abuse, the faith of members of the church, and the credibility of church leadership have all been wounded grievously by the evil deeds of priests and religious who exploited their position to wreak havoc on the lives of helpless children. Those wounds were aggravated by serious mismanagement on the part of bishops and other leaders in the Church,"" said Irish Cardinal Sean Brady in his homily. He apologized to victims and vowed to do his part to keep the safety of those in the church his overriding concern. In a letter last month, the pope said he was ""truly sorry"" for the abuse suffered by victims at the hands of Catholic priests in Ireland. Also Sunday, Belgium's top Roman Catholic bishop addressed the scandal. ""Through a guilty silence, we often preferred the reputation of certain men of the church to the honor of these abused children,"" said Andre Joseph Leonard, archbishop of Mechelen-Brussel. ""Here, as well, we must, by the force of truth, give dignity back to those who were so atrociously exploited."" German Archbishop Robert Zollitsch also brought up the scandal in his Easter address, saying, ""We need to go down the path together and take into full view the unfathomable occurrences, the horrible crimes, the dark sides of the church and the dark parts in ourselves. But we cannot leave it at that alone. We need a new beginning."" In a message Friday on the Web site of the Archdiocese of Freiburg, Zollitsch expressed ""sadness, horror and shame,"" as well as his ""disappointment over the painful failure of the offenders, and that the victims weren't helped enough because of the misplaced concern about the reputation of the church."" The Archdiocese of Munich and Freising -- once headed by Pope Benedict XVI -- has been criticized for ignoring warnings to keep one of its priests away from children despite the man having been convicted of pedophilia. The priest, the Rev. Peter Hullermann, was convicted of abusing minors in 1986, but was later allowed to continue his priestly work and to deal with children. A new allegation of abuse recently surfaced against Hullermann, dating from 1998 in the town of Garching. Cardinal Friedrich Wetter, archbishop at the time, has apologized for allowing Hullermann to work in the town after his conviction. The German Diocese of Regensburg confirmed last month that four Catholic priests and two nuns have been accused of sexually abusing children. Five of the cases are from the 1970s and one is from the 1980s. German lawyers representing alleged victims say there are more than 300 cases across Germany. Some of the cases date back to the 1950s. A few priests have called for the pope to step down. ""The ever growing sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church has now reached the doorstep of the Vatican. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, knew -- or should have known -- about pedophile priests under his authority,"" the Rev. Roy Bourgeois of Columbus, Georgia, said Friday. While the Vatican has emphasized Benedict's concern about the scandal, the pontiff focused his Easter remarks on other issues. Citing the story of the Exodus, he said, ""In our days too, humanity needs an 'exodus', not just superficial adjustment, but a spiritual and moral conversion. It needs the salvation of the Gospel, so as to emerge from a profound crisis, one which requires deep change, beginning with consciences,"" Benedict said. He mentioned several of the world's leading international crises, praying for an exodus from war and violence in the Middle East and an end to suffering for Christian communities, especially in Iraq. ""May the risen Lord sustain the Christians who suffer persecution and even death for their faith, as for example in Pakistan,"" he said. He cited the ""dangerous resurgence"" of drug crimes in Latin America and the Caribbean, the ""appalling tragedy"" of the earthquake in Haiti, and the ""grave catastrophe"" of the quake in Chile. ""In the strength of the risen Jesus, may the conflicts in Africa come to an end, conflicts which continue to cause destruction and suffering,"" the pope said, adding, ""In particular I entrust to the Lord the future of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea and Nigeria."" He prayed for all countries affected by terrorism and discrimination, and touched on the financial crisis as well. ""To the leaders of nations, may Easter bring light and strength, so that economic and financial activity may finally be driven by the criteria of truth, justice and fraternal aid."" Concluding his annual ""Urbi et Orbi"" -- ""To the City and to the World"" -- address, Benedict added, ""Easter does not work magic. Just as the Israelites found the desert awaiting them on the far side of the Red Sea, so the Church, after the resurrection, always finds history filled with joy and hope, grief and anguish. And yet, this history is changed, it is marked by a new and eternal covenant, it is truly open to the future.""","NEW: Some Catholic leaders condemn church hierarchy in wake of abuse scandal .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thousands of anti-government protesters defied an order Sunday to disperse from the capital's commercial center, but the government said it would use negotiation -- not force -- to get them to comply. Police estimated that as many as 50,000 members of the group United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship were at the Rajprasong intersection in the heart of Bangkok. They forced the closure of luxury shopping malls, blocked entrances to five-star hotels and made access to a holy shrine difficult. A spokesman for the government's peacekeeping operations, Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, said that the protesters had ""incited and created a situation which has caused great inconvenience to the conduct of business and the pursuit of normal activity."" He said that the gathering was not considered to be a ""peaceful demonstration sanctioned by the constitution."" The government's Center for Administration of Peace and Order (CAPO) announced a clause to the country's Internal Security Act on Saturday night that makes unlawful gatherings punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva took to the airwaves Sunday, urging people in the affected area to be patient. He said his administration is negotiating with the protesters to peacefully disperse and that the government did not intend to use force. The opposition group, also known as the ""red shirts,"" is demanding that the prime minister dissolve the parliament within 15 days. Abhisit has said that doing so would not solve the country's political crisis. Cheerful, dancing red shirt protests . The two sides met for meetings on March 28 and 29, but they ended in a stalemate.

Thaksin was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full term and remains hugely popular. He fled the country in 2008 while facing trial on corruption charges that he says were politically motivated. The protesters say Abhisit was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call elections.

"(CNN) -- Elizabeth Smart was not afraid to face Brian Mitchell in her first testimony detailing her 2002 abduction. Elizabeth Smart, now 21 and in college, testified that Brian Mitchell raped her daily. In fact, her father said, she wanted the man who allegedly kept her tethered to a tree in the Utah woods muzzled and forced to listen to her testimony. Mitchell was in court Thursday for a competency hearing, but Smart never saw him because U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball ordered him removed from the court when he ignored requests to stop singing and disrupting the proceedings. He watched via a closed-circuit camera from another room. ""She actually wanted to face him,"" Ed Smart said. ""I think she asked [U.S. Attorney Brett Tolman] if he could be muzzled and have to sit there and watch it."" Tolman, standing alongside Smart's father after Thursday's hearing in Salt Lake City, confirmed the 21-year-old woman's request: ""She did ask me whether or not [Mitchell] got to see that testimony and hear that testimony, and I indicated to her, to her relief, that he was there in a room with the audio and video and had nothing else to do but listen."" Mitchell is accused of abducting Smart from the bedroom of her Salt Lake City, Utah, home in June 2002. She testified that she was kept captive in Utah and California until March 2003, when she was found walking down a street in Sandy, Utah, with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. Smart said that, during those nine months, no 24-hour period passed without Mitchell being able to rape her. Public defender Robert Steele says Mitchell is mentally ill, but Tolman said he believes that Mitchell ""has attempted to fool or to deceive the system."" Ed Smart said he hopes his daughter's testimony nixes the notion that Mitchell cannot stand trial, ""and if this doesn't clinch the issue of competency, our nation is in really, really bad shape, because it means that anyone out there can manipulate and make the court do what it wants.""  Watch Smart's father talk about the hearing » . Mitchell and Barzee are charged with six felony counts, including aggravated burglary, aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault. Smart's testimony began with details of how she was abducted at knife point while she slept next to her sister. She was 14 at the time. She said Mitchell took her to a wooded area not far from her home, performed a marriage ceremony and began raping her. Mitchell often sang about his intentions, she testified: ""He would come up the mountainside, yelling, 'I'm going to [expletive] your eyes out.' "" Mitchell also threatened to kill her if she tried to escape, Smart said. ""He said an angel would strike me down with a sword,"" she said, ""but he also told me that he would be that angel."" Mitchell gave her drugs and alcohol, showed her pornography and used religion to justify most of his actions, she testified. He also said he was God's servant, a prophet, and would one day face and kill the Antichrist, she said. On one occasion, Smart said, she vomited after Mitchell gave her too much to drink. ""He let me lie face-down in my vomit for the entire night until I woke up the next day,"" she told the court. ""He said that was showing my true state, that I was laying face-down in my vomit."" That morning illustrated a recurring theme, she said, explaining that Mitchell often rationalized his actions by saying they would ultimately yield greater spirituality. ""He said that first I had to be humbled and to sink below all things before arising above all things,"" she recalled. ""You have to experience the lowest form of humanity to experience the highest."" Smart, now a Brigham Young University student and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, described Mitchell as ""evil, wicked, manipulative, sneaky, slimy, selfish, greedy, not spiritual, not religious, not close to God."" During her nine months in captivity, Mitchell kept her in Utah until the winter approached, at which point he transported her to San Diego, California, she said. It's unclear when they returned to Utah, but Elizabeth Smart testified that she convinced Mitchell that they should hitchhike back to Salt Lake City. She told the court her ulterior motive was to return to an area where she more easily could be recognized and rescued. While in Utah, Mitchell kept her confined with a cable attached to her leg, she said. The 10-foot tether was locked on to another cable that was 15 to 20 feet long. ""He had a big cable bolted onto my leg, which was strung between two trees, and there was a lock that would slide between the two trees,"" she said. ""He had the key around his neck the entire time."" Asked how often she was raped, she replied, ""On a daily basis, up to three or four times."" She resisted his advances several times, she said, once biting him as he tried to have sex with her. ""He said that if I ever did that again, he would never have sex with me again, and I would be the most miserable woman in the world,"" she said. ""It didn't make a difference that he said that. I mean, it didn't stop him."" After the hearing, Ed Smart said he was ""amazed at her strength"" and ""I don't know how she could have done a better job."" Asked about his daughter's reaction following her testimony, he said, ""Phew, it's over."" He bordered on tears when asked whether he had learned anything Thursday about his daughter's abduction. ""There were certainly a lot of things that I had never heard before, and I had no idea what she had gone through -- so much out there,"" he said. Prosecutor Tolman said Smart's ""powerful"" testimony demonstrated that Mitchell was manipulative and inclined to be deceptive, but defense attorney Steele said Mitchell's guile did not negate his mental illness. ""Those things can exist side by side: manipulativeness and mental illness,"" he said. Smart testified Thursday because she is scheduled to leave soon on a mission, customary of the Mormon religion. The prosecution plans to call dozens of witnesses when the competency hearing continues at the end of November, Tolman said. Included are people who have been incarcerated with Mitchell, he said. ""The battle is not over. This is the very beginning of it,"" he said. Asked whether he would be willing to accept a plea bargain, Tolman said there was no indication that one was imminent. ""We're inclined to prosecute this case vigorously and present it to a jury,"" he said.","Elizabeth Smart testifies against accused captor for first time .

"(CNN) -- Jesse James was cited for vandalism after an incident last week with a photographer near his Long Beach, California, motorcycle shop, police said. Celebrity photographer Ulises Rios also was cited for stalking James, Long Beach Police Sgt. Dina Zapalski said. Long Beach detectives were given a copy of the video of the March 25 run-in recorded by Rios, his lawyer said. James, a motorcycle designer and reality TV star, has been the target of controversy and publicity since his separation with actress Sandra Bullock soon after she won a best actress Oscar earlier this month. James is at a treatment facility ""to deal with personal issues"" in a bid to save his marriage to Bullock, a spokeswoman for James said Wednesday. A citation is the equivalent of an arrest, Sgt. Zapalski said. The Long Beach city prosecutor will decide if the cases will be prosecuted, she said. Detectives with the city's violent crimes section met with the lawyer for Rios Thursday morning to obtain a copy of the video, attorney Mark Haushalter said. The video shows James confronting Rios, who is sitting in a vehicle park across the street from West Coast Choppers, a business owned by James, Haushalter said. Two tires on the SUV were slashed, a door was dented and a window was scratched, he said.

Forecasters warned of large accumulations of ice in places such as the north Georgia mountains, causing hazardous driving conditions. Ice and heavy wet snow on power lines could cause power outages. ""The precipitation will briefly transition back to light snow or flurries Saturday before ending Saturday afternoon,"" the weather service said. By Friday afternoon the storm was either in or on its way to parts of Virginia, West Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas. Forecasters issued severe storm warnings for these states. It already was snowing in the afternoon in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. Although the snow didn't appear to be sticking, it was expected to form ice in the evening on bridges and overpasses, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. iReport: Share your photos and video . ""This is actually an ice event more than a snow event, not so much for Nashville, but places south of there ... from Memphis [Tennessee] to Little Rock [Arkansas], and even over to Chattanooga [Tennessee],"" Myers said.

"(CNN) -- Democrats and Republicans woke up this week with a fresh perspective on the midterm elections. To many political observers, the election of Republican Scott Brown is a game changer. He overcame what at one point was a 30-point deficit to defeat Democrat Martha Coakley in a special election to serve out the remainder of the late Ted Kennedy's Senate term. Democrats are trying to calm frustrated voters and make sure that recent losses in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Virginia don't become a national trend. Republicans, still jubilant from last week's win, are hoping to capitalize on the excitement brewing from a refueled base. ""As a Frank Sinatra fan, I think of the great song 'New York, New York,' and really for Republicans right now, we think if we can make it there in Massachusetts and New Jersey, we can make it anywhere,"" Republican strategist Doug Heye said. ""There's no state in the union right now that Republicans don't feel that they can be competitive in."" The passion awakened in Republicans could put Democrats at a disadvantage as the midterm elections near, experts say. ""The problems for the Democrats will be remobilizing the enthusiasm that they had in 2008, and I think that is a serious problem. Right now, the Republicans have the advantage of strong emotions, and that tends to pull their people to the polls, whereas weak emotions do not,"" said Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate at American University. Dr. Elizabeth Ossoff, a psychology professor at Saint Anselm College who specializes in voting behavior, said voters start from an emotional perspective and then get rational. ""If you can grab them emotionally, I think you've gone a long way toward getting them where you want them to be, voting either Democrat or Republican,""  said Ossoff, who is also the director of research for the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. President Obama rode into the White House on a compelling message of change, inspiring his base while also winning over independent voters. But a year after his inauguration, polls suggest that much of the excitement that followed him has disappeared. Are you an independent voter? Tell us why . A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released this month found that 39 percent of Democrats say they're extremely or very enthusiastic about voting this year, down 11 points from November. Forty-nine percent of Republicans questioned in the poll say they're enthusiastic, up 6 points. ""[Democrats] will try to mobilize more voters, but you have to overcome the enthusiasm gap. The best grassroots, ground operation will only work if the territory is fertile,"" Gans said. He predicted the economy will be the most important issue in the midterms. The Obama administration has said it plans to emphasize job growth both in this week's State of the Union address and in the months to come. ""He had a year in which he could blame the Bush administration for not dealing with the economic problems. The economy is now his baby, as Afghanistan is his baby,"" Gans said. But Republicans can't get too carried away. If they swing too far to the right, they run the risk of alienating independent voters like those who swung the Massachusetts election for Brown. ""If the 'birthers' and the Tea Party people win most of the primaries in the Republican Party, that may not yield as much of a Republican victory in the general election as if their more moderate elements win,"" he said. This scenario played out last year in a special election for New York's 23rd Congressional District. Local Republican leaders backed state assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava because they thought she would appeal to centrists and independents. But more conservative party members revolted and instead backed Doug Hoffman, who ran on the Conservative Party line. Scozzafava dropped out days before the race and endorsed Bill Owens, the Democratic candidate and eventual winner. The split among Republicans contributed to Owens' win. A similar battle could take place in Florida, where Republican Gov. Charlie Crist and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio are competing to be their party's nominee for the Senate race. Crist has the backing of mainstream Republicans, and Rubio is the darling of the right. ""Rubio has the enthusiasm of the birthers and the Tea Party people and others like that, and that may propel him to the nomination, but it will be harder for the Republican Party to win in Florida under Rubio than it would be under a more moderate person,"" Gans said. Going ahead, both parties need to clarify their messages and why their strategies are the best options in order to engage voters, Ossoff said. ""What the Democrats have to do is get off the defensive if they want to win and start packaging themselves in a more positive light. ... They need to not only say, 'This is what we are going to do because it is right,' but 'those guys over there don't want us to do that' and paint [the Republicans] as bad guys. ""In turn, the Republicans have to keep doing what they're doing, which is, 'They're leading you astray, we're the ones who have the right idea.' "" she said. CNN's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Republicans energized after upset in Massachusetts .

"(Travel + Leisure) -- You're sitting in a hip Tokyo cafe, having a fish cake and sake. Your server has been especially attentive, so when the check arrives, you think nothing of pulling out some extra yen and leaving a healthy 20 percent tip. But suddenly things go horribly wrong: the server turns wide-eyed, becomes agitated, and walks away. What happened?! You'll likely come across more people at a hotel that need to be tipped than anywhere else as you travel. Tipping in Japan and many other Asian countries is simply not a way of life. In fact, it's usually regarded as a vulgar display of wealth and a disregard for the culture. The same can be true in Europe and Latin America ... though not always. And in the United States, of course, tipping is expected (and sometimes demanded). With expectations all over the map, it's not surprising that anxiety and confusion about whom to tip -- and how much -- are commonplace for travelers. So we've done the legwork for you, talking with concierges, tourist boards, and other travelers to find out the real protocol on when (and when not) to reach into your wallet and how much of a tip you should give to waiters, sky caps, maids, doormen, and cabbies all over the world. Of course, tipping is confusing enough for Americans traveling domestically. The expectation is to tip not only big but also often, from the kid handing you a Venti coffee at Starbucks to the multiple hotel hands that rush to open doors, carry bags, and offer an escort to the hotel room. Go abroad and the situation changes. The legion of skycaps, cab drivers, bellboys, and waiters may perform the same services as their U.S. counterparts, but they often have radically different expectations of a tip. You can credit different customs, as well as a service industry with a different wage scale. In the United States, tips usually abet low wages. In other parts of the world, service employees are often paid a living wage. If you're taking a taxi in Chile or New Zealand, for example, the driver won't give you the evil eye if you don't tip -- it's not expected. Read Travel + Leisure's guide to tipping around the world . At a hotel, you'll encounter more people who potentially need to be tipped than anywhere else during your travels. In fact, there are so many people it can become confusing. If a doorman opens the door of your cab, another takes your bag, and a third delivers it to your room, who gets the tip? It should be the last person in the chain -- the one who actually brings the bags to your room. And at checkout, only tip the one who loads your bags onto a cart and takes them out of the room. Restaurants can be tricky, too: keep an eye out for the service charge. In many European countries, this charge averages 10 percent, but it's usually included in the price of a meal. If it is, then do as the European do, and leave a few extra coins or round up the bill -- in cash, even if you've paid for the meal with a credit card. And if you're heading to Fiji, Malaysia, or South Korea, be aware that no tip is required in restaurants. Here are some other scenarios: . Spa Therapists: Tipping 15 or 20 percent is common practice in the United States but rare at any spa abroad, where a service charge is typically added to the cost of the treatment. Concierges: Situational. If a concierge gets you theater or train tickets, or has been especially helpful during the course of your stay, then a $10 or $20 tip (in local currency) is in order. Guides: Booking a ski guide to take you off-piste in Switzerland, a golf pro in Scotland, or a fishing guide in Ireland? All should be compensated in the 10 to 15 percent range, as they would be in the United States. A good tip on tipping? Get small bills or coins from your hotel's front desk to make tipping easier. But if you have only large bills, it's perfectly acceptable to ask a hotel porter or even a skycap for change when you give them a tip. After all, tips are a part of their business. They're not embarrassed, and you needn't be either. And if you don't have local currency, U.S. greenbacks can work just as well as a ""thank you"" in London, Lombok, or Lahore. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Jay Leno pulled no punches on his show Monday night, the first since NBC confirmed the TV host was being kicked out of his low-rated 10 p.m. slot after just three months. ""Welcome to 'The Jay Leno Show.' As you know, we're not just a show anymore, we are now a collector's item,"" he said to open the show, before launching into a string of scathing one-liners making not-so-light of the situation. Jeff Gaspin, chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, announced Sunday that the network was taking Leno -- formerly the host of ""The Tonight Show"" now helmed by Conan O'Brien -- out of the prime-time slot because the show ""didn't meet affiliates' needs"" despite performing at acceptable levels for the network. The last show will air February 11 to make way for the 2010 Winter Olympics, which airs starting February 12. ""NBC said the show performed exactly as they expected it would and then canceled us. Don't confuse this when we were on at late night and performed better than expected and they canceled us. That was totally different,"" Leno quipped. Gaspin said the plan now is for Leno to host a new, half-hour show at 11:35 p.m. ET, followed by ""Tonight"" with O'Brien at 12:05 a.m. and Jimmy Fallon's ""Late Night"" show moving to 1 a.m. O'Brien had his own zingers for NBC during his monologue Monday night. Among them: . -- ""Good evening, I'm Conan O'Brien, the new host of 'Last Call with Carson Daly.' "" -- ""This weekend no one was seriously hurt, but a 6.5 earthquake hit California. The earthquake was so powerful that it knocked Jay Leno's show from 10:00 to 11:35."" -- ""On the positive side, I have learned a valuable lesson from all this: never sign a contract that ends with the word 'NOT.' "" As of Sunday, NBC was still negotiating with the three hosts over the proposed line-up. ""Supposedly we're moving to 11:30. Even this is not for sure. My people are upset. Conan's people are upset. Hey, NBC said it wanted drama at 10:00 -- now they've got it! Everyone's mad,"" Leno said Monday night. Before turning his monologue to other current events, Leno had one last piece of mud to sling: . ""I take pride in one thing. I leave NBC prime time the same way I found it -- a complete disaster."" NBC moved Leno to the prime time slot in September with ""The Jay Leno Show,"" a decision that raised eyebrows in the industry. In an unprecedented move, NBC was pitting a talk show up against the hourlong dramas that have typically done well at 10 p.m. Although Leno's ratings were on target with NBC's expectations, the low average of nightly viewers left affiliates feeling the brunt of ""the Leno effect,"" causing the ratings for nightly news to drop. This announcement fueled rumors that O'Brien, who took Leno's spot on ""The Tonight Show"" in 2009, is considering making an exit. Scott Grogin, a spokesman for Fox, had no comment on whether the network had reached out to offer O'Brien his own show. Fox reportedly went after him six years ago, which led to NBC offering him the ""Tonight Show"" chair after Leno's eventual departure. ""This is still being sorted out,"" said Ben Grossman, editor in chief of the industry trade publication Broadcasting and Cable, who added that he expects the network to reach a conclusion over the next few days. ""The bottom line is that NBC has decided -- correctly or incorrectly -- that they're going to try and keep all their late-night talent. That's very expensive and a very questionable strategy."" Grossman thinks it's very likely Leno will remain at 11:30 post-negotiations. ""I just don't know that you need to pay that much money in late-night. I think you pick two hosts, one at 11:30 and one at 12:30."" Out of the three hosts, O'Brien is the clear loser, Grossman says. Even if O'Brien were to stick it out with NBC, getting bumped back to 12:05 is not optimal, said Christopher Naughton, a 20-year TV veteran and attorney who produces ""The American Law Journal."" ""Pushing it back half an hour is huge,"" Naughton said. ""The later in the night you go, the fewer people that are watching. [That's] going back to a time slot where it's the 'Late Show' again."" The whole scenario recalls the precedent set by a similar NBC fiasco 17 years ago, Naughton said, when Leno and David Letterman were dueling over ""The Tonight Show."" After failing to secure the ""The Tonight Show"" position succeeding Johnny Carson, ""Letterman was able to break out of his contract [with NBC],"" Naughton said. ""It set legal precedence because they wanted to keep Letterman, but he jumped ship through an escape clause."" NBC's talk shuffle: The right move? Share your view . The effect of that incident has been reverberating through NBC for years, he added. ""It's a karmic thing for them,"" Naughton said. ""You would think that NBC would have learned."" Jerry Seinfeld, however, doesn't believe people should be shedding tears for O'Brien. ""Conan has a chance to destroy everybody,"" the comedian said while on a press tour for his new show, ""The Marriage Ref."" ""I don't think anyone's done anything to Conan.""","NEW: Conan: Earthquake so powerful ""it knocked Jay Leno's show from 10:00 to 11:35""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- In some parts of the South, Friday's rare snowfall didn't pack the punch anticipated, but it still forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of flights. Cities put emergency crews to work throughout much of the region while state offices and schools were shut down. An estimated 8 inches fell in De Kalb in eastern Mississippi, while 200 miles south in metro Biloxi, snow fell but didn't stick, the National Weather Service reported. ""We had flurries for about five minutes where I am, that's it,"" said John DeMiller, owner of the Petit Bois Grocery in Biloxi. DeMiller's 10th-grade daughter stayed home from school Friday after the Mississippi Department of Education closed all schools due to inclement weather. DeMiller hadn't expected much snow, and when schools were closed in his town without accumulations, he was flabbergasted. ""I'm going, 'they just lost their mind,' "" he said. Share your winter weather photos, stories . Just north of metro Biloxi, though, 1-2 inches fell and black ice could pose a problem as wind chills drop, National Weather Service forecaster Phil Grigsby said. Officials in Georgia were bracing for enough snow to paralyze parts of the state. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, which canceled hundreds of flights, had reported 4 inches of snow, National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Darbe said. Numerous accidents have been attributed to the dangerous conditions, he said. Temperatures were to fall to the mid- to upper-20s in the Atlanta area after the snow tapered off sometime between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. Friday, he said. Traffic accidents were expected to increase as slush turned to ice late Friday, he said. The clear skies already over parts of western Alabama are expected to move into Georgia later this weekend, Darbe said. In Louisiana, Commissioner of Administration Angele Davis announced state government offices were closed in 42 parishes. Earlier in the day, iReporter Susan Sharman in Bastrop, Louisiana, said she couldn't believe snow was falling over her town. ""I haven't seen snow like this in Bastrop in over eight years,"" she said. Metro Baton Rouge, Louisiana, saw about an inch of snow on its streets, while the rest of the area got 1 to 3 inches, Grigsby said. But Mardi Gras revelers don't have much to worry about. The very early morning snow shouldn't interfere with parades Friday evening, he said. Windchills in the 30s, however, mean paradegoers need to bundle up before the fun. Drivers should also be wary of any black ice that may form on bridges and overpasses, he said. Yasamie Richardson of Alabama Emergency Management said conditions could be ""very, very dangerous,"" in her state and the likelihood of power outages was ""very great."" She said authorities were encouraging people to prepare for the possibility of losing electricity. ""My husband and I haven't seen snow since we were stationed in Massachusetts and my children have never seen it,"" Sara Johnson in Wilmer, Alabama, said in a CNN iReport as the first flakes began to fall Friday morning. The weather system pounded parts of Texas on Thursday, leaving a record 12.5 inches in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The National Weather Service said the 24-hour total in the area topped the previous record of 12.1 inches set in 1964. ""For the DFW Metroplex this is amazing,"" said iReporter Brent Dow. See Dow's photo of a Texas-size snowman . West of Dallas, in Irving, Texas, Michael Whiteside was awakened at 2:45 a.m. Friday ""to the sound of my patio roof collapsing from the weight"" of the snow, he said in a CNN iReport. At Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, where American and American Eagle canceled about 230 flights, officials were working to ramp up departures Friday. An Airport spokesman said Friday afternoon that most flights were running on time. There was some relief in sight for the South. Warmer weather was melting the snow Friday in Dallas, and temperatures in the 40s were expected to move through the rest of the region over the weekend. The Southern states were getting a smaller dose of what their Northeastern and mid-Atlantic counterparts have experienced this week. That area is digging out from a pair of record-setting blizzards. The first storm dumped more than 30 inches of snow in some places last weekend, while the latest part of the one-two punch dropped 22.5 inches on Baltimore, Maryland; 15.8 inches on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and about 10 inches on Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia; Central Park in New York; and Atlantic City, New Jersey, the National Weather Service said. Records for total snowfall for the season have been set at Dulles International Airport west of Washington, with 72 inches; Philadelphia, with 70.3; Baltimore, with 70.1; Reagan Washington National Airport, with 55.6; and Atlantic City, with 48.7, according to the weather service.

"Halle, Belgium (CNN) -- At least 18 people died and 162 were hurt when two trains collided in Halle on Monday, a government spokeswoman said. The trains collided head-on at 8:30 a.m., the companies that run the Belgian railways and the train said. The cause of the accident is not known, according to the railway operator, Infrabel, and SNCB, the train operator. Authorities do not believe there is anyone else on the trains, said Anya De Wols, spokeswoman for the province of Flemish Brabant. But they have not ruled out the possibility bodies could be pinned beneath the train cars, she said, and they plan to lift the cars from the track by Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, investigators will collect personal effects, such as wallets, from the scene to help identify the victims, she said. Send your pictures, videos, stories . A Belgian government spokesman, Bart Ouvry, said it was snowing at the time of the crash, but not an unusual amount. People were thrown against the walls of the trains by the impact, said Emily Divinagracia, whose husband, Stephan Riviere, was a passenger. He was awakened by the impact, she said he told her by phone minutes after the accident. It took about 30 minutes for rescue crews to arrive, and some passengers did not immediately know there had been a collision, she said. ""He was actually getting the news from me, because they didn't know much on their side and it was all a bit disorganized, obviously, because nobody expected this sort of thing to happen,"" she said. Riviere was not badly injured, his wife said. The injured were being treated at a sports center near the scene of the accident, the Belga news agency reported. Fifty-five of them were taken to hospitals, while more than a hundred others had minor injuries, De Wols said. The crash took place during morning rush hour when people were on their way to work, Belga journalist Eric Vidal said from the scene. Pictures showed people being taken from the crash site by stretcher as snow fell. Passengers who were not hurt in the crash were taken away by bus, according to Vidal. He said people had come to the station to try to find family members who may have been involved in the crash. Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme is on his way back from Kosovo, Albania, and would visit the scene of the crash, his office said. The Justice Ministry is in charge of the investigation, Leterme's office added. The crash caused disruption to parts of the wider rail network in northern Europe. Eurostar suspended high-speed train services between London, England, and Brussels, Belgium, the company announced, and did not expect the trains to run for the rest of the day. London-to-Paris services were not affected, the company said, but there were delays on the service to Lille in northern France close to the border with Belgium. Thalys, which operates high-speed trains across much of northern Europe, announced that services were fully suspended all day, affecting travel to Brussels from Paris, France; Amsterdam, Netherlands; and Cologne, Germany. The company urged passengers planning to travel this week to check its Web site, www.thalys.com, before starting their trips. The French high-speed train operator TGV Europe announced that its Brussels-bound services were going only as far as Lille. Eight people died in a train crash in Belgium in March 2001, media reports said at the time, calling it the worst rail accident in the country in 25 years. Investigators later suggested the two trains collided because of confusion between a French-speaking signalman and a Flemish-speaking one. Belgium is divided between speakers of the two languages. Monday's crash is one of the deadliest train accidents in Europe since at least 41 people were killed in the Balkan nation of Montenegro in 2006. At least 180 passengers also were injured when a train derailed and plunged down an embankment outside the capital, Podgorica.

"(CNN) -- The Internet connection in Myanmar was cut Friday, limiting the free flow of information the nation's citizens were sharing with the world depicting the violent crackdown on monks and other peaceful demonstrators. Ko Htike runs his Myanmar blog out of his London apartment and says he's trying to stop the violence. Myanmar-based blogs went dark suddenly. But London-based blogger Ko Htike -- who has been one of the most prominent bloggers posting information about the violence -- has vowed to keep up the fight, saying where ""there is a will, there is a way."" ""I sadly announce that the Burmese military junta has cut off the Internet connection throughout the country,"" he said on his blog Friday. ""I, therefore, would not be able to feed in pictures of the brutality by the brutal Burmese military junta."" Ko Htike is a 28-year-old who left Myanmar, once known as Burma, seven years ago to study in England.  Watch a blogger's fight for Myanmar » . He told CNN.com a day earlier that he has as many as 40 people in Myanmar sending him photos or calling him with information. They often take the photos from windows from their homes, he said. Myanmar's military junta has forbidden such images, and anyone who sends them is risking their lives. ""If they get caught, you will never know their future. Maybe just disappear or maybe life in prison or maybe dead,"" he told CNN. Why would they take such risks? ""They thought that this is their duty for the country,"" he said. ""That's why they are doing it. It's like a mission."" Even with Friday's action by the government, he said he will continue to do all he can to get images of what's happening out for the world to see. ""I will also try my best to feed in their demonic appetite of fear and paranoia by posting any pictures that I receive through other means,"" he said on his blog. ""I will continue to live with the motto that 'if there is a will there is a way.' "" With few Western journalists allowed in Myanmar, his blog has become one of the main information outlets. More than 170,000 people from 175 countries have gone to the blog, according to a counter on the page. On Friday, shots rang out in the streets of Myanmar's biggest city of Yangon, marking the third straight day of violence at the hands of the ruling military junta to suppress citizen protests.  See photos of the protests » . One diplomat told CNN that a Western witness had reported seeing about 35 bodies lying in rows on a street near Sule Pagoda, with civilians praying over them. CNN could not independently confirm the report, and it was not known if the bodies were from Friday or the result of earlier violence. According to The Associated Press, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Friday he believes the loss of life in Myanmar has been ""far greater"" than is being reported. In a country where Buddhist monks are revered, the violence against them could stir even more outrage among the people of Myanmar. ""Now, there is blood shed on the monastery,"" Htike said. The Internet has also spawned other Myanmar pages. On the popular online community of Facebook, several Myanmar support pages were set up with links keeping a close eye on the latest developments. One letter floating around the Internet from a group calling itself the ""Global Alliance of Burmese Students"" called on people abroad to stage protests. ""We call on you to take action, to take the lead, and to show solidarity with our fellow countrymen back home,"" it said. ""The streets of Yangon bleed red, and it will all be in vain if we do not act and mobilize for change."" Other people used technology as simple as the cell phone as a means to get the word out on what was happening. ""We didn't do any terrorism, but they sharp-shoot us,"" one woman said by phone inside Myanmar Thursday. ""I just want to say we have no weapons and no rights."" She added, ""Who can help us?"" The last time the nation saw such widespread protests was in 1988, when today's instantaneous means of communication did not exist. The government used brutal force to quash that democratic uprising, with few people seeing what happened.  View a timeline of events there » . Today's technology allows anyone with the means to capture what is happening. Despite the cutting of the Internet inside the country, people can still take pictures and videos with cell phones and send them to the outside world. ""They are ready to die for that,"" Vincent Brossels with Reporters Without Borders said on Thursday. ""I spoke with a Burmese journalist this morning in Rangoon and he told me that now I don't care about anything. I'm ready to be in jail. I'm ready to die for that."" Benjamin Valk, a 25-year-old student from a university in Tokyo, Japan, sent CNN.com video of saffron-robed monks carrying out a peaceful protest earlier this week in Yangon, once known as Rangoon. The video shows thousands of monks and civilians walking together and chanting. He said he felt compelled to share the video because people ""should know what is happening in a country like Myanmar."" ""In a world where democracy is considered the better or perhaps the best political system, there is huge global support for a people who dare to openly challenge a military dictatorship and call for democracy,"" Valk said. ""I think it's good for the world to see."" Htike agrees, saying he's just trying to stop the killing in his homeland.

"(CNN) -- Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine agreed Tuesday to review the report examining the deadly 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech and to correct any errors based on what has been learned since its publication. Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and faculty members on April 16, 2007, then killed himself. Relatives of some of the victims of the 2007 shootings issued a statement Tuesday asking Kaine to reinstate the panel that investigated the nation's deadliest shooting spree and prepared the report. Gordon Hickey, Kaine's press secretary, said that ""re-convening the panel"" would be ""problematic"" because its members participated voluntarily and it seems unlikely they could gather again. Hickey said Kaine has asked families to send his office corrections or changes that they feel need to be made. And Kaine said on Washington-based WTOP's ""Ask the Governor"" program, ""I have made a commitment to the families of those who were injured and killed at Virginia Tech that the report that was done under my direction ... that we are going to open the factual narrative of that report and look at any information that has come in since."" The family members contend that the August 2007 report compiled by the independent Virginia Tech Review Panel contains ""grave errors, misinformation and glaring omissions,"" their statement says. ""We feel an incomplete and inaccurate report does not respect our loved ones, or us, and is potentially harmful to the public,"" they wrote. Thirty-two people, nearly all of them students or professors, died when 23-year-old Cho Seung-Hui went on a shooting spree on campus April 16, 2007. He then turned a gun on himself. Kaine announced last week that mental health records belonging to Cho were recently found at the home of Dr. Robert Miller, former director of Virginia Tech's Cook Counseling Center. Miller has said that he mistakenly took the the files when he left his job there more than a year before the shootings. Kaine said the absence of the records was a mystery and a concern during the investigation. The files were discovered in connection with a civil lawsuit, he said without elaborating. The governor said his office is asking Cho's family for permission to make the records public. Lori Haas, whose daughter Emily was grazed by a bullet in a French class Cho attacked, said she and the other families are seeking answers to new issues. ""New information leads to new questions,"" Haas said. Haas, whose daughter survived and who was among those who received compensation in the settlement, said the report has errors in its timeline for the day of the shootings. Nearly all the families, including Haas, pursued wrongful-death and personal injury claims against the state after the panel's report was published. The study concluded that more timely and more specific information from university officials might have saved lives. College officials at the Blacksburg campus were criticized for not immediately warning students and staff after two students were found dead in a dormitory at 7 a.m. on the day of the killings. Police said they initially believed that the two had been involved in a romantic dispute but later determined that they were Cho's first victims. It was almost 9:30 a.m. before authorities sent an e-mail to students and staff notifying them of the shootings and warning them to be cautious. About 9:50 a.m., Cho began shooting people in Norris Hall, an engineering and classroom building. While criticizing the university response, the panel -- which included former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge -- also said that quicker action by school officials may not have made a difference. The report also noted that campus and state agencies might have taken a different approach to Cho had his middle- and high-school records followed him to Virginia Tech, officially Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Problems with Cho reportedly began to surface well before the shootings. The records detailed his mental health issues, including a tendency to react to depression with violence.","Gov.

"(CNN) -- Former President Alfonso Portillo of Guatemala faces money-laundering charges in the United States, according to a federal indictment unsealed Monday. The indictment charges Portillo with embezzling tens of millions of dollars in public funds, ""a portion of which he then laundered through bank accounts located, among other places, in the United States and Europe,"" the indictment says. A grand jury indicted Portillo in U.S. District Court in New York. Portillo engineered an embezzlement with co-conspirators that occurred from about 2000 through about 2003, the indictment says. Prosecutors allege the money-laundering took place through at least 2006. Portillo was the president of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004. Authorities in Guatemala started searching for him after the United States requested his extradition, a spokesman for the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala told CNN en Español on Sunday. They executed search warrants in four locations but had not found him as of Sunday night, officials said. Portillo came into power promising to clean up corruption, but found his own government mired in the same accusations as his predecessors. According to the indictment, in one instance in 2000, Portillo funneled $1.5 million worth of donations for a literacy project from Taiwan into accounts in Europe controlled by his ex-wife and daughter. In that case, the indictment alleges, Portillo endorsed three $500,000 checks destined for a program to purchase books for libraries, but diverted the funds into a bank in Miami, Florida. That money was eventually laundered into his family's accounts in Europe, the court document states. In short, ""this money was diverted, in a series of transactions and transfers designed to conceal the sources and origin of the funds,"" the indictment states. There was a second instance where Portillo allegedly embezzled money given to Guatemala by the Taiwanese, according to the document. In addition, Portillo is accused of embezzling money from his defense ministry in 2001. With the help of others, Portillo made large cash transactions that ended up in accounts belonging to him and his co-conspirators, the document says. Some of the money that Portillo took went to buy expensive watches and cars, the indictment says.","Indictment unsealed Monday charges former Guatemalan president with embezzlement .

"(CNN) -- There's never a bad time for a toga party, right? The story of Perseus -- the bastard son of Zeus who takes on the mighty Kraken -- will endure long after Louis Leterrier's enjoyably cheesy movie has been forgotten (or, inevitably, remade in 4D). But for now, and for young men especially, Leterrier's version is the one that counts, and it will just have to do. It's a mixed bag: Three credited screenwriters have labored in the footsteps laid down by the 1981 Ray Harryhausen ""classic"" (hardly his finest hour) -- that is, they've taken the myth as an excuse to showcase as many special effects sequences as they can muster. That's not a bad strategy when it's clear from the laughably clumsy opening that they haven't a clue how the ancient Greeks spoke to one another. The clunky dialogue is delivered in various shades of tone deaf Antipodean, English, Irish and European by the likes of Sam Worthington (Perseus), Gemma Arterton (as his spiritual guru/love interest) and Liam Neeson (Zeus). Neeson's old ""Schindler"" nemesis Ralph Fiennes brings a touch of class to Zeus's brother Hades, while the great, growly, scene-stealing Mads Mikkelsen (Le Chiffre in ""Casino Royale"") makes the strongest impression among the mortals. Mikkelsen's only serious competition in the scenery-chewing stakes comes from the Kraken itself, a toothy sea monster who is built up for an hour and three quarters, then comes on for five minutes -- wisely doesn't say a word -- and walks away with the picture. In Harryhausen's day, effects meant stop-motion photography of artfully modeled monsters, including a three-headed dog (excised here) and a golden mechanical owl (who makes a cameo appearance for old time's sake). Today's CGI creatures may not have the same charm, but they're considerably more agile and fluid, and the action scenes have tremendous dynamism. Leterrier comes from ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""The Transporter,"" and he's evidently more comfortable running than walking. A showdown with gigantic angry scorpions is the movie's first big set-piece, and it's exciting enough to make you forget you've seen these critters before -- or something very similar, in ""Transformers."" The three Graeae are ghastly, touchy-feely crones with one eye between them, and Medusa is a giant snake who slithers around her lair like a heat-seeking missile - though I preferred the aplomb Uma Thurman brought to the role in ""The Lightning Thief."" Like his namesake Percy Jackson, Perseus has daddy issues -- he's a demi-god who wants to prove he's all man. After ""Avatar"" and ""Terminator Salvation"" Worthington has cast-iron credentials on that score. We can see why Perseus would resist invitations to join the Immortals. Mount Olympus looks like a colossal bore, a resting home for eternity. You wonder what they find to talk about all day.

"Washington (CNN) -- Full-body imaging machines that see through clothes have significantly improved security in airports where they are deployed, and have revealed more than 60 ""artfully concealed"" illegal or prohibited items in the past year, the Transportation Security Administration says. To date, no explosives have been detected by the machines, but their ability to spot even small concealed objects demonstrates their effectiveness as a security tool, officials said. ""It is absolutely a tremendous improvement of what we can detect at the checkpoints,"" TSA Acting Administrator Gale Rossides said this week. ""It is an excellent piece of technology that will significantly improve our detection capabilities."" As evidence of the machines' capabilities, the security agency released five photos of drugs or suspected drugs that airport screeners found after scans revealed anomalies on the ghost-like images of people's bodies. The agency said metal detectors would not have revealed the items. Screeners using the technology also found a knife hidden in the small of a person's back at the Richmond, Virginia, airport, a concealed razor blade on a passenger in Phoenix, Arizona, and other concealed items such as large bottles of lotion, which are prohibited as carry-on items. In addition, the machines have revealed numerous prohibited items that passengers evidently inadvertently left in pockets. Those items are confiscated but are not counted in the tally, a TSA spokesman said. U.S. to implement new airport security measures . The agency field-tested the full-body imagers for more than a year before announcing last month the deployment of machines to 11 airports nationwide. Today, 46 machines are in place in 23 airports, and the agency is stepping up deployments and plans to have about 1,000 set up by the end of 2011. Interest in the machines has heightened since the Christmas Day incident in which a man allegedly attempted to detonate an explosive concealed in his underwear. In an appearance before Congress last month, Rossides declined to say whether the machines could have detected the underwear bomb. But to illustrate the machines' effectiveness, Rossides showed a packet of white powder smaller than a tea bag, saying it was identical to a concealed bag detected by an imager. ""The amazing thing is that our officers, as they get more and more familiar with this technology, are actually finding very, very small things that are being secreted on the body,"" she said. But some passengers say the machine's capabilities are presenting new Fourth Amendment questions about the government's searches, saying the machines -- in detecting very small objects -- are subjecting passengers to scrutiny beyond what is needed to safeguard the plane. ""I can't imaging an explosive that is powerful enough in that [tea-bag size] quantity to endanger an aircraft,"" said John Perry Barlow, a former Grateful Dead lyricist who once took the TSA to court after a search of his checked luggage revealed a small amount of drugs. ""Every time technology makes another leap forward, we have to reclaim the Fourth Amendment, and often we have to reclaim the entire Bill of Rights, because technology gives us powers that were not envisioned by the Founding Fathers,"" Barlow said. The security agency said that it searches only for prohibited items -- not illegal items such as drugs. When it finds illegal items during a search, it refers the item to local law enforcement officers, it says. ""What we're trying to resolve is the anomaly that we're seeing on the body,"" said Rossides. ""If it's drugs, then we call in local law enforcement and they handle it from there."" Barlow predicted that the body scanner will lead to another court case to clarify the extent it can be used to search the body. ""Eventually they're going to bust somebody for something that was clearly and obviously not a threat to the aircraft, and any reasonable person would have known that [while looking at the] body scan. And at that point somebody is going to make it an issue,"" he said. Rossides said the body imagers are especially useful because they can expose contraband on parts of the body that aren't fully explored in pat-downs, such as the groin. ""I think what was so telling about the Christmas Day attack was that it exploited our cultural norms, that we don't frequently pat down persons in that part of the body. This technology will give us the image of the entire body,"" she said. But Rossides said the imagers are not a ""silver bullet"" because ""those who intend to do harm are constantly adapting."" ""We still have to have multiple layers of security,"" she said. For all his reservations about scanners, Barlow said he does not hesitate going through one. ""I've got nothing to hide,"" he said. ""I go through the scanner. If anybody wants to see me naked, they're welcome to the sight.""","60 ""artfully concealed"" illegal or prohibited items discovered in past year, TSA says .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi produced a performance of stunning brilliance, scoring all four goals as holders Barcelona beat Arsenal 4-1 to reach the semifinals of the Champions League 6-3 on aggregate on Tuesday. Messi turned on the style in the Nou Camp with one of the most devastating individual displays the competition has ever seen, as an injury-ravaged Arsenal side were torn apart. The match started started brightly for the Londoners who actually took a shock 18th-minute lead. Theo Walcott's pace had troubled Barca in the 2-2 first leg at The Emirates and the England winger created the opener with a break down the right. His pass inside for Nicklas Bendtner was a poor one, but somehow the Dane managed to pounce at the second attempt to stab his shot past Victor Valdes in the Barca goal. Arsenal's lead lasted barely three minutes before Messi began his one-man show. Mickael Silvestre failed to clear the ball on the edge of the area and it fell to Messi, who curled home a superb equalizer. Messi added his and Barca's second on 37 minutes. Eric Abidal's cross from the right was cut out by Thomas Vermaelen. However, the rest of the Arsenal defense were slow to react and Pedro found Messi, who smashed his shot past Manuel Almunia. The striker completed his stunning hat-trick four minutes before the break when he raced onto a header from Abidal to sprint clear of the Arsenal defense before superbly chipping the ball over Almunia. By now, Arsenal needed two goals to go through and, in truth, they never looked likely to get them. Bendtner struck the post with a fierce header from Gael Clichy's cross, but he was flagged offside, and Tomas Rosicky fired over the bar when in a great position. Messi completed the job three minutes from time, beating two defender on the left hand side of the area before firing the ball through Almunia's legs. The result means Barcelona will now face Italian champions Inter Milan, who they were drawn against in the group stages, in a mouth-watering semifinal clash. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was full of praise for Messi's performance. ""For me, he is the best player in the world, and by a distance,"" he told Sky Sports. ""When he's in the game, he's really dangerous. Once he is on the run with the ball, he is unstoppable. The Frenchman added: ""I believe that we lost against a team that is better than us and have the best player in the world.""","Lionel Messi scores all four goals as Barcelona thrash Arsenal 4-1 at the Nou Camp .

"(CNN) -- ""Usually when I mention suspended animation people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh,"" says scientist Mark Roth. But he's not referring to the plot of a ""Star Trek"" episode. Roth is completely serious about using lessons he's learned from putting some organisms into suspended animation to help people survive medical trauma. He spoke at the TED2010 conference in Long Beach, California, in February. The winner of a MacArthur genius fellowship in 2007, Roth described the thought process that led him and fellow researchers to explore ways to lower animals' metabolism to the point where they showed no signs of life -- and yet were not dead. More remarkably, they were able to restore the animals to normal life, with no apparent damage. Read more about Roth on TED.com . The Web site of Roth's laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, describes the research this way: ""We use the term suspended animation to refer to a state where all observable life processes (using high resolution light microscopy) are stopped: The animals do not move nor breathe and the heart does not beat. We have found that we are able to put a number of animals (yeast, nematodes, drosophila, frogs and zebrafish) into a state of suspended animation for up to 24 hours through one basic technique: reducing the concentration of oxygen."" Visit Mark Roth's laboratory . Roth is investigating the use of small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, a gas that is toxic in larger quantities, to lower metabolism. In his talk, he imagined that ""in the not too distant future, an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide, or some related compound, to a person suffering severe injuries, and that person might de-animate a bit ... their metabolism will fall as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home. ""That will buy them the time to be transported to the hospital to get the care they need. And then, after they get that care ... they'll wake up. A miracle? We hope not, or maybe we just hope to make miracles a little more common.""","Mark Roth is a scientist who is studying ways to put life into suspended animation .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The three surviving children of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. are moving forward after averting a public trial over the estates of their parents. Bernice King and her brothers Martin Luther King III and Dexter King will split money they have been fighting over. The settlement among Bernice King, Martin Luther King III and Dexter King was announced after 11:30 p.m. Monday, Fulton County Superior Court spokesman Don Plummer said. ""We disagreed with each other, but we still always loved one another, and I think that's probably the most important factor,"" Martin Luther King III said. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in July 2008, one month after accusing him of converting ""substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America"" for his own use, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit contended that Dexter King  illegally and fraudulently converted estate funds and should be forced to repay the money and reimburse his siblings' legal costs. The document does not say how much he was accused of taking. The suit also accused Dexter King of failing to provide timely accountings of their father's estate and said he hadn't given his siblings an accounting of finances in years. Dexter King denied the accusations. He said shareholder meetings had not been held in the past few years because of family deaths that disrupted normal routines. The Martin Luther King Jr. estate was also named as a defendant. Dexter King is the corporation's president and chief executive, in addition to being the estate's administrator. The three children are the only shareholders in the corporation. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King hold 20 percent of its outstanding shares. The two siblings also accused Dexter King of improperly removing money from the estate of their mother, Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006. However, Superior Court Judge Ural D. Glanville determined that Dexter King was an authorized signatory on the checking account for his mother's estate, which is administered by Bernice King. ""There was no improper conduct with respect to the removal of funds from Mrs. King's estate,"" the court said in its order for summary judgment. The judge ordered that money withdrawn be equally divided among the siblings. ""(It was a) very long day but also a very triumphant day in that we, as a family, I think, have amicably resolved our differences,"" Dexter King said. ""Families love each other. Families have disagreements,"" Bernice King said. ""It doesn't mean as we go forward we will always agree because that would be a misnomer to say that."" The Kings have 14 days after the signing of Monday's settlement to each find three possible temporary custodians to manage the estate for at least one year. After the names are submitted to the court, the judge will make a choice, the settlement says. According to the settlement, the appointment of a custodian will give the three children time to heal their relationship as siblings, to develop procedures for managing the corporation that oversees the  Martin Luther King Jr. estate and to assure third parties ""as to the validity and enforceability of any agreements."" One of the most bitter disagreements came over the private papers of Coretta Scott King. Dexter King accused his sister of withholding love letters between their parents that he wanted for a proposed $1.4 million book deal. The judge ordered that Coretta Scott King's papers be brought to Freedom Hall at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center in Atlanta, Georgia, for temporary storage. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. HIs oldest child, Yolanda, died in 2007.","Children of slain civil rights leader decide to split contested money equally .

"(CNN) -- Iran could see widespread protests this weekend, as a day of mourning for the most prominent cleric to oppose the regime coincides with the major Shiite holy day of Ashura. Iran -- whose regime exists as an explicitly Shiite Muslim leadership -- may find it politically and culturally difficult to put a lid on the marking of Ashura this year. It falls on Sunday -- which happens to be a week to the day since the death of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution. Montazeri, who went on to become one of the government's most vocal critics, died December 20. The seventh day after a death is a traditional time for mourning in Islam, giving Iran's opposition two reasons to demonstrate on Sunday, both with impeccable religious justification. But what exactly is Ashura and why does it draw such passionate crowds, some of whom beat themselves until they bleed? The holy day commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, who died in 680 fighting to lead the religion based on the teachings of his grandfather, the Prophet Mohammed. The battle is one of the defining points in the split between the two main branches of Islam, the majority Sunnis and the minority Shiites. Hussein was badly outnumbered when he was killed fighting Yazeed near the city of Karbala, in modern-day Iraq. Shiites commemorate the death of Hussein each year, climaxing on Ashura -- the 10th day of the month of Muharram -- after a 40-day mourning period. While Shiites are a minority among Muslims worldwide, they are the majority in Iraq and Iran, where the day sees tens or even hundreds of thousands of faithful out on the streets. Some of the most dramatic scenes take place in Karbala itself, as Shiites congregate to do symbolic penance for failing to come to Hussein's aid in his uprising against Yazeed. Believers chant, beat their breasts, cut themselves with daggers or swords and whip themselves in synchronized moves. In Iraq under Saddam Hussein, the marking of Ashura was banned for 30 years. (The former dictator was a Sunni.) The first public Ashura demonstrations in Karbala after his fall, in 2004, came under attack by Sunni militants.","Iran may find it difficult to put a lid on the marking of Ashura this year .

"(CNN)  -- A Swedish diplomat in Iran was arrested and accused of participating in Iranian protests during observances surrounding the Muslim holy day of Ashura, two semi-official news agencies reported Sunday, citing members of Iran's parliament. Sweden denies that the diplomat was involved in the protests. Swedish officials and the Mehr news agency reported that the diplomat was subsequently released. ""Based on the law and international norms, diplomats cannot be detained or arrested,"" Alaedin Boroujerdi, a member of the Iranian parliamentary National Security Committee, told Mehr. ""But since this person was among those who were disturbing the peace, he was initially arrested but then he was released when it was determined he was a diplomat."" The Swedish Foreign Office confirmed the arrest, but said the diplomat -- who was not named -- was not taking part in demonstrations. ""A Swedish diplomat was arrested in Tehran about two weeks ago and detained overnight for between 10 and 20 hours before being released,"" said Anders Jorle, spokesman for the Foreign Office. ""He was arrested after he was found to not be carrying ID, which is not required but is recommended in Iran."" ""He was not taking part in a protest,"" Jorle said. ""He was passing one of the places where a protest had taken place, but the protest was not ongoing at the time of the arrest. ""In hindsight, we would say that he should have been carrying ID,"" Jorle said. ""As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed and there is nothing further to say."" The Fars news agency quoted Zohreh Elahian, a member of the security committee, as saying the Swedish chargé d'affaires was arrested on the day of Ashura, December 27. He was arrested by Iranian officials who considered his presence at the demonstration to be an interference in international affairs, Elahian told Fars. ""According to witnesses and evidence, several foreign embassies in Tehran played a role behind the scenes and were represented [on the scene on that day] by their chargés d'affaires and other diplomats,"" Elahian said. Ashura is the major Shiite Muslim holy day. It marks the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, as a martyr. Shiites commemorate the death of Hussein each year, climaxing on Ashura, after a 40-day mourning period. Its observance in Iran was marked by anti-government protests. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad downplayed the reports, calling them ""a theater play by the Zionists and the Americans,"" according to state media. An Iranian media blackout made it difficult to verify accounts of that weekend's violence, but videos that found their way west depicted bloodied and, in some cases, apparently dead protesters.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's Intelligence Ministry has compiled a list of 60 groups -- several based in the United States -- saying it considers them ""soft war"" agents against the country, Iranian media reported Monday. The semi-official Mehr news agency reported the following are on the list: . -- U.S. philanthropist George Soros' Open Society Institute in New York. -- The Washington-based nonprofit National Endowment for Democracy. -- The National Democratic Institute and its GOP counterpart, the International Republican Institute. -- Human Rights Watch. -- The Washington-based Brookings Institution. -- U.S. National Defense University. Media outlets BBC and Voice of America are also on the list, as are the East European Democratic Center in Poland and British nonprofit Wilton Park, among dozens of others. Iran's deputy intelligence minister urged Iranians to avoid any ""unusual relations"" with the groups and with foreign embassies and foreign nationals. ""He stated that it is illegal to sign contracts with these organizations, and it is also against the law for groupings and political parties to receive financial assistance from foreign countries,"" Mehr reported. Such crackdowns have become commonplace in Iran since the summer, when thousands of protesters were arrested in the aftermath of Iran's disputed president election in June. The government has been trying to limit the flow of online information and other forms of communications in Iran, according to activists and human rights officials. Amid the unrest, Iran's judicial chief in July ordered the the prosecution of individuals ""who cooperate with satellite television programming providers,"" according to reports by reformists. Ayatollah Seyyed Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahroudi called on local judicial heads to work with investigators to determine ""intentions, objectives and their sources of financial, political and intelligence support"" of individuals who ""operate against the system,"" according to Hamshahri, a widely circulated pro-reform publication that has been in print for more than a decade. At the time, Iranian-American Kian Tajbakhsh, an independent consultant and urban planner employed by Soros' Open Society Institute, was among roughly 100 people accused of participating in a ""velvet revolution"" against the Islamic republic. Tajbakhsh, the only American on trial in Tehran at the time, resigned from his position with the foundation after he was arrested and detained for four months in 2007 on unspecified charges. He holds dual citizenship in Iran and the United States. Iran's election authority declared incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner of the June 12 race.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Both Iraq and Iran stood their ground Saturday over the reported seizure of a southern Iraqi oil well by Iranian forces. Two days after Iraq said an Iranian ""armed group"" crossed the border into Iraq and seized the well, Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Labid Abawi said the occupation of well No. 4 in Maysan province's Fakka oil field continues. But in a statement issued by its embassy in Iraq, Iran denied what it characterized as rumors of its forces crossing the border, and hinted that the claim was political because it comes ahead of next year's Iraqi parliamentary elections. Both sides said they are in negotiations and have a joint committee dedicated to handling border disputes diplomatically. On Friday, the Iraqi government issued a strong statement deploring the alleged seizure, after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki headed an emergency meeting of Iraq's National Security Council to discuss the situation. Iraq and Iran share a long border, and high-ranking committees from both countries handle all border matters, an Iranian Embassy official said. Iraq and Iran fought a bloody eight-year war that ended in 1988 in a cease-fire with no clear victor and parts of the border under dispute. Ties between Iran and Iraq -- both predominantly Shiite Muslim nations -- greatly improved after the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003. At the same time, there has been widespread concern among Iraqi and U.S. officials that Iran has been providing Iraqi insurgents with material for roadside bombs during the Iraq war. Drilled in 1979, the well is in Iraq's Maysan province, east of Amara, near the Iranian border. It is within the province's Fakka oil field, the Iraqi government said. The report of the oil well incident comes several days after the Oil Ministry's two-day auction of oil fields. Aimed at increasing Iraqi oil production, deals were struck for seven of the 15 fields offered. There also had been oil bidding in June.

"(CNN) -- Walking into school Wednesday morning was not easy for Constance McMillen. The last time she'd been there was March 11, the day after her Fulton, Mississippi, high school canceled prom rather than allow her to wear a tuxedo and attend with her girlfriend. She didn't assume last week's spring break would cool things down. She expected stares, dirty looks and cold shoulders, and passing through the doors was daunting. Over these last two weeks, she said, she's had a hard time sleeping, can barely eat, feels anxious and -- until she saw a doctor for help -- often felt like she was ""going to throw up."" ""I've been very nervous about all of this,"" the 18-year-old Itawamba Agricultural High School senior said. ""I don't like being somewhere where everyone hates me."" McMillen's name made national headlines when she, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, filed suit against her school and the Itawamba County School District, asking them to reinstate prom for everyone, without discrimination. A federal judge in Mississippi ruled Tuesday that while he wouldn't force the school to have a prom, which had originally been scheduled for April 2, he agreed that McMillen's First Amendment rights had been violated. That was good news, said her attorney, Christine Sun, senior counsel with the ACLU's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender project. It set a precedent and helped broadcast an important statement, which was made stronger by virtue of where it came from, she said. ""We're in a conservative area of the country, where people tend to think we can do what we like,"" said Sun, who lives in New York but has traveled multiple times to Mississippi for this legal push. ""This case sends a strong message that that's not going to fly anymore."" The only pending issue, Sun said, is the question of damages and the ACLU's request for attorneys' fees. An amended complaint to seek a quick resolution on this should be filed in the next 30 days, she said. Meantime, McMillen is trying to find her new normal. In many ways, she stands in an awkward balance. Though there are some people who support her in Fulton (population about 4,000), the overarching tension and what she described as ""hostility"" that she feels at school and in her community is in deep contrast to the reception and groundswell of support that's overwhelmed her nationally. As a poster child for the rights of LGBT students, she's been asked to jump on airplanes to appear on news programs and talk shows. The Facebook fan page ""Let Constance Take Her Girlfriend to Prom!"" had attracted more than 414,000 fans as of Friday morning. Wealthy individuals, including Ellen DeGeneres, have offered to pay for a prom for her school. She's received a $30,000 college scholarship from an anonymous donor and Tonic.com, a digital media company in New York that's also offered her a summer internship. She's even been invited to high school proms in cities she's never visited. ""It means a lot to me,"" she said of the outreach from others. ""The amount of support helps me to continue with the fight."" But all McMillen, who came out as a lesbian in eighth grade, ever wanted was to go to her school prom with her class, and with her girlfriend. Going to another school's prom, while a nice offer, doesn't make any sense to her. Parents at her school are reportedly planning a ""ball"" for the same night that prom was intended. McMillen said she's still trying to find out if she's free to attend with her girlfriend. She won't go otherwise. She never meant to be a spoiler for others when she sought approval to bring her girlfriend and wear a tuxedo, she said. She thought she was doing the right thing by asking in advance, since the school had stipulated in a February memo that dates must be of the opposite sex. Rather than give her permission, the school canceled the prom. McMillen said she's learning who her ""true friends"" are. They're the ones who respect her for taking a stance, defend her when others talk trash about her, don't turn their backs when she approaches and aren't afraid to be seen with her. Her girlfriend, too, has remained a constant support, even though she herself hasn't gone public. McMillen also said she's blessed to have family members who shore her up even if they don't all feel comfortable with her sexual orientation. ""My grandmother doesn't believe in it [same-sex relationships] but still stands behind me no matter what,"" McMillen said, her southern drawl thick. ""She's a conservative Christian but respects that it's my life. She doesn't think discrimination of any kind is right."" Whether she intended to or not, McMillen has inspired others -- not just nationally but in her home state, said Izzy Pellegrine, 19, a student at Mississippi State University. ""I thought for a long time I was the only gay person in the state of Mississippi,"" said Pellegrine, who came out at 15 and went to high school about 1½ hours from where McMillen lives. McMillen's actions speak for others who feel unable to speak for themselves, said Pellegrine, who's a founding board member of the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition, which helped connect McMillen with the ACLU. The grass-roots organization seeks to protect the interests of LGBT youth and will host a ""second chance prom"" on May 8, an event Pellegrine estimated may attract as many as 500 students, thanks in large part to the way McMillen's fight empowers others. ""Usually Mississippi is 10 or 20 years behind,"" Pellegrine said. ""For Mississippi to be spearheading the LGBT student movement is unheard of.  I, personally, and my co-workers are so proud to have it happen in our state,"" where ""queer flight,"" the compulsion to leave as soon as one is able, is rampant, she said. As for where life will take McMillen after graduation, she isn't yet sure. She's still thinking about that summer internship offer in New York and is pretty certain she'll attend Itawamba Community College for a couple years before going to one of her dream schools, Southern Mississippi State University or UCLA. What she does know is she'd like to study and possibly pursue a career in psychology. ""I like helping people, and I like talking to people about their problems,"" she said. ""I find the human mind and human behavior very interesting.""","Constance McMillen in news after school cancels prom; she wanted to bring girlfriend .

"Montcoal, West Virginia (CNN) -- I am West Virginia born and raised, and I come from a long line of coal miners. My father, grandfather, brothers, husband and son-in-law either are or were coal miners. My husband spent 35 years as an underground union coal miner and he died of black lung. I live near Coal River Mountain and my community is experiencing a tragedy. The situation here, before this disaster, had already compelled me to become an environmental activist, committed to doing everything I can to stop the destructive practice of coal extraction known as mountaintop removal. I am not trying to stop all coal mining. I believe coal mining will be with us for a very long time, considering our enormous thirst for energy and our slow transition to renewable energy. Throughout Appalachia, 2,000 miles of headwater streams have been destroyed and over 500 mountains have been decapitated by mountaintop removal. I stood by and did nothing until Massey Energy brought this fight to my door. Three years ago, Massey applied for a permit to blow the top off the mountain behind my house. The company plans to level 6,600 acres of Coal River Mountain and turn it into a moonscape where no living, breathing thing can survive. I believe a higher and better use for this mountain is the Coal River Wind Project. On Monday, April 5, an enormous explosion went off at the Upper Big Branch mine at Performance Coal Co., a subsidiary of Massey Energy. Thirty-one men in our community didn't come home that day. We don't yet know the names of all of the deceased and I dread the day when the list is read and we, at last, know our connection to those who didn't make it. I felt extremely blessed when I knew that my family members who worked at this mine were home and safe. I know many friends and neighbors will be among those we lost and I grieve for all of the families involved. On April 6, many heartbroken and terrified families kissed their loved ones at the door and sent them off back to work underground. These very brave men enter these mines knowing their fate will probably be the same as their friends' on April 5 or the same as my husband's. Now, although these very proud, brave and strong men make about $70,000 a year, if they had a choice, many of them would never go underground again. The problem is that we live in a mono-economy and there are no choices. The coal industry has a death grip in the state of West Virginia and we have some of the best politicians money can buy. We also have some very honest, good and environmentally friendly politicians. Their numbers are small and it is considered to be political suicide to do anything in West Virginia that appears to be anti-coal. Many of our representatives have tunnel vision and refuse to advocate for job diversity in the coal fields. Coal is a finite resource, and no matter when you think, it will eventually run out -- someday we will have harvested all of the economically feasible coal. When that day comes, how will the people we love support their families? I live at ground zero for mountaintop removal and because of the stand that I and many other people have taken to stop it, tensions run high in the coal fields. We are all being used by an outlaw industry and corrupt politicians and we are all driven by fear. The men who work in surface mining are terrified they will lose their jobs. I am terrified that my granddaughter will not have clean drinking water when she is of child-bearing age if we don't stop this. Massey Energy's record speaks for itself. With an enormous amount of violations and previous deaths at this mine, I will leave it to you to decide if this company puts profits before the safety of its workers or views its employees as a disposable commodity. We are coping with this enormous tragedy, and sometimes tragedy brings communities together. I can only hope that something good will come out of all of this bad. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Lorelei Scarbro.","Lorelei Scarbro comes from a long line of coal miners; husband died of black lung .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama said Wednesday night he will work with Congress and the military to repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that bars gays and lesbians from openly serving in the armed forces. Obama made the remark in his first State of the Union speech during a short litany of civil rights issues, which included his successful hate crimes bill, a move to ""crack down on equal-pay laws"" and improvement of the immigration system. ""We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution: the notion that we are all created equal, that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected by it,"" he said. ""We must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination. We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate,"" he said. ""This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are."" Weigh in on the president's address . Former Navy pilot Sen. John McCain said ""it would be a mistake"" to repeal the 1993 law that bars gay men and lesbians from revealing their sexual orientation, and prevents the military from asking about it. ""This successful policy has been in effect for over 15 years, and it is well understood and predominantly supported by our military at all levels,"" McCain said. ""We have the best-trained, best-equipped, and most professional force in the history of our country, and the men and women in uniform are performing heroically in two wars. At a time when our Armed Forces are fighting and sacrificing on the battlefield, now is not the time to abandon the policy."" But in a message to Pentagon leadership, Gen. John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it's time to repeal the law. ""As a nation built on the principal of equality, we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger more cohesive military,"" said Shalikashvili. His letter was sent to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who supports repealing the policy. The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an organization that works with those affected by the ""don't ask, don't tell"" law, praised Obama's call for repeal. ""We very much need a sense of urgency to get this done in 2010,"" the group said. ""We call on the president to repeal the archaic 1993 law in his defense budget currently being drafted, that is probably the only and best moving bill where DADT can be killed this year. ... The American public, including conservatives, is overwhelmingly with the commander in chief on this one."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, flatly disagreed with the idea of ending it. ""When it comes to 'don't ask don't tell,' frankly, I think it's worked very well. And we just ought to leave it alone,"" he said to reporters Wednesday morning. The policy prohibits openly gay men and women from serving in the U.S. armed forces. The policy bans military recruiters or authorities from asking about an individual's sexual orientation but also prohibits a service member from revealing that he or she is gay. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, supports ending the practice but wants to go about it carefully. Levin said he did not have any details about what the president would say. ""If we do this in a way which isn't sensitive ... we could have exactly the opposite effect of what I hope will be the case -- which is to change the policy,"" he said Monday. Levin said the committee plans to hold hearings on the issue in early February, although the hearing may be with outside experts -- delaying a hearing with Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen, that had originally been promised, CNN was told by a congressional source. Obama campaigned on the promise that he would repeal the law in his first year of office. Speaking to the gay rights group Human Rights Campaign, in October, Obama admitted that ""our progress may be taking longer than we like,"" but he insisted his administration was still on track to overturn the policy. ""Do not doubt the direction we are heading and the destination we will reach,"" he said. Pentagon Spokesman Geoff Morrell deflected repeated questions about the policy at Wednesday's Pentagon briefing, directing reporters to take their questions to the White House. ""We continue to work on this problem,"" said Morrell. ""But I'm not going to get into it with more specificity than that.""

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer suffered a surprise defeat to Czech Tomas Berdych in the fourth round of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami. The Swiss top seed was a long way from his best as Berdych edged a tight battle 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (8-6). Federer had a match point in the deciding tie-break but missed his chance with a wayward forehand, allowing Berdych to claim the victory three points later. Federer, who won the latest of his record 16 Grand Slam singles titles at the Australian Open in January, had only lost once to Berdych in nine previous meetings. ""It's no secret I've struggled the last five matches I've played here in the States,"" Federer told the official ATP Tour Web site. ""I'm definitely lacking timing. I don't know where that comes from because I played so nicely in Australia. So it's disappointing to not be able to back it up."" They were joined in the quarterfinals by American Andy Roddick, who fought back from 4-1 down to defeat Germany's Benjamin Becker 7-6 (7-4) 6-3. Fourth seed Rafael Nadal beat fellow Spaniard and 15th seed David Ferrer 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 and will next face eighth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who trounced Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain 6-2 6-2.

Williams, who had required three sets to defeat Daniela Hantuchova in the previous round, was delighted to have had an easier ride this time around. ""Getting through a match like yesterday makes me more confident because it wasn't exactly my best game,"" she told the tournament's official Web site. ""Today I was kind of eager to clean up my act. We had some really good rallies and really good points, but I just see me keep coming out on top, so of course I like that.""","Roger Federer loses to Tomas Berdych at Sony Ericsson Open fourth round in Miami.

"(CNN) -- Two top Iranian opposition leaders have called on supporters to protest on February 11, the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, an opposition Web site reported. According to The Green Way Web site, a meeting took place Saturday between opposition leaders Mehdi Karroubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi at Karroubi's home. They discussed the two executions that happened last week and the cases of 16 protesters who went on trial Saturday, the site reported. ""The widespread arrests of political activists and university students, the silencing of the media, and the forced confessions of prisoners are against the principles of Islam and the constitution of Iran,"" the leaders said in a statement. They also called for people to take to the streets on February 11 to demand their rights back as citizens of Iran, The Green Way reported. Meanwhile, state-run Press TV quoted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Sunday as saying that the nation will deliver a harsh blow to ""global arrogance"" on February 11. Press TV offered no details on or explanation of the statement. Opposition protests were launched after the disputed June 12 presidential election that gave hardline Ahmadinejad a second term. The government denies accusations of fraud. About 4,000 people have been arrested in the post-election crackdown. As of January 24, the government had confirmed the deaths of at least 37 people in the protests or in detention, seven of those deaths happening on the religious holiday of Ashura. On Thursday, authorities hanged Mohammed Reza Ali Zamani, 37, and Arash Rahmanipour, 20, who had been convicted of being enemies of God and plotting to topple the Islamic regime. The two were convicted in mass trials of opposition supporters in August, but Rahmanipour's lawyer said the young man was arrested two months before the election.","Top Iranian opposition leaders call for February 11 protest, opposition Web site reports .

"Cottage Grove, Minnesota (CNN) -- Unlike many other boys his age, 17-year-old Levi Dubov wakes up excited to go to class each day. ""There is no other place like this,"" he says, as he finishes up breakfast in his school's basement cafeteria. Dubov is talking about his Yeshiva school outside Minnesota's Twin Cities, known simply as MyYeshiva. The boys' school not only focuses on the study of Judaism. It's one of a few Yeshivas nationwide that combines religious teaching with a focus on students with special learning needs. The school aims to help kids who are ""stuck in the middle"" -- who can't keep up with the pace of regular schools, but haven't completely given up either. ""[It's] a place for kids that are struggling everywhere else,"" the school's director, Rabbi Moshe Weiss, said. ""There wasn't ever a place for those kids."" Students come from all over the country to attend this boarding school, including many from low-income households. ""We wanted to try and help those kids out there that need more attention,"" Weiss said, sitting in his office after just returning with the students from a twice weekly hockey trip to the local ice rink. Since opening in 2006, the school has seen its enrollment double from its inaugural class of 18 students. Dubov, now in 11th grade, feels more at home here than he did at his previous Yeshiva in his hometown of Montreal, Canada. ""They told me I was a weak learner,"" he said.  But he says at MyYeshiva he excels because of the different pace of teaching. Tzemi Zimmerman, a ninth-grader from Chicago, Illinois, says he struggles with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ""In another school, if you can't keep up with the learning, they'll tell you ... 'We're going to have to suspend you,'"" Zimmerman said. He says the school's dedicated time for physical education -- another unique quality of this Yeshiva -- makes it easier for him to sit through classes. ""It makes you feel like people care,"" he said. ""It's just -- you're wanted. You're part of everybody."" Victoria Livshutz, whose son attends the school, says he would be in a much different situation if it weren't for the school. ""They are just like a family, which, to me, is very important,"" she said. ""Because even though he is a big boy, he still needs a lot of attention."" The school's co-founder Rabbi Mordechai Friedman calls MyYeshiva a place where ""there's a little bit less of the stress in learning, a little bit more relaxed in academics."" ""We want to know how you are doing -- not just what your test scores look like,"" Friedman said. While the school may be unique in many ways, it's still a functioning business. The rough economy hasn't passed by unnoticed. Weiss acknowledges they've had difficulty making mortgage payments this past year. If they can't come up with the remainder of the building's cost in cash or five-year pledges by May 15 -- about $500,000 -- they'll be forced out. ""We're talking about these kids' home and the future kids that are going to come here,"" Weiss said. ""I believe that with God's help, the best case scenario is going to occur."" While this year the school has set tuition at more than $18,000 a year, it typically operates with a ""pay what you can"" mentality. But this is the first time since the school opened four years ago that not one of the 36 enrolled students has been able to come up with the full amount. Weiss blames a combination of factors. ""Throughout last year, lots of our parents lost their jobs,"" Weiss said, adding that they also ""lost donations due to the economy, some large."" Regardless, students and faculty are optimistic. ""What'd they say about Chrysler? Too big too fold. We're not as big as Chrysler -- yet. But we're too important,"" Friedman said. ""To see the kids we're helping, there is no way in my mind that this won't continue,"" Rabbi Weiss said. ""God is not that cynical."" Levi Dubov says without this school, he'll likely end up moving to Israel where his family lives now.  That means he'd have to join the Israeli army after his 18th birthday. But Tzemi Zimmerman offers a reassuring assessment: . ""Someone will pull us through,"" he said. ""We're going to keep going on like this for many more years, and one day maybe I can send my children here.""","Boys' school is one of few Yeshivas to focus on students with special learning needs .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The optimism once held by many Americans has been ""beaten out"" of them amid a lagging economy, threat of terrorism and two ongoing wars, according to a professor at Emory University. ""All of those things ... have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be,"" says Patrick Allitt, a British citizen who teaches American history. Allitt recently wrote about what he describes as ""America the miserable"" -- the mood swing he has seen in his 30 years in the U.S. -- for The Spectator, a British magazine. Read the professor's full essay . Allitt spoke with CNN about his perspective. Below is a transcript of that conversation, which has been edited: . CNN: How would you describe the change in America since you first came to America? Allitt: The change is this: I don't get the same sense of intense self confidence as I used to feel when I first came to America, even though that was a period that's usually remembered as a pretty grim time -- the Jimmy Carter years when there was a lot of stagnation and inflation and a general feeling of malaise. Even so, to me, it seemed incredibly energetic here. People in America worked much, much harder than they did in Britain. They seemed more upbeat. They had faith in progress. And there was this feeling of being intensely wide awake for the first time. But now, I think some of that optimism has been beaten out. Counter: Why there's reason for optimism . It's been a very tough 10 years since 2001, hasn't it? The attack on the World Trade Center, the growing fear of terrorism, the difficulty of prevailing in the wars, obviously, more recently the recession. All of those things, collectively, have made people start to be much more doubtful than they used to be. CNN: Do you attribute it to a change in American mentality or are we exposed to an array of different beliefs through the ever-expanding media landscape? Allitt: It's certainly true there are far more media than there used to be ... that devote a lot of time to people who are dissatisfied. In other words, if somebody's happy, that isn't news. It's certainly news when they become dissatisfied in some way or they have some kind of problem to deal with. In that sense, I suppose there's an inherent bias in favor of bad news. But I think it's more than that. I've spent most of the last 30 years in the company of academics, who also tend to be pessimistic people. They tend to have very high ideals for America. When they see it doesn't live up to its ideals, it makes them disappointed and sometimes embittered. So it may be that, if I spent more time with less educated people, I wouldn't have this sense quite so acutely. I think that's quite possible. CNN: You write: ""The decline of American confidence isn't just a temporary blip on the screen brought on by the recession."" Elaborate on that for me. Allitt: Even before this recession began, I guess it was in October and November 2008 when things really started to go bad. Already by then, I was having a feeling that the general national optimism was less emphatic than it used to be. In the first five or six years of the last decade, there was this feeling that things were going wrong, particularly that the wars were grinding on interminably and that it was very difficult to prevail. It wasn't the same kind of decisive conflict as World War II where you're fighting against a nation-state and you can clearly detect when you're winning. The dispersal of the enemy and the very shadowy character of terrorism tends to be very depressing to confront. You have to maintain a high degree of vigilance and sometimes you have to take comfort in thinking what's extraordinary is what didn't happen; there wasn't another major attack. That doesn't feel like a victory. ... That kind of thing is what I was attentive to when I was writing this story. CNN: If we are in this funk as you describe, is there anything wrong with that? And how do we emerge from it? Allitt: The one thing I've always admired about Americans is their willingness to be self-critical. I do think you could take the view that the very fact that so many Americans are willing to scrutinize their own behavior and their nation's behavior is a sign that they do have these high ideals and they want to live up to them. So in that sense, you can take an optimistic view, even of pessimism -- that sooner or later, the sheer attention to it is going to cause people to recover. But I do think there are generational trends in American life. People who were brought up in the 1930s during the Great Depression -- the image of it stayed with them for a lifetime. ... In the same way, I expect the kids who have grown up in the last few years are also going to carry the marks of this with them through life. They'll come into conflict with their own children who have different generational experiences. It's impossible at this stage to say what's going to happen next. ... But it certainly is true studying the American past, you can see how various traumatic events through the nation's history leave a long-term impression on the people themselves. CNN: You kind of hint about this in your piece: Maybe you're just going through a midlife crisis and that's why you might have this view. Allitt: I think that's possible, but I think I'm describing something more real than that. My job is to study the American people in the past; but also to some extent in the present. I really do feel this kind of change has come about. But you can't quantify it. You can't say 8 out of 10 people are optimistic -- or at least if you try to you're really giving a false sense of definiteness. So what I'm trying to do is capture a mood and compare it to a mood that I saw previously. ... I still feel there's an enormous amount of hope and potential and capability here, so I don't share the feeling of gloom, which I see in the people around me. CNN: Describe the ""Avatar"" analogy for me? Allitt: The plot [of ""Avatar""] is kind of incredibly depressing. The corporation is at the center of this planet. First of all, they have invaded the planet. And now they're sort of stomping on the homeland of the blue people who live there. And really the picture it gives you of America is incredibly depressing. It shows Americans to be greedy and incredibly violent and intolerant, and they haven't got time for this anthropological experiment that's going on. But obviously, the hero is one of the Americans. He's clearly an outsider. ... The main part of the story is a condemnation of America and its values. I was surprised how few reviewers said this picture is a grotesque distortion of what we're really like. CNN: Have you started receiving hate mail yet: Hey, Brit, get the hell out of our country? Allitt: No, not at all. ... It certainly isn't meant to be an attack on America; quite the opposite. As I say, I'm very, very pro-American. CNN: Any final thoughts? Allitt: To me, coming from Britain, one thing that is so inspiring about the United States is people really believe in human equality and they really take it seriously and they try to make it a reality. When I was growing up in Britain, nobody talked about equality. It's a very hierarchical society in Britain, and everyone has their own place within the hierarchy and others are below them -- and then, what you've got to do is stay in your place. So it felt very liberating for me to come to America. Although obviously, this isn't a society where everybody is equal in practice. But at least this is a place where everybody tries hard to make sure that every kid really does have the opportunities to make the most of their own abilities. And that's a great thing. There haven't been many societies in the entire history of the world that have been like that.","British professor recently wrote about what he calls ""America the miserable""

"(CNN) -- An overdose of a blood thinner may have contributed to the death of a Nebraska toddler, the Omaha hospital that treated her said Thursday. The Nebraska Medical Center is investigating the death Wednesday of 23-month-old Almariah Duque, said hospital spokesman Paul Baltes. The girl, who lived with her parents in Dallas, Texas, was born with a birth defect and in December had undergone a transplant at the hospital of her small intestine, pancreas and liver, Baltes said. The hospital has one of the nation's largest intestinal rehabilitation and transplant programs, he said. The girl was readmitted in February after an infection and died at 5 p.m. Wednesday, the hospital said in a statement. ""It appears an overdose of the blood thinner heparin may have contributed,"" said the statement, which called the death ""a deeply troubling and emotional incident"" for hospital personnel. ""We all want to extend our deepest apologies to the Duque family for their tragic loss,"" it added. Heparin is routinely used after a variety of medical procedures as an anticoagulant. ""The medical center strives to provide the highest level of care and will use this tragic event to continue to improve and find ways to prevent errors in the delivery of complex health care,"" the statement said. The medical center is paying for funeral and travel expenses for the girl's parents, Greg and Kenya Duque, who have no other children, Baltes said. ""We just want her voice to be heard and for this to never happen again to any child or adult,"" said the parents in a statement released by the hospital. ""We believe this was an honest mistake but one that needs to be corrected. We love her, we did everything we could for her and we don't want this to ever happen again.""","23-month-old Almariah Duque died Wednesday .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haitians have to be in the driver's seat as they try to rebuild their shattered country after last week's devastating earthquake, the head of the International Monetary Fund told CNN Friday. ""We can provide resources, but there must be ownership by the Haitians themselves and especially by the Haitian authorities,"" Dominique Strauss-Kahn said during an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Repeating his call for some kind of Marshall Plan like the one that rebuilt Western Europe after World War II, Strauss-Kahn said, ""We need to have the entire international community working together -- I call it a Marshall Plan."" His comments came three days before an international donors' conference in Montreal, Canada, that will raise money for Haiti and look at long-term prospects for recovery.

""We cannot just deal with some piecemeal thing, saying we're going to provide some resources here, some other resources here,"" he added. ""It has to be a comprehensive plan, and I think that the Haitian authorities agree with this view."" Jeffrey Sachs, a special adviser to the U.N. secretary-general and head of Columbia University's Earth Institute, strongly supported Strauss-Kahn's view. Sachs said Haiti needs a sustained international effort coordinated not by the U.S. government but by an organization such as the Inter-American Development Bank.

It has to put money in the hands of Haitians and not just the Haitian elite.""

"(CNN) -- Kim Clijsters continued her successful return to tennis by demolishing American third seed Venus Williams in the final of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami on Saturday. The Belgian, a former world No. 1 but seeded 14th for this event following her two-year absence from the women's circuit, will move up to 10th in the rankings next week following her one-sided 6-2 6-1 triumph at Key Biscayne. Williams had been hoping for a fourth title at the event, having won her last two tournaments, but was well below par as Clijsters added to her 2005 victory in Miami in just 58 minutes. The 26-year-old claimed her third title since making her comeback last year after giving birth to baby daughter Jada, who was watching her mum from the stands again on Saturday. The 2009 U.S. Open champion notched up her 37th triumph in WTA Tour events, 28 of those now on hardcourt surfaces. She passed $17 million in career earnings after taking home the $700,000 first prize -- which is almost $100,000 more than the winner of Sunday's men's final between Andy Roddick and Tomas Berdych will receive. Clijsters, who defeated fellow comeback queen Justine Henin in an epic semifinal on Friday, broke Williams to love to seal the title. ""It took a lot of hard work to get back into shape and I have a few people to thank, including my fitness coach and husband,"" Clijsters said on-court after the match. ""It feels really good to be back here, having won the title in 2005. It's always nice to come back to a place you have done well before, and to such a beautiful stadium."" Williams, cheered on by injured younger sister and current No. 1 Serena, made 29 unforced errors to Clijsters' 12 as she struggled to continue her recent good run of form. ""Sometimes when you hit a few bad shots it's not as easy to reel it in, and things start to go a little bit quicker,"" said Williams, who will rise to fourth in the rankings. ""Obviously against a player like Kim, if you make too many errors, the match can go quickly. I mean, I think she hit eight winners, so it wasn't that she played extremely solid -- it's not like I was blown off the court. Unfortunately I was my own worst enemy today.""","Kim Clijsters demolishes Venus Williams in final of Sony Ericsson Open in Miami .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department remained tightlipped Friday as criticism mounted over the decision to hold the the September 11 terrorist attack trial in a civilian court in lower Manhattan. Earlier, senior Obama administration officials confirmed that the White House is considering moving the site of the trial if the Justice Department sees fit. ""Conversations have occurred within the administration to discuss contingency options should the possibility of a trial in lower Manhattan be foreclosed upon by Congress or locally,"" a senior administration official said. Justice Department officials refused to acknowledge whether they are being pressed to find an alternative location, despite bipartisan concern that holding the trial in Manhattan would be too costly and disruptive. ""We're reviewing our options,"" said Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd in a statement Friday. The administration's turnabout comes after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other politicians expressed great concern over the costs and disruption of holding the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four accomplices at a courthouse near Ground Zero in lower Manhattan. White House officials said President Obama agrees with Attorney General Eric Holder's decision in November to try the suspects in a civilian criminal court in the United States, not a military tribunal. ""Currently our federal jails hold hundreds of convicted terrorists, and the president's opinion has not changed on that,"" White House spokesman Bill Burton said Thursday. White House officials say the decision about any possible alternate sites to try Mohammed and the others will come from the Justice Department. One government official close to the case said other New York locations, including a military site on New York Harbor's Governor's Island, are possibilities. And while Virginia sites also were mentioned as alternatives by former counterterrorism officials, Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat, opposed moving the trial to his state. ""Bringing enemy combatants for detention or trial in Washington, D.C., or Northern Virginia would unnecessarily burden these communities from both a financial and security perspective,"" Webb said. New York police estimated the cost to the city would be over $200 million per year in what could be a multi-year trial and that over 2,000 checkpoints would need to be installed around Lower Manhattan. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said additional protection would have to be deployed for the city, not just the core area of Manhattan. Residents like Pat Moore contemplated what it will be like to live through the trial. ""Those people would virtually be held prisoner in their homes,"" Moore said of New Yorkers who live near the courthouse. ""We've all been traumatized, any of us who were there that day"" referring to September 11. Bloomberg initially supported the move, saying ""it is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the World Trade Center site where so many New Yorkers were murdered."" But this week he used different rhetoric when asked about a community agency's proposal's to relocate the trial, saying he would prefer the trial be held elsewhere, perhaps at a military base where it would be easier and cheaper to provide security. ""It's going to cost an awful lot of money and disturb a lot of people,"" Bloomberg said. On Thursday, a group of New York politicians urged the Obama administration to thoroughly re-examine locating the trials in downtown Manhattan. ""We are concerned that the administration has not fully considered the impact that the trials would have on lower Manhattan in choosing the Moynihan Courthouse in Foley Square,"" U.S. Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Nydia Velazquez, both Democrats, and several state and local officials said in a letter dated Thursday to Holder. Also, a spokeswoman for Gov. David Paterson cited his ""hesitation"" with the decision, citing the burdens it would pose on city residents. A spokesman for U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand raised financial concerns, saying her ""single biggest concern is making sure that the federal government cover the hundreds of millions of dollars per year cost to New York City for security during the trials."" Julie Menin, chairwoman of a city community advisory agency, proposed four alternative locations for the trial within the Southern District of Manhattan: Governors Island, Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the Bureau of Prisons jail complex at FCI Otisville. A West Point spokesman said no one has officially requested a review of demands for such a trial, which would require in-depth study of legal and security concerns. Some U.S. senators -- including Homeland Security Committee chairman Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut -- want the detainees tried in military commissions. A letter from one group of senators said a federal civilian trial would provide militants with ""one of the most visible platforms in the world to exalt their past acts and to rally others in support of further terrorism."" One congressman, U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, is planning to introduce legislation that would cut off funding for the trial and block transfer of the September 11 suspects to New York. U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Dean Boyd said the Justice Department ""can safely prosecute this case in the Southern District of New York while minimizing disruptions to the community to the greatest extent possible, consistent with security needs."" President Obama is ""committed to seeing"" Mohammed, the mastermind of the attacks ""brought to justice,"" Burton said. ""Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is a murderous thug who has admitted to crimes ... some of the most heinous crimes ever committed against our country,"" he said. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux, Terry Frieden and Cassie Spodak contributed to this report.","Moving site of 9/11 trial from Manhattan under consideration, administration officials say .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people gathered Tuesday in Marrowbone, Kentucky, to lay to rest nine people who were killed in a crash in central Kentucky last week. John and Sadie Esh were killed when a tractor-trailer crossed the median on Interstate 65 and smashed into their van as they traveled to Iowa for a wedding. Four of the couple's children -- Leroy, Rachel, Rose and Anna -- were also killed, according to the Rev. Leroy Kauffman with the Marrowbone Christian Brotherhood. Leroy's wife, Naomi, and a baby the couple adopted were also killed, as was Rachel's fiance, Joel Gingerich, he said. A family friend, also in the van, was killed as well. The driver of the tractor-trailer also died. Two boys, age 3 and 5, whom Leroy and Naomi adopted, survived. ""They have lived their lives, God seemed fit to take them home, and we rest in that,"" said Michael Kauffman, a member of the Mennonite community. He said family and friends had traveled from all over the United States to attend the funeral. CNN affiliate WBKO, quoting a media liaison at the services, said about 3,000 people attended. ""The amount of people who came is overwhelming to say the least,"" Kauffman said. ""We have been very blessed with the amount of people who are here."" The nine were to be buried in a grassy spot where John and Sadie's son Johnny was buried. He died while on a mission trip in the Ukraine three years ago, Leroy Kauffman said last week. ""I have not been to the grave site, but I feel like it's the way it should be,"" Michael Kauffman said.

"Moorhead, Minnesota (CNN) -- He's been there for 30 years, and 85-year-old Lloyd Paulson isn't moving anytime soon. But on his stretch of Rivershore Drive in this city just east of Fargo, North Dakota, he's essentially the only one. ""I want to go feet-first out of here,"" Paulson said from his living room, which is now just feet from rising floodwaters. ""I don't want to leave. I want to stay here because I enjoy it so much."" Last year, he and his family and friends saved his home from the record flooding that nearly ravaged the entire city -- but it took 30,000 sand bags. A farm boy since birth, Paulson said the sandbagging in 2009 saved his property from major damage, meaning another pleasant year of watching the wildlife in his backyard. ""I can see turkeys and squirrels and deer. They come up at night."" But when the retired sporting goods store manager looks down the street now, what he sees is a mix of houses on stilts ready to be moved and vacant houses awaiting demolition. The neighbors in the 14 houses to his south and three to the north sold their homes to the city, accepting its offer to buy them out so that a more permanent levee can be built up in their place. Paulson says he's surprised that so many people made the decision, since some had ""beautiful homes."" The buyouts were voluntary, but since Paulson decided to stay, he must foot the bill for his portion of that new levee himself. He hasn't received a bill yet, but he says whatever the cost, it should be worth it because that mountain of dirt will mean his days of sandbagging are over. Since the city's new levee isn't up yet, earthen levees surrounding Paulson's home are protecting it from this year's flood. ""The cupboards are all stocked up, the freezer is all stocked up, so I can stay here for weeks without having to go out,"" Paulson said, laughing. And those levees will protect him up to a 43-foot crest. The most recent forecast calls for a crest of 38 feet, so Paulson says he's ""not worried at all"" about staying in his home while the water is high. His wife of 57 years died shortly after the flood of 2009. But even though he now lives there solo, Paulson said he doesn't feel lonely. ""Not at all. I have so many friends in town, and every day, I'm out doing something. The phone rings regularly,"" he said. Are you there? Share photos, video of flood . When asked how he feels to be known as the last man standing in his neighborhood, the one who won't leave, Paulson said he ""didn't do this for publicity.""

"(CNN) -- Roy Braswell was 9 years old when the flu pandemic of 1918 hit. Margaret Duchez, 94, sees some similarities to the 1918 situation, like the dozens of school closings. ""I know it's a bad feeling, 'cause I had it,"" said Braswell, 100, who now lives in Cobb County in Georgia. ""It makes you have headaches, you be out of your head, you don't know nothing."" Margaret Duchez, 94, did not have the flu, but remembers that in 1918 her grandmother locked the door so that she couldn't go outside during the pandemic. In her community near Cleveland, Ohio, people were afraid to go to church, walk in the street or let children play outside, she said. An entire family died around the corner from her. ""People were dying so fast in our parish, which was old St. Patrick's, they could not bury them fast enough,"" Duchez said. A study in Nature last year showed survivors of the 1918 pandemic still have some immunity to that virus in the form of B cells, which are immune cells that produce antibodies. Now, researchers are taking the knowledge from that study to work toward an antibody treatment for swine flu, the 2009 H1N1 virus that has sickened hundreds of people worldwide.  Learn about other influenza pandemics in history » . When a person gets infected with a virus, the body typically mounts an immune response to it. B cells produce antibodies, leaving the person at least partially immune to the disease, said Dr. James Crowe, professor at Vanderbilt University and lead study author. The levels of immune response tend to wane with time, he said. The response is strongest within the first several months, and then diminishes over the following years. In the Nature study, supported by the National Institutes of Health, Crowe and colleagues took these rare B cells from survivors' blood and cloned the antibody genes from these cells to produce antibodies in the laboratory. ""It's interesting because we had this technology, and we should be able to do this with survivors of any flu,"" he said. Applying this technique to the 2009 H1N1 virus, researchers could use blood from swine flu survivors to develop an antibody molecule, which is ""a biologic drug that we could give to people to protect them against the current swine flu, or possibly to treat them,"" he said. Crowe said he was shocked to find B cells that produce 1918 flu antibodies from the blood of flu survivor volunteers 90 years after they got the illness. ""Typically, it's thought that you have high levels of antibodies for about 10 years,"" he said. ""Our studies have shown in some cases you keep antibodies for the rest of your life. Crowe and collaborators are now in the process of working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to get blood samples of survivors of 2009 H1N1. If a survivor of a virus maintains immunity for years, does this mean people should try to contract a mild case of a virus so that they will naturally develop antibodies? This used to be the logic with chicken pox, a far more serious illness for adults than children. Before there was a vaccine, people thought children ought to catch the disease to avoid complications later in life, he said. But Crowe does not advise that anyone purposely contract swine flu to develop immunity, even in the United States, where most cases appear mild. ""We don't know yet how severe this virus is going to be,"" he said. Duchez, who follows the news on television from her assisted living community in Westlake, Ohio, sees some similarities to the 1918 situation -- for example, the dozens of school closings nationwide.   Watch another 1918 epidemic survivor share her memories » . Still, the swine flu does not seem as bad, she said. Duchez recalls that when she went to school at age 6, in 1920, the nuns told of how they became nurses and put sulfur in their shoes to protect themselves from catching diseases. People are worried now, but not like they were back then. And Duchez herself does not fear the swine flu.   ""My life is in the hands of God. Why should I be afraid?"" she said.","Study: Survivors of 1918 pandemic still have some immunity to that virus .

"(CNN)  -- The recent emergence in the United States of ""K2,"" sometimes called synthetic marijuana, is testing lawmakers to see if they've been paying attention to the failures of marijuana prohibition and will respond to K2 with enlightened policy. The first stories on K2, or ""Spice,"" broke out with headlines labeling the mixture of herbs and spices, which are treated with a synthetic compound, as ""fake pot."" K2 was virtually unknown until the media hyped up its presence at tobacco and novelty shops. Under U.S. law, and in all 50 states, the herbal product is legal, and also unregulated. People who have tried K2 often report psychoactive effects that are comparable to marijuana, but notably less pleasurable. When lawmakers consider regulating K2, they should keep in mind that the government has waged a futile war against marijuana and people who use the drug for decades. For another opinion, click here . Elected officials have burned through billions of taxpayer dollars chasing marijuana sellers, bagging marijuana plants and jailing marijuana users. Government-funded media campaigns have sought to scare children and adults away from marijuana with grossly exaggerated claims that using the drug will lead to death and mayhem. Despite all of these efforts, the public has largely dismissed the myths and hysteria around marijuana and recognized that the drug has important medicinal benefits. Moreover, public opinion is leaning in favor of a regulated and taxed market for marijuana. Researchers who have tested K2 identified synthetic chemicals that are thought to mimic the psychoactive component in marijuana. These chemicals are thought to act on the cannabinoid receptors in the brain much the way that THC -- the principal psychoactive component in marijuana -- operates. What's notable about these synthetic chemicals is that very little is known about them, and this legal alternative designed to deliver an experience like marijuana may actually carry more risk. Thus we have a supreme irony of drug prohibition: The government continues to criminalize marijuana -- a drug with established medical value that has undergone exhaustive study -- and entrepreneurs introduce a legal alternative to marijuana with ingredients scientists know little about. Given this potential for harm, and the growing volume of sensational media portrayals of K2, some lawmakers have ignored the lessons learned from marijuana prohibition and moved to criminalize possession and sales of K2. Lawmakers in Kansas, Kentucky and Missouri have already written legislation to ban the herbal mix. It seems that a reporter need only write an article about an obscure bag of twigs to spur a lawmaker to criminalize more chemicals and the people who use them. Time and time again, elected officials have dropped the ball when it comes to regulating drugs. Lawmakers have preferred to lazily pass the responsibility of controlling a drug on to law enforcement and the criminal justice system. The problem is, we know from marijuana prohibition that law enforcement has no control over the drug market and the criminals who run it. Criminalizing K2 will only worsen the devastating harm our society already suffers under drug prohibition. Rather than regulation of the supply and ingredients of K2, criminalization leaves the question of what goes into the product up to drug dealers. Rather than passing regulations that bar K2 sales to minors, criminalizing K2 will essentially give dealers the green light to sell the product to whomever they please. By choosing to ban K2 outright, lawmakers will also forfeit badly needed state revenue from K2 sales and instead commit millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate, prosecute and jail K2 users. Plus, researchers point out that hundreds of other known synthetic chemicals will easily reach store shelves once K2 is banned. The sensible legislative response to K2 is to create effective regulatory controls on sale and possession. California and Maine have passed model legislation that formally regulates and taxes adult sales of salvia divinorium -- another product with psychoactive properties -- and criminalizes salvia sales to minors. Lawmakers should deliver a knockout to prohibition and pass laws that will actually regulate and control K2. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Grant Smith.","Grant Smith: ""K2,"" sometimes called synthetic marijuana, should be regulated for safety .
But, he says, lawmakers must not duplicate costly, futile war against marijuana .

"(CNN) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received a candidate vaccine virus for swine flu from one institution Friday, spokesman Thomas Skinner said in an e-mail. The CDC estimates more than 100,000 people have had swine flu in the United States. The CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have also created a candidate vaccine virus for swine flu, also known as 2009 H1N1, using reverse genetics, he said. ""Suitable viruses will hopefully be sent to manufacturers by end of next week,"" Skinner wrote. Once that happens, vaccine makers will tweak the virus and have ""pilot lots"" of vaccine ready to be tested by mid- to late June. Several thousand cases have been reported nationally, but the CDC estimates more than 100,000 people have had swine flu in the United States, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director for science and public health program at the CDC, in a news conference Friday. Most of these people probably have not been officially tested. The first sample virus came from a lab run by virologist Doris Bucher at New York Medical College, in Valhalla, New York. Bucher told CNN Thursday that she had just packaged four viruses that she considers vaccine candidates and sent the samples to the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, via courier. Earlier this week, a Korean scientist, Dr. Seo Sang-heui, also claimed to have produced a virus that might be used in a swine flu vaccine. But Skinner said the methods Sang-heui used were not suitable and that his virus was not considered a viable candidate. Bucher's samples will likely get more attention. For the past five years her lab in Valhalla has produced elements of the seasonal vaccine that's given to tens of millions of Americans each year. She says the process she's using with the H1N1 virus is virtually identical to the process her lab uses when working on that seasonal vaccine. The virus used in vaccines is not the actual virus that infects people, but rather a hybrid that's been genetically modified to make it safer, and to give it the ability to multiply more quickly -- a crucial factor when it comes to manufacturing large quantities. Bucher's method of achieving this has a decidedly old-fashioned feel. She first injects a sample of ""wild virus""-- in this case, H1N1 virus she got from the CDC, originally culled from a child who was infected in California this spring -- and then injects a sample of another flu strain that's known for its ability to rapidly multiply in eggs. For that, Bucher is using a strain with the exotic sounding name of NYMC X-157. (That's NYMC as in ""New York Medical Center;"" it's a hybrid of an H3N2 seasonal virus and the so-called ""Puerto Rico strain,"" A/PR/8/34, that's used to speed the growth of seasonal flu vaccine). Together in the egg, the viruses swap genes. In a laborious series of steps, Bucher's team guides the changes by adding antibodies that eliminate the surface proteins of the H3N2 virus. The end result is a virus with the exterior proteins of the H1N1 swine flu -- so the immune system recognizes it -- but with the inner mechanics -- the fast-growth ability -- of X-157. Another method of creating a candidate virus also mixes wild virus with a second, fast-growing strain, but instead of growing them in eggs, lets the viruses mingle in a special solution while scientists manipulate them through a complex technique called reverse genetics. In 2005, Dr. Richard Webby and Dr. Robert Webster at St. Jude Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, used reverse genetics to produce a vaccine against the H5N1 avian flu virus. Webby has been working to produce a candidate virus against H1N1 as well, but told CNN the virus is growing slower than expected, and that it would likely be a few weeks before a suitable strain is ready to be sent to the CDC. With any candidate strain, CDC virologists will perform tests to see if the new virus can induce an immune response against the wild H1N1 strain. That's done by using a solution derived from the blood of ferrets, whose susceptibility to flu is similar to that of humans, and also by deliberately trying to infect live ferrets. If test results are acceptable, the CDC will forward samples of the virus to various manufacturers. Those companies will fine-tune the virus for their own production methods, and produce small ""pilot lots"" of vaccine that can be tested in animals, and possibly people, for effectiveness and safety. Only after those tests are complete would the CDC, World Health Organization and other government health authorities decide whether to recommend mass production. Even in the fastest-moving scenarios, that step isn't likely to occur before late June or even July. CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","The CDC received a candidate vaccine virus for swine flu Friday .

"New York (CNN) -- One wily coyote traveled a bit too far from home, and its resulting adventure through Harlem had alarmed residents doing a double take and scampering to get out of its way Wednesday morning. Police say frightened New Yorkers reported the coyote sighting around 9:30 a.m., and an emergency service unit was dispatched to find the animal. The little troublemaker was caught and tranquilized in Trinity Cemetery on 155th street and Broadway, and then taken to the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo, authorities said. ""The coyote is under evaluation and observation,"" said Mary Dixon, spokesperson for the Wildlife Conservation Society. Dixon said the coyote is a female, between 1 and 2 years old. She said the Department of Environmental Conservation will either send the animal to a rescue center or put it back in the wild. According to Adrian Benepe, New York City Parks Commissioner, coyotes in Manhattan are rare, but not unheard of. ""This is actually the third coyote that has been seen in the last 10 years,"" Benepe said. Benepe said there is a theory the coyotes make their way to the city from suburban Westchester.

"(CNN) -- Lights went off across the world Saturday as millions of homes and businesses went dark for one hour in a symbolic gesture highlighting concerns over climate change. The lights go off Saturday at the Houses of Parliament and the Big Ben clock tower in central London. More than 2,800 cities and towns worldwide dimmed their lights at 8:30 p.m. local time for the third annual Earth Hour -- a day-long energy-saving marathon spanning 83 countries and 24 time zones. In New York, the Empire State Building, Central Park and the George Washington Bridge went dark at 8:30 p.m. ET. The Philippines topped this year's participation for Asia, with more than 650 communities taking part in the event, according to Earth Hour's Web site. The light illuminating the face of the landmark Big Ben clock tower in London, England, went out at 8:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET). In Dubai, iReporter Sharad Agarwal turned out the lights and sat down to a candlelit dinner with his family. ""I personally believe in going green and everything that goes with it,"" Agarwal told CNN. In Australia, floodlights of the Sydney Opera House were extinguished as the city's iconic harbor kicked off events for Earth Hour. The event's Web site reported that hundreds of people lined the harbor for a glimpse of the dimming skyline at 8:30 pm. Sydney became the birthplace of the Earth Hour campaign in 2007 when 2.2 million turned off their lights, igniting a grass-roots movement that has become a global phenomenon. In China, illuminations at major buildings including the ""Bird's Nest"" Olympic Stadium and the Water Cube were extinguished as 20 cities joined in, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Other landmarks around the world expected to join the World Wildlife Fund-sponsored event were the Egyptian pyramids, Vatican, Niagara Falls, the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building, the Acropolis in Athens and the Las Vegas casino strip. CNN iReporter Marie Sager of Los Angeles, California, said she planned to hike up to the Griffith Observatory to experience the massive lights-out event. ""A good portion of the city is participating. We'll see the Capital Records sign go out. A lot of these places haven't turned out their lights in awhile,"" Sager said.

Earth Hour events got off to an unofficial start in the remote Chatham Islands in the southern Pacific Ocean where locals switched off their diesel generators, organizers said. Shortly afterward, 44 New Zealand cities and town joined in the event. Organizers say they hope this year's event will send a message to world leaders meeting Copenhagen, Denmark, in December for a major summit on climate change.

Every day for more than a week, he has stepped down into the dark crevices of a destroyed building to look for two people: Daniel Varese and his 4-year-old son Mateo. Mateo's mother, Marylinda Gonzalez Davi, a United Nations employee from Guatemala who has been living in Haiti for four years, was at work when the earth shook violently on January 12. Rescuers pulled her 1-year-old daughter Fabiana alive from the rubble, but there was no sign of her husband and son. She refused to believe they were dead. Word of her plight reached Mendez, who had arrived in Port-au-Prince with a team of 25 Mexican rescue workers. ""We told her we won't leave. We will stay by her side,"" Mendez said. He has a grandchild the same age as Mateo. His orange jumpsuit dulled by dust, Mendez  and his crew made camp adjacent to the rubble of the landmark Hotel Montana. They slept out in the open, with Gonzalez and her friend. They took short naps to re-energize. Then they went back in to search. Each day, they pulled things from the place that Gonzalez called home: a stuffed animal, her husband's computer, a piece of carpet. It helped Mendez to know what room of the apartment they had entered. He kept moving, deeper and deeper. In search of smell. In search of the slightest sound. Of an infant's whimper, a man's weak cry for help. Mendez became convinced father and son might be alive. He knows well the science of rescue after doing it for a quarter century. ""There is no smell,"" he said. And that could mean they were alive. Even two weeks after the earth shook, people were being rescued. Each gave Gonzalez hope. And that propelled Mendez. He believes in the power of love. The strong bonds between a man and his child, trapped together. That link, he thought, could be enough to sustain them. A veteran of many disasters . After a killer earthquake struck his hometown of Mexico City in 1985, Mendez, 46, felt a need to give back the humanitarian gestures extended to his own people. He joined a team called the Topos, or moles, named so because the rescuers wriggled through the deepest darkest corners in search of life. He volunteered to rush to disasters: to Indonesian quakes, five times; to Latin American countries; to Iran, Turkey, India and Egypt; to New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina and to New York after the 2001 terror attacks. Haiti, he said, is one of the worst situations he has seen. ""People are very, very poor here."" Much of the infrastructure and construction was so shoddy. This was the first time government officials paid for his flight. Usually, he finds his own way. And that has left him penniless and jobless. ""Who will hire this old man now?"" he asked. ""People tell me I am mad."" He does the work because he loves to help people. ""It's worth it to find one person alive."" Behind him, the incessant sound of a jackhammer deafened the ear. Above him, the roar of jets taking off from the airport. But it was below where Mendez belonged. Time was ticking. Sometimes, in the darkness, when he was crawling like a mole, the earth trembled. ""Replica! Replica!"" some of his men shouted. There was always the fear that whatever was left standing would tumble in the many aftershocks this city has felt. ""We laugh,"" he said. ""We don't scream like ladies. There is nothing you can do inside. You only die once. It would be an honor to die in the rubble."" From other people, the statement might seem trite. But Mendez's eyes make you believe. He is called Chino because people say he looks Chinese. He says he has the look of a fierce Mexican Indian. After so many days, Mendez was running on two hours sleep -- and hope. But late Wednesday his search finally ended. His men found two bodies buried deep in the apartment. Mateo was in his father's arms. In Haiti, Mendez had hoped for a miracle. Instead, he saw more suffering. This, too, will define the curves of his face.","Rescuer searched every day for a woman's husband and 4-year-old son in Haiti .

"(CNN) -- The man closest to Tiger Woods when he plays golf says he had no idea about the extramarital affairs that have sidelined Woods from the game. Steve Williams, Woods' caddy and confidant for nearly a decade, talked to New Zealand's TV3 about the scandal. ""I knew nothing,"" Williams said in an interview posted on the station's Web site Thursday. ""I don't need to clarify it, extend that answer. I knew nothing."" Williams said he's heard the calls from some that he should be fired for not preventing Woods' downfall. ""In some people's perception, I'm involved with it, and I've committed a crime or done wrong,"" he said. ""If the shoe was on somebody else, I would say the same thing, it would be very difficult for the caddy not to know,"" he said. ""But I'm 100 percent telling you, I knew nothing, and that's that."" Williams' wife, Kirsty, defended her husband, insisting he would not have been able to keep the secret from her or Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren. ""The four of us are so close,"" she told TV3. ""Being so close, he couldn't know and not say something to Elin or myself. You know, it's just, that's the way it is."" Woods, 34, apologized last month in a tightly controlled televised statement for his ""irresponsible and selfish"" behavior, which he said included infidelity. The February 19 statement was his first public appearance since he crashed his black Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and a tree near his home in November. The crash and reports about why it happened sparked a barrage of infidelity allegations against the golfer, who has two children with his wife. Williams, who gets 10 percent of the millions Woods wins on the golf tour every year, said he would not have kept it secret just to protect his job. ""I'm a straight up sort of person, if I had known something was going on, the whistle would have been blown,"" Williams said. ""He knows that I'm straight up, that's the way I operate."" He said he is disappointed with Woods. ""Of course, I'm mad at him,"" he said. ""Why would you not be? He's obviously let his family down."" Williams said he and Woods will talk about the scandal eventually, but not now. ""When a guy's having a tough time, that's not the time,"" he said. ""It's not up to me to beat him with a stick right now. I mean, he's getting enough grilling from everybody else."" Williams said his role now is to talk to Woods -- who he described as ""one of my closest friends"" -- about the future and help him get back on the golf tour. ""When you are friends with somebody, and you're a true friend to somebody, that's when somebody needs your support, and that's when they need you the most, that's when you don't walk away,"" he said. In his February 19 statement, Woods left open the possibility of returning to professional golf this year. Williams predicted that Woods would bounce back from his troubles. ""Tiger's biggest asset is his mental strength,"" he said. ""So, he's going to need all his mental strength to get out of this, no question about it."" With Woods not playing, Williams is spending more time with his personal passion: speedway racing in New Zealand. ""When I'm not working on the tour, I don't miss it one bit,"" he said.","Steve Williams says some think he should be fired for not preventing Woods' downfall .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The steeple clock at Port-au-Prince's St. Pierre Catholic Church is stopped at 4:53, the hour at which a devastating earthquake struck Haiti nearly one week ago. The church gates were closed Sunday. The doors shuttered. But it seems Tuesday's quake has only strengthened the religious fervor many Haitians carry in their souls. ""A lot of people who never prayed or believed -- now they believe,"" said Cristina Bailey, a 24-year-old clerk. In parks and backyards, anywhere a group gathers, the prayers of the Haitians can be heard. Last week, the call-and-response chanting and clapping that accompany those prayers pierced the darkness of night and the pre-dawn hours -- sometimes as early as 4 a.m. The singing and praying was particularly intense in Champs de Mars plaza, where hundreds of people have taken refuge. But the scene was repeated throughout the city, with preachers on megaphones exhorting the faithful, who responded with lyrics like ""O Lord, keep me close to you"" and ""Forgive me, Jesus."" Many preachers are telling followers not to lose faith, that God remains with them regardless of what's happened. Most Haitians don't feel abandoned, Bailey said. ""People don't blame Jesus for all these things,"" she said. ""They have faith. They believe that Jesus saved them and are thankful for that."" Perhaps few personified that deep belief better than 11-year-old Anaika Saint Louis, who was pulled from the rubble Thursday night and later died. Her leg had been crushed, and doctors thought they might have to amputate her feet. She said she didn't care. ""Thank you, God, because he saved my life,"" she said. ""If I lose my feet, I always had my life."" Jean Mackenle Verpre also suffered a crushing leg injury and was freed after 48 hours underground. Asked what kept him going, he answered without hesitation: He believes in Jesus Christ and put his life in God's hands. Colonized by France, Haiti is a strongly Catholic country. Christian motifs are everywhere in Port-au-Prince. Many vehicles bear signs like the one painted on the windshield of a truck on Rue Delmar: ""Merci Jesus,"" it said. A woman passing by on Avenue Christophe chanted softly: ""Accept Jesus."" ""In Haiti, you have Protestants and Catholics, and you have your percentage of each,"" said J.B. Diederich, a native-born Haitian who now lives in Miami, Florida, but returned to the Caribbean for several days after the earthquake. ""But everybody is 100 percent voodoo."" Voodoo is widely acknowledged but practiced only behind closed doors, with practitioners often placing candles and icons on the floor of a home and dancing to music and drums. Followers believe the world is under the power of loas -- spirits and deities who act as intermediaries between humans and God. In voodoo, disasters like Tuesday's quake are not the result of natural forces, but displeasure by a loa.  See complete coverage of Haiti earthquake . ""It's in every apartment. The voodoo is our culture,"" 25-year-old Alex Gassan said. ""It's like the folklore."" Gassan proudly calls himself a Catholic, pulling out a crucifix necklace from under his shirt to show a reporter. Many observers have a simple explanation for what makes Haitians so devout. ""Because in all poor countries, you have to believe in something,"" said Agnes Pierre-Louis, the Haitian-born manager of her family-owned hotel. ""If they don't have that, they don't have anything."" Added Diederich: ""They leave everything in the hands of God. When you have so little, what else can you turn to?""","Many preachers tell followers not to lose faith .
Most Haitians don't feel abandoned by God, says one Hatian .

"(CNN) -- Indian tennis player Sania Mirza has used her Twitter page to thank well-wishers following the announcement of her marriage to Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Malik. The wedding, which will take place in April, brings together two nuclear powers historically divided by political and sporting rivalry. On Tuesday, the 23-year-old Mirza greeted her 13,205 followers with the message: . ""Hi Guys! Me & Shoaib are very happy in this new phase of our life.Want to thank the media & all you guys for the wishes. Lots of love to all."" Mirza divides opinion in India, drawing criticism from strict Muslim groups for her short tennis skirts and jewellery, while gaining plaudits and fans for her achievements on the court. She became the first Indian to win a WTA Tour title in 2005, reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open later that year and won the Australian Open mixed doubles last year. The announcement of the marriage between the two Muslims comes two months after Mirza broke off her engagement to a childhood friend. ""I have been in the constant glare for too long and would appreciate the privacy at this very personal moment in my life,"" her statement said. Malik, 28, is a former national captain who is currently serving a year-long ban from the Pakistan Cricket Board due to indiscipline on a tour of Australia. He caused controversy in 2007 when, after losing to India in the World Twenty20 final, he thanked Muslims from ""all over the world"" for their support.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)  -- A previously unknown armed group said Friday it attacked a Nigerian oil pipeline this week on the first full day in office for Nigeria's new acting president. The attempt by the Joint Revolutionary Council (JRC) of the Niger Delta was not successful, a spokesman for the military said. But it indicates not everyone in Nigeria is happy with the way the new president, who hails from the Niger Delta region, was given power. The JRC said that early Wednesday, one of its units attacked and ""exploded"" the Tura manifold owned by Royal Dutch Shell in Abonnema, near the coast. The manifold connects several pipelines to the Bonny Export Terminal. ""Our patriotic fighters fought and overpowered the military guards on duty (as all Shell manifolds are always heavily guarded) before going ahead to explode the Tura manifold,"" the group's statement said. But Lt. Col. Timothy Antigua, a spokesman for the Nigerian military, said the attack failed. ""On Wednesday night there was an attempt by criminals to sabotage a Shell pipeline,"" he told CNN. ""They were thwarted in their attempt by a community surveillance group assigned to protect the Shell pipeline."" Antigua said the group's dynamite and other explosives were recovered and that there were no injuries or deaths. A spokesman for Shell in The Hague, Netherlands, said the company had received no report of an attack. The JRC said its attack Wednesday followed another last weekend, and that both are aimed at incapacitating the export terminal and fighting the ""occupation"" in Nigeria. ""The actions are continuous and are preparatory to the final war. Every little step we take today brings us closer to freedom,"" read the statement. Acting President Goodluck Jonathan was approved for the role Tuesday by Nigeria's House and Senate to fill the political void left after President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua departed in November for medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. Jonathan was previously the country's vice president. In his first address to the nation Tuesday, Jonathan praised the ""resilience and unity of purpose"" with which Nigerians reacted to the recent political upheaval, saying there were ""no winners and no losers"" and that it is now time to move forward. He called on all Nigerians and the country's political parties to ""tackle the various challenges which we face as a nation,"" including those in the areas of power, infrastructure, security and job creation. Jonathan also vowed to pursue the ""war against corruption"" more robustly. His appointment has stirred controversy in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, with some arguing that the articles of the Nigerian constitution were not followed with the transfer of power. Nigeria's constitution says the president must formally communicate to the National Assembly that he is empowering the vice president to act as president in his absence. While no such formal communication was given, the Senate declared Tuesday that a January 13 BBC interview with Yar'Adua from his hospital bed could constitute such a notice. In the interview, the president acknowledged that he could not perform the duties of his office and would not be able to return until his doctors declared him fit. In a separate statement, the JRC called Jonathan a ""lame-duck ruler"" and termed his acting presidency an ""illegality"" because of questions over the transfer of power. The group said Jonathan was appointed in a ""jungle manner."" ""The purported interview granted the British Broadcasting Corporation by the deserter president can never (be) approximated to a (formal)/official letter which ought to be duly endorsed by the writer,"" the JRC said. ""The deserting act of Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar'Adua can only be appropriately categorized as gross misconduct and should naturally have attracted an impeachment. This ought to have been followed by the swearing in of the vice president as substantive president, not in an acting capacity."" The group said the political events will not deter their ""resolve to wage a continuous revolutionary war to liberate all parts of our territory."" CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Joint Revolutionary Council (JRC) of the Niger Delta claims pipeline attack .

"(CNN) -- Why is goal line technology not used by football? Is Africa's hosting of the 2010 World Cup a step in the right direction? Are the world's best players being asked to compete in too many global competitions? These are just some of the issues that may be puzzling you about the beautiful game. Well worry no more because here is your chance to quiz the man in charge of global soccer, Sepp Blatter, the head of world football's governing body FIFA. CNN will speak to Blatter in an exclusive interview at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland on Monday 29 March where we will ask him the questions you want answered -- just add your query to the bottom of the page. Are you a World Cup super fan? Represent your team . Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, a former Swiss amateur footballer, was voted in as the FIFA president in 1998 before securing a second term in office in 2002, and a third in 2007. His tenure has seen him lead world football through three World Cups -- the fourth will kick off on June 11 in Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium -- five Confederations Cups and the creation of the World Club Cup which has taken place annually since 2005. The 74-year-old  has been heavily involved with charitable programs during his presidency. These include UNICEF's ""Say Yes for Children"" campaign, which aims to increase awareness of children's rights, and the more recent ""1Goal"" program, that seeks to increase education opportunities in Africa. Blatter was a key figure in securing Africa's inaugural World Cup for 2010 after he introduced a system which saw each regional confederation take turns in hosting the tournament. The soccer chief has also courted controversy during his 12 years in charge, most recently by ruling out the introduction of goal line technology into the game. ""The application of modern technologies can be very costly, and therefore not applicable on a global level,"" Blatter told FIFA's official Web site. ""Many matches, even at the highest level, are not even televised. The rules need to be the same for all association football matches worldwide."" Blatter has views on the English Premier League's domination of the global game. ""In France they have an expression 'l'appetit vient mangeant' [the appetite comes with eating]. It means when you are at a good table you like to eat more and more and more. And this is the success story of the Premier League,"" he told a FIFA meeting held in Northern Ireland in March 2009. The Swiss administrator has also condemned the hold big clubs have over star players. When Spanish side Real Madrid were negotiating with Manchester United over the transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo, Blatter told British broadcaster Sky News: ""I think in football there's too much modern slavery in transferring players or buying players here and there, and putting them somewhere.""","Your chance to quiz the boss of global soccer, the head of FIFA, Sepp Blatter .

"(CNN) -- A Taiwanese fishing vessel that was seized by pirates and anchored off the Somali coast for nearly 10 months was released Thursday night, the European Union Naval Force Somalia reported. The Win Far 161 was held off the coast of Harardheere until the pirates left the ship and allowed its commander to retake control, the naval force said. The vessel was hijacked April in the Somali Basin, about 184 miles north of the Seychelles islands. The vessel reported that all 28 crew members were safe. The boat was operating outside the EU NAVFOR area of operation and was therefore not registered with the Maritime Security Centre for the Horn of Africa, authorities said. The coordination center helps protect merchant ships from pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden, Somali Basin and off the Horn of Africa. The ship's owner reported that the crew was released with food, fuel and water. The ship headed out to sea, where it was being monitored by EU NAVFOR.

"(CNN) -- The French Foreign Ministry and a top African Union official have denounced a military coup in the west African nation of Niger. The ministry said France ""condemns all taking of power by nonconstitutional means"" and calls on people in Niger ""to show responsibility in the interest of the country,"" which gained its independence from France in 1960. Jean Ping, the chairman of the 53-nation African Union, meanwhile, called for a quick return of ""constitutional order"" and said the organization is ready to help facilitate the process. He said he had been following developments in the nation with concern after a Niger military official announced the constitution had been suspended. President Mamadou Tandja is said to be detained in a military camp. The violence may have been prompted by a collapse of talks between the government and the opposition over a recent referendum allowing the president to hold power indefinitely, according to the United Nations, which also called for a quick resolution. French journalist Diallo Doudacar said the situation in Niger was calm Friday. ""The children are going to school, the shops are open,"" he said. A ""demonstration of joy"" in support of the military was held Friday afternoon, Doudacar said. ""The people are very happy,"" he said. ""The coup ends a nine-month debate that blocked out all other subjects. We have gone through so many coups that it doesn't really affect us anymore."" Ping condemned the coup. ""The chairperson of the commission stresses that the relevant AU instruments systematically condemn any unconstitutional change and, accordingly, he condemns the seizure of power by force that took place in Niger,"" said a statement from his office. ""The secretary-general has called on the stakeholders in Niger to swiftly revert to constitutional order in the settlement of the political crisis,"" said a statement from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Thursday's order to suspend the constitution was attributed to the Superior Council for the Restoration of Democracy. It also suspended all institutions, urged citizens to remain calm and called for support from the international community. Dana Palade, a spokeswoman for World Vision, who is in the capital, Niamey, said gunfire rang out in the streets Thursday. The French Embassy also reported hearing intermittent gunfire near the palace. Tensions have flared in Niger recently. Tandja, in office since December 1999, had been trying to stay in power beyond the time mandated by the constitution. ""That may well have been ... an act on his behalf that precipitated the act today,"" P.J. Crowley, assistant U.S. secretary of state, said Thursday. The United States does not condone violence, but ""clearly we think this underscores that Niger needs to move ahead with the elections and the formation of a new government,"" Crowley said. Niger, one of the poorest countries in Africa, has about 8 percent of the world's uranium. It has had lucrative uranium contracts, particularly with China. The west African nation has a population of about 15 million and lies between the Sahara Desert and Nigeria.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Dr. Roberto Feliz and Dr. Hiba Georges were quickly jolted from the most modern of medical care in Boston, Massachusetts, to the most rudimentary of care when they flew to Haiti last week to work at a hospital housed in two tents run by the University of Miami. The doctors, who worked at the Boston Medical Center, quickly learned that when you have no technology -- not even the simplest blood test -- you have to make medical decisions in an entirely different way. The first death they witnessed taught them a valuable lesson. The patient was a boy who needed his leg amputated or else he would die of either an infection or rhabdomyolysis, a kidney disease that follows injuries where muscles are crushed. Find loved ones in Haiti | Share your story . Feliz, Georges and the other doctors had nowhere to take the boy. Their own hospital had yet to open its operating room, so they spent hours trying to find a hospital that could do surgeries. Their search was in vain. Finally, the doctors decided to do the surgery themselves that night by the moonlight under a mango tree. ""We just sawed his foot off. We didn't have to use anesthesia because he was already unconscious and wasn't feeling a thing,"" Feliz says. But they'd waited too long. The boy took his last breath during the surgery. ""Some of the doctors cried,"" Feliz says. ""I told them, 'There is no crying in medicine.'"" As a direct result of the boy's death, a few hours later, at 3 in the morning, the surgeons at the University of Miami hospital decided to build their own operating room. They had no surgical lights, no oxygen, no blood, no ventilators and no monitors. For a tourniquet they used one of the doctor's belts. ""We'd been waiting to build the operating room until we received better equipment, but after that boy's death we became more aggressive. We said let's do it, because they're going to die anyway,"" Feliz says. The doctors continued to learn lessons about what one had called ""civil war medicine"" after the operating room went up. At one point, a 16-year-old boy needed an amputation, but the surgeons asked Feliz and Georges to make sure the boy's kidneys were working before they put him through surgery. Without any blood tests to assess kidney function, the only thing they could look for was urine as a sign that his kidneys were working. ""We tried to see if we could get some urine going, but there was not a drop. We filled him with fluids and gave him Lasix, a diuretic, to get him to pee, but nothing,"" Feliz says. The boy died as the doctors were treating him. ""I saw a lot of deaths there, but this one hit me the hardest,"" he says. ""I texted my wife back at home, 'I've had a bad day.'"" After that boy's death, surgeons were quicker to give permission to amputate, Feliz says. Feliz says if there's any silver lining to practicing such rudimentary medicine, it's that it made him a more humble doctor. ""Back in Boston, I'm a hot shot. The nurses have to respect me,"" Feliz says. ""Here, I'm just a worker bee. I cleaned the OR floor after surgery. I carried dead bodies down the street. I was in traffic carrying dead bodies. That makes you human. I came here a very fancy doctor, and I'm leaving here as a humble man.""","Doctors arriving in Haiti learn there is no technology, no basic equipment .

"(CNN) -- A year after a nearly $800 billion stimulus package was passed, the U.S. economy still finds itself mired in mediocrity. Economic growth is stagnant, unemployment remains higher than almost any time since the Great Depression and millions of Americans are upset that trillions of taxpayer dollars have been committed to numerous government bailout programs with no improvement of the economy within sight. They question, rightfully, is where this money is going and why it hasn't been as helpful as the government has claimed. The problems with stimulus packages are manifold. The primary reason they fail is because they do not address the roots of the problem. If you are unable to identify the cause of your problem, then your solution is doomed to fail. In the case of the current economic crisis, it had its root in loose monetary policy and easy credit that skewed the allocation of resources within the economy. Combined with other measures to promote home ownership, these easy money policies caused a massive housing bubble. Money that would have been put to other uses was used to produce raw materials, hire workers and loaned to homebuyers, all while home prices spiked. The boom was, of course, unsustainable, as many prognosticators pointed out during the housing bubble's peak. But the damage was done, and now that the bubble has burst, we need to stand back and allow the mess to unwind. Yet the government does everything in its power to stave off true recovery and is attempting to re-inflate the bubble. Rather than allow prices to fall so that the housing market returns to a sustainable level, the government does everything in its power to try to keep housing prices elevated. The reasoning behind the stimulus package was that underconsumption was to blame for the collapse of the housing bubble and the resulting economic crisis. The government seems to think that if consumption can be spurred, then the economy will be return to normal. In reality, the collapse of the economy was not caused by a sudden lack of consumption but rather a malinvestment of resources into sectors of the economy that were unsustainable without easy credit. The rise in housing prices was not, in fact, indicative of the new normal but rather an indicator that something was seriously wrong. Government attempts to boost the economy through measures such as stimulus packages merely take money from hardworking taxpayers and throw that money into unproductive endeavors, into the sectors of the economy that already suffer from malinvestment or into make-work projects. Washington is throwing good money after bad, wasting hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars and accomplishing nothing. As the eminent economist Frederic Bastiat once pointed out, there is a difference between what is seen and unseen. The government likes to tout the number of jobs that have been created or saved by the stimulus. But even if these numbers are accurate, they do not count the number of jobs that are not created in other more productive or self-sustaining sectors of the economy. Nor do they count the jobs that will be lost in the future when tax rates will have to be increased to pay off the interest on the debt that is financing much of the stimulus package. Finally, the stimulus package enables the government, rather than the market, to pick winners and losers. Whenever the government doles out money, political factors come into play. Firms that are politically well-connected or located in important congressional districts will benefit, while those firms without political connections, the ability to navigate bureaucratic hurdles or that exist in isolated areas unimportant to Washington will lose out. Once the stimulus money runs out, the companies and jobs dependent on that handout will find themselves once again struggling. A company that cannot satisfy consumer needs in the marketplace and that requires a government stimulus to remain competitive is a company that should not be in business. The last thing this country needs is more government spending, especially on such wasteful measures as stimulus packages. We have wasted trillions of dollars in the past year and a half in stimulus packages, bailouts and guarantees to unsound companies. We have run up our national debt to unprecedented levels. We are destroying the dollar. And it seems as if there is no end in sight. Loose monetary policy, easy credit and too much debt created the bubble and got us into this economic crisis. Unless the government learns its lesson and opts for restrained monetary and fiscal policy, it risks a complete implosion of the U.S. economy.

"(CNN) -- Everyone has their favorite Girl Scout cookie: the popular Thin Mints, the coconuty caramel delight of the Samoas, the simple yet lovable Shortbreads. But for those who are eagerly running to their pantry to open a box of Lemon Chalet Cremes, a foul odor may dampen their cookie-eating experience. Little Brownie Bakers of Louisville, Kentucky, one of two bakeries in the United States that make Girl Scout cookies, posted a statement on its Web site Friday saying it had received several complaints from customers who encountered a foul smell and taste in boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes. The bakery says it tested the cookies and determined that they are safe for consumers to eat. No sickness from the cookies has been reported. The company says that the odor is a result of oils improperly breaking down in the cookies that ""are not up to our quality standards."" The Lemon Chalet Cremes were distributed in 24 states -- Alabama, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin -- and the District of Columbia. The number of potentially stinky boxes totals 636,000, according to a spokesperson for Little Brownie Bakers. The company is contacting each Girl Scout council that received a batch of the smelly cookies and says it will provide replacements. The National Girl Scout offices were closed Friday because of the snowstorm in the Northeast. A recording on its 800 number redirected callers to Little Brownie Bakers for assistance.","Baker says it received complaints about bad smell, taste .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A sealed envelope awaits in Rissi Palmer's Bible. Country singer Rissi Palmer performs for students in an after-school program at Atlanta's Parkside Elementary. It's her Grammy acceptance speech, the one she wrote as a 12-year-old. She vowed not to open it until she could read it from the stage accepting her award. Sixteen years later, the time may be nearer when Palmer can open the envelope. The road has been a long one, starting with her standing on a milk crate as a child so she could sing solos in the church choir. But these days, she is an up-and-comer in country music -- and a rare African-American performer in the genre. Palmer acknowledged this week to students in Atlanta that some people had told her she couldn't sing country because she was African-American. But she said, ""When you tell me I can't do something, it just makes me want to do it more."" Palmer told CNN that no one in the music industry had discouraged her based on race but that people who loved her were concerned country stardom might be a tough goal. She said she doesn't believe her story is different from any other musician's: ""The music industry is just hard."" Palmer told students at Parkside Elementary School that she grew up listening to all kinds of music, including country. ""My mother was a big country music fan,"" she recalled. The family also listened to R&B and classic soul, such as Sam Cooke, she said. ""I loved the way the country artists wrote songs,"" Palmer told about 50 students, most of them minorities, in an after-school program at Parkside. She liked the way that country songs told stories: ""I always liked telling stories."" ""Country Girl,"" the first single off Palmer's self-titled 2007 debut album, made her the first African-American female in 20 years to hit Billboard's country chart, according to Country Music Television. Country music is home to a smattering of well-known African-American artists. Charley Pride is by far the most visible, but other artists have dabbled in country as well -- the Supremes, for instance, and Ray Charles. More recently, Darius Rucker, longtime lead singer for Hootie and the Blowfish, hit the top of the country charts as well. African-Americans always have been in the country music industry, said John Rumble, senior historian for the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. However, it's rare for an artist -- of any race -- to reach the level of stardom attained by Pride, who had 67 records on the country chart between 1966 and 1990, more than 20 of them in the Top 10. ""Some people at the time, and since, called him the Jackie Robinson of country music, but nobody who followed him has yet reached that level,"" Rumble said. ""... He's almost an impossible standard to match."" However, given Rucker's recent success, he is showing ""superstar potential"" in the country industry, Rumble added. Palmer lost her mother at an early age but has said her parent's love for country music stayed with her. Still, she said she doubted she could break into the genre. ""When you're a child, you react to something that's familiar and looks like you,"" she told CMT in 2007. ""And there was nobody [in country music] who looked like me. Just being a kid, you don't see black country singers. So you don't think that's a possibility for you. You see black pop singers. You see black R&B singers. You see black rockers. So you say, 'If I'm black and I want to sing, then I probably have to sing R&B.' "" Rumble echoed Palmer's comments about the music industry being tough on new artists. More than ever, ""it takes a lot of money to put an artist out there on promotional tours,"" creating videos and the like, he said. Rumble said many African-American artists probably gravitate to other genres. And, for artists of any race, ""once you're in the door ... it's still a matter of catching on."" ""There are a certain number of people who are just not used to seeing a black person on CMT or GAC [Great American Country],"" he said. ""It just doesn't compute, for whatever reason."" Palmer's family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, when she was 13, according to her Web site. She took part in talent pageants there and joined an entertainment troupe. ""That is where a lot of my country influences started to come out,"" she said in the online biography. ""At the audition we were instructed to pick an artist that we admired and perform some of their songs. I chose LeAnn Rimes and Shania Twain. I was not the one they expected to walk out and sing 'Any Man of Mine' at those state fair shows, but they always liked it."" She participated on the CBS show ""Star Search,"" reaching the finals, and credits judge Naomi Judd's manager with introducing her to the creators of ""Waiting in the Wings,"" a CMT documentary about African-Americans in country music, according to her Web site. She was also featured on CMT's ""Most Wanted Live."" Her music reached Terry Johnson, president and CEO of 1720 Entertainment, who offered her a record deal. ""You guys are at an age where all the possibilities are open to you,"" she told the Atlanta students this week. ""Anything you want to do, you can do it."" However, she cautioned them that being a singer is not always fun, even though she loves it. ""The best advice I can give you is that this is a job that I do,"" she said. ""... You have to take it very seriously."" She fielded questions with a sense of humor, telling them some of her favorite songs (one is Bonnie Raitt's ""Nick of Time"") and her favorite instrument -- a guitar (""Have you ever tried to push a piano around with you?"" she asked). She told the children that once they start dating, they will find plenty of material -- good and bad -- to write songs about. She said afterward she enjoyed talking with children and likely would have been a teacher if she had not pursued a music career. Palmer appeared as part of the Arts in Schools program at the Atlanta-based Threshing Floor Academy of Arts and Sciences Inc. The organization was founded in 2008 by Meisha Card, a former special education teacher. For her part, Palmer has said she hopes that one day, the discussion centers on her music rather than her ethnicity. ""I'm looking forward to the day when the only thing that's being discussed is the album -- the actual music -- as opposed to my race,"" she told CMT. ""I understand it is something rare, and it is something different, and it is something that's not happening every day. I get that. But if my career's as successful as I hope it will be, we're going to reach a lot more firsts.""","Singer Rissi Palmer has had a Grammy acceptance speech ready since she was 12 .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Some southern states were getting a second round of unseasonal snow Tuesday, prompting airlines to cancel flights and schools to close for the day. Parts of several southern states remained under a winter storm warning Tuesday, as a developing low-pressure system threatened to spread snow and rain across portions of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky and the Carolinas, the National Weather Service said. Snow fell north and west of metro Atlanta, Georgia, although the city, with a temperature hovering just above freezing, saw mostly rain. The weather prompted schools in several northern Georgia counties to close, according to CNN affiliates. Airlines also canceled flights. AirTran Airways has canceled 69 flights in and out of Atlanta, and is expected to cancel more this afternoon, spokesman Christopher White said. ""Should the [weather] event continue into the evening, there is a possibility of many more cancellations,"" he said. He said the airline is offering free rebooking and changes for anyone traveling to or from Atlanta. Delta Airlines said it has made about 250 cancellations for flights leaving Atlanta. ""Depending on the severity of the storm some additional thinning may be necessary,"" spokesman Anthony Black said. The airline is offering to reschedule Tuesday travel plans for those concerned about the weather, at no fee. Customers will have to pay any increase in fares, according to the Web site. The National Weather Service said snow will continue Tuesday afternoon across northeast Georgia and the western half of upstate South Carolina, although it will taper off later. Total snowfall accumulations of 2 to 4 inches are expected, mainly in areas along and north of I-85. The same amount of snow is expected from Shelby, North Carolina to Gaffney and Union in South Carolina, the National Weather Service said. Snow is also possible in Tennessee, Kentucky and northern Alabama, it said. CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.","Storm warnings and winter weather advisories issued for the Southeast .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Labour Party suspended four members of Parliament -- including three former Cabinet ministers -- after they were secretly filmed offering to sell their government influence, the party said Tuesday. The party said it has launched an investigation of Geoff Hoon, Patricia Hewitt, Stephen Byers and Margaret Moran and suspended all four from the Parliamentary Labour Party. None of the four plans to run in the next election, expected to be held in May. ""The Labour Party expects the highest standards of its representatives and believes that they have a duty to be transparent and accountable servants to their constituents at all times,"" the party said in a statement. What the British media has now dubbed the ""cash-for-lobbying"" scandal comes just weeks before the expected general election in which Labour, the ruling party, faces a stiff challenge from the opposition Conservatives. Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell, a non-partisan official, called the allegations ""extremely serious."" The undercover filming was done by reporters for Channel 4's ""Dispatches"" program, which aired Monday night. They set up a fictional U.S. company that claimed to want to hire British politicians for an advisory board, and an undercover reporter then invited the MPs to a rented office in London to discuss the work. A hidden camera captured the politicians agreeing to use their experience and influence to lobby the government in exchange for thousands of pounds (dollars) in pay. ""I'd be very interested. I'm a bit like a sort of cab for hire, I suppose, at the moment,"" said Byers, who was the transport and business secretary under former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Byers said he usually charges a daily rate of between £3,000 and £5,000 ($4,500 and $7,500) for similar work. Among the services Byers offered was to try to get Blair to show up at a client's event. ""The three to five just depends a bit on the work, the clients, to be honest,"" Byers said on the tape. ""I mean, sometimes I can charge more."" Hoon, who was British defense secretary during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, said he would request a similar amount. He said he could lead delegations to see certain ministers, or he could write letters to ministers to persuade them to see a client. ""One of the challenges, I think, which I'm really looking forward to is sort of translating my knowledge and contacts about (the) international scene into something that, bluntly, makes money,"" Hoon said. Lawmaker Margaret Moran, who was implicated in the parliamentary expenses scandal last May, was also shown on hidden camera to be interested in a possible job. Moran spent £22,500 ($33,700) of taxpayers' money for repairs on a seaside home far from her constituency, days after declaring it as her second home, records last year showed. Moran told the undercover reporter that she would be willing to approach parliamentary committees or special advisers on behalf of the company. Hewitt, who served as health secretary and trade and industry secretary in the cabinet, said she is looking for another ""major board position"" to employ her for three days a month. Asked how easy it would be for her to arrange meetings with Cabinet ministers or senior civil servants, Hewitt replied, ""It's very doable, but you have to be kind of quite careful, you know, about how you do it. And it partly depends on the individual minister."" The Conservatives called on Prime Minister Gordon Brown to launch an investigation into the scandal. Peter Hoskin, a columnist for The Spectator magazine, described the revelations as ""dirty money and dirtier politics."" ""Our democracy could hardly bear another major political scandal, but here we have one: as grubby, underhand and dispiriting as last year's expenses revelations,"" Hoskin wrote. ""The question now is whether it's as widespread."" Daily Telegraph columnist Mary Riddell called it ""the week that could finish Labour"" and said it put the Conservatives, also called the Tories, in a good position ahead of the election. ""Any hope that the shadow of greed had lifted was crushed by accusations that former ministers sought money for favors,"" she wrote. ""The taped claim by Stephen 'Cash' Byers that 'I'm like a sort of cab for hire' is a remark geared to give the Tories a chauffeured drive to power.""","Britain's Labour Party suspends four senior MPs in cash-for-lobbying scandal .

"(CNN) -- It will take NATO-led military forces ""another 25 to 30 days to secure that which needs to be secured"" in Afghanistan's Helmand province, and a further three months after that to be sure insurgents are being kept out of the area, British Maj.

""The insurgent was entirely dislocated within 24 hours"" of the insertion of troops by helicopter, he said.

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council has approved a proposal to send an additional 2,000 soldiers and 1,500 police officers to quake-ravaged Haiti, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday. By its approval of the plan Monday, ""the council sends a clear signal: The world is with Haiti,"" Ban said. He said he was confident that member states would respond quickly in order to get the troops on the ground as soon as possible. ""I believe that the deployment of additional troops and police forces will be done quite quickly,"" Ban said. ""... In every aspect of our operation there, we are running against time."" Look for missing loved ones . The forces will bolster the approximately 7,000 U.N. soldiers and 2,200 police already assigned there, at least 22 of whom were killed in the January 12 earthquake. About 150 people affiliated with the U.N. remain unaccounted for. Although Tuesday marks a week since the magnitude 7.0 temblor struck, ""there are still lives to be saved,"" Ban said. Some 90 victims have been saved by 43 international rescue teams, made up of about 1,700 people. Relief operations and delivery of aid are increasing and becoming better organized, Ban said, although he added, ""For those who have lost everything, of course, help cannot come soon enough."" Despite logistical challenges, the situation is improving, he said. New corridors have been cleared on land. Capacity at Port-au-Prince's airport is improving. And a main port -- rendered unusable by earthquake damage -- is expected to be reopened next week. ""There have been some difficulties and some bottlenecks in delivering our relief items,"" Ban said. ""... The situation is overwhelming."" But U.N. personnel are working day and night to overcome hurdles and increase the delivery of aid to Haitians, he said. ""On the ground, we have seen some difficulties when it comes to deliver[ing] actual relief items, because of the over-demand and the extraordinary situation. I have seen for myself how many people are without homes and shelters, and we have to work very hard, according to this cluster system,"" Ban said. He was referring to the U.N. Cluster System set up for disasters, under which the World Health Organization plays a lead coordinating role for health, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees or the Red Cross for shelter, and the World Food Programme for food. Watch how UNICEF is trying to help children . Twelve cluster systems are up and functioning, Ban said Tuesday, ""so you will see a much improved situation in terms of coordination, in terms of delivering aid to people who need it."" On Monday, daily food rations for 200,000 people were distributed. The World Food Programme's goal is to reach 1 million people within a week and 2 million within two weeks, he said. ""Our chief priority right now is to get the relief distribution system in Port-au-Prince fully operational so that we may more efficiently distribute supplies -- food, water, medicine, tents and other essential items,"" Ban said. How you can help . Ban appealed to international nongovernmental organizations and aid groups to work closely with the U.N. in delivering aid. ""We are concerned ... that numbers of unsolicited and uncoordinated supplies and personnel entering the country will stretch limited logistical resources and interfere with the delivery of vital aid,"" he said. ""We have already turned our attention to outlying regions, as well as the capital city. As you know, in certain areas, such as Leogane, the situation is every bit as critical, if not more so, than in Port-au-Prince."" See images of the need and relief efforts . Asked about a report that fuel for U.N. trucks was scarce, Ban said 10,000 gallons of fuel arrived from the Dominican Republic on Monday night. Alain Le Roy, U.N. peacekeeping director, was asked about reports of looting. It is occurring, Le Roy said, but is not widespread.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A New York nightclub hostess identified by a supermarket tabloid as Tiger Woods' mistress has called allegations that she is romantically involved with the golf superstar false and ""ridiculous."" In an interview published Tuesday, Rachel Uchitel told The New York Post that a disgruntled acquaintance sold the story to the National Enquirer and that ""not a word of it is true."" ""I work in clubs, and I am a businesswoman,"" Uchitel said. ""I do not have sex with celebrities, and I have not had an affair with Tiger Woods."" Speculation has swirled around Woods since a wreck outside his Florida home early Friday left him with minor injuries and a citation for careless driving. The Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday that its citation closes its investigation of the crash. Woods was not required to talk to state police about the wreck and did not sit for an interview with investigators. He issued a statement Sunday saying he alone was responsible for the crash and denouncing ""the many false, unfounded and malicious rumors that are currently circulating about my family and me."" Opinion: Woods is only human . The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, as well as three U.S. Open titles. Investigators have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home at such an early hour. A police report says the wreck was not alcohol-related. Uchitel said she has met Woods twice, once in her capacity as the VIP director at a club in Manhattan's trendy Meatpacking District and another time through a mutual friend.

"Washington (CNN)  -- Look no further than the two warning flares shot up from Virginia and New Hampshire Tuesday evening to understand how concerned Democrats are about the political consequences of losing the late Sen. Edward Kennedy's seat to Republican Scott Brown. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, called on his Democratic colleagues to suspend votes on their controversial health care legislation, warning it would be wrong to try to muscle a bill through Congress before Brown was sworn into office. ""In many ways, the campaign in Massachusetts became a referendum not only on health care reform but also on the openness and integrity of our government process,"" Webb said in a statement. Some 500 miles to the north, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley sent out an urgent plea for donations to help fund a special election next month for a state senate seat he fears losing. ""Over the past few weeks, radical right-wing activists turned Massachusetts into ground zero for the Tea Party movement, and we saw a taste of what's to come in 2010,"" Buckley wrote. Brown's victory has changed the political narrative in 2010. Weigh in on the election results . Traditionally, the president's party loses seats in the midterm elections. But now there is concern among some politically savvy Democrats who worry that the losses could be greater than originally anticipated in November all because of Brown's win. ""It makes it really hard,"" a senior Democratic operative, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday evening. ""The frustrating thing for (Democratic) members is that it was preventable, it affects them and it was something that never should have gotten to this point."" In a matter of two weeks, Democrats witnessed a sleeping Republican base come to life to rally around a little-known GOP candidate, who defied the odds to win the race to succeed the liberal lion from Massachusetts. And after watching two governorships slip from their grasp in November, many Democrats have come to realize that the American public is not particularly happy with their stewardship of the nation. Democrats have 10 months to try to regain the momentum, but the wind is now at the Republicans' backs, and their first legislative victory will likely be slamming the brakes on President Obama's signature domestic issue: health care reform. It is a mighty blow for a president, who just one year ago seemed unbreakable, unstoppable, unbeatable. Brown is an unlikely savior for the Republican Party, which one year ago was disoriented, disorganized and disillusioned. A Massachusetts Republican has successfully brought together -- for the time being -- a party at war over the ideological purity of its membership. There is still discord in the GOP, but Brown's win gives Republicans another case study in how to run a successful campaign after their two gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia. Martha Coakley's loss provides Democrats with yet another example of how not to run a campaign after their earlier losses in New Jersey and Virginia. One of the biggest challenges for Democrats is wooing back independent voters, who broke Brown's way Tuesday to help him beat Coakley. ""If we don't figure out a way to talk to independent voters, we are done,"" lamented another high-level Democratic staffer, speaking freely on the condition of anonymity. Republicans wake up Wednesday morning with a new vigor, and GOP strategists vow to try to use this win to broaden a playing field that one year ago seemed unrealistic. The GOP's top target is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who is in danger of losing re-election, according to public polls. But Republicans hope Tuesday's victory also convinces some fence-sitting Democrats to follow the leads of Dennis Moore of Kansas or Rep. John Tanner of Tennessee and choose to retire instead of running for re-election. For Obama, the loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities, as his support on Capitol Hill wanes in this midterm election year. Conservative Democrats are less likely to back him on controversial issues such as health care and cap and trade, fearing that to do so would be political suicide. After all, Republicans were able to win Kennedy's seat by running against the Obama agenda.","Analysis: Many Democrats now realize public isn't particularly happy with their stewardship .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich capped a successful week by returning to the top of the German Bundesliga with a 2-1 victory away to title rivals Schalke on Saturday despite having a man sent off in the first half. Louis Van Gaal's team followed up the midweek Champions League victory over Manchester United with a win that puts them a point clear of previous leaders Schalke ahead of Wednesday's trip to England for the second leg of the quarterfinal. Bayern took a 2-0 lead after only 26 minutes as Franck Ribery and Thomas Muller scored within 60 seconds of each other, but Schalke's former Germany striker Kevin Kuranyi reduced the deficit soon after. The Bavarians had Hamit Altintop sent off for a second booking four minutes before halftime, but Schalke -- beaten by Bayern in the German Cup semifinals 10 days ago -- could not claim a point and had Marcelo Bordon dismissed at the end of the match. Bayern were again without Dutch forward Arjen Robben, who missed the United game with a calf problem, but surged into a two-goal lead when French playmaker Ribery fired home from a corner and Tuesday's match-winner Ivica Olic set up Muller. Kuranyi followed up his double from last weekend with another strike from a pass by Rafinha, who was fouled by Altintop to see the Turkey international an early bath. Kuranyi should have leveled just before the break but missed from close range, and Schalke failed to seriously threaten the Bayern goal in the second spell. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen suffered another blow to their title hopes with a 3-2 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which left the former leaders six points adrift of Bayern after a run of just one win in seven league outings. Frankfurt, who upset Bayern two weeks ago, moved up to eighth with a third successive win thanks to Maik Franz's 89th-minute winner. Leverkusen led 2-1 straight after halftime through Stefan Kiessling's second goal, but had Daniel Schwaab sent off three minutes later for a rash tackle on Umit Korkmaz. Caio leveled on 62 with a super long-range effort, and Franz snatched victory from close range. Borussia Dortmund consolidated fourth place with a 2-1 victory at home to Werder Bremen, scoring both goals in the first half through Kevin Grosskreutz and Neven Subotic before Aaron Hunt pulled one back in the 65th minute. Dortmund closed to with a point of Leverkusen, who hold the final Champions League place, and went four clear of fifth-placed Bremen. Stuttgart moved up to seventh with a 2-1 victory at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, while Nuremberg moved three points clear of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win at home to 10-man Mainz. Bochum joined Nuremberg on 28 points with a 1-1 draw at third-bottom Freiburg, while bottom side Hertha Berlin earned a surprise 3-0 win at Cologne in Saturday's late match thanks to two first-half goals from Raffael and a 75th-minute effort from fellow Brazilian Cicero.","Bayern Munich return to top of German Bundesliga with 2-1 victory at title rivals Schalke .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The longest and most visible lines in Haiti's capital are not for food, water or gas. They are for money. Earthquake survivors need cash and are waiting hours outside wire transfer businesses, including Western Union, that are starting to reopen. ""I have no money,"" 32-year-old Anderson Bellegarde said Thursday, in his sixth hour standing outside a UniBank money wire branch. The business in Carrefour, near the epicenter of the earthquake and about eight miles from the capital of Port-au-Prince, was operating at a crawl.

In the 1940s, ""The Adventures of Superman"" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further. It was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with ""truth, justice, and the American way."" So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration. In the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets. But when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them. Struggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role. In a 16-episode series titled ""Clan of the Fiery Cross,"" the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets. By revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them. Mental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship . 2. Donald Duck's scientific breakthrough . In 1966, Danish engineer Karl Krøyer developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls. However, when Krøyer tried to license his invention with the Dutch patent office, he was denied. Donald Duck had beaten him to the punch by 22 years. Indeed, Krøyer's concept could be traced back to a Donald Duck comic conceived by Carl Barks. In addition to being the most celebrated artist of the Donald Duck comics, Barks was known for his scientific prowess. So in a 1944 story, when Donald got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius, the duck managed to mumble, ""If I mix CH2 [a methylene compound] with NH4 [ammonium] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog, I should get speckled nitrogen!"" Although it sounded like nonsense, it wasn't. In 1963, chemists P.P. Gaspar and G.S. Hammond wrote a technical article about methylene that included a reference to the Donald Duck story. The final paragraph read, ""Among experiments which have not, to our knowledge, been carried out as yet is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than 19 years ago."" A footnote revealed that ""literature"" as the Donald Duck comic. It seems the web-footed children's hero had deduced the chemical intermediate long before it had been proven to exist. Mental Floss: Musicians performing on Sesame Street . But why were these top American chemists looking to comics for inspiration? Apparently, Dr. Gaspar had been a lifelong Donald Duck fan, and he'd rediscovered Donald's early reference to methylene while collecting old copies of the classic adventures. Gaspar never disclosed how much his work owed to Duckburg's most famous resident, but then again, how many scientists would confess that they used comic books to bolster their research? 3. A Spider-Man villain keeps folks out of jail . In a 1977 edition of Spider-Man, Peter Parker has the tables turned on him. The villain, Kingpin, tracks down Spidey using an electronic transmitter that he'd fastened to the superhero's wrist. Although Kingpin loses in the end (he always does), one New Mexico judge saw beauty in his plan. Inspired by the strip, Judge Jack Love turned to computer salesman Michael Goss and asked if he could create a similar device to keep track of crime suspects awaiting trial. In 1983, Goss produced his first batch of electronic monitors. Authorities in Albuquerque then tested the devices on five offenders, using the gadgets as an alternative to incarceration. Today, the transmitters are a common sight in courtrooms across the country, usually in the form of electronic ankle bracelets. Most famously, Martha Stewart donned one while she was under house arrest in 2004. Perhaps she would have felt better knowing that the gadget had once nabbed Spider-Man, too. Mental Floss: Truth about lie detectors (and Wonder Woman) 4. Captain Marvel Jr. saves the bad-hair day . Like most American kids in the 1940s, Elvis Presley fantasized about growing up to be like his favorite comic book superheroes. But it turns out that The King might have been more interested in their fashion statements than their special powers. During his early teen years, Elvis was obsessed with Captain Marvel Jr., known as ""America's most famous boy hero."" A younger version of Captain Marvel, the character sported an unusual hairstyle that featured a curly tuft of hair falling over the side of his forehead. Sound familiar? When Elvis set out to conquer America with his rock 'n' roll ways, he copied the 'do, thus making it one of the most famous hairstyles of the 20th century. But that wasn't all. Captain Marvel also gets credit for the short capes Elvis wore on the back of his jumpsuits, as well as The King's famous TCB logo, which bears a striking resemblance to Marvel's lightning bolt insignia. Of course, Elvis never tried to hide his love for the Captain. A copy of Captain Marvel Jr. No. 51 still sits in his preserved childhood bedroom in an apartment in Memphis, and his full comics collection remains intact in the attic at Graceland. Plus, the admiration was mutual. Captain Marvel Jr. paid tribute to The King in one issue, referring to the singer as ""the greatest modern-day philosopher.""

"(CNN) -- Chelsea struck a major blow in the English Premier League title race with a controversial 2-1 victory over champions Manchester United on Saturday that put the London club two points clear at the top of the table with five matches to play. Carlo Ancelotti's team traveled to Old Trafford to face a side reeling from the loss of injured England star Wayne Rooney following the midweek European Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich. The Italian coach opted to leave his own key forward Didier Drogba on the substitutes' bench, but the Ivory Coast international scored a decisive goal with 11 minutes to play despite being clearly offside. United boss Alex Ferguson was left fuming at the decision. ""What I can't understand is the linesman's directly in front of it. He has no-one near him and he gets it wrong,"" the Scot told Sky Sports. ""A game of that magnitude, you really need quality officials and we didn't get them today. It was a poor, poor performance. ""Five games left, they're two points ahead and four goals better than us -- they're in the driving seat. Chelsea are favorites now, there's no question. I'm certain we'll respond but we could win the next five games and not win it."" United hit back with a late bundled goal from young substitute Federico Macheda, which television replays showed came off the Italian's arm, but Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov could not convert a chance to equalize in time added on. Chelsea, who had scored 12 goals in the two previous matches and did not have to play in midweek following last month's Champions League exit against Inter Milan, started the game in dominant form. Man of the match Florent Malouda set up the opening goal in the 20th minute, with the France winger surging past Darren Fletcher into the penalty area and providing a low cross that England midfielder Joe Cole cheekily backheeled past goalkeeper Edwin Van Der Sar. Both teams had penalty claims turned down before halftime, and Berbatov missed United's first real chance with a header after an hour. Drogba replaced Nicolas Anelka in the 69th minute, and 10 minutes later he had the ball in the net after collecting a pass from fellow substitute Salomon Kalou despite being further forward than United's last two defenders. United pulled a goal back with nine minutes to play as substitute Nani broke down the left and his cross rebounded off goalkeeper Petr Cech, onto Macheda and into the Chelsea net, with visiting captain John Terry appealing in vain for handball. Berbatov, who started on his own up front in place of Rooney, then tamely volleyed Gary Neville's cross into the arms of Cech as Chelsea held on for a deserved victory. Third-placed Arsenal kept their title hopes alive with a last-gasp 1-0 victory at 10-man Wolverhampton which left Arsene Wenger's team three points behind London rivals Chelsea. Wolves had captain Karl Henry sent off for a foul on Tomas Rosicky in the 66th minute, but Arsenal could not take advantage until deep into injury-time when substitute striker Nicklas Bendtner headed in Bacary Sagna's cross. Manchester City moved up to fourth place above Tottenham with a 6-1 thrashing of Burnley in Saturday's late match that left their near neighbors deep in relegation trouble. Roberto Mancini's team were 4-0 up after 20 minutes, and led 6-0 before an hour had been played as Emmanuel Adebayor scored twice along with goals from fellow strikers Craig Bellamy and Carlos Tevez. Patrick Vieira and Vincent Kompany were also on target before Steven Fletcher's 71st-minute consolation for the home side. Tottenham's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League took a big blow with a 3-1 defeat at Sunderland, for whom the London club's former striker Darren Bent scored twice -- the first after only 36 seconds and the second from the penalty spot. England World Cup hopeful Bent also had two spot-kicks saved by Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes as he took his tally to 23 for the season. Sunderland also had a goal disallowed as Steve Bruce's team consolidated 13th place, a comfortable 11 points clear of the bottom three. Aston Villa bounced back from the 7-1 thrashing at Chelsea with a 1-0 win at Bolton to join sixth-placed Liverpool -- who travel to Birmingham on Sunday -- on 54 points. England international Ashley Young fired an 11th-minute winner to leave Bolton five points above the relegation zone. Stoke moved up to 10th with a 2-0 victory that left Hull in the bottom three, equal on points with West Ham, who travel to Everton on Sunday. Jamaica forward Ricardo Fuller gave Stoke a sixth-minute lead, and Hull were reduced to 10 minutes after Dutch midfielder George Boateng was carried off after being kicked in the head before Liam Lawrence scored a late second. Bottom club Portsmouth delayed their inevitable relegation with a 0-0 draw at home to Blackburn despite having defender Anthony Van den Borre sent off with half an hour to play. Avram Grant's team would have gone down if they had lost and Hull had won.","Chelsea move two points clear at the top of the English Premier League with vital victory .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Liverpool were beaten by two penalties in Lisbon as Benfica came from behind to grasp the advantage in their Europa League quarterfinal. The Portuguese club suffered a nightmare start when Daniel Agger put the visitors in front after just nine minutes with a neat back heel from Steven Gerrard's free kick. But just after the half hour mark Liverpool were reduced to ten men when Ryan Babel clashed with defender Luisao after he had fouled Spanish striker Fernando Torres. Babel appeared to put his hands in Luisao's face and the referee produced a red card. It took Benfica less than 30 minutes to press home their advantage when Liverpool defender Emiliano Insua brought down Pablo Aimar inside the box and conceded a penalty. Oscar Cardozo converted the spot kick and was given the chance to put his side into the lead when the referee adjudged Jamie Carragher had handled in the area on 79 minutes. Again Cardozo made no mistake from the spot. The return leg is at Anfield next Thursday. Fulham vanquished seasoned European opponents again as they defeated German champions Wolfsburg 2-1 at Craven Cottage. Striker Bobby Zamora gave the English side the lead on 59 minutes with a precise curling shot from the edge of the area. Irish winger Damien Duff made it 2-0 just four minutes later as he converted Zamora's pass. But in the final minute Wolfsburg scored a vital away goal as Alexander Madlung emphatically headed home Zvjezdan Misimovic's cross. After the game Fulham manager Roy Hodgson told ESPN television: ""Wolfsburg are a good team but tonight I thought we made them look reasonably ordinary."" The all-Spanish tie between Valencia and Atletico Madrid finished 2-2. Uruguayan striker Diego Forlan put Atletico in front on 59 minutes but Manuel Fernandes equalized shortly after for the home side. Atletico struck again through Antonio Lopez only for Spain forward David Villa to rescue a draw for Valencia. In the evening's other match Hamburg beat Belgian side Standard Liege 2-1 in Germany. A strike from Deiudonne Mbokani gave Liege an early advantage but goals from Mladen Petric and Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy secured Hamburg a lead to take into the second leg.","Portuguese club Benfica beat Liverpool 2-1 in their Europa League quarterfinal tie .

"(The Frisky) -- I know you are really, really upset -- but can you stop crying for a second so we can talk about the fact that Katherine Heigl is finally leaving ""Grey's Anatomy?"" Long overdue, as far as I'm concerned. She has been annoying me since day one. How bad can the job really be? Hmmm, let's see. You get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to show up on set for 12 episodes -- then you get half the year off. Yeah, I think I'd quit too. Her publicist claims she's out of there because she wants to spend more time with her newly adopted daughter, and that becoming a mother has ""changed [her] desire to work full-time."" That's sounds like sunshine and moonbeams and all, but the truth is that she's been petitioning to get Dr. Izzie Stevens written off for the last three years. Since her BFF T.R. Knight left, I suspect. At least we can have some fun imagining how they might get rid of her. Drug overdose? Amnesia? Doctors Without Borders? Sex tape? Fun! Anyway, considering her last few movies were ludicrous rom-coms and she has a rep for biting the hand that feeds her, I'm thinking she may not be too popular in Hollywood after this. Plenty of other celebs have left cushy TV jobs for bigger and better things. Let's see how nine of them fared. The Frisky - Sandra Bullock and other celebs who ditched the dead weight . 1. Amanda Seyfried thinks she's too big for the filming schedule of ""Big Love."" That's why she's leaving the show -- to move back to New York City, pursue her film career, and live life to the fullest by eating spinach and seeds and popping pills. Mazel Tov, Amanda! But we're not sure how this is going to go for you. 2. Fans went crazy when ABC announced that it was canceling ""My So-Called Life"" after just one season. But then it came out that Claire Danes was the one who wanted the show to end -- she was ready to move on to a film career. She's had some hits, ""Romeo & Juliet"" and ""Shopgirl,"" but she will always and forever be Angela Chase. 3. She's never confirmed it, but when ""The O.C."" killed off Marissa Cooper in the season finale of season three, most people assumed it was because Mischa Barton wanted to move on. The show trucked on without her -- for a season. Mischa's career, on the other hand: as dead as Marissa after the car wreck. Frisky - 8 female stars who dated their managers . 4. Rose McGowan replaced Shannen Doherty when good witch Prue Halliwell was ""killed off"" of ""Charmed."" Now she's working her magic on the judges of ""Dancing With the Stars."" Abracadabra!

Yeah, she's pretty much taking over the industry and making money with much more than her looks. The Frisky -- Britney and J. Lo did it: How a ""How I Met Your Mother"" cameo can turn a career around . 6. Hunky George Clooney left ""ER"" in its fifth season to become the A-list movie star in the front row at the Oscars.

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Officials have agreed to pay $1.5 million to the daughter of a man fatally shot in the back by a transit police officer on New Year's Day 2009 in Oakland, California. A bystander's cell-phone video of the shooting on a transit platform was widely circulated on the Internet and on news shows. The Bay Area Rapid Transit train system late Wednesday announced the settlement over the killing of Oscar Grant, 22. ""It's been a little over a year since we experienced the tragic death of Oscar Grant,"" BART Board President James Fang said. ""No matter what anyone's opinion of the case may be, the sad fact remains this incident has left Tatiana without a father. The $1.5 million settlement will provide financial support for her.""  Grant's daughter, Tatiana, is 5. The video showed then-Officer Johannes Mehserle, 27, pulling his gun and shooting Grant in the back as another officer kneeled on Grant. Mehserle might have intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun, according to a court filing by his attorney. The shooting sparked large protests in Oakland and led to Mehserle's arrest on a murder charge. The case against him is pending. Initially, attorney John Burris asked for $50 million in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed on behalf of Grant's daughter. Burris was not immediately available for comment on the settlement. The transit system's police department has made several changes since the shooting. The department has increased training hours for officers, is requiring them to report all ""use-of-force incidents,"" and is tapping the public's help in searching for a new police chief, the transit system said in a statement. ""This settlement is critical in our efforts to move forward,"" said Carole Ward Allen, a BART board member.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Shootouts between drug suspects and the military in the Mexican northeastern border state of Tamaulipas have left seven dead and 11 wounded, the government reported. One of the dead and the 11 wounded were Mexican military who were ambushed while on patrol late Thursday night in the cities of Miguel Aleman, Mier and Valadeces, the Notimex news agency reported, citing the nation's National Defense Department. The cities are along the U.S. border, near McAllen, Texas. The cities also are near Reynosa, Mexico, where the United States closed its consulate Thursday because of recent increased drug violence. The U.S. Consulate also issued a warning ""to advise U.S. citizens of recent gun battles in Reynosa, Mexico, and cities surrounding Reynosa in the last week."" Thursday night's firefights were the latest in a string of confrontations that some residents say have been going on for at least 10 days. Earlier this week, local news reports said, gunmen in as many as 20 vehicles clashed with members of the Mexican military and municipal police in Ciudad Mier, just west of Reynosa. The daytime gun battle Tuesday reportedly resulted in the abduction of 10 municipal police officers. Video from the scene showed abandoned police sport utility vehicles with bullet holes and broken windows. Shattered glass covered the street against a backdrop of palm trees. A damaged red truck with the insignia CDG -- the Spanish acronym for the Gulf Cartel -- was shown being towed from the shooting scene. In Reynosa, residents told CNN on Thursday that banners purportedly placed throughout the city by the rival Los Zetas drug cartel announced there would be a gunfight at 8 p.m. Residents reported hearing gunshots as early as 7:30 p.m. After Thursday night's gunfire, officials say they confiscated 14 vehicles, 29 firearms, 10 hand grenades and more than 1,700 rounds of ammunition of various caliber. On a tour of the border cities, Tamaulipas Gov. Eugenio Hernandez Flores sought to reassure residents that the government is committed to controlling the mayhem. Violence throughout Mexico has exploded since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after assuming office in December 2006. More than 16,000 people have been killed in drug violence since then. Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, is the most violent city in Mexico and one of the deadliest on earth. The rival Juarez and Sinaloa cartels are fighting for control of the lucrative drug routes into the United States as well street sales within Ciudad Juarez. The cartels also are fighting the Mexican army and federal, state and local police. Mexican officials point out that most of the deaths involve criminals; few civilians have been killed. In Juarez earlier this month, however, 10 teenagers and five other people were gunned down at a party. Officials said the gunmen belonged to the Juarez cartel and mistakenly believed the partygoers were members of a gang affiliated with the Sinaloa cartel.

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Commercial air service resumed Friday morning from the United States to Haiti.

The flight landed at 9:22 a.m. ET in Haiti, the company said. An Insel Air flight also left Miami on Friday morning with passengers bound for Haiti, including relief workers, said Heerem Zeen of the airline's international office. Commercial air service from the United States to Haiti had been suspended since the January 12 earthquake. The Haitian government says at least 212,000 people died in the magnitude-7.0 quake.

""We'll start out with three main flights a day from South Florida, two from Miami and one from Fort Lauderdale. Then we'll also fly a JFK New York flight into Haiti four days a week."" Haitian customs officials will work out of a cargo facility because of damage at the main terminal, Smith said. ""These flights serve as major milestones toward helping the country rebuild,"" Peter Dolara, American's senior vice president for Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America, said in a recent news release. ""With commercial air service restored, we can better connect loved ones and provide consistent transportation to and from Haiti."" Also beginning March 12, American Eagle -- American's commuter affiliate -- will commence new service into Port-au-Prince from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and daily flights from the Dominican Republic cities of Santo Domingo and Santiago.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Transportation slapped United Airlines with a $30,000 fine Friday for violating price advertising rules, and the airline also will have to pay the balance for a previous infraction. Under DOT rules, airlines must disclose the full price of air travel to consumers. ""Our fare advertising rules are designed to ensure that consumers know how much they will pay for a ticket and are able to compare prices when choosing which carrier to fly,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. The department found that United failed to disclose a 7.5 percent federal excise tax for 60 hours on the initial results page of its Web site. United said it is committed to advertising its fares clearly. ""In this unique case, due to a programming error, the initial fare display inadvertently placed the 7.5 percent federal excise tax in the 'taxes and fees' section, rather than in the base fare,"" said spokeswoman Sarah Massier in an e-mail. ""Immediately upon learning of the programming error United took action to move the tax to the base fare."" Government taxes and fees per passenger are the only charges that are not required to be included in the published fare, according to the DOT. The new penalty means United also will have to pay the balance on a fine for a violation over the summer. In August, the DOT fined United $75,000 for not disclosing taxes and fees in the initial advertised fares on its Web site and for showing one-way fares that were only applicable for round-trip travel. The airline was required to pay $37,500 of that penalty, with the understanding that half would be forgiven if it had no further violations within the next 12 months. United now is required to pay the other half of the $75,000 fine.","Under DOT rules, airlines must disclose the full price of air travel to consumers .

According to Anatolian, Tarkan was detained along with several other individuals who are ""important figures from the art and magazine world."" Full coverage in Turkish: CNN Turk . Tarkan rose to international prominence in the late 1990s for singing playful hit songs like ""Simarik"" (Spoiled). The heartthrob has been described by some as a Turkish Ricky Martin, referring to the Latin pop singer from Puerto Rico who achieved popularity worldwide. German-born Tarkan, who uses only one name, also has made the pop charts around the world. In recent years, it was reported, he has been living in New York City. The arrest was carried out in Istanbul. Turkey is a key stop on a drug smuggling transit route between Asia and Europe. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, it is a major hub for the trafficking of illegal heroin and opium from Afghanistan en route to European markets. Drug operations involving Turkish celebrities, including artists and models, are often carried out in Istanbul. Last month, Tarkan gave a concert in Istanbul's central Taksim square to celebrate the city's inauguration as Europe's 2010 Capital of Culture.

"(CNN) -- On January 12, a magnitude-7.0 quake struck Haiti just southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince. On February 27, an 8.8-magnitude quake hit Chile near that nation's second largest city, Concepcion. That same day there was a 7.0 quake off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, and just this week a 6.4 quake hit southern Taiwan. The Fact Check Desk looked at whether all of the seismic activity could be related. Fact Check: Is there any connection between the recent deadly earthquakes? • Dr. Kurt Frankel of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who specializes in active tectonics, says that earthquakes are sporadic and unpredictable in nature. • According to Frankel, the fact that these relatively strong quakes would strike around the same time is merely coincidence. Because the quakes did happen one after another, earthquakes are on people's mind, Frankel explained. ""Had the quakes in Haiti and Chile not occurred recently, we might not have even been interested in the other quakes,"" he said. • CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said earthquakes can trigger other seismic activity, but added that those four aforementioned events were too far apart in both time and distance to be connected. • The U.S. Geological Survey on its Web site takes on the assertion that two major earthquakes in the same day must be related. Their answer: not likely. This is because Earth's surface is not rigid enough to transfer the stress over long distances. ""There is evidence to suggest that earthquakes in one area can trigger seismic activity within a few hundred miles,"" they write. ""There is also evidence that some major earthquakes manage to trigger seismicity over much greater distances (thousands of miles), but these triggered quakes are small and very short lived."" • The USGS estimates there are several million earthquakes each year and the National Earthquake Information Center locates about 50 quakes per day. However, large quakes measuring 8.0 and higher occur only about once a year on average. Bottom Line: While earthquakes can, and do, trigger other seismic events, the recent earthquakes in Haiti, Chile, Japan and Taiwan are not thought by experts to be connected.

The incident is under investigation, according to the agency's report. Spokesman P.J. Crowley had said Thursday afternoon that the department had been unable to get information on the reported incident. North Korea announced December 29 that it was holding an American who had entered the country illegally from China on Christmas Eve. The news agency did not identify the man, who it said was ""now under investigation by a relevant organ."" At the time, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Washington was concerned by reports that a Korean-American missionary, Robert Park, had gone into North Korea, but could not confirm them. Washington and Pyongyang have no diplomatic relations. The United States relies on the Swedish Embassy to look after U.S. interests in North Korea. Crowley has said the United States continues to seek consular access to Park.","North Koreans say U.S. citizen entered the country from China .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-eight suspected pirates were taken into custody Friday by the European Union Naval Force after a handful of failed attacks on fishing vessels in the Indian Ocean, the EU mission said. In the first incident, the mission intercepted a mother ship and two skiffs early Friday in the southern Indian Ocean between the Seycelles and Mombasa, Kenya. The mission said the suspected pirates were in an area where an earlier attack had occurred. A helicopter from the French warship FS Nivose then tracked the vessels and saw the suspects throwing things overboard, the mission said. When a French team arrived at the scene, it found 11 suspected pirates and ""pirate paraphernalia"" in the skiffs: a rocket launcher, grappling hooks and several fuel barrels. The forces destroyed the pirate ship and a skiff and took the suspected pirates into custody. The fate of the second skiff was not immediately known. Soon after, pirates tried to attack a French fishing vessel near two other fishing boats, said Cmdr. John Harbour, spokesman for the EU Naval Force. The French fishing vessel collided with the suspected pirates' vessel and sank it, Harbour said. Six suspected pirates were picked out of the water by the EU force, he said. It was not immediately clear if they had been transported to the FS Nivose, although that had been planned, he said. Later, pirates tried to attack a Spanish fishing vessel, Harbour said. The boat alerted the EU Naval Force, and air and naval units intervened, he said. Eleven suspected pirates were taken into custody and were on board the Nivose, Harbour said. Harbour said an increase in pirate attacks was likely over the next few weeks as the monsoon season was ending and the ocean was becoming calmer, he said. ""The pirates have been preparing for it. ... We are prepared as well,"" he said. On Thursday, pirates on two skiffs in the Indian Ocean attacked the Spanish fishing vessel Albacan, the EU Naval Force said. The pirates fired a rocket-propelled grenade, which exploded on the Albacan's deck and burst into flames, force said. Armed guards on the Albacan fired shots at the skiffs and repelled the attack, it said. No crew members were injured, and the small fire was extinguished. The EU mission tries to deter and stop piracy off Somalia, which has been mired in chaos since the early 1990s. It escorts vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean carrying World Food Program humanitarian aid to displaced people in Somalia. It also seeks to protect ""vulnerable vessels"" in the Gulf of Aden and off the Somali coast, according to the mission's Web site.","Pirates attack fishing vessels in Indian Ocean .

"New York (CNN) -- Today's bipartisan health care meeting is being called a summit, a term that brings to mind diplomatic missions during wartime. That's a fitting description for the atmosphere in Washington. Political opponents are considered enemies. Health care is just the latest example of government dysfunction; it's been derailed by hyper-partisanship, over-spending and the disproportionate influence of special interests. Independent voters, the largest and fastest growing segment of the electorate, hold the balance of power in American politics, but they have once again been shut out of the debate. The professional partisans in Washington ignore them at their peril. Many Americans associate broken government with the chaos that followed Hurricane Katrina and the anxieties that accompany the current manic recession. But the roots of independent voters' frustration go deeper. For them, the first modern evidence of failure from the federal government came during the late 1960s, when the social spending of Democratic President Johnson's Great Society failed to stop urban blight by throwing taxpayer money at the problem. One presidency later, the country confronted the corruption of Watergate from Republican President Nixon. Washington grew more harshly partisan, with political opponents determined to delegitimize any president from day one of his term. As the two parties grew more polarized, power shifted from the center to the margins, and special interests increased their influence. In reaction, the ranks of independent voters grew from 20 percent of the electorate at the start of the 1960s to 30 percent after Watergate. When Ross Perot ran for president as an Independent in 1992, the self-made businessman presented himself as a nonideological problem solver. His campaign gained traction because both parties had lost credibility as stewards of fiscal responsibility, with overspending and then-record deficits. Perot briefly led in the polls, and independents spiked to 36 percent of the electorate. The divided government of President Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich ultimately produced hard-won budget surpluses. But when President Bush and the Tom DeLay-led Republican Congress ruled Washington during the last decade, surpluses again turned to deficits and independents turned against the GOP. Independents listed the economy as their No. 1 issue back in 2007, when Democrats said health care and Republicans said terrorism. Moderates and the middle class -- the people who determine who wins elections -- felt squeezed even before the fiscal crisis, with rising health care and energy costs absorbing whatever benefit they might have received from tax cuts. After watching the jet set excess of the Bernie Madoff class from afar, they were left with less and still asked to clean up the mess. Now, as they try to balance their own budgets at home, they see big government and big business --Washington and Wall Street -- piling up huge debts and passing the buck to the taxpayer. It was in this environment that independents began to break with President Obama last spring, after voting for him in 2008 by an eight-point margin. The change they voted for was rooted in candidate Obama's calls for an end to politics that ""played to the base"" and a restoration of fiscal responsibility. The liberal House leadership's private negotiations over the $787 billion stimulus bill seemed to contradict those promises. And the subsequent health care debate was derailed in part because it was seen as adding additional spending and leading to the growth of government. In reaction, independents reasserted themselves, their numbers growing quickly and reaching 43 percent by September 2009, according to a monthly Washington Post/ABC News poll. In Virginia, New Jersey and Massachusetts' elections, independents voted by at least a 2-to-1 margin for Republican candidates. Exit polls showed they were voting to send a message to Washington, not necessarily endorsing the Congressional Republicans' agenda. Independents' anger today is focused on familiar targets: hypocritical politicians, over-spending and a lack of agreement on solutions from Washington. Independents feel they are paying more and getting less. They believe the system has been rigged to benefit special interests at the expense of the national interest. As bitter partisanship increases government's dysfunction, more voters are declaring their independence from politics as usual. Today's bipartisan health care summit is a step in the right direction. Independent voters want to see the warring parties in Washington speaking to each other in the presence of television cameras, ensuring at least a degree of civility and accountability. It's more difficult to demonize the opposition when talking with them. But photo-op centrism is, of course, not enough. It must be followed by substance. To really change the culture of Washington, we need to change the rules that reinforce this predictable partisanship. The quickest policy cure would be to change the rigged system of redistricting that creates congressional 'safe seats' and replaces competitive general elections with closed primaries, where party activists reign supreme. Nonpartisan redistricting and open primaries would reward politicians who reach across the aisle, and would empower independent voters. Americans' sense that government is broken didn't happen overnight, and it won't be solved overnight. It will take time to restore trust in Washington. But substantive efforts to depolarize our politics will lead to the politics of problem solving. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon says health care summit comes amid a period of bipartisan dysfunction in government .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Desiree Rogers, the White House social secretary, plans to step down, the Obama administration announced Friday. Her office came under scrutiny after a couple who lacked an invitation were allowed into President Obama's first state dinner. ""We are enormously grateful to Desiree Rogers for the terrific job she's done as the White House social secretary,"" the president and first lady said in a statement released Friday. In an interview on Friday, Rogers said she was leaving voluntarily and that her decision was unrelated to the fallout over the security breach. ""It has nothing to do with that,"" she said. ""It's Secret Service's job to handle security. Not the social secretary's office."" The Obamas' statement did not mention November's party-crashing incident . ""When she took this position, we asked Desiree to help make sure that the White House truly is the people's house, and she did that by welcoming scores of everyday Americans through its doors, from wounded warriors to local schoolchildren to NASCAR drivers. ""She organized hundreds of fun and creative events during her time here, and we will miss her. We thank her again for her service and wish her all the best in her future endeavors."" Rogers said in an e-mail to CNN on Friday, ""It has been incredible setting the foundation for the [White House] for this historical presidency. Headed back to private sector."" ""I accomplished initially what I came to do,"" Rogers said later. ""I like strategy. I like building something. It's built... the foundation of the [social secretary's] office is good and solid."" Rogers would not say where she'll be working. She said she'll be ""around to work on the transition"" to a new social secretary at the White House. She summed up her experiences at the White House in another note: ""330 events. Halloween for 3,000. Easter egg roll for 30,000. Music series with performances and the performers teaching the students during the day. Latin, jazz, country, civil rights. "" In December, the White House was accused of stonewalling as Congress investigated the party-crasher security breach at Obama's first state dinner. At issue was whether the White House was protecting Rogers from testifying about how Tareq and Michaele Salahi were able to crash the first White House state dinner. The couple did not have an invite but were allowed in. Rogers' office planned the dinner. At the time, Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan said his agency would take the heat for the incident. ""This is our fault and our fault alone,"" he told federal lawmakers. ""There's no other people to blame here. ... Look at me and blame me,"" he told members of the House Homeland Security Committee.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)  -- Saddam Hussein's cousin Ali Hassan al-Majeed -- also known as Chemical Ali -- was executed Monday, an Iraqi government spokesman said. He was hanged after having been convicted on 13 counts of killings and genocide, Ali al-Dabagh said. Al-Majeed had been sentenced to death in four separate trials, including one that focused on his involvement in a poison gas attack against Iraqi Kurds that killed about 5,000 people. His execution had been delayed for political rather than legal reasons. It is not clear what change, if any, led to the reported execution. Al-Majeed had been held in United States custody since his capture in 2003. But he was handed over to the Iraqi authorities in the 24 hours before his execution, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill told CNN's Diana Magnay on Monday. The 1988 poison gas attack on the village of Halabja, which earned al-Majeed his nickname, was part of the Anfal campaign, in which the Hussein regime killed at least 100,000 Iraqi Kurds. The campaign is believed to be worst poison gas attack on civilians ever. Al-Majeed was sentenced to death separately for his role in putting down a Shiite uprising against Hussein in 1991, and for his part in putting down a Baghdad revolt in 1999. Estimates of the Shiite death toll in the 1991 rebellion range from 20,000 to 100,000. Al-Majeed was convicted of playing a key part in the slaughter during the revolt in southern Iraq that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War. One of his co-defendants in the Anfal case, Sultan Hashem, is a prominent Sunni leader who is considered a key player in efforts to reconcile the country's once-dominant Sunni community with the Shiite majority that now wields political power. Hashem was also sentenced to death, but Iraq's Sunni Arab Vice-President Tariq al-Hashimi has long refused to sign his execution order.  That delayed the execution of al-Majeed and another defendant as well. Iraqi law requires all three members of the Iraqi presidency council -- the president and two vice-presidents -- to sign execution orders. It does not say what happens if they do not sign. CNN's Yousif Bassil contributed to this report.","NEW:  U.S. handed al-Majeed over to Iraqi authorities shortly before execution, official says .

"New York (CNN) -- Former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw and his wife were involved in a three-vehicle accident Friday in which one person died, a network spokeswoman said. The accident happened about 1 p.m. on New York's Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx, spokeswoman Jenny Tartikoff said in a statement. Brokaw and his wife, Meredith, were not injured, she said. The accident occurred when an SUV swerved to avoid a spool of wire that had fallen from a truck and slammed into a 7-ton U.S. postal truck, said Peter Rendina, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. Brokaw, who was driving behind the postal truck, hit the rear of the truck, Rendina said. The driver of the SUV was thrown from her vehicle and killed, according to Rendina. The newsman and his wife waited at the crash scene until postal inspectors arrived, Rendina said. ""According to our inspectors, Brokaw did nothing wrong, just in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" he said. ""Tom and Meredith are greatly saddened by this loss of life,"" the Brokaw statement said.

"San Diego, California (CNN)  -- There was a lot to appreciate in yesterday's bipartisan White House health care summit between President Obama and members of Congress. No really. This is the kind of thing that our leaders ought to do three or four times a year on a variety of issues -- from Social Security to education to immigration to job creation. Why not? Put aside the sound bites and partisan barbs. Get beyond the dueling appearances on the Sunday morning talk shows. And bring your best ideas and most constructive suggestions to the table. Obama deserves credit for convening the meeting. His opening remarks were good, especially when he talked about the rising costs of health insurance premiums, the ""exploding costs of Medicare and Medicaid,"" and how he wanted to ""make sure that this discussion is actually a discussion and not just us trading talking points."" I also appreciated  his candid discussion of health scares years ago involving his own daughters and how he wondered ""What would have happened if I didn't have reliable health care?"" And his acknowledgement that ""Everybody here understands the desperation that people feel when they're sick."" That is, assuming everything that happened yesterday at Blair House was real -- and not merely a theatrical setup for a Democratic-led effort next week to push through, using reconciliation, what Democrats on the Hill call ""the big bill."" That's Obama's comprehensive $950 billion plan to radically reform the nation's health care system -- the one opposed by every Republican in Congress and, according to polls, a majority of Americans. Reconciliation is a procedural maneuver that allows the Senate to pass the health care bill with 51 votes rather than the 60 votes required to end a filibuster. Yet, according to a recent Gallup poll, more than half of Americans -- 52 percent -- oppose Democrats resorting to reconciliation to pass a bill. And while Republicans are still holding out hope that Obama and congressional Democrats will go back to the drawing board and start with a blank piece of paper, that appears unlikely since Democrats seem to be ""all in"" on their piece of legislation. So what was the point of the summit? It might well have been to create a foil. According to what an unnamed Democratic official told Politico.com, the purpose of the event was to give a face to gridlock. Democrats intend over the next few weeks to spin this narrative suggesting that they tried, really tried, to work with Republicans but the ""party of no"" was just too obstinate and too uncompromising. So Democrats had no choice but to rely on the perfectly legitimate process known as reconciliation. So the summit was a fraud? A charade? I hope not. Even in Washington, there has to be a limit to cynicism. And I'd hope this would be it. I'd hope that Obama and Democratic lawmakers wouldn't toy with the American people on an issue as important as this one. Talk about broken government. The public wants solutions to our health care problems -- however they're defined -- and not partisan gimmicks that give ""a face to gridlock."" Even many of those Americans who oppose the Democratic plan turn around to tell pollsters, in the next breath, that the current system has too much cost and not enough common sense. No one approves of the status quo. That's at least something to agree on. And while Obama got a lot of things right in his remarks, he also made a big mistake when -- at the very outset of the discussion -- he defined as the baseline ""the House and the Senate legislation that's already passed."" That told Republicans that they were not getting their blank sheet of paper, and that the best they could hope for was to tweak but not substantially change the Democratic plans. It also did something else. It reminded the American people of who calls the shots in Washington. It's the party in power. Democrats control all the levers of government, at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Remember that fact. Write it down. For President Obama and the Democratic congressional leadership, the real obstacles to reform aren't Republicans -- who don't have any power -- but fellow Democrats who are up for re-election and who are terrified of ""the big bill."" They represent districts that either Obama lost to John McCain in 2008 or in which Obama barely squeaked out a victory. So they're not going anywhere near this unpopular piece of legislation. Who can blame them? Whatever happens on health care, Democrats alone deserve, depending on your view, either the credit or the blame. You see, the real face of gridlock is theirs. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarette, Jr.","Ruben Navarrette Jr. lauds the health care summit, says leaders ought to hold more such events .

"(CNN) -- Ena Zizi was participating in a prayer group at the national cathedral in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, when the structure came down on her during the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that hit the island on January 12. In New York, meanwhile, her son, Maxim Janvier, had no way of knowing what befell her other than she was missing. Miraculously, the 70-year-old Zizi survived seven days trapped under the rubble before she was rescued by international search crews this week. A person can, give or take, expect to survive 72 hours trapped without water or food. Zizi managed to hold on for twice as long, something that experts say speaks to the body's resilience in times of danger. It is possible for a healthy person to survive more than 10 days in some cases, experts say. ""I wasn't surprised. I knew she would live through that. She is a tough woman,"" Janvier said, recalling when he heard the news, via a CNN tip, that his mother had been found. Earlier, he had used CNN's Web site to enter his mother's name, age and approximate location in hope of someone identifying her. Zizi has since been moved to a medical facility aboard the USS Bataan, and now her son is seeking help moving her to a hospital in Florida for further treatment. ""I haven't given up hope,"" Janvier told CNN. ""It's God's sign to me that I will have another chance to see my mom."" A CNN crew captured video of Tuesday's rescue. After hours of careful extraction by rescue crews from Germany, South Africa and Mexico, Zizi was carried from the rubble on a wooden board as she grasped the edges, her face covered in dust. ""Thank God! Thank God!"" she exclaimed as she was pulled out, the video shows. ""Thanks to teamwork we were able to take this woman that prayed and prayed, and I believe that her faith that is so big was the thing that saved her,"" one of the Mexican rescuers said.  iReport: Search list of the missing and the found .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda's north African wing has released an audio message from an Italian man whom it says it has kidnapped and has set a 25-day deadline for the Italian government to meet its demands. The message was accompanied by a still photograph, posted on Islamist Web sites, showing a bearded man kneeling in front of a group of six armed and masked men. The group, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, says the man is Cicala Sergio. The group says it has been holding the man and his wife for two months. The audio message, dated February 24, urges the Italian government to meet the group's demands in 25 days -- although it was unclear what those demands are. ""If you want to guarantee the safety of these two Italian captives, you need to pressure your government and urge them to respond to the legitimate demands,"" the statement said. CNN could not immediately determine the authenticity of the message. In June, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb executed a British man after the British government did not give in to its demand to release Abu Qatada, a Jordanian considered to be al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe. The group began life as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat with aspirations to overthrow the Algerian government. Around 2004, it joined forces with al Qaeda and extended its reach across North and West Africa.

"(CNN) -- A Philippine government convoy was ambushed by gunmen Thursday in the same province that saw the bloody massacre of 57 people last month, a Philippine military spokesman said. The convoy was on its way back from a raid on the compound of former governor Andal Ampatuan Sr. in Maguindanao province, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang said. No one was injured in the attack, he said. ""They were about to take the evidence to General Santos City when they were ambushed in the same municipality (where) the massacre took place,"" Cabangbang said. ""The convoy was able to return fire and the gunmen scampered,"" he added. The attack occurred at 7:30 p.m. local time (6:30 a.m. ET) and Philippine military personnel were still in the area conducting search operations several hours later, he said. ""We surmise that these are men who are still loyal to the governor trying to recover what we took from the governor's compound,"" Cabangbang said. Thousands of rounds of ammunition and several firearms were recovered from the compound, Cabangbang said. Maguindanao province is the same place where 57 people, including 30 journalists, were massacred on November 23. That attack, authorities have said, was an apparent attempt to keep a political opponent of the Ampatuan clan from registering to run for governor. Philippine police say that at least two people who were at the scene of the massacre have implicated a mayor as being involved in the killings, state media reported Thursday. The two are among 161 suspects in the killings in the southern province. Some of the suspects are in custody; others are being sought, the Philippines News Agency said. Immediately after the killings, suspicion fell on Andal Ampatuan Jr., the mayor of Datu Unsay municipality and the son of the powerful governor of Maguindanao. Authorities have recommended that Ampatuan be charged with 25 counts of murder. ""We have two (witnesses). Because they were in the crime scene, these two have direct testimony linking the mayor to the crime,"" the country's National Police Director Raul Castaneda was quoted as saying by the news agency. Also on Thursday, 75 civilians, including children, were kidnapped in the region where the massacre took place, authorities said. Several rebel groups there are fighting for different causes. Seventeen children and an adult were freed soon after, and negotiations continued to secure the release of the rest, said Army Capt. Enrico Ileto. The abductions took place Thursday afternoon in Prosperidad, the capital of Agusan del Sur province. The November 23 massacre took place on the other side of the island. There are no indications that the two incidents are related. Alongside Muslim separatist groups that have been fighting for an independent Islamic state in the region, communist rebels are engaged in a 40-year insurgency there. The Philippine Congress met Thursday for a second day in a joint session as lawmakers questioned President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's Cabinet members about a martial law that was imposed on the province Friday. The martial law allows arrests without a warrant. The army has said it is necessary to impose peace following what has been called a politically motivated massacre. Critics contend that it sets a dangerous precedent. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the country. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation. CNN's Nick Valencia, Joyce Joseph and Sarita Harilela contributed to this report.","Philippine government convoy ambushed in same province as massacre .

"(CNN) -- In a most public fashion, congressional lawmakers have been grilling Toyota officials this week about safety defects that have caused some of the automaker's vehicles to accelerate without warning. Accidents and deaths are being linked to these problems. This is prime political theater. Angry lawmakers are aggressively demanding answers, dressing down their corporate counterparts. Toyota officials are largely apologetic. Toyota President Akio Toyoda wept after the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing Wednesday. What's largely occluded from television cameras, however, are the long, deep ties between Toyota, former federal government employees and current lawmakers, some of whom are (or have been) tasked with providing oversight, upholding public safety and, at the moment, potentially recommending regulatory changes. Of course, ties do not mean tepid congressional questioning, nor do they mean tough regulations will not result from committee hearings. But as consumers -- and citizens -- watch the hearings transpire, it's worth remembering that Washington is a place where the public interest isn't always politicians' first or only interest. In 2009, Toyota employed 31 lobbyists, hired to exert influence and defend the company's interests before Congress, the White House and federal agencies, such as the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy. So who are these Toyota lobbyists working the back channels of government? Our research indicates that in many instances, they're former members of the U.S. government, earning handsome salaries lobbying on behalf of their corporate client. Among the leaders in this small army of lobbyists (and registered as such in 2009) are a former congressman, two former chiefs of staff for prominent senator currently serving, a former Department of Energy assistant secretary, a former assistant director of the National Commission on Air Quality and a former special events director for the Republican National Committee. This is a group that can't be easily dismissed by congressional leaders and their staffs. In politics, just like any social realm, it's simpler to say ""no"" to a stranger than someone who used to work for you or with you, or someone you may have even campaigned for. Now, in Toyota's period of political peril, the company will probably need the help of its lobbyists to mitigate damage to its corporate interests. By December, Toyota had spent about $5.4 million on federal lobbying efforts for 2009, more than Honda, Volkswagen, Nissan or any other foreign automaker. During the past five years, Toyota's federal lobbying expenditures total nearly $25 million, about enough to buy two new Prius hybrids for every member of Congress. Among automakers, only General Motors and Ford have each spent more money to lobby the federal government during that time. As for lawmakers themselves, they, too, have connections to Toyota. In 2008, the most recent year for which data are available, seven members of Congress reported owning Toyota stock. Rep. Jane Harman, D-California, who represents that district in which Toyota's U.S. headquarters is located, declared in her 2008 personal financial disclosure report that she and her husband owned $315,000 in Toyota assets. Harman, who serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is investigating Toyota, said this week that she'd recuse herself from committee proceedings and votes, an appropriate step to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest. No other member of Congress has publicly followed suit, including Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, another Toyota stock owner in 2008 who also sits on the committee. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia, doesn't own Toyota stock, but he was instrumental in wooing Toyota to build a factory in his state, once saying he ""felt like a full-fledged member"" of Toyota's site selection team. Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate's Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, is slated to serve as the Senate's lead investigator into Toyota's safety issues (hearings begin next week) and whether the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration properly monitored safety concerns about the company. The agency's new chief? He's David L. Strickland, a former lawyer and senior staff member for Rockefeller's Senate committee. (A spokeswoman for Rockefeller told the Washington Post this week that the senator fought ""for good-paying manufacturing jobs but never shirks from holding those same companies' feet to the fire when it comes to safety and consumer protection."") Lawmakers are also the beneficiaries of money Toyota has directly donated to their political campaigns. Although Toyota itself cannot create a political action committee through which to make donations to politicians -- foreign firms are banned from doing so -- the U.S.-based Toyota distributor, Gulf States Toyota, faces no such restriction. Gulf States Toyota's political action committee has contributed at least $1,000 to each of 10 federal political candidates this election cycle after making donations to 29 federal candidates during the 2008 election cycle. Included on this list -- for 2007 and 2008 -- are members of the congressional committees investigating Toyota: Reps. Joe Barton, R-Texas; Gene Green, D-Texas; Charles Melancon, D-Louisiana; Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana; and John Sullivan, R-Oklahoma. Since 1999, Toyota employees in the United States have also individually donated more than $100,000 to congressional members. Taken separately, these associations may not amount to a smoking gun of profit and politics over people. But together, they represent a ruck of entanglements and potential conflicts of interest that must be adequately checked by the press. And the public must be mindful of these ties, lest they deliver on their potential to render safety subservient to a financial bottom line. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sheila Krumholz and Dave Levinthal.","Toyota hearings were a major event on Capitol Hill .

"(CNN) -- Johnny Lee Wicks, 66, was carrying a 12-gauge shotgun when he walked Monday into the Lloyd D. George Federal Courthouse and started firing, shooting court security officer Stanley W. Cooper and a deputy U.S. marshal, said Kevin Favreau, special agent in charge of the FBI's Las Vegas office. The two victims returned fire, driving Wicks out of the courthouse, and pursued him into the street along with two other marshals and three other court security officers -- a total of seven officers, authorities said. During the ensuing exchange of gunfire, Wicks fired a total of five rounds, authorities said, while the officers fired a total of 81. Wicks was shot in the stomach and fatally shot in the head, Favreau said. Cooper later died of his injuries. The deputy marshal's condition has stabilized and he was released from the hospital, said Gary Orton, U.S. marshal for Nevada. Authorities said the deputy marshal's name would be released after he recovers further. Orton said he was about 48 and had more than two decades of service with the U.S. marshals. Wicks had a lengthy criminal history, Favreau said, including arrests for murder in Memphis, Tennessee, in the 1970s; arrests for drug charges in the 1980s in Memphis; a 1995 arrest for sexual assault and domestic violence in Sacramento, California; and a 1996 arrest for robbery and domestic violence, also in Sacramento. It was unclear whether those arrests resulted in convictions, and authorities did not have information on whether Wicks had been incarcerated. In 2008, Wicks filed a race discrimination and civil rights claim against the Social Security Administration, alleging he was denied full benefits because he was African-American, according to court documents. A federal judge -- located in the Las Vegas courthouse -- ruled against him in September. Those who knew Wicks told authorities he had an ""overwhelming anger"" toward the government, Favreau said. However, he had made no threats that police were aware of, and investigators do not know why Monday was the day his rage boiled over. Evidence indicates Wicks intentionally set his apartment on fire about 5:05 a.m. Monday, then walked three miles to the courthouse, Favreau said, where the shooting took place about 8 a.m. Witnesses said Wicks was clad in black when he walked inside, pulled out the shotgun and opened fire. Police believe he acted alone. ""An act such as this cannot be predicted,"" said Doug Gillespie, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. He and other officials praised Wicks' victims for acting quickly to repel the gunman. Cooper, a former sergeant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police who had been a contract security officer since 1994, ""dedicated his entire life to protecting others,"" Gillespie said. ""He was not only a good man, he was a great man."" Cooper was able to fire one round while pursing Wicks, authorities said. The sheriff said he did not know whether funeral arrangements had been made for Cooper. Wicks fired three rounds inside the courthouse and two others outside, said Las Vegas police Lt. Lou Roberts. The last two were fired when Wicks turned to face the pursuing officers, and he was fatally shot shortly afterward, Roberts said. He died among the bushes in front of an old school that once housed a temporary police headquarters. Wicks had more rounds available, Roberts said, but would not elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation. The officers involved in the firefight have been placed on administrative leave, authorities said -- standard procedure for officer-involved shootings. Witnesses to the exchange of gunfire Monday estimated at least 40 shots were fired. A one-minute, 13-second video clip posted on YouTube includes at least 45 gunshots, many in rapid succession. Nicholas Gramenos, who recorded the clip, said he was leaving the courthouse when the shooting erupted. Another witness, Bobby Scottland, told CNN the shots ""sounded like popcorn."" Cones were scattered across Las Vegas Boulevard Monday evening, with each representing a slug or shell casing from the gun battle.","NEW: Suspect Johnny Wicks had a lengthy rap sheet .

"(CNN) -- The search will continue until at least Friday night for 16 people missing since Thursday morning when a helicopter carrying them to an offshore oil platform ditched in the Atlantic Ocean off Newfoundland, Canadian officials said. A helicopter made an emergency crash landing off Newfoundland en route to Hibernia oil field on Thursday. One survivor, identified as Robert Decker, was found and taken to a hospital, but efforts to find more survivors had proven fruitless, said Maj. Denis McGuire of the Rescue Coordination Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The body of one person, who has not been identified publicly, also was pulled from the water. There were 18 people aboard the helicopter when it went down, about 30 nautical miles from St. John's. ""All we've got is the debris field,"" McGuire said. ""There are no indications of any [more] survivors, but the search will continue."" The water is 400 feet deep at the site where the helicopter hit the water, he said. Helicopters and ships were scouring the debris field Thursday evening, and search-and-rescue technicians were planning to use night-vision goggles and flares overnight. The debris filled a six-mile area, said Jeri Grychowski of the Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax. Officials became aware that the helicopter was having problems shortly after 9:10 a.m., when the pilot declared a mayday, McGuire said. ""They declared their mayday and then they hit the water or landed in the water approximately eight minutes later,"" he said. About 25 minutes later, a helicopter arrived and discovered the survivor, the body, the overturned helicopter and two empty life rafts, he said. Those aboard should have have been wearing survival suits that would have kept them dry and were equipped with lights and personal locator beacons, but the suits have not helped searchers. ""We have not received any signals whatsoever,"" McGuire said. The suits theoretically would allow wearers to survive 24 hours in the freezing waters -- or until about 9 a.m. Friday -- but the search effort was to continue well beyond that. ""We will continue to search until there's absolutely no chance that any survivors will be located,"" he said. ""Until last light [Friday]."" At that time, based on water temperature and the size of the search area, officials will decide whether to continue the effort, he said. Early in the day, high winds and seas hampered the search, but by late afternoon, the weather had improved, though seas were still about 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) and winds were at about 40 knots (46 mph). The survivor was taken to the Health Sciences Center in St. John's, Newfoundland. The helicopter had been heading to the Hibernia offshore oil platform when it went down in what Grychowski called a controlled emergency crash landing. The pilot reported some technical malfunctions before the crash and radioed that he was turning the chopper around, said Rick Burt of Cougar Helicopters -- the operator of the S-92 Sikorsky copter.","NEW: Search to continue ""until there's absolutely no chance"" of locating survivors .

"Liancourt, Haiti (CNN) -- She gingerly walked from the car and shuffled up the small hill, her eyes welled in tears. The first sight of her daughter's grave was too much for Beatrice Elan to bear. She began to scream and flail. ""Anna, Anna, Anna,"" Elan cried, while two family members struggled to restrain her. On Thursday, Elan's 11-year-old daughter, Anaika St. Louis, became another victim of a tragedy unforgiving to both the old and the young. Just hours earlier that day, CNN brought Anaika's story to the world. For 48 hours she had lain trapped under the rubble since a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on Tuesday. Her right leg was crushed and pinned by a steel beam. ""My lord God, save me!"" she cried. Her screams were chilling. Share your tributes to victims of the Haiti earthquake . No rescue teams could be found. Caring neighbors and family desperately tried to cut through steel using a hacksaw. CNN correspondent Ivan Watson and photojournalist Dominic Swann, climbed up into the crevice that trapped Anaika, and brought her water and granola bars. She reached out to hold their hands when she was scared. Volunteers gave Anaika a pair of glasses to protect her eyes from the dirt. ""She spent 3 days in the hole. All that time saying, 'My God, I don't want to die. I want to live,"" said her aunt Etiana Jean-Baptiste. On Thursday night, neighbors found a power saw and a portable generator. Soon after, Anaika was free. But a happy ending eluded this story. Anaika was rushed to a doctor, who could only offer some mild pain killers. The doctor told the family that they had to get Anaika to a hospital about three hours away. Her uncle said Anaika was bleeding internally. She was so incredibly strong, he said, and was willing to have her leg amputated, to live. ""She say, 'Thank you, God. Because He save my life,"" said Rodreffe Jean-Baptiste, in broken English. ""If I lose my feet. I always had my life,"" he recalled his niece saying. But before the night was over, Anaika was gone. Anaika's family called her the ""little lawyer,"" because she wanted to study law one day. She sang in the choir at church and at school, and seemed to have found a special place in each of her family members' heart. Her aunt said she was just beautiful. ""She said ... 'Bring me a Bible. There is a psalm I like a lot, which is Psalm 23,'"" recalled her aunt, Etiana Jean-Baptiste. ""She spent all her time reading the psalm. She said, 'My God, come help me.'"" Anaika's funeral was held in a church in Liancourt on Friday night and Anaika was buried -- wearing a Girl Scouts uniform and a veil in Liancourt. Liancourt, about two hours away from the devastated capital of Port-au-Prince, escaped the quake's fury. This is where Anaika's family has taken refuge -- and where they mourn the passing of a little girl with an angel's voice.","Anaika St. Louis dies after being rescued .

"(CNN) -- It has become a commonplace that it is hard to comprehend the disaster in Haiti. If so, and if we hope to provide Haitians with anything like the help that they need, then we must understand where our minds fail us. One problem that we do not yet face is having our compassion numbed by the sheer magnitude of the calamity. Indeed, it has evoked a deep visceral response, as we see graphic images of individual suffering on a background of mass devastation. When our local tea store is devoting 20 percent of sales to relief and cell phone donations keep pouring in, the scope of the tragedy is mobilizing, not paralyzing. The threat to our compassion comes, rather, from feeling ineffective. We risk that failure if we cannot grasp the realities facing Haiti. Here, we face two deep mental challenges. One is that we must struggle to comprehend how many interdependent threads of Haiti's social fabric have been ripped apart. People lost family, friends and communities in an instant. Children were orphaned in a nation already struggling to care for many orphans. Hospitals, factories and government agencies disappeared. Essential aid organizations lost brave people and resources. Communications and transportation were ruined, including the port that brings almost all goods into the nation. Here, imagining ourselves in the Haitians' plight might help. Can we imagine trying to recover, if our country faced the most massive disaster in its history, without work, food, medicine, transportation, commerce or government? The second challenge is that our minds also struggle to reason quantitatively about events beyond our normal experience. Here, a back-of-the-envelope calculation might help. Assume, plausibly, that everything that 3 million Haitians need must be brought in from outside their country for a period of time. Assume that each Haitian needs 5 pounds of goods per day (food, water, medical supplies, soap, cooking fuel, the gasoline needed to distribute these supplies and more). Assume that everything must be flown in (at least until the port can be reopened). That means 15 million pounds (7,500 tons) of airfreight per day. If a cargo plane can carry 75 tons, then that means 100 flights per day, or one plane landing every 15 minutes, then having its goods unloaded and distributed to victims across the country. One way to understand what those numbers mean is by analogy. The Berlin Airlift was another crisis that required a massive mobilization to supply an isolated population in desperate need. Berlin was cut off by a hostile power, rather than by an ocean. It was devastated by war rather than by an earthquake. Its 2 million citizens needed roughly 5,000 tons of goods per day, delivered through limited entry points, over distances comparable to those of Haiti's island neighbors. The airlift required an unprecedented logistics operation, which Soviet and East German authorities believed impossible. It encountered serious organizational problems in coordinating American forces among themselves and with our allies. It drew resources from other military theaters. It was enormously expensive, in both money and the lives of aviators. In some ways, supplying Haiti is easier. Technology is vastly improved and the world much wealthier. But in other ways, supplying Haiti is even more difficult than the Berlin Airlift. Berlin was occupied territory, under Allied military rule; while Haiti has little functioning government, and those trying to help are struggling to work out their division of labor. If we are not thinking in terms of an effort as massive and risky as the Berlin Airlift, then we have not gotten our minds around the problem. Unless we grasp the complexity and magnitude of the task, then we may be expecting brave, dedicated relief workers to do the impossible -- and be disappointed when they cannot do it all. As a nation, we may fail to support our leaders in providing the sustained resources that the mission requires. If our collective imagination and our sense of history fail us, then we will not achieve the results that our compassion demands -- and will fail Haiti and its people in their long, difficult road to recovery. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Baruch Fischhoff and Kathleen Tierney.","The earthquake devastated Haiti's families, social networks and economy, authors say .

"New York (CNN) -- ""Unauthorized and unprofessional"" is how an internal memo describes the conduct of an air traffic controller, who allegedly allowed his two young children to speak with pilots on an air traffic control frequency, and his supervisor, who allegedly allowed it to happen. The memo, dated February 25, was written after the facilities manager for the air traffic control tower at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport learned about the incident, a source who has seen the memo told CNN. ""The display of professionalism in the past by the control personnel at this facility has been exemplary,"" the memo said. ""However, a lapse in judgment for what may seem a minor transgression diminishes our credibility and slights the high standards of professionalism."" It was not immediately clear what prompted the manager to write the memo or how he found out about the incident, the source said. The incidents occurred on succeeding days last month at JFK, the Federal Aviation Administration said this week, and the controller and the supervisor have been placed on paid administrative leave. ""We have an incredible team of professionals who safely control our nation's skies every single day. This kind of behavior does not reflect the true caliber of our workforce,"" FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in the statement Wednesday. Babbitt was referring to the February 16 incident involving the controller's young son, who is heard in a recording -- posted on liveatc.net -- clearing a JetBlue flight for takeoff and later speaking to an apparent Aeromexico flight. Later, an FAA official, who asked not to be identified because of the ongoing investigation, said the controller brought his daughter into the same tower the following day, and the child was allowed to talk with pilots of two planes. A separate source said the supervisor ""should be making sure that things like this don't happen."" Yet another source familiar with the investigation said the two children are twins. The controller who brought the children to work later reported that he had done so, the source said. The controller and supervisor involved are veteran employees, the official said. Dave Pascoe owner of the Web site where the recording of the air traffic communications is posted, told CNN he thinks the attention the incident has drawn is ""ridiculous"" and it has been ""blown out of proportion."" In the recording, a child says, ""JetBlue 171, cleared for takeoff."" A man then tells the plane, ""Here's what you get, guys, when the kids are out of school."" The pilot chuckles and says, ""Wish I could bring my kid to work."" The same pilot later tells the child, ""Awesome job."" During the recording, which is dated February 17, the child also speaks to an apparent Aeromexico flight. A recording from the following day, when the daughter was reportedly in the tower, also was posted on the Web site. FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown later said the incident took place about 7:30 p.m. February 16. Pascoe said most people ""in the aviation community felt like this was (not) anything more than a noble thing, that a father would take his kid to work."" ""It was one incident where a kid was up in the control tower,"" he said. ""If you know anything about aviation, you know that the air traffic control towers are highly supervised. ... A father was taking a child to work and let the kid clear planes for takeoff and now the world thinks it's an unsafe place."" The FAA has suspended all unofficial visits to air traffic control operational areas during its investigation into the incident. Babbitt has directed a team to review air traffic control policies and procedures related to facility visitors. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing controllers, issued a statement, saying its members ""do not condone this type of behavior in any way."" CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Memo says conduct of control personnel in the past ""has been exemplary""

"(CNN) -- When Bertrand Piccard came up with his audacious plan to fly around the world in an aircraft powered only by the sun, he found that airplane manufacturers were skeptical such a plane could be built. So who built the first model of ""Solar Impulse,"" Piccard's $72-million solar-powered craft? A company that makes ships. Piccard, who won the first transatlantic balloon race and commanded the first balloon flight around the world, told CNN, ""Each time we asked the aeronautical industry to build that airplane, they told us it's impossible. We cannot make an airplane so light and so big. So who did we ask for some help? A boat manufacturer. They had no idea it was impossible, so they built the pieces in carbon fiber and now we have an airplane."" The plane is made by the Swiss company Decision SA, which made the America's Cup-winning Alinghi. ""People put limitations on their creativity, believing they have to rely on what they know and what they have done,"" Piccard says. He sees the Solar Impulse venture as a way to dramatically demonstrate that it's possible to make a sharp break with the past -- in this case, by showing that renewable energy can replace fossil fuel. ""A lot of industries say we have a society based on oil dependency, so let's continue. ... We know how to deal with oil. The result is General Motors and Chrysler going bankrupt. It's a typical example of people who did not make the turnaround early enough. If GM made engines with much lower fuel consumption, they would not have gone bankrupt."" ""We have to get rid of certainties, habits, paradigms, common assumptions,"" Piccard says. ""These are the limits to creativity."" Piccard, who is 51, spoke about his new venture at the TED Global conference in July 2009 and elaborated on it in a recent interview with CNN.com. CNN: Why are you interested in attempting to fly around the world in a solar airplane? Bertrand Piccard: My life and the life of my family has to do with exploration, with adventure. My grandfather was the first man in the stratosphere, and my father was the first to touch the deepest point in the ocean. ... For me adventure and exploration is something in the blood. So that's why I flew around the world in a balloon in 1999. ... It was considered to be impossible, I said, ""Let's try it."" I succeeded after two failures, and I came to the middle of my life, thinking now that adventure has to go on, and a pioneering sprit has to go on, but how can the adventure be useful -- not a personal dream like flying around the world in a balloon -- but really useful? I came up with idea of a solar airplane flying around the world with no fuel -- that would be a beautiful message in terms of technology, the energy of the future and the environment. CNN: So what is the status of the effort right now? Piccard: So the airplane is built. The first flight was achieved on the third of December and in the spring and summer this year, we're going to make the high-altitude flights and the cycle of [flying] one day, one night and one day. We take off in the morning. We climb to 27,000 feet, and at the same time we load the batteries and run the engines on solar power only. Then we fly through the night on the batteries in order to reach the next sunrise and continue the following day. So this makes a complete cycle, with no fuel. When this will be achieved, we will build a second airplane that will be able to cross the Atlantic and fly around the world. The first airplane has to prove that it's possible to fly a complete cycle, one day, one night, one day. ... This little airplane is not a Piper or Cessna with a couple of solar cells. It's a really high-tech carbon fiber airplane which is 200 feet in wingspan. It weighs 1.6 tons. So it has basically the wingspan of a jumbo jet 747, it has the weight of a little car, and on average it can fly with the energy of a little motorcycle -- which is only provided by the sun. ... If an airplane like this can fly day and night with no fuel, then nobody can say in the future that it is impossible to use the same technology for cars, for heating systems, for air conditioning, for electronics and so on. CNN: How fast will the plane travel? Piccard: The plane will travel very slowly. Otherwise it would take too much energy. The average speed will be 40 knots, roughly 55 miles per hour. CNN: And so a flight around the world will take how long? Piccard: It would take around 20 days and because there is only one pilot at a time in the cockpit, we're going to land every five days and change the pilot. ... When Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic in 1927, he was alone on board, and the airplane was full of gasoline and nobody thought than an airplane could take passengers over the Atlantic. And 30 years later, airplanes were taking 200 passengers across the Atlantic. So now we start the same thing over again, but with no fuel. We need an airplane that is very big, that is very light, and full of batteries, lithium polymer batteries, and it can take only one person. We have to see afterward if the technology can improve -- and transport people. But our goal is more to bring about a revolution in behavior than to bring a revolution in aviation. The goal is really to have people on ground who will follow this adventure and will start to use the same technologies, to save energy and to rely on renewable energy. CNN: What is the biggest technical challenge in building this airplane? Piccard: There are several challenges. One challenge is to have this airplane light enough despite its huge wingspan. The construction has to be done with carbon fiber with completely new technologies. The structure of Solar Impulse ... is 10 times lighter than the normal glider. It's a breakthrough in construction technologies. The second challenge is energy. It has to fly through the night with a battery that has been loaded the previous day. So it has to be extremely energy efficient. Another challenge is that it's difficult to ... control such a huge airplane that flies so slowly and is so light. CNN: Do you intend to be one of the pilots? Piccard: I will be one of the pilots, and Andre Borschberg will also be a pilot. CNN: What's the greatest risk on the flight? Piccard: The greatest risk is bad weather. If we cannot remain in sunny areas, we may have to land somewhere or ditch in the ocean. But we have very, very good weathermen, and I'm confident that it will work. CNN: So you will not be flying above the cloud cover? Piccard: We will be flying above the cloud cover, but during the night we have to fly lower because the efficiency of the batteries on the market is not yet sufficient for us to stay at high altitudes. So during the day we climb to 27,000 feet and then during the night, we go down to 10,000 feet to save energy. When we have sunlight, we go up again. Which means that in the morning we absolutely have to be clear of clouds, otherwise we cannot go up again. CNN: Why can't you go up through clouds? Piccard: Because we will have almost empty batteries every morning ... so if we have clouds in morning, we cannot load the batteries to go back up. ... This will be the big weather challenge for the team. CNN: Where will you land the plane? Piccard: We need an airport with a large runway. We don't need a long runway. We'll have one stop in the U.S. ... We have not yet decided where it will be. We'll have five legs, and each leg will be five days and five nights on average. So we'll stop in China, Hawaii, the U.S. mainland, Europe and one stop probably in the Arab Emirates and then back in China. CNN: What's your projected date for takeoff? Piccard: The schedule is like this: In 2010, we fly day and night. In 2011, we'll make international flights, several days and nights. In 2012, we'll cross the Atlantic, and in 2012 or 2013, we'll go around the world. CNN: How much does this project cost and who's paying for it? Piccard: The entire budget is 100 million U.S. dollars, coming from private sponsors. CNN: Do you have children? Piccard: Yes I have three kids. CNN: And are they adventurous? Piccard: Well, they fly with me with hang gliders, with balloons, paragliders, micro-lights. They like it very much. But I'd say they're a little too young to show really what they're going to do, they're 15, 17 and 19. ... CNN: Are you hoping your children will take on adventures the way you have? Piccard: No, I hope they will take on the challenge of improving the quality of life, bringing a pioneering spirit and new ways to think about political issues, environmental issues, technological issues, charity issues. In the 20th century, the heroes were the ones who went to the North Pole, the South Pole, Everest, the bottom of the ocean, space and the moon. In the 21st century I think the heroes will be the people who will improve the quality of life, fight poverty and introduce more sustainability.","Bertrand Piccard is a ballooning record-setter; wants to fly around the world in a solar plane .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Two Iranians who were caught up in the waves of arrests that followed the disputed presidential elections in June have accused their captors of raping them. By telling his story, Ibrahim Sharifi says, he ""committed social suicide so this incident wouldn't happen to others."" An Iranian man and a woman made the allegations in separate interviews with CNN. Both said they fled to Turkey from Iran after claiming to have been threatened by Iranian security services. While CNN does not normally use the names of alleged rape victims, their names are included here with their permission. CNN could not independently confirm their accounts. But the testimony of one of the alleged rape victims, Ibrahim Sharifi, was revealed last month by a prominent Iranian opposition leader who claimed to have gathered at least four accounts of sexual assault this summer in Iranian prisons. Sharifi's allegations were also included in a report published last week by two Western human rights organizations investigating reports of abuse in Iranian prisons. ""What we're encountering are numerous accounts of brutality, poor treatment, even torture, serious beatings, and a couple of cases, as you know, of alleged sexual assault -- rape,"" said Joe Stork, Middle East deputy director for Human Rights Watch. The Iranian government has launched two investigations into the allegations. Iran's judiciary concluded there was no evidence of rape. A parliamentary fact-finding committee is still working on the issue. Repeated calls by CNN to get reaction from Iranian officials to the claims of the alleged victims did not result in a response. ""Take him and get him pregnant"" Twenty-four-year-old Ibrahim Sharifi is a university student from Tehran who campaigned actively on the Internet for opposition presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi in the run-up to the controversial June 12 vote. When incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared winner, Sharifi joined the throngs of angry protesters in the streets who accused the government of rigging the election. On June 22, Sharifi said, he was kidnapped, handcuffed, blindfolded and stuffed into a car by three unknown men while he was walking home from language lessons at the Italian Embassy. He said they drove him to an unknown location, where he was stripped to his underwear. There, he said, he endured several days of beatings and mock executions alongside other male prisoners, all the time tightly blindfolded.  Watch Ibrahim Sharifi describe being tortured and sexually assaulted » . ""They took us and they put a noose around my neck in a way that I was forced to stand on my tiptoes, unable to breathe,"" Sharifi said. ""Somebody was constantly telling us ... 'You have received the oral sentence to be hanged, we are just waiting for the written order.'"" ""There was the stink of piss and blood. It smelled terrible,"" Sharifi recalled. ""I was beaten so much I didn't have any energy left to cry."" On the fourth day of his detention, during one of these mock executions, Sharifi said he finally snapped. ""I said, if you want to kill us, go ahead. Why do you play such games with us? And the response was a kick in my stomach that made me fall."" Sharifi said his captors kicked him repeatedly in the stomach until he started vomiting blood. He showed a pink scar on his belly from a previous car accident that he said was torn open by the blows. ""Then the guy told someone else, 'Take him and get him pregnant,'"" Sharifi said, his voice cracking with emotion. ""They tied my hands to the wall and tied my legs, and then did that thing to me. While doing it, he was telling me, ""You, who cannot even defend your you-know-what, you wanted to conduct a revolution?"" Sharifi said he blacked out during the rape and woke up later, handcuffed to a hospital bed. A day later, he said, his captors dumped him, blindfolded, on the side of a highway. ""I was raped. Raped four times"" Twenty-one-year-old Maryam Sabri spoke to CNN by telephone from a Turkish city where, like Sharifi, she is waiting for the U.N. High Commission for Refugees to process her request for asylum. She said she was arrested by men in plainclothes on July 30 while attending a ceremony at the grave of Neda Agha-Soltan, the Iranian woman whose death was captured by cell phone camera after she was shot during a protest in the streets of Tehran. ""When I asked them where was I being taken to, why have you arrested me, who are you?"" their response was a constant slap on my face,"" Sabri recounted. Sabri said she was interrogated several times after being detained. The sexual assault began during the third interrogation, she said. ""He said, 'OK, you wanted your vote back? Now I'm going to give back your vote."" It was then that I was raped. Raped four times,"" she said. ""My hands were tied and my eyes were blindfolded,"" she said. ""He threw me on the ground while pressing my throat with one hand, and both my legs were under the weight of his legs so I couldn't move at all."" Sabri said the last time she was raped, her assailant took off her blindfold and said he would release her on the condition that, once out of prison, she remain in contact with him and cooperate with him. Several days after her release, Sabri said the alleged rapist, described as a man in his late 30s with light eyes and several days' worth of stubble, began calling her on her cell phone and threatening her. She fled Iran several weeks later and applied for refugee status in Turkey. Rape as punishment? Human rights organizations Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran have expressed alarm about the reports of sexual assault in prison. ""The issue is, are the authorities using rape as a tool to pressure people, to punish people?"" asked Stork, the Middle East deputy director for Human Rights Watch. ""In the case of the one individual, Ibrahim Sharifi, it appears it was a punishment."" Iran's parliament and judiciary launched investigations into the allegations. But last month, Iranian security forces raided the offices of Karrubi, the opposition presidential candidate and longtime advocate for prisoners' rights who first publicized the rape allegations. The offices of another opposition candidate, Mir Hossein Moussavi, were also raided in September. Iran's powerful conservative parliamentary speaker, Ali Larijani, said a special committee of Iran's parliament, or Majlis, conducted a ""precise and comprehensive inquiry"" into the treatment at Tehran's Evin and Kahrizak prisons and found ""no cases of rape or sexual abuse,"" government-funded Press TV reported last month. Larijani accused Karrubi of spreading ""sheer lies."" However, not everyone was persuaded by the investigation. ""The Iranian authorities appear more intent on finding the identities of those who claim to have been tortured by security officials than in carrying out an impartial investigation,"" said Amnesty International Secretary General Irene Khan. Sabri and Sharifi are members of a growing population of expatriate Iranian dissidents in Turkey. Both face an uncertain future as refugees here and worry about the safety of their families back in Tehran. Sabri claims her father was arrested after she first went public with her rape testimony on the U.S. government-funded network Voice of America. Sharifi, meanwhile, said that before he fled Iran, government investigators accused him of lying about his prison experience for money ... charges he angrily denies. ""I broke a taboo in Iran,"" he said, weeping. ""I sat in front of the camera and committed social suicide so this incident wouldn't happen to others."" ""I want the whole world to know that Iran's problems are not only limited to the nuclear issue,"" he said. ""The Iranian regime plays games with other countries of the world. It plays the same games with its own nation and people.""","Two expatriate Iranians allege rapes in graphic detail .

"(CNN) -- The Canadian government hopes to overturn a decision granting refugee status to a white South African who says he would face persecution at home, a spokesman for Canada's immigration minister said Friday. The Immigration and Refugee Board recently granted refugee status to Brandon Huntley, 31, a South African native who has been living illegally in Canada. The board decided to let him live and work legally in Canada after Huntley argued he had been the victim of racial violence and discrimination in South Africa. The board operates independently of the Canadian government. The ruling African National Congress in South Africa blasted the decision as racist and said it would ""only serve to perpetuate racism.""  Watch how the South African government has condemned the ruling » . Now the Canadian government plans to ask federal courts to overturn the decision, said Alykhan Velshi, a spokesman for Canadian Immigration Minister Jason Kenney. ""It's important to stress that this isn't the minister's decision nor that of the government,"" Velshi said in a statement Friday. ""It was a decision taken by the quasi-judicial, independent Immigration and Refugee Board. I will leave it to them to defend the quality of their decisions."" He declined further comment ""because the matter is now before the courts."" A spokesman for the Immigration and Refugee Board earlier also had declined to comment on the grounds that refugee claims are confidential. However, a member of the board's Refugee Protection Division, William Davis, has written in The Toronto Star that the board found that Huntley's case demonstrated ""a picture of indifference and inability or unwillingness"" by South Africa to protect ""white South Africans from persecution by African South Africans."" About 79 percent of South Africans are black; 9.6 percent are white. Huntley's attorney, Russell Kaplan, said his client had been attacked seven times by black South Africans who called him a ""settler"" and a ""white dog."" ""In each instance, there were racially motivated remarks that were made -- that's what distinguishes this case from ordinary criminality,"" Kaplan said. The African National Congress has a different view. ""We find the claim by Huntley to have been attacked seven times by Africans due to his skin color -- without any police intervention -- sensational and alarming,"" the ANC said in a statement this week. Kaplan is a human rights lawyer in Canada who left South Africa 20 years ago to escape the apartheid government's discrimination against black South Africans. ""Twenty years later, we have this case that involves the exact opposite,"" he said this week. Newspaper clippings were presented as evidence of life in South Africa during the August 18 hearing, South Africa's The Times reported. Kaplan's sister, who came to Canada last year, testified about ""the torture and murder"" of their brother, who was killed by robbers in 1997, the newspaper reported. The ANC said the current government under President Jacob Zuma is committed to fighting crime ""regardless of color or creed."" The South African government would have preferred Canada seek its view ""before such a decision was made,"" South African Foreign Affairs spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa told The Times. ""Quite clearly, the allegations are as preposterous as they are laughable -- which they would be if they were not serious,"" he told the newspaper.","Brandon Huntley says he faced racial violence and discrimination in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Philippines President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared martial law beginning Friday night in the southern province of Maguindanao, where 57 people were killed last week, an army spokesman told CNN Saturday. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said martial law -- under which police can make arrests without a warrant -- went into effect at 9 p.m. Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. Brawner said the measure was invoked to impose peace on the region after the unrest, which led to troops being mobilized. ""Life is to resume normally and martial law is established to prevent new violence, with troops on the ground monitoring any possible violence breakout,"" he said. ""But the civilian government will be running the affairs of the province, not a military governor."" Military police have detained three brothers and their father on suspicion of involvement in the unrest: Akmad Ampatuan, the vice governor of Maguindanao; Anwar Ampatuan, the mayor of Sherif Auguak, Maguindanao's capital; and Zaldy Ampatuan, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the patriarch, became ill and was hospitalized after he too was taken in. ""Local government will function, it will prevent armed groups from wreaking havoc ... and it will allow the officials to search and find the guilty parties,"" Brawner said. Security forces on Friday searched the home of Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay and son of the provincial governor of Maguindanao, according to Brawner. Authorities say Andal Ampatuan Jr. directed the November 23 politically motivated killings. Weapons were found in the house, Brawner said. On Tuesday, Philippine authorities charged Ampatuan and other suspects with 25 counts of murder in the killings. Still more suspects were taken into custody Friday. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. The National Bureau of Investigation has moved a third witness to Manila for questioning, the Philippines News Agency reported Thursday. ""At the moment, we are interviewing the witness, so that we would know what he knows about the incident in Maguindanao,"" NBI Director Nestor Mantaring said. The witness claimed to have been at the site during the massacre. ""He is very vital,"" Mantaring said. ""From what I know ... he knows a lot of information regarding the incident."" Among the victims in the massacre were the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan, the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Witnesses and local officials have blamed the younger Ampatuan, a longtime ally of the Philippines president and a known warlord. They said the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging him in the May gubernatorial election. Also killed were a dozen journalists who had accompanied the women. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation. Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims. CNN's Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","NEW: Martial law invoked to impose peace on the region after unrest .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Dressed head to toe in black, designer Isaac Mizrahi is wearing an outfit that seems to contradict his personality -- and his usual fashion flair. Isaac Mizrahi has earned four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. ""I always start with color when I'm designing things. Always. If the color is right, I feel better,"" he touts on his Web site. But Mizrahi has an explanation for his less than colorful attire on a recent visit to CNN Center in Atlanta. ""We have this very quick trip, and we have to go right back and there's no time to pack and we can't check luggage ... so I focused it to black, gray and white."" It's just one more style tip you can pick up from Mizrahi's new book ""How to Have Style"" (Gotham). Despite the slightly audacious title, Mizrahi, who has won four awards from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, has earned the right to tell women how to dress. For five years, the New York fashion designer has been selling low-priced clothing and home furnishings at Target. But with his new book comes a new job -- as the creative director of Liz Claiborne. CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: You started in acting at the High School of the Performing Arts. How do you combine that love and your love for design? Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater. I think that fashion is a form of entertainment. And I think that these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something. Like women say, ""Oh, that's a brand name I associate with because I've worn it before. I love it. It seems to fulfill who I am really easily."" Whatever it is, she knows that it just makes her life really easy so she associates with it, you know? And in the end, I am like this personality that represents that.  Watch Mizrahi talk about his new book » . But more than that, I have designs [in] the entertainment business. There's a movie called ""Unzipped"" about me that was a really successful movie. I had two TV series. I design costumes constantly for theater and ballet and opera. So to me it's all one big world. It's seamless to me. CNN: What's your daily schedule like? It has to be crazy with all that you do. Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that. There's a base to it. I wake up, I go swimming every day, and I eat the same breakfast almost every single day. But when I get to work is when it changes up. Some days I work in the showroom; some days I work in the design room; some days I actually work in my own private studio, where I just do sketches and sketches and sketches. Other days I work in the TV studio taping segments and my Web show. I don't really love travel. I feel like it really disrupts what I love doing most, which is this creation, you know what I mean? When I finally let myself enjoy it, I can enjoy traveling. But it takes a great agony for me to separate from New York City and my studios and the people that I work with. CNN: Say you're walking down the street. What's the most common style error that you see in people? Mizrahi: I see a lot, a lot, a lot of bad hair. I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair. You know people have excuses for bad shoes -- because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking -- but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair. Because you know what? There's a hat, if your hair is really that bad that day. But I always think that women should be encouraged to spend a lot of money on their hair. It's like you should spend your most money ... on your hair. You'd think I had a chain of hair salons, but I don't. [Laughter]. CNN: What about in home furnishing? You do a line for Target that's ending this year. What's the most common mistake people make there? Mizrahi: You know what it is with people? I think people get lazy when it comes to being at home -- they leave things around. I like to think about cabinets. I like to put things away as much as possible. It's like salt shakers on the table? No. You put the salt shakers in a cabinet, and the table looks so much better when it's plain. You know what I mean? And people just think that bad flowers are better than nothing, but I disagree with that. I think that nothing is way better than bad flowers. You either have gorgeous, gorgeous flowers, or you have no flowers. Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table. That's awful, but it's true. CNN: How has your personal style evolved over time? Mizrahi: It's gotten a lot quieter, my personal style. I used to dress, dress, dress, dress, dress, and I don't know, I dress in a very particular way now and it's almost like clockwork. And every once in a while I break out and do something crazy. CNN: Can you describe your personality for me, and how it affects your style? Mizrahi: I don't know. It's very hard to describe one's personality. I can't say about my personality, but I like to think that I'm very exposed to what's going on out there in the world culturally, and that's what influences my design. It's kind of like here's the 360 degrees of what's going on [in] the world culturally, you know? Socioeconomically, culturally, and here's my response to it. Here's what the clothes look like; here's what you should be wearing. And it's kind of like a wonderful edge, you're standing, and yet there's room enough in there for your own interpretation or to move in one direction or another. Oh! Here's a good description of my personality: claustrophobic. I am very claustrophobic. I don't like to commit to one thing necessarily, but when I do commit to it, it's whole and complete.","Designer Isaac Mizrahi moving from Target to creative director at Liz Claiborne .

"Hanford Nuclear Site, Washington (CNN) -- The federal government has set aside nearly $2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up Washington state's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site, once the center of the country's Cold War plutonium production. That is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received, which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent. The facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south-central Washington, an area roughly half the size of Rhode Island. It was built in the 1940s as part of the ""Manhattan Project"" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II. Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built. During the Cold War, Hanford became a main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program. Decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being one of the most contaminated nuclear sites in the Western Hemisphere. Today, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town, and those involved in the cleanup say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds. There are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge. The stimulus money will reduce the cleanup time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford. ""It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,"" Peschong said. ""Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the cleanup footprint much sooner, years sooner."" The money has also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time. ""I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world, [I] thought I'd be there for 20 years,"" Gill said. ""We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant, [and] those jobs aren't jobs you just read the paper and get."" Hanford won't be decontaminated quickly. The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear. They break down contaminated equipment through a ""glove box,"" allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead-lined gloves. Each time a worker removes the gloves, a colleague must check for radiation exposure. The large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. A report by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted. The Hanford cleanup ""has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress,"" according to the report. Gerry Pollet, who runs a Hanford watchdog organization, says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste. But he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed. ""You are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the cleanup and the environment,"" said Pollet, who heads Heart of America Northwest. ""They are picking the low-hanging fruit, the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities. But that doesn't cost $2 billion. ""Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds, and you would expect to see real progress for cleanup [to] happen with those dollars."" While debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used, the Tri-Cities area that surrounds the Hanford site -- which includes Richland, Kennewick and Pasco -- is reaping the benefits of the cleanup boom. Hanford began receiving stimulus dollars in March 2009, which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn. The Tri-Cities area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Washington, and the housing market has barely been affected by the recent economic downturn, according to the Tri-Cities Industrial Development Council. Ken Brutzman, who owns a local office furniture store, said his business was ""at a standstill"" last year before the orders from Hanford contractors started pouring in. Brutzman had to hire six temporary workers, two of which he may keep on full time, to deal with the boom in business. ""We are on track to have the best year ever,"" Brutzman said. His business has been in his family for three generations and will likely stay profitable since the Hanford cleanup project is expected to take another 40 years. ""It has my manufacturers raising their eyebrows saying, 'Wow how does that guy do that?'""","$2 billion in stimulus funds set aside to clean up Washington's Hanford nuclear site .

"(CNN) -- Denny's restaurants served about 2 million free Grand Slam breakfasts during its eight-hour promotional giveaway on Tuesday, the company reported Wednesday. Cooks fill the pass-through window with Grand Slam breakfasts Tuesday at a Denny's in Emeryville, California. The company used a commercial during the third quarter of Sunday's Super Bowl to announce it would give away its signature breakfast from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday, and the response was spectacular. Media outlets across North America reported lines of customers stretching outside and around restaurants and strangers crowding together into booths to take advantage of the special. The restaurant chain's approximately 1,500 stores served an average of 130 Grand Slams per hour to customers who waited an average of 60 minutes for their free pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage, the company said. ""We had an extraordinary day,"" Denny's CEO Nelson Marchioli said when the promotion was over. ""We were hoping to reconnect with millions of Americans today, and we did. ""We have received the most heartwarming comments from our servers, our managers and above all our customers. This Free Slam Day has exceeded our expectations in every way."" iReport.com: Miami customers line up for Denny's meal . Denny's doesn't disclose specific cost information, but including the cost of the food, the Super Bowl spot and other production costs, the promotion cost the company roughly $5 million, it said. The Grand Slam started as a baseball-related promotion in Atlanta, Georgia, in the mid-1970s and has been served chainwide since 1977. Its normal price varies by market but averages around $5.99. Denny's said it sells 12.5 million Grand Slams a year. At the normal average price of $5.99, Denny's gave away meals Tuesday with a retail value of $11.9 million.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian authorities will observe and control text messages and e-mails that encourage protesters, an Iranian semi-official news agency reported Friday. Messages that encourage demonstrations will be screened, and organizers of illegal protests will face heavy penalties, the Iranian Labor News Agency reported, citing Tehran Police Chief Ahmadi Mogadham. Iran has clamped down on protests nationwide since mass demonstrations erupted after a disputed presidential election last June. Hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi. Full coverage of the protests in Iran . Many of the protesters e-mailed images worldwide of demonstrators clashing with police, filling the void created by strict government controls on foreign media outlets. Protesters were also active on social networking sites including Twitter and Facebook where one pro-democracy page has more than one quarter of a million members. The mass arrests that followed the protests have led to widespread accusations of authorities torturing and otherwise abusing prisoners. A report released Sunday by an Iranian fact-finding committee found that 147 detainees held after last summer's post-election protests were stuffed into a small room, deprived of adequate food and subjected to other mistreatment, Iranian media reported. The 147 detainees at Kahrizak Detention Center were held with 30 additional inmates for four days in a 750-square-foot room lacking proper ventilation, the parliamentary report found, according to the semi-official Mehr News Agency. The fact-finding committee blamed former Tehran prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi for the decision to send the detainees to Kahrizak -- usually reserved for rapists and other dangerous criminals -- instead of Evin prison, which had informed Mortazavi that it had the space for them. ""Even if Evin prison had been full, it was not justified to send other offenders to this special site,"" the investigation found, according to Mehr. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the Kahrizak facility shut down after reports of mistreatment surfaced. Three prison officials have been charged with premeditated murder in the beating deaths of three imprisoned protesters. According to the investigation, Mortazavi had claimed the three died of meningitis, Mehr said. Sunday's report found that the 147 detainees arrested July 9 suffered ""harsh corporal punishment, humiliating and insulting techniques,"" and other mistreatment, Mehr said. ""The deaths of some detainees were a result of beatings and neglect of the physical condition of the injured by the detention center's officials,"" an excerpt of the report said on the Mehr Web site. The investigation did not reveal evidence of rape or sexual abuse, as alleged by reformist Mehdi Karrubi, Mehr and state-run Press TV reported. Karrubi, a former parliamentary speaker, and fellow reformist Moussavi, had publicly accused the government of allowing rape, torture, wrongful deaths and secret burials of several detainees. Karrubi had been especially vocal about the claims of detainee rape -- even publishing a first-hand account of one alleged victim on his Web site in October. The parliamentary committee met with Karrubi about the claims, but he ""did not present any convincing evidence or reliable documentation of the alleged abuse,"" Mehr said the report found.","Iranian press agency reports Iranian government to screen e-mails, texts .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man accused in an alleged terrorist plot pleaded guilty Thursday to lying to federal agents. Ahmad Wais Afzali, a Muslim cleric and funeral director from the New York borough of Queens, was one of the first people charged in what authorities have described as a plot to detonate bombs on New York subways. Afzali was accused of lying about whether he tipped off suspect Najibullah Zazi that the FBI had been asking questions about his activities. Zazi subsequently pleaded guilty to conspiring to detonate explosives in the United States. On Thursday, Afzali told the court that police had asked him to help provide information about Zazi and two other suspects, Adis Medujanian, and Zarein Ahmedzay. He said he knew Zazi and Medujanian fairly well from when they were teenagers and attended his mosque for prayers and to play volleyball. ""The police interest in these men led me to believe that they were involved in some criminal activity, but I had no idea of its seriousness,"" Afzali said Thursday, at times choking up during his statement. He said he called Zazi on September 11, 2009, a day after he was contacted by authorities. ""I told him that our phone call was being monitored. I told Zazi, 'Don't get involved in Afghanistan garbage and Iraq garbage, that's my advice to you.'"" ""On September 13 ... I was interrogated by FBI agents for the first time. I believed that the FBI was angry at me for calling Zazi,"" he added. ""When I was asked whether I had told Zazi about law enforcement being interested in him, I lied and said I did not. My intention was not to protect Zazi, but to protect myself."" He admitted to repeating the lie during another interview with prosecutors a few days later. ""In doing so, I failed to live up to my obligation to this country, my community, my family, and my religion. I am truly sorry."" Afzali's plea deal reduced the charge from lying to federal agents ""during the course of a terror investigation"" -- which carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison. The basic charge of lying to feds carries a maximum sentence of five years. His plea deal recommends that Afzali be sentenced anywhere from zero to six months in prison. His sentencing hearing was tentatively scheduled for April 8. Under the terms of the agreement, Afzali agreed to leave the United States within 90 days of completing any sentence he receives. Before entering his plea, the 38-year-old imam placed a scarf down on the floor outside the courtroom and prayed. He later told reporters that he ""just signed his death sentence"" by accepting the plea deal, saying he didn't want to the leave the United States. Afzali is a native of Afghanistan, but has no idea where he will go upon leaving the United States . ""I hardly speak my own language,"" he said. Afzali also said he is concerned for his health; he has diabetes and is anemic, and said his wife has a pelvic tumor. ""I was helping the government and this is what I get,"" Afzali said. The two others suspects in the case, Ahmedzay and Medunjanin, pleaded not guilty in February to new charges of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction against persons or property in the United States, as well as several other counts. The two had previously faced lesser charges. Prosecutors say the two 25-year-old U.S. citizens and residents of Queens conspired with Zazi ""to attack the New York subway system in mid-September 2009.""

"(CNN) -- Hours after January 12's earthquake in Haiti, Drs. Claude and Yolene Surena were treating more than 100 wounded people -- not in a medical facility but outside their own Port-au-Prince home. City medical facilities were decimated or overwhelmed, and makeshift triage areas like the one in the Surenas' yard tried to keep patients alive long enough to get the next available hospital bed. Yolene called her daughter in Maryland to assure her the couple was fine and to make a request. ""She was overwhelmed with patients,"" said Fabiola Surena, a 28-year-old U.S. Army staff sergeant studying to be a physician's assistant. ""She needed me to come help."" Surena and eight U.S.-based relatives and friends -- all of whom were raised in or have relatives in Haiti -- went to the Surenas' Haiti home to assist the doctors, deliver food and first-aid supplies, and to see how their loved ones fared. Surena, who was granted time off from the Army, and her cousin Anne-Rene Louis have been documenting their trip on CNN's iReport.com. They talked to CNN.com by phone on Thursday, their seventh day in Haiti; the group planned to return to the United States this weekend. iReport.com: Fabiola and Anne-Rene's journey to Haiti . The nine, none of whom had any medical experience except for Surena, flew to the Dominican Republic and traveled by bus to Haiti's capital on January 15. At the Surenas' house, one of the few in the neighborhood that didn't collapse, patients were in bad shape. ""I've seen crushed bones, fractures, dislocations, a lot of lacerations. We've had kids who lost digits,"" Fabiola Surena said. ""We've also had people just suffering from just diabetes or high blood pressure, whose medication was stuck in their [destroyed] house, so they're going into diabetic comas."" Many patients needed surgery, but the one surgeon assisting the couple had no post-school experience. The Surenas' home, stocked mostly with first aid and suture kits and over-the-counter medications, had ""no surgical capabilities outside of sutures,"" Fabiola Surena said. Because surgeries couldn't be done immediately and infection was setting in, many patients would need amputation later. A few people died before Surena's group arrived, and one has died since, after being moved to a hospital, she said. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? Fabiola Surena dressed bandages and took vital signs. The other eight from the U.S. made sure patients took medication, sterilized tools and did small dressing changes. The crew also tried to find hospitals that could take the critical patients, she said. Patients rest on mattresses in the yard, covered by tents. Food, water and medical supplies, though bolstered by trips to the Dominican Republic and aid brought by others, are constantly low. The family eats whatever it serves to the patients -- perhaps rice, beans and tuna -- and sometimes it's just one meal, Surena said. ""We're basically out of painkillers. We receive a lot of medication for adults, but not for kids, so children are barely getting painkillers at all,"" she said. Surena, who was born in New York but was raised in Haiti, says her feelings are difficult to put in words. ""It can be very depressing,"" she said in Port-au-Prince, in and around which tens of thousands were killed in the quake. ""After a while, you're looking at the things you can't do. ... Some people beg for water, and we don't have water for us to drink."" ""People look calm and try to go on with life and joke, but then a scared, panicked look comes over their faces when a helicopter flies overhead, because it sounds like an aftershock,"" she added. Full coverage | Twitter updates . Haitians took the wounded to the Surenas' house after the quake because they knew they were doctors. They also knew that Claude Surena, a pediatrician who heads the Haitian Medical Association and directs Rotary International's disaster preparedness committee for Haiti, sometimes sees patients at his home, Rotary spokeswoman Elizabeth Dwyer said. Besides tending to patients, the U.S. nine have connected with relatives to find out who survived. Not all the news was good. Louis, 25, of Orlando, Florida, said her parents' Port-au-Prince-area house collapsed during the quake, killing her grandfather and a maid. Also killed was the best friend of Louis' 18-year-old sister, she said. The sister, Soraya Louis, a U.S. college student visiting her parents' home, was trapped for a few hours in the rubble. She passed out briefly during the collapse, and she awoke to ""everybody screaming,"" she said. ""I heard footsteps overhead. People were walking on the bricks,"" Soraya Louis, a student at Connecticut's University of Bridgeport, said by phone from Port-au-Prince on Thursday. ""I was crying and screaming for help."" People dug her out after she helped them find her. She found a piece of wood, stuck it between bricks and moved it until someone saw it, she said. Impact Your World . Soraya Louis and her cousin were injured but are OK. Also escaping the collapse were one of her sisters and another friend; her parents were at work. Anne-Rene Louis arrived in Haiti in time for her grandfather's funeral January 15. By Thursday, many of the Surenas' patients had been sent to hospitals. Only about 20 remained in the yard. Claude and Yolene no longer tend to the patients during the day -- Claude was just named the country's coordinator for disaster medical care, and Yolene, who already worked for Haiti's government, is helping determine which hospitals are running and where more can be set up, Fabiola Surena said. Some of the U.S. nine went to work with Claude Surena on Thursday, helping to direct hospital workers to medical supplies, Anne-Rene Louis said. Though the nine plan to leave Haiti this weekend, some may return soon. Soraya Louis said it was a relief to see the group. ""It's been hard for us here, and it feels good to know people are supporting us,"" she said. ""Now our whole family is together. ... They give us strength every day.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Fears that Haitian earthquake survivors would engage in a massive and deadly ocean migration to South Florida have thus far been unfounded, according to federal and local government officials, who say they continue to plan for such an exodus only as a precaution. The U.S. Coast Guard said it has witnessed only normal maritime traffic around Haiti, and it has not intercepted any Haitians attempting illegal crossings into U.S. waters. Nor does it see people preparing for voyages . Florida officials have asked for federal government funding to shelter 10,000 refugees, but said that was done only as a precaution. Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force continues daily flights of its EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft -- a radio station in the sky -- which is broadcasting warnings to would-be migrants, as well as information about where people can find food and aid. List of missing, found people in Haiti . The plane is broadcasting a recorded message from Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the United States, saying: ""Listen, don't rush on boats to leave the country. Because I'll be honest with you: If you think you will reach the U.S. and all the doors will be wide open to you, that's not at all the case. And they will intercept you right on the water and send you back home where you came from."" State Department deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid said the message is ""part of the U.S. effort to help keep Haitians safe."" ""We don't want people to endanger their lives by taking risk to try to get to the U.S. at this time,"" he said. The U.S. military will be distributing special radios to Haitians this week in an effort to get messages and news spread as far as possible. Some 50,000 portable solar-powered and windup radios will be distributed by the U.S. military joint task force that is deploying troops in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and other severely stricken parts of the country. Government officials say past migrations from Cuba and Haiti were the result of large geopolitical events, circumstances that differ significantly from those in Haiti now. Further, there is a large U.S. government presence in Haiti and offshore -- factors that will make any migration easier for the government to detect. ""At this point, we are not expecting a massive influx of Haitian individuals,"" said Mike Stone, spokesman for the Florida Emergency Operations Center. Immediately after the January 12 quake, the state ""dusted off"" a preparedness plan known as Operation Vigilant Sentry ""just in case,"" he said. The plan has been in place since 2003. David Halstead, director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said the state's request for ""safe housing"" for 10,000 Haitian survivors was based on the plan. That is the maximum number Florida officials believe the state could support in any mass migration, and only for a limited period, he said. It is based on the expectation that people would first be housed at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and federal immigration detention centers. ""I think right now, with everyone watching Haiti ... for any boat or ship to be able to get out of there illegally would be a miracle upon itself,"" Halstead said Tuesday. The U.S. Coast Guard said it has seen ""nothing out of the ordinary"" off Haiti's coast in recent days. Ferry vessels have been crowded, ""but they're not going anyplace we wouldn't expect them to,"" Lt. Cmdr. Christopher O'Neil said. Haitians have migrated to the United States by boat in relatively small numbers for at least the past 30 years, with several notable spikes. An estimated 25,000 Haitians were among the mass migration of more than 150,000 asylum seekers, primarily Cubans, during the Mariel boatlift in 1980. In the early 1990s, tens of thousands of Haitians migrated to the United States after the coup d'etat deposing President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old woman whose claims that she was abused in a trailer in rural West Virginia in 2007 helped send six people to prison now says she made up the story, her lawyer said Wednesday. Attorney Byron Potts says his client is not being pressured to recant her story. ""She is recanting her entire story,"" attorney Byron Potts told reporters in Columbus, Ohio, about his client, Megan Williams, who moved there after the incident. ""She says it did not happen. She fabricated it."" He added, ""She wanted to get back at her boyfriend. She was mad at him."" In 2007, police acting on a tip found the black woman in a trailer with cuts and bruises. She said she had been stabbed in the leg and beaten, sexually assaulted, forced to eat feces and subjected to a racial slur by her white captors. The suspects included a mother and son, a separate mother and daughter, and two men. All are still jailed, according to the prosecutor who handled the case. The incident, which drew extensive media coverage, stirred outrage around the country. Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton called for the incident to be investigated as a hate crime. Last year, all six defendants pleaded guilty and were given terms of up to 40 years in prison. Potts said his client was coming forward ""to right the wrong perpetrated on these six individuals."" He added that she told him all her injuries except for the bruises on her face were self-inflicted. The bruises, he said, were from an altercation she had had with her then-boyfriend before the incident in question. Potts described Williams' feelings as ""total remorse; that's why she's coming forward. She is remorseful for having these people spend time in jail."" Asked if she was being pressured to recant, he said, ""No, she's not being pressured into this."" Williams had been expected to speak herself, but Potts said she would not appear before the news media because she was afraid for her safety. He said she was ""fully aware"" that she might face criminal charges, ""but she still wanted to go forward with this."" Brian Abraham, the former Logan County prosecutor who handled the case, defended the convictions. ""The case wasn't based on her statements,"" he said, noting that Williams never testified in the case. ""The case was based on the evidence discovered by the police, including the confessions of the six defendants."" He added, ""All six of them have been in jail without filing appeals. If they file something afterwards, the evidence was pretty overwhelming for the charges on which they were convicted."" The current county prosecutor, John Bennett, said he could not comment on whether the case would be reopened. He said he represented one of the suspects in 2007 and so would let a judge decide how to handle the potential conflict of interest. Sharpton said, ""If they are being held under false information and she misled authorities, and if the authorities went solely on her testimony, then they should be released."" But he added, ""If there are other circumstances around the recanting, we should know what they are.""","6 people in prison for beating, sexual assault of Megan Williams .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's involvement in the invasion of Iraq ""was the right decision and it was for the right reasons,"" Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Friday in his first response at an inquiry into country's role in the March 2003 conflict. Brown was answering a question from the chairman of the inquiry, John Chilcot, about whether he thought taking military action in March 2003 was the right decision, especially given that it led to such a great loss of life among military personnel and civilians. The prime minister said he respects members of the armed forces ""who served with great distinction in Iraq"" and lost their lives, and to civilians who died. ""I think any loss of life is something that makes us very sad indeed,"" Brown said. The inquiry began last year and is expected to be the most thorough investigation yet into decisions that led up to the war and governed Britain's involvement, analysts have said. It is not a court of law, so the inquiry cannot find anyone criminally responsible or apportion blame. But inquiry members will be able to judge the legality of the conflict. Brown spent much of Friday defending military spending allowances, which have come under harsh scrutiny in Britain. Earlier witnesses have said Brown, as head of the British Treasury leading up to and after the Iraq invasion, did not allow the Ministry of Defence to spend as much as was needed. Such cuts would have restricted the military's ability to buy helicopters, body armor and weapons that would have subsequently been used in Afghanistan. Brown said as chancellor, he never ruled out a military option on the basis of cost. ""I said that every single request that was made for [military] equipment had to be met, and every request was met, and at any point military commanders were able to ask for equipment that they needed, and I know of no occasion when they were turned down for it,"" Brown testified. Tony Blair testifies at Iraq inquiry . Geoff Hoon, defence secretary at the time of the 2003 invasion, testified that Brown forced cuts that limited military spending. ""We then had to look hard at our budget and make some rather difficult cuts in the future equipment program as a result,"" Hoon testified. Brown had faced increasing pressure to testify before Britain holds general elections, widely expected to be held May 6. His Labour Party faces a tight race with the opposition Conservatives. Chilcot, the inquiry chairman, said committee members previously decided not to call any government ministers who are still serving in posts relevant to Iraq, but Brown offered to testify. Chilcot announced in January that Brown had agreed to appear in the next two months. Susan Smith, whose son, Pvt. Phillip Hewett, died in Iraq in 2005, said she doesn't believe Brown did everything possible to equip British troops. ""Was it needed? Was it asked for? If it was, why was it not funded?"" she said. ""At the moment, you've got no answers. It's all speculation. It would be nice just to know the truth."" Brown has faced repeated criticism for the level of equipment for the 9,000 British troops in Afghanistan, which some have said is too low. The prime minister has defended equipment levels and said he seeks assurances from military officers in the field that troops have the supplies they need. A military memo, sent in June but released in October, contained a warning from a British officer that a shortage of helicopters was putting troops at risk because they were forced to travel on the ground, increasing the chances a roadside bomb could kill them. The memo was written by Lt. Col. Rupert Thorneloe, who died a month later in a roadside bombing. At the time, he was the highest-ranking British serviceman to die in combat since the 1982 Falklands War. Gen. Michael Walker previously testified the Treasury gave defence officials a spending target that they found hard to reach. ""It was [a budget for] some of the stuff that was related to some of the longer-term equipment programs, including infantry battalions,"" he testified February 1. ""I think it included helicopter money. I think it included things like aircraft carriers. It was all big-ticket items that were being threatened."" Defence officials made as many cuts as they could before they had to stop, Walker said. ""I think we drew a line somewhere halfway down the page and said, 'If you go any further than that, you'll probably have to look for a new set of chiefs,' "" he said. Hoon and others have testified that the Defence Ministry's budgeting structure in 2002, the year before the Iraq invasion, allowed officials to save money by using and maintaining existing equipment. Officials used the cash saved for other spending, Hoon said. That spending ability changed a year later and caused big problems for the ministry, they have testified. ""We asked for significantly more money than we eventually received"" in subsequent spending programs, Hoon said. Kevin Tebbit, who was permanent secretary to the Defence Ministry at the time of the invasion, said Brown did not want the ministry to have as much cash as it eventually received. ""The Treasury felt that we were using far too much cash, and in September 2003, the chancellor of the day instituted a complete guillotine on our [ability to spend],"" he said. ""It meant that we had to go in for a very major savings exercise in order to cope with what was effectively a billion pounds reduction in our finances."" Brown testified that military options took precedence over financial concerns. ""There was no time from June [2002] when the Treasury said, 'This is a better military option because it's cheaper and less costly,' "" Brown said. ""At every point I made it clear that we would support whatever option the military decided upon with the prime minister and the Cabinet, and there would be no financial barrier to us doing what was necessary to be done."" He also testified the Treasury granted ""every application"" for equipment made by the Defence Ministry. Brown was chancellor, or head of the Treasury, from 1997 until 2007 when Prime Minister Tony Blair stepped down and Brown took over the top post. Alistair Campbell, Blair's former spokesman, testified in January that Brown was part of Blair's inner circle, discussing questions about the Iraq war. Blair testified in January.","Gordon Brown served as Chancellor, or head of the Treasury, from 1997 until 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Len Gengel cries between sentences. ""It's my daughter's birthday today,"" he says, choking back tears. ""We should be celebrating,"" he says. ""Instead, I'm talking to people all day long, making sure they continue on the search and rescue. That's my objective today: to keep that search and rescue going."" Gengel's daughter, Britney, is one of four students from South Florida's Lynn University who are missing amid the rubble of Haiti's Hotel Montana. Two faculty members from the university also remain missing. Britney, a sophomore journalism major with jet black hair and a bright smile, turned 20 Thursday. She had traveled to Haiti with 12 Lynn University students on a humanitarian mission to feed the poor. Eight of the students were rescued last week. An hour before the magnitude-7.0 quake, Britney called her mother. ""Brit said she found her calling, that she knew what she wanted to do for the rest of her life,"" her father said, pausing to catch his breath. ""Who knew an hour later that was going to happen? It's so hard to talk about. ... Think of the worst day of your life and then times that by 1,000."" Crews have spent days searching mounds of rubble, 30 feet high in places, that was the Hotel Montana, popular with tourists and visiting officials. Lynn University, which hired a search crew immediately after the quake, initially told the Gengel family that their daughter had been rescued. The family then flew from their Massachusetts home to South Florida for what they thought was going to be a reunion. ""We have spent a week here in Florida in a living hell,"" the father said. ""It's just one of the dirtiest tricks life can play on you, to take someone from you and then call and say they found her and she's on a helicopter and she's gonna be OK. And then to be told 10 hours later ... that they had bad intel -- they don't have her."" Lynn President Kevin M. Ross said Thursday evening that he is still optimistic ""that a miracle is found."" ""We still have hope at Lynn University,"" he said. ""The search and rescue will continue.""

"(CNN) -- The faithful prayed -- for relief, for mercy, for safety -- as aftershocks rumbled across Haiti on Tuesday evening. ""It's 8:44 p.m. and we're still getting aftershocks! Can hear people gathered in the distance singing prayers,"" wrote Richard Morse, hotel manager at the Oloffson Hotel in the capital, Port-au-Prince. On Twitter, he captured the aftermath of a 7.0-magnitude earthquake that struck off the coast of Haiti, causing widespread destruction. The quake, which happened shortly before 5 p.m., was followed by at least 18 aftershocks, averaging a magnitude of 5.0, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. As the night went on, the singing and praying intensified and then waned, Morse wrote. What he didn't hear in all the commotion were helicopters or ambulances. The panic that engulfed Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, could be witnessed on an online Haitian entertainment channel called Haitipal, which suddenly became an essential communication tool. Frantic callers broadcast pleas for help. ""My cousin has a broken leg and she's trying to get to the hospital,"" one caller said. ""She has two kids. ... How can she get to the hospital?"" Are you there? Submit an iReport . The man gave his cousin's address, and the channel's commentator asked anyone listening who lived nearby to see whether he could help. Many callers expressed their sympathies and prayers for the people of Haiti, while others told of fallen buildings and damaged homes. The first photographs from the area showed collapsed walls and sidewalks covered with cinder block-size chunks of debris. One photograph, taken by members of a American church mission group, showed a dead man in a gray T-shirt and jeans, hunched on the ground. Another broadcaster, Radio-Tele Ginen, collected and posted photographs on its Web site that hinted at the damage and deaths caused by the earthquake. One showed two bodies, completely covered in dust, inside the bed of a pickup. Others showed men and women bloodied by rubble. The building that houses Citibank's offices in Port-au-Prince, one of the most modern in the city, collapsed, bank spokeswoman Liliana Mejia told CNN. There were 12 employees unaccounted for after the three-story building fell, she said. Are you looking for loved ones in Haiti? Jonathan de la Durantaye was in a car when the quake hit.

"(CNN) -- While millions of Christians worldwide will celebrate Easter this weekend, David Silverman has other plans. Silverman will join about 300 atheists in a Newark, New Jersey, hotel ballroom to proclaim another message: The atheist movement in America is growing. Silverman will participate in the 36th annual American Atheists National Convention at the Newark Liberty Renaissance Hotel. He'll also try to clear up a misconception: Atheists aren't immoral, and they don't worship Satan. That's what many people assume when he tells them that he belongs to an atheist group, Silverman says. ""We have a lot of wonderful people,"" he said. ""I haven't sacrificed any Christian babies. I haven't danced naked under the stars. I haven't stolen anything."" What Silverman is doing instead is talking up the ""resurgence"" among atheists. He says atheists once felt isolated and misunderstood. Two events changed that, he says: the rise of the Internet and the election of George W. Bush. Bush's polarizing presidency showed people how bad things could turn ""if religion was in charge,"" he said. The Internet showed atheists that they weren't alone, as they sought out and encouraged one another. ""Closet atheists are coming out all over the country,"" Silverman said, estimating that his group has 4,000 members. ""Anybody can go on the Internet and read blogs, Facebook pages, and know that there are millions like them."" Those who ask why people need God are also raising their public profile in other ways. Richard Dawkins, author of ""The God Delusion,"" and Sam Harris, author of ""The End of Faith,"" have best-selling books questioning the need for religion. Silverman says a coalition of groups, including American Atheists, met with White House officials in February to discuss more tolerance for nonbelievers. He takes pains to say that atheists respect those who believe otherwise. But if that's so, why hold a convention on Easter weekend? Silverman chuckled at the question. ""It's not a slam against Easter,"" he said. ""We always have our national convention on Easter weekend. The hotels are cheap, and everybody has time off.""","American Atheists group meets Easter weekend .

"(CNN) -- British billionaire Richard Branson's dream of space travel that thousands of people can afford took a leap toward reality with the maiden flight of the world's first commercial spacecraft over California's Mojave Desert. Branson's company Virgin Galactic announced Monday that the VSS Enterprise had successfully completed what it called a captive carry flight attached to a carrier plane. The spacecraft's developer called it a ""momentous day."" ""The captive carry flight signifies the start of what we believe will be extremely exciting and successful spaceship flight test program,"" said Burt Rutan, founder of Scaled Composites, which built the spacecraft. The VSS Enterprise remained attached to its carrier aircraft for the duration of the 2-hour, 54-minute flight, reaching an altitude of 45,000 feet, according to a statement from Virgin. Eventually, the 60-foot long rocket plane will be taken 60,000 feet above the Earth by its carrier and fire rockets to propel itself into space. The test-flight program is expected to continue through 2011, going first to a free glide and then to a powered flight before commercial flights begin. ""Seeing the finished spaceship in December was a major day for us but watching VSS Enterprise fly for the first time really brings home what beautiful, ground-breaking vehicles Burt and his team have developed for us,"" Branson said. ""Today was another major step along that road and a testament to U.S. engineering and innovation,"" he said. Virgin Galactic has envisioned one flight a week, with six tourists aboard. Each will pay $200,000 for the ride and train for at least three days before going. About 80,000 people have placed their names on the waiting list for seats. ""What we want to be able to do is bring space travel down to a price range where hundreds of thousands of people would be able to experience space, and they never dreamed that [they] could,"" Branson said last year. He has said he hopes the technology will lead to a new form of Earth travel, jetting people across oceans and continents faster through suborbital routes.","VSS Enterprise remained attached to carrier aircraft for duration of near 3-hour flight .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN)  -- Last week during the day, some kids in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, were playing soccer in a park when a car slowed down, guys got out and executed a 13-year-old boy. And then they drove away, unmolested in a city with 11,000 army and police officers. The Mexican government repeatedly states that 90 percent of the deaths in the current drug war are of people who are dirty; that is, criminals involved in the drug business. The killings of reporters and of innocent women, men and children continually belie that statement. The child was not a cartel member in disguise. Nor were the 15 high school kids killed at a party in a small house in a poor barrio. Their parents had made them hold the celebration of a sports victory at home because it was too dangerous to be out in the city. I went to Juarez in June of 1995 and never seem to escape the pull of the place. The city then was controlled by Amado Carrillo Fuentes, then the head of the Juarez cartel. Drug Enforcement Agency intelligence told me he was raking in $250 million a week. American factories were erupting out of the ground in the wake of the passage of NAFTA. Huge districts of shacks made out of stolen pallets and cardboard boxes were growing faster than the city could map. These shacks were filled with people working full time in those American-owned factories. Murders ran around 250 a year and sometimes the cartel left bodies on the street wrapped in yellow ribbon. Carrillo ran the city and yet his name never appeared in the newspapers nor was mentioned on radio and television. I thought I'd stumbled into hell. Now the city is dying. About 5,000 people have been slaughtered in Ciudad Juarez in 27 months. It is a destroyed city where 25 percent of the houses are abandoned and 40 percent of the businesses have closed. There were 2,600 murders last year and killings are going on at a faster clip this year. At night, no one is on the streets. I realize that I was a fool in 1995. I had not stumbled into hell. That was the golden age. But one constant remains: No matter how many die in Juarez, no matter how low the pay in the American factories, the U.S. government insists the War on Drugs is being won and that NAFTA is a big success. The Mexican War on Drugs is not lost: it never seriously began. The drug industry is an essential prop under a faltering Mexican economy and has been so for more than 20 years, since the peso crisis of the early 1980s. The money flows into the hands of countless government officials, into the banking industry and into many investments in Mexico. More people die each day as the government of President Felipe Calderon uses the Mexican army and the federal police to try to get the illegal drug industry under control. Calderon was elected by a razor-thin margin and followed the custom of Mexican presidents by immediately making a show of force. But he badly underestimated the power of the drug industry. The profits are estimated by many analysts to be between $30 billion and $50 billion a year, although it's notoriously difficult to track. But it is not a piddling sum in a country where oil is the official highest earner of foreign currency and supplies 40 percent of the federal budget. But the oil is running out. Calderon has publicly stated that the oil fields will be gone in 10 years or less. The next big earner is human flesh, the millions of Mexicans who have fled the economic doom of their nation and send more than $20 billion a year home from the United States. But the recession and job losses in the U.S. have cut into that source. Tourism ranks third in legitimate sources of money for Mexico, but in a nation where heads keep getting lopped off, tourism isn't thriving. The illegal drug industry in Mexico employs hundreds of thousands of people. No one knows the payroll, but certainly it includes many people in the army, the 3,500 separate police forces and the government from top to bottom. It's difficult to make a living wage legitimately here. The pay varies, but in Ciudad Juarez, one of the most violent cities on Earth, the starting salary in the 400 foreign-owned factories, mainly American, is about 40 bucks a week. There are 500 to 900 street gangs. No one can live on the pay offered by these factories. In a country with 50 percent of the population living in poverty, the turnover in these plants runs from 100 to 200 percent a year. No one can live long in a gang -- but for a while, a kid can live well and feel that his life is a dream of money and power. The U.S. approach to the killings in Mexico never looks at an economic reason, just as the consequences of our free trade treaty (NAFTA) are never brought up. The effects wrought by NAFTA launched one of the largest human migrations in the world as poor Mexicans fled collapsing industry and agriculture. Border Patrol statistics show that the number of Mexicans entering the U.S. illegally skyrocketed within two years of the passage of NAFTA. We also never question our four-decades-old War on Drugs, which has produced cheaper drugs of higher quality at lower prices in thousands of U.S. cities and towns. It has helped create one of the largest prison populations in the world. If our drug policy were a ship, it would be called the Titanic. Anyone who questions the propaganda of the U.S. government on the violence in Mexico, on our War on Drugs or on our free trade agreement is told to come up with a solution, some silver bullet that instantly slays the dragon. But our policies over the decades have created a disaster, and it will take years to reverse the damage these acts of government have inflicted. The time to start is now. Let's address the true and lethal nature of Mexico's war on drugs -- one we are in part bankrolling under the Merida Initiative to the tune of half a billion dollars per year, often tossed into the murderous hands of many in the Mexican army. We need to have a public discussion of the obvious: Legalize drugs or keep caging Americans for taking drugs -- unless of course they are booze, tobacco or happy pills from the doctor -- and keep financing the murders of Mexicans. The first thing to do if we want to come clean about the slaughter in Mexico is start smelling the coffee. We share a 1,900-mile border. We share a history and people. At least 10 percent of the Mexican people now live in the United States as economic or political fugitives. Recently, the secretaries of State, Homeland Security and Defense flew to Mexico City and promised the Mexican government we would continue exactly the same polices as in the past. I have been told I should be reasonable. I am. And I expect the same of my government. Building prisons and lending support to a murderous war on drugs must stop, and digging deep into the economics and politics behind the hellish state of affairs must begin. It's a testament to the Mexican people that no matter how hard life is in Juarez, they seem to endure, raise families, smile and try to create a better future. As a Mexican friend told me, ""I love Juarez, it is such a needy city."" It is poor and dangerous, a tapestry of one-story buildings. But once you know Juarez it haunts you no matter how you try to flee.

"(CNN) -- ""Media must cease reporting on the discovery of a body at a psychiatric hospital in Dongguan."" ""Media must not report on corruption allegations relating to the eldest son of President Hu Jintao."" ""Media must not report on a lawsuit against China Eastern Airlines by victims of a plane crash in 2004 in which 52 passengers were killed."" Those are just a few of more than 60 restrictions the Chinese government slapped on the media in 2009, often secretly, according to the International Federation of Journalists. The press freedom group said it obtained written media-related orders which are published in its report, ""China Clings to Control: Press Freedoms in 2009."" Tight controls were put on reporting of ethnic riots in the west of the country in July, and clear orders were issued for how to report President Barack Obama's visit to the country in November, the IFJ said in the report released Sunday. The press was instructed not to organize questions for the public to ask Obama at a town-hall style event he did in the country and was banned from reporting on ""protests or spontaneous news during Obama's visit,"" the IFJ report said. It all added up to a year of increased censorship in China, on the heels of a period of relative openness around the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the group charged. CNN's calls to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Washington were not immediately returned. The IFJ report said that Chinese media were ordered not to report prominently on protests in Iran following the country's controversial presidential election in June. They were barred from reporting at all on elections for the chief executive of Macau, a region of China, and were waved off stories about refugees entering China, threats to public health, political protests and corruption, the report said. They were allowed to report about some stories in English but not Mandarin, and others in newspapers but not online, said the report, which was compiled with the help of a group called Chinese Human Rights Defenders. That's not to mention self-censorship in the press around two key anniversaries last year: the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests and the Tibetan uprising of 1959, the IFJ said. ""Media did not need to be ordered how to report these matters -- they were very aware there was to be no independent reporting on these topics,"" the report said. ""Most journalists and media outlets would self-censor and there would be no need for regulations or orders... self-censorship remains a matter of self-preservation."" Direct orders from the government -- sometimes containing the explicit threat of ""punishment from the Central Propaganda Department"" -- was only one element in Beijing's arsenal against the press, the report said. China is clearly concerned about the Internet, the IFJ suggested. ""Online surveillance was stepped up, Web sites were entirely or partially closed, online social networks were shut down, online news portals were censored, online journalists and bloggers were detained and arrested."" Press ""accreditation rules tightened further in 2009... making it difficult for online journalists to gain accreditation,"" the report said. And foreign journalists encountered ""acts of violence, destruction of work materials and equipment... surveillance and reprimands,"" the report said. But ""despite the difficulties, many journalists try to go out of the way to get the news,"" the IFJ said. China hosted a World Media Summit in October, drawing the heads of some of the world's largest news organizations, including the Associated Press, Reuters, News Corporation, Russia's Itar-Tass, Kyodo of Japan and China's own Xinhua. President Hu addressed the conference, saying ""it is more important than ever before that the media should establish and uphold social responsibilities,"" according to Xinhua. Hu pledged the Chinese government would safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of foreign news media and continue to facilitate foreign media coverage of China in accordance with the law, Xinhua reported. It is not clear that he made a similar promise regarding Chinese media. Obama criticized censorship in his November visit to China, responding to questions from the Chinese public about restrictions on the Internet. ""Because in the United States information is free, and I have a lot of critics in the United States who can say all kinds of things about me, I actually think that that makes our democracy stronger and it makes me a better leader because it forces me to hear opinions that I don't want to hear,"" he said. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on China to investigate alleged hacking of Google in the country -- prompting the Internet search giant to threaten to pull out of China. ""We look to the Chinese authorities to conduct a thorough review of the cyber intrusions that led Google to make its announcement. And we also look for that investigation and its results to be transparent,"" Clinton said. Five years ago, Google agreed to allow some censorship by China, in exchange for the right to operate in that country's massive emerging technology market. The company now says censorship and the hacking of Chinese dissidents' Google e-mail accounts have prompted it to reconsider. The IFJ calls itself ""a non-governmental, non-profit organization that promotes coordinated international action to defend press freedom and social justice through the development of strong, free and independent trade unions of journalists.""","Press group notes more than 60 government restrictions on media in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- American sixth seed Andy Roddick denied Rafael Nadal a third final appearance at the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami after another sensational serving performance on Friday. Roddick, the tournament's 2004 champion, will face Tomas Berdych in Sunday's title match after coming from behind to defeat Spanish fourth seed Nadal 4-6 6-3 6-3 in the semis at Key Biscayne. He has won an incredible 62 of his last 64 service games, reaching the final of two successive Masters 1000 events for the first time since 2003, when he went on to win the U.S. Open. Roddick, beaten in the Indian Wells title match by Ivan Ljubicic two weeks ago, broke Nadal's serve at 4-3 up in the second set with three forehand winners and then held to love to level the match. He again broke his fellow former world No. 1 in the third game of the decider and held serve to claim his first win in the last four meetings between the two. ""I knew I had to be more aggressive. My heavy forehand doesn't work against him, so I had to hit it flatter, which is higher risk. I took really, really ridiculous cuts at a lot of forehands,"" Roddick told the ATP Tour Web site. ""I took a lot of risk there in the last two sets. My comfort zone of moving the ball around and maybe chipping it around a little bit doesn't work against Rafa. I had to try to come up with something that at least took him out of his comfort zone a little bit, and it paid off."" Nadal was not too disheartened, having reached the semifinals in his two outings since suffering a knee injury at the Australian Open in January. ""Two semifinals in a row, first two Masters 1000 of the season for me is positive,"" Nadal said. ""Positive American hardcourt season, first part. So, yeah, happy for that.""

The Czech, seeded 16th, has gone one better than his last-four achievement in Miami last year as he qualified for only his second Masters final. ""In all my matches with Robin in the past I've been too defensive. If you give him time to hit the ball hard it's really tough,"" Berdych said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The State Department's chief of diplomatic security has resigned amid scrutiny of the use of private military contractors to guard the department's staff in Iraq, a spokesman said Wednesday. Richard Griffin testifies before a House committee looking into private security contractors earlier this month. Richard Griffin, a 36-year career official, gave no explanation for his decision in his resignation letter to President Bush. ""I am grateful that I had the opportunity to serve as the assistant secretary for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, whose brave men and women serve on the front lines of the Global War on Terror,"" he wrote in his resignation letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. ""Without their courage and commitment, the State Department could not possibly carry out its foreign policy mission."" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice accepted Griffin's resignation, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. Griffin's decision to step down follows weeks of investigations into the September 16 killings of Iraqi civilians by Blackwater USA, a North Carolina-based firm hired by the State Department to protect American diplomats in Baghdad. Meanwhile, a survivor of the September 16 incident told CNN on Wednesday that he and a number of other victims were summoned to a meeting with U.S. Embassy officials and were offered money. Mohammed Abdul Razzaq, whose 9-year-old son died, said the embassy offered him $12,500 -- which he said he refused because ""they didn't acknowledge their crime."" ""Don't they need to acknowledge my son's blood first so I can forgive them? Now I can't. How can I take compensation and they never acknowledge the crime?"" he said. The father is demanding a formal apology from Blackwater CEO Erik Prince, prosecution of those responsible for his son's death and political asylum in the United States so he can pursue the case in American courts. Another survivor, taxi driver Sami Hawas, told CNN he received $7,500 from the embassy, a payment he described as ""aid."" Hawas was shot a number of times in the back and leg. He said he is unable to work now and complained about the high cost of medication. He took the money, he said, because he needs help paying for medical treatment and supporting his family. ""Even if they compensate me with millions, it will not make up for the lost blood and the pain I live every day,"" he told CNN. U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Mirembe Natango said the payments were ""part of a standard procedure"" and would continue. She described them as ""short-term and speedy aid and support"" but said they were not an admission of guilt. She said those receiving the money do not waive any right to future compensation. The State Department and the FBI are conducting their own investigation into the killings, and a joint U.S.-Iraqi commission is reviewing the results of both probes. Prince has said that Blackwater guards came under fire while protecting a State Department convoy and acted properly in self-defense.  Watch Blackwater chief talk about his company » . But Iraqi authorities have called the killings ""premeditated murder"" and demanded Blackwater leave Iraq. A State Department report of its own operations, released Tuesday, found lax oversight of security contractors, who are under the supervision of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. It recommended tightening the rules of engagement for contractors to bring them in line with those used by the U.S. military, and Rice appointed a top U.S. diplomat to oversee all security operations in Iraq. Blackwater is the most prominent of the military contractors working in Iraq, where an estimated 25,000 private contractors guard diplomats, reconstruction workers and government officials. Company officials urged subscribers to its e-mailed newsletter Wednesday to help fight its public-relations battle. ""In this tumultuous political climate, Blackwater Worldwide has taken center stage, our services and ethics aggressively challenged with misinformation and fabrications. Letters, e-mails and calls to your elected congressional representatives can and will create a positive impact by influencing the manner in which they gather and present information,"" the company wrote. The message, titled ""A Request for Your Support,"" urged readers to contact members of Congress ""and tell them to stand by the truth."" It recommended that constituents emphasize that the company hires U.S. military veterans and the fact that no one under Blackwater's protection has been killed in Iraq. It also asked that supporters stress what the company termed the ""cost efficiency"" of its services, for which the State Department has paid more than $800 million since 2004. Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said the company had received ""hundreds of positive responses"" to its appeal by Wednesday afternoon. The contractors are immune from prosecution under Iraqi law, under an order issued by the American-led occupation government in 2004. Iraq's government has agreed to ask the country's parliament to consider changing that directive, an adviser to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki told CNN on Wednesday.  E-mail to a friend .

"Washington (CNN) -- When President Obama threw out the first pitch at the Washington Nationals' season opener on Monday, he kicked off not only a new baseball season but also a new round of fundraisers at Nationals Park. Though Obama wasn't raising any cash himself on game day, his appearance was the backdrop for at least one ballpark fundraiser Monday, the first of what Nationals President Stan Kasten hopes will be many political events held at the stadium this season. Since Nationals Park first opened in March 2008, Kasten has actively encouraged political operatives of all ideological stripes to hold their fundraisers and receptions at the ballpark, as opposed to more conventional venues such as restaurants or hotel ballrooms. ""I am absolutely bipartisan when it comes to business, or even multi-partisan,"" said Kasten in an interview with CNN. ""We welcome all, and we've had all come to the ballpark. Republicans, Democrats, and I'm sure other parties as well."" Kasten helped bring major-league baseball back to Washington in 2005 after a 34-year absence. Since then, federal candidates, major political parties, and political action committees have spent at least $432,000 on fundraising events either at Nationals games or at their facility, according to campaign finance documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. Although campaigns did spend money on Nationals-related fundraising events when the team played at RFK Stadium, the records show that spending skyrocketed once the gates opened at Nationals Park. Campaign disbursements to the Nationals for fundraising expenses averaged $11,000 per year from 2005 to 2007, but that increased by twelvefold, to about $131,000, in 2008, the year the park opened. That amount doubled to $264,000 in 2009. The total dollar amount spent on all fundraisers at Nationals Park is likely to be much higher than FEC records indicate, since lax federal disclosure rules allow campaigns to pay corporations directly for use of their luxury suites at the ballpark, without having to specify how the money was spent. However, regulations do require that campaigns pay full price for all expenses, such as tickets, suite rentals and concessions. Much of the Nationals' success in wooing the campaign crowd can be attributed to a relative lack of variety available on the Washington fundraising circuit. One Democratic fundraiser who has held two events at the ballpark told CNN that both candidates and donors enjoy the change of scenery. ""It's different. It's a good time to interact with people but also have fun while doing something non-politically related,"" she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""There is a little bit of monotony in fundraisers in D.C. There's a formula to it, so this is a little out of the ordinary."" Kasten could not agree more. ""The key to fundraisers is to get people to come,"" he said. ""We have the added element of holding an event at our ballpark and having a fun evening going on alongside the fundraiser with lots of other things to do."" ""It's just so much more appealing to potential contributors than just coming to some hotel ballroom,"" he added. The ballpark hosted over 40 fundraisers in 2009, and Kasten expects that number to increase this year with the midterm elections looming. The team advertises its facilities to individual campaign committees, congressional offices, and to national party organizations, including both the Democratic and Republican National Committees. Special outreach is made to the members and candidates representing whichever visiting team happens to be in town. Although holding fundraisers at baseball games is not new, the Nationals have capitalized on being uniquely positioned in a city with a year-round political industry unrivaled by other baseball towns. Records show that several teams with national fan bases have not received nearly as much in campaign expenditures as the $432,000 the Nationals have garnered so far. Since 2003, the Boston Red Sox have received about $207,000, the New York Yankees have received about $157,000, and the Chicago Cubs have brought in just over $36,000. The Baltimore Orioles, which had been Washington's venue of choice for baseball-themed political fundraisers prior to the arrival of the Nationals, received $134,000 during the same time period. But not everyone is sold on Nationals Park as a fundraising venue, at least as long as the team continues to perform poorly on the field. ""The allure of doing events at their games has worn off, since the home team isn't good. We usually struggle to sell tickets for Nationals games,"" said one Republican fundraiser, who asked not to be identified. ""We generally advise our clients to have other types of fundraising events that are cheaper and more successful. [Washington Capitals hockey] games sell very well right now."" On that point, Kasten, who has also headed up professional hockey and basketball franchises, says that baseball is the most conducive sport for political fundraisers. ""The pace is a little slower,"" he said. ""It gives people more of a chance to sit and think and talk typically than there is at a basketball or hockey game."" Despite his efforts to lure partisan fundraisers to his ballpark, the Nationals' top executive sees baseball as an inherently nonpartisan activity. According to Kasten, ""A ballpark is a controversy-free zone, a politics-free zone, where everyone can unify behind the idea of just having fun.""","Nationals President Stan Kasten encourages political operatives to hold fundraisers at ballpark .

"(CNN) -- The maternal grandmother of a 7-month-old Florida girl found hidden in a small cedar box under her baby sitter's bed says her daughter, who was charged in the case, is troubled and needs help. Police think Chrystina Lynn Mercer gave Shannon Lee Dedrick to the sitter -- who is the baby's paternal aunt, Susan Baker -- and 10 hours later reported the girl missing. ""As confused as Tina is, I have to tell you, she has emphatically stated that she did not and would not ever harm her child,"" Mercer's mother, Kandis Boyer, said Thursday on HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" Without elaborating, Boyer said she thinks her daughter ""was manipulated into this situation."" Baker, whose home Shannon was found in, was also charged in connection with the incident, Washington County Sheriff Bobby Haddock has said. The baby is in protective custody with the state and is in good health despite her ordeal, according to Boyer, who says she drove nearly 900 miles in 14 hours from Texas to Florida when Shannon disappeared. According to Haddock, Baker took custody of Shannon from her mother on Saturday. Boyer said her daughter told her she only let Baker care for the child, nothing more. Asked why Mercer reported the child missing to police, Boyer said she did not know. Boyer said her daughter has said ""so many different things"" and that ""she seems to be very confused. That's what I've gathered from talking to her myself since I have been here from Texas."" She said her daughter has had counseling over the years, and ""she's going to get the help she needs now."" Clothes and baking powder to hide the smell of soiled diapers were found inside the 2-foot-by-3-foot box. Shannon had been inside the box for about half a day before authorities found her late Wednesday, but she might have been in and out of the box for several days, investigators said.","7-month-old Florida girl reported missing, found in small box under baby sitter's bed .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Two barrels filled with explosives washed up on beaches in Israel on Monday, according to Israeli authorities. Authorities disposed of both without injury. Islamic Jihad, the Fatah Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades issued a leaflet in Gaza claiming responsibility for sending three explosive devices to Ashkelon and Ashdod. A large barrel filled with explosives was found on a beach in the Ashkelon area Monday morning. The beach was closed. Policemen and bomb disposal experts neutralized the explosives, according to police spokesman Miki Rosenfeld. A second barrel filled with explosives was discovered later in the day on the shore of the city of Ashdod. Authorities conducted a controlled explosion on the second barrel. Police were combing the beaches, and nearby areas were closed to the public. Authorities have not discussed a third device. The Israel Defense Forces, in a statement Monday, said several Palestinian groups had claimed responsibility January 29 for a maritime terrorist attack after the detonation of two sea-born explosive devices about two kilometers (1.24 miles) off the coast of Gaza. Hamas, the movement controlling Gaza, has been vowing retaliation since one of the founding members of its military wing, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, died last week in Dubai. Al-Mabhouh's brother, Fayek al-Mabhouh, said that preliminary results of Hamas' investigation of the death showed his brother was killed by electrocution and strangulation with a piece of cloth. Hamas officials accused Israel of assassinating Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. Israeli officials have not responded to those charges.","Authorities dispose of two barrels filled with explosives; no injuries reported .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain scored the goals that gave Real Madrid a 2-0 win at Racing Santander on Sunday -- a result that sees Manuel Pelegrini's side return to the top of the Spanish Primera Liga. Real's 12 consecutive league victory ensured that Real will face title rivals Barcelona in next weekend's crunch league match in pole position on goal difference. Barcelona's 4-1 victory at home to Athletic Bilbao on Saturday ensured that Real needed another win to regain top spot and they took the lead in the 24th minute. Ronaldo teased a foul out of Jose Moraton in the penalty area and from the resulting spot-kick, the Portuguese international fired home his 18th league goal of the season. Despite dominating the match, Madrid had to wait until the 76th minute for their second goal, Higuain sliding the ball home from Guti's pass for his 24th goal of the season, two behind Lionel Messi at the top of the scoring charts. Meanwhile, Spanish international striker David Villa took his season's goal tally to 20 with two late goals as Valencia defeated Osasuna 3-0, to take a firm grip on third position.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Love it or hate it, the Hummer came to symbolize American might over the years -- tires the size of Texas, a chrome grill that looked primed to eat up wimpy cars in its path, and its drivers with egos to match their mammoth-mobiles. But the iconic vehicle -- a symbol for macho men like Arnold Schwarzenegger and ridiculed worldwide by environmentalists -- is headed toward the auto graveyard. General Motors last week announced the likely end of the Hummer after a deal with a Chinese automaker fell through. The news thrilled many who have protested the guzzler for years: Good riddance! But for Hummer owners, the reaction remains mixed. Most mourn the impending death of their beloved behemoths but celebrate the fact that the Hummer won't be outsourced to China: Whose harebrained idea was that anyway?! Ain't no Hummer meant to be made in China! Owners are hoping for a last-minute buyer to emerge before the Hummer joins the maligned Pinto in the scrapyard. GM has said it is trying to salvage the Hummer, setting May 1 as a deadline for other possible deals to be made. A single sticky note, left on Russ Builta's 2005 Hummer, sums up the emotion stirred by the super-sized SUVs. ""You are polluting our air and abusing our national resources,"" the unsigned note said. ""And all because of greed and selfishness. You should be very ashamed of yourself."" Builta, who served in the Marine Corps, still gets mad: ""It was not even on recycled paper!"" Builta installed a supercharger that gave his Hummer a whopping 600 horsepower. When he really mashed the pedal, it got 1 mile per gallon. ""It would just move,"" he told CNN iReport. Check out Builta's mega-ride . After the HMMWV rolled off the AM General assembly line in Indiana on January 2, 1985, it represented a new breed of American military might and toughness. In 1992, production of the civilian Hummer began, instantly creating a fraternity among owners of the SUV-on-growth hormone. They exchange photos of their trucks, chat over the Internet and plan for their next muddin' sessions. They laugh at tree huggers who give them the finger as they cruise down the road. ""I hate to see it die,"" says iReporter Michael Tawdy of Tennessee, who owns a 2006 H3. ""You can go anywhere you want."" Hummer: What might have been . The Hummer even shares its name with a sexual term. How many cars can stake that claim? And the vehicle became fodder for late-night comedians and Internet jokes. ""You might be driving a Hummer,"" says one joke on a Web site devoted to the vehicle, ""if you can't reach far enough to slap the person sitting in the passenger seat."" The grass-roots social justice group CodePink created an anti-Hummer campaign during the height of the Bush administration, including a Top Ten Reasons Not To Buy A Hummer. At the top of the list: ""The Gas Mileage Alone Will Kill You."" Billy Paniaha of North Carolina gets speechless when talking about his chrome-and-gray-mobile. ""I love my Hummer,"" he told iReport. In one photo, he's leaning against his mud-caked Hummer, which looks like it just wallowed in a pigpen. ""Trust me, these tree huggers in their Priuses. ... If a Prius hits me, I won't get hurt. They will."" Paniaha hot-dogs in mud . Raymond Winbush isn't your ordinary Hummer owner. A lover of his giant SUV, he also owns -- are you ready for this? -- a Toyota Prius. ""People think I'm kidding when I say I have both cars, but I do,"" said Winbush, an author and the director of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University. ""If you combine my carbon footprint ... I don't feel real guilty about it."" A resident of Baltimore, Maryland, he uses the Hummer to get through the East Coast's brutal winters. During last month's storm, which left the region under a couple of feet of snow, he helped get doctors and nurses to and from a hospital, thanks to his Hummer. When winter ends, his machismo-meter goes down. He grabs his man purse and hops into his Prius. ""My son calls it the nerd-mobile,"" he said. ""I've had more people razz me about the Prius than I have the Hummer."" ""It's my yin and yang. I think they balance each other out."" Winbush: Why I own a Hummer and Prius . Candi Angotti of Texas is just the opposite. She wouldn't be caught dead in a Prius. The president of the Texas chapter of Club Hummer Offroad, she's been driving her solar-flare metallic orange Hummer for three years. ""I use it what it was built for -- off-roading and adventures -- and it has never let me down,"" she said. ""I have met a great group of guys and girls, and we're like a big family."" See Texas woman catch air in Hummer . The owners now have one more thing in common: They're sporting a likely collector's item. But Builta's the exception. He got rid of his Hummer.

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Christiane Amanpour meets the Dalai Lama and some of his unruly flock in ""Buddha's Warriors"" airing Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 11 p.m. ET . The Dalai Lama cracked jokes and chatted when a storm knocked out power during his interview with CNN. DHARAMSALA, India (CNN) -- I never knew much about Buddhism, and was not expecting much, spiritually, from covering the Dalai Lama. But what happened just goes to show how the unlikeliest events can affect you at the unlikeliest times. I flew from covering the historic visit of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in North Korea to Dharamsala, India. This is the home-in-exile of the Dalai Lama and his government, as well as thousands of Tibetan monks and supporters. Our visit coincided with the events that commemorate each March 10, the date the Dalai Lama fled Tibet on horseback in 1959. He managed to evade the Chinese Communist forces, disguised as a soldier and escaping at night. The somber remembrance is a little like what the Palestinians do every year. They call it al-Nakba, or ""catastrophe,"" which marks 1948 when they lost much of their land as the state of Israel was founded. This year, however, the March 10 anniversary took on a more ominous tone. It was the first time the growing split among Tibetan exiles burst into the open. Some of the younger generation of exiles are losing faith in the Dalai Lama's abandonment of the dream of Tibetan independence. Some want action, even if it might mean abandoning their peaceful Buddhist way. I wanted to ask the Dalai Lama about this and where he thought it would lead. The day we visited, we attended a ""Long Life Ceremony"" in which thousands of Tibetans come from all over India and across the Himalayas from Tibet to catch a glimpse of their spiritual leader, to pray for his continued health and long life and to bestow their most precious gifts upon him, including cubes of dried cheese wrapped in muslin, textiles and tapestries. It went on for more than two hours. I never thought I would sit through the whole thing, but something about the chanting, the incense and the vital connection between the Dalai Lama and his adoring flock was mesmerizing.  Watch: Amanpour investigates new breed of Buddhists » . As a journalist and an observer, I was transfixed. Even though the Dalai Lama has spent nearly 60 years in exile, people are still so faithful to him, so respectful, weeping, bowing low as they pass him sitting high above on his throne-like dais. He towers over them, and yet there is nothing removed or dictatorial about him.  See behind-the-scenes photos from Buddha's Warriors » . Afterwards we prepared for our interview. He gives many, and I wondered what we could elicit from him that would be new or noteworthy. As our cameramen were setting up, I hung around outside to quietly watch as he received the first of many visitors that day: dignitaries, ordinary tourists, prayer groups and school groups.  I've found you can tell almost everything about a person by observing the way they deal with others. He was kind, witty, warm, laugh-out-loud funny and deeply moved by some of the personal tales he heard from those visitors seeking his advice and blessing. I thought about how he must do this so many hundreds of thousands of times and yet he had time for everyone, treating each one like a VIP. Once we sat down, I was immediately slightly thrown off by his style. He told us very clearly that what the Chinese are doing in Tibet amounts to ""cultural genocide."" And then he burst into his trademark giggles. I couldn't fully understand why, but it is apparently the Buddhist way to laugh off life's horrors, and thus survive.  Learn about Tibet's history of conflict » . He went on to tell us, with great earnestness, how he approves of the Olympic Games being held in Beijing and how he is not trying to seek full independence from China, just what he calls cultural autonomy. This man, who is lionized for his quiet spirituality and for being a one-man movement of conscience, who had won a Nobel Peace Prize, calls himself a simple Buddhist monk. As we sat there, suddenly a thunderstorm broke and all our lights went out and we were plunged into darkness. Any other important interviewee would have swept out to rest while we dealt with it. Not the Dalai Lama. He sat there with us in the dark, cracking jokes and chatting, as we waited for the generator to kick in. The Chinese government says the Dalai Lama is lying when he says he does not want independence from China. They call him a wolf in sheep's clothing. So why, I wondered, would he not overtly support the young generation of Tibetans who want a more proactive policy of confronting China? Over and again I asked him about the split among his ranks. He said he would not condemn them as he believed in democracy and free speech. But nor would he support their tactics or their goals. He just kept asking (rhetorically) a simple question: With what are we going to fight them? Are we 6 million Tibetans going to confront the army of 1.2 billion people? How? The Chinese government refused repeatedly to talk to us and accused us of trying to ""beatify"" the Dalai Lama. I couldn't help wondering why they won't talk to him or meet him halfway. They may be trying to wait out the 74-year-old Dalai Lama. But they must know they'll have much more trouble on their hands once he is gone and the angry younger generation takes over.","Christiane Amanpour traveled to India to meet with the exiled Dalai Lama .

"(CNN) -- Former 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards, who admitted last week that he fathered a child with a videographer who worked on his campaign, has legally separated from his wife, Elizabeth, a source close to her said Wednesday. The source would not say when the separation occurred, only that it happened a while ago. The source said he or she spoke to Elizabeth Edwards in recent days, and would not speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation. John Edwards issued a statement Wednesday, calling it ""an extraordinarily sad moment, but I love my children more than anything and still care deeply about Elizabeth."" Elizabeth Edwards' publisher, Random House, released a statement saying, ""Elizabeth is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her. It was an excruciatingly painful period for her and she [has] no interest in rehashing the past."" News of the separation comes a week before a tell-all book by Andrew Young, a one-time close confidante of John Edwards, is set to hit bookstores. ""Based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available, it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations,"" the statement from Random House said. ""[Elizabeth Edwards] will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges, but would like to set the record straight on two key points. ""First, the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable, hurtful and patently false. Second, she believed Andrew Young to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity to her this past summer. She will have nothing further to say."" Edwards, 56, had denied he was the father of his mistress Rielle Hunter's infant for more than a year, saying his self-admitted affair with her was over before she became pregnant. People magazine, a CNN sister organization, first reported the story. Elizabeth Edwards' sister, Nancy Anania, told People magazine in an article dated Wednesday that Elizabeth Edwards told her, ""I've had it. I can't do this. I want my life back."" The sister told the magazine, ""She's got cancer and has young children and totally believes in marriage ... but she can only do so much."" Read the People story . John Edwards, a former U.S. senator from North Carolina, sought his party's presidential nomination in 2004 and 2008. On November 3, 2004, the day her husband and Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, conceded the presidential race, Elizabeth Edwards revealed she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She discovered a lump in her right breast the last week of the campaign, but said she withheld the diagnosis from her husband to spare him the distraction during the campaign. She announced in 2007 that the cancer had recurred. Last year, she told CNN's Larry King that the medicine she was taking seemed to be working. However, she said the situation was ""up and down."" Elizabeth Edwards, 60, and her husband have been married for 32 years. They had four children together. The oldest , Wade, died in a car accident in 1996.

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Charlie Rangel temporarily stepped down as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, a decision forced by a growing storm of ethics controversies threatening the longtime congressman. The 20-term New York Democrat told reporters he had submitted a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requesting a temporary leave of absence until a broad-reaching House ethics committee investigation concludes. ""In order to avoid my colleagues' having to defend me during their elections, I have this morning sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi asking her to grant me a leave of absence until such time as the ethics committee completes its work,"" Rangel said Wednesday. In a statement, Pelosi said she had accepted Rangel's request and praised the congressman for ""his decades of leadership on jobs, health care and the most significant economic issues of the day."" Read Rangel's letter to Pelosi . The night before Rangel said he had no plans to step aside from his powerful post. The Ways and Means Committee is responsible for drafting the nation's tax policies. Rangel is being investigated for, among other things, failing to pay taxes on a home in the Dominican Republic. The congressman also has admitted failing to report several hundred thousand dollars in assets on federal disclosure forms. In addition, he is under scrutiny for the purported misuse of a rent-controlled apartment for political purposes, as well as for allegedly preserving tax benefits for an oil-drilling company in exchange for donations to a project he supported at the City College of New York. Rangel was formally admonished Friday by the House ethics committee for violating rules on receiving gifts. Specifically, the committee found that Rangel violated House gift rules by accepting reimbursement payments for travel to conferences in the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008. Rangel's staff, according to the committee, knew that corporations had given money to the Carib News, which sponsored the events. That fact had not been divulged to the ethics committee when Rangel asked for and received approval to attend the trips, according to the committee's report. The committee found that while Rangel did not know about the contributions, he was nevertheless responsible. A source told CNN on Tuesday that if Rangel stepped aside, senior Ways and Means Democrat Pete Stark would take over as the committee's chairman ""on a temporary basis."" House Republicans plan to introduce a resolution Wednesday calling on Rangel to permanently step down and again force House Democrats to go on record defending him. They issued a statement after Rangel's announcement, calling his decision to temporarily step aside an ""embarrassing episode"" for the Democratic majority. ""Nancy Pelosi's promise to run the 'most ethical Congress in history' has been reduced to a punch line, and as a result she is presiding over a caucus in chaos,"" said GOP spokesman Ken Spain. ""The Democrats -- under Speaker Pelosi's leadership -- are incapable of leading the United States Congress."" House Democrats have blocked previous GOP resolutions on the House floor, but several Democrats in competitive districts have come out publicly in recent days, saying they thought it was time for Rangel to step down. Rangel is a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has 42 members in the House.

"(CNN) -- Jessica Simpson's name dominated headlines for months in 2009 as critics picked apart everything from her weight to her romantic relationships. The onslaught of attention was so extreme, Simpson said on Wednesday's ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" she couldn't escape it. ""The judgment of people. ... Those voices are sometimes in my head when I fall asleep,"" the singer said. Even when she's walking through an airport, she isn't free from people's opinions, she said. ""I was going through security getting a pat down, and the woman goes, 'Oh, you're really not that big,' "" Simpson recalled. ""I walk away from a moment like that thinking that people really think that I'm 245 pounds."" But the numbers on her scale haven't been her only public embarrassment. Simpson's romantic life also became fodder for the media after former boyfriend John Mayer told Playboy magazine that having sex with her was like being exposed to ""sexual napalm."" ""I couldn't read the John Mayer article,"" Simpson said. ""I heard about it and I saw some of the clips. I tried to read it, and I was so disappointed in him ... it made me so sad. It was so discouraging, because that's not the John I knew."" While Simpson doesn't want people to know the intimate details of her personal life, she admits it could've been a lot worse. ""My phone is ringing off the hook, I must say,"" she laughed. All jokes aside, Simpson said she did feel betrayed by her ex-boyfriend, whom she dated on and off for two years, and has yet to accept his apology. ""I don't resent him,"" she said, ""but I'm just going to let that part of my life go."" Yet of all the events in the past few years that have affected Simpson, the now infamous pair of ""mom jeans"" she wore while performing at a chili cook-off in January 2009 have taken the greatest toll. ""The sad part about it is that when everything came out, I didn't want to sit down and talk to anyone about it because I felt guilty,"" she said. ""I felt like if people look at me and they're a size bigger, they think they're fat because of what the media was saying. I didn't want to feed into it."" Now, Simpson said she's found self-acceptance. ""I'm comfortable with me. I love my curves. I'm not ever going to be a size 0 and weigh 90 pounds,"" she said. Simpson dropped weight for her 2005 film, ""The Dukes of Hazzard,"" but insisted it was just for a role. The constant chatter about her dress size was part of the inspiration for Simpson's VH1 show, ""The Price of Beauty,"" in which she visits seven countries to learn the lengths that women go to for beauty. Cameras follow Simpson -- accompanied by friends Ken Paves, a celebrity hairstylist, and CaCee Cobb -- as she tries a flesh-eating fish pedicure in Japan and a detoxifying drink made from cow urine in India. Simpson says filming the show has given her a new outlook on what it means to feel beautiful. ""No one else can define beauty but me,"" she said. ""Nobody's words, nobody's compliments, nobody's love -- it's all what I have within myself. I finally relaxed, and I don't care what people have to say about my weight. I think I look great.""","Jessica Simpson has been silent about the gossip surrounding her weight and relationships .

"SACRAMENTO, California (CNN) -- For more than two years, undercover cops on the Sacramento Police Department's vice squad have been working one of the most draining beats: trying to crack down on online child prostitution. Sacramento police have nabbed nearly 70 underage girls for child prostitution since 2005. Police have nabbed nearly 70 girls under the age of 18 since 2005. Most of the girls were released to foster or group homes. Those are just the official figures; investigators think there are many more child prostitutes out there. It is no easy task. ""We're asking these girls to do a big thing ... which is to stop what they're doing,"" said Sgt. Pam Seyffert of the Sacramento Police Department. ""Stop what's working for them. Surviving is basically what they're doing."" Sacramento police are working with the FBI as part of a nationwide campaign to combat underage prostitution called Innocence Lost. The goal of the program, which is now in almost 30 U.S. cities, is to decriminalize the girls and concentrate on catching the pimps who control them. ""It really makes me angry,"" Seyffert said. ""I think everybody on the team has different reactions to it, but I just flat out get really angry that some guy thinks he can take this girl and basically deprive her of her freedom."" It is not uncommon for the officers on the unit to put in 30-hour shifts. Oftentimes, their work is heart-wrenching.  Watch how investigators work to catch pimps » . Child prostitution is even tougher on the parents of these girls. Roslyn and Sergio's daughter had been missing for more than two weeks. They waited for hours at police headquarters in hopes that their daughter would be found. Vice squad officers found her in a downtown apartment with Bruce William Carter, a 21-year-old man who police said had posed on the Internet holding fistfuls of cash. He pleaded not guilty to charges of statutory rape and was held in lieu of $35,000 bail. The couple's daughter, who had just turned 17, was detained but not arrested. ""It hurt,"" said Roslyn, who appeared weary and a bit shell-shocked. ""Because you don't want to see your children involved in things like this. You don't realize how dangerous the Internet is. Now, we got to keep her away from the Internet."" Police say most of the ads appear on Craigslist, the popular and free Internet classifieds site, under a category named ""Erotic Services."" Even though Craigslist has posted a bold disclaimer warning against human trafficking and the exploitation of children, law enforcement officials said it doesn't seem to deter girls from posting the ads or men who are searching for sex. But why would a girl sell her body online? To help answer that question, Sacramento police made arrangements for CNN to interview a 14-year-old girl who said she'd started selling herself as a prostitute at the age of 11. ""I wanted to feel loved. ... I wanted to feel important,"" said the teen, who did not want to be identified. She said she used Craigslist because it was free and she could post dozens of ads a day. Even though she understood the seriousness of what she was doing, she said she didn't care. ""You could put stuff in your ad like 'wet and wild,' 'fun and sassy,' things like that to catch their attention, to make them want you,"" she said. Craigslist executives said they abhor the fact that their site is being used for child prostitution but believe that the problem could be harder to track if they removed the category. ""It would be a bigger problem if we removed that category and had those ads spread throughout the site,"" said Jim Buckmaster, chief executive officer of Craigslist. Both legal experts and police say Craigslist bears no legal responsibility. Undercover officers said the fact that the listings can be traced helps them pinpoint the girls and sometimes leads them to pimps. For her part, Roslyn has a strong message for the man arrested in connection with her daughter's detention. ""I want him to stay away from my daughter,"" she said. ""I'm going to put a restraining order on him. Every time he goes near my daughter, I'm going to call the police and have him put in jail."" Even though they have more work than they can handle, vice officers hold out hope that they can save more girls from a life of prostitution.","Underage girls are selling sex in free Internet classifieds, police say .

The Grammy Award-winning artist, whose real name is Dwayne Carter, is due for sentencing in February. His trial had been scheduled to begin in January. When he was indicted in February 2008, Carter pleaded not guilty to a charge of criminal possession of a weapon, the district attorney's office said. His guilty plea Thursday was to a reduced charge. He was arrested in July 2007. Police officers said Carter and another man were smoking marijuana on a street, and the officers found a .40-caliber pistol in Carter's possession. Born and raised in New Orleans, Carter launched his solo career at age 16 with the release of ""Tha Block is Hot"" in 1999.

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN)  -- Holding the Olympic medal she and her mom always wanted, Joannie Rochette finally smiled and talked about when she was a young skater and desperately wanted to make her mother proud. Her mom, Therese, was her biggest supporter and sometimes her biggest critic, she said. She wasn't the best ""coach,"" and she was kind of picky, but she had such a good eye, Rochette said. She was always encouraging, too, even when she was finding fault. ""And even though she's not here anymore, I'm not afraid to say it, sometimes she was a pain in the ass,"" Rochette said laughing, probably for the first time in days. Rochette made her mom very proud Thursday night, winning a bronze medal in the women's figure skating final, just four days after Therese Rochette died of a heart attack. Without her mother to support her, Joannie Rochette skated into Canada's collective heart by relying on all those years of training, all those years of committing jumps and spins to muscle memory. And when she needed it most, she relied on the memory of how her mom would always convince her that she was going to be on the Olympic medals podium. ""It feels good for me to talk about her,"" she said, joyfully recounting the many times her mom took her to practice and stay when the other moms left. She laughed when she told how her mom would assess a school test score of 98 with a ""What about those other two points?"" ""She was my biggest fan, my best friend. She was with me every step of the way,"" she said. When things weren't going so well in the first week Rochette was here for Olympics training, she called her mom, seeking her advice on what to do about her triple Lutz. Her mom assured her it would be all right, that she just needed to visualize doing it well in her head, that this was something she had done for years. But doing what she did this week was something no person can ever be prepared for. To compete in the spotlight of the Olympics' marquee event, in front of an expectant and hopeful home crowd, with the heartache of her mother's death so present would take strength most of us cannot imagine. But the people closest to her knew she had that strength. Her coach, Manon Perron, said there was never any doubt that Rochette would skate and never a doubt that she wouldn't be standing on the medals podium. ""Never ... because she was so ready and the goal was so strong,"" Perron said, just like a proud mom. ""I've been with her since she was 12 so we just have to look into each other's eyes and we know right away. It was really hard on her because her mom was the biggest thing in her life, but she's not a quitter."" Rochette said she struggled more than she showed during Tuesday night's short program that captivated the skating world. When she stepped on the ice, her legs were shaking, she said. With mom in 'heart and soul,' Rochette goes for medal . ""I don't know how I ever got through this whole program. I'm sure my mom was there with me,"" she said. Rochette was third after the short program -- 7.14 points behind Kim Yu-Na of South Korea and 2.42 points behind Mao Asada of Japan -- who skated just before her. The free skate scores are weighted more and account for roughly two-thirds of a skater's total. Kim made it impossible for Rochette to dream of gold with an amazing free skate that was the best ever under the 6-year-old scoring system -- 150.06. The score was so high it would have beaten seven skaters' combined marks on its own. Her total of 228.56 is also a record. Asada then put up a 131.72, virtually clinching silver. Rochette came on the ice, looking determined, to the hockey-like cheers of the 14,000 at Pacific Coliseum. She needed a perfect skate for silver but on a triple flip, she stumbled and her chance for second place slipped away. Later in the program she had a bit of a shaky landing after another jump, but she stayed on her feet. After she finished she blew a kiss into the air, and came to the waiting area where she, in French, covered her heart with her right hand and spoke to her mother. Joannie Rochette opted to stay in the games, and two days later stirred a crowd with a courageous performance. ""Her mother is inside her heart and soul, so she'll be there for her,"" her agent Dave Baden told CNN on Wednesday, ""and [Joannie] will draw from that strength."" Therese Rochette herself wrote of the bond she had with her daughter in an e-mail interview with The Christian Science Monitor in January. She said that she was the first person her daughter called whenever a problem occurred, though Joannie didn't need a great amount of support, the Monitor reported this week. ""The hurdles she faces motivate her to rise above them,"" Therese Rochette wrote to the Monitor. ""Joannie has always been naturally determined and persevering."" Joannie Rochette rose through the ranks of Canadian skaters, winning junior national titles before winning six straight senior national championships from 2005 to 2010. In 2006, she placed fifth at the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and last year she finished second at the World Figure Skating Championships in Los Angeles, California. Liz Manley was the last skater to medal for Canada, earning silver at the 1988 Calgary Games.","Joannie Rochette earns bronze medal in women's figure skating .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Some know Emmitt Smith as the National Football League's all-time leading rusher. Others recognize him as a three-time Super Bowl champion or a Dancing with the Stars winner. But do you really know who Emmitt is? Until he traced his genealogy for the NBC reality series ""Who Do You Think You Are?"", Emmitt says he didn't even know the answer to that question. To find out more about himself and the family members who paved the way for his success, this hall-of-fame inductee followed his roots to Burnt Corn, Alabama, the town where his great-grandmother was born. ""I feel like a detective on a hunt trying to find clues,"" he says. In Burnt Corn, Emmitt wandered into a convenience store and asked a clerk if he knew two of his relatives, Bill and Victoria Watson. Coincidentally, Joe, the clerk, turned out to be Emmitt's second cousin. Oprah.com: How to dig up your own family history . Emmitt soon learned that his great-great-grandmother, Victoria, had an unusual maiden name -- Puryear. Genealogist Marjorie Sholes told Emmitt that ""Puryear"" was probably the name of a slave owner. ""African-Americans, at the end of the Civil War, sometimes picked the names of their last slave owner,"" she says. The next step? Emmitt went in search of Victoria's parents' names. In an old ledger, Marjorie found a man named Prince Puryear who was described with the letter ""m,"" which meant mulatto. ""Specifically, black/white race,"" she says. Oprah.com: Chris Rock uncovers his genetic roots . They also discovered that Prince's mom was a woman named Mariah. ""Now, I know that Prince was mixed race and born into slavery,"" Emmitt says. ""If Mariah was his mother, could she be the link between the black and the white side of my family?"" To explore this theory, Emmitt traveled to Mecklenburg, Virginia, to learn more about a notorious slave trader who owned Mariah at some point in history. The man's name was Alexander Puryear. Virginia historian John Caknipe said Samuel Puryear, Alexander's father, might be the link to Mariah. To find out for sure, John selected a book of old deeds from a shelf. The number on the book was 22 -- the same number Emmitt wore on the football field for 15 years. ""I've been wearing jersey number 22 since college,"" he says. ""Maybe it is my destiny, and I've always believed I was a child of destiny, but, whew, this is ... it's making me a little bit nervous."" Emmitt says the family history he unearthed in book 22 shook him to the core. John helped him find a property deed stating that Mariah was transferred from Samuel to his son, Alexander. ""Samuel probably had her bred,"" John says. ""Then, when she got old enough, he gave her to his son. ... They raised and bred horses, and raised and bred slaves."" ""In other words, the horses were more important than any slaves that they ever had,"" Emmitt says. ""They treated my people like animals...but worse than animals."" The deed stated that Mariah was passed down along with a horse bridle and a saddle. ""She was such a young woman,"" Emmitt says. ""I have a 13-year-old daughter right now, and I have a 10-year-old daughter right now. I couldn't imagine them being passed down through slavery that way."" Professor Steven Deyle, a domestic slave trade historian, says it's safe to assume that Samuel was, in fact, Mariah's father. ""Alexander was engaged in this horrible, horrible traffic and why he didn't sell Mariah is because he recognized Mariah as his sister,"" Steven says. After discovering the horrors his family endured, Emmitt says he's even more thankful for the power of progress. ""I thank God for people who stood up for equality for all of us,"" he says. Emmitt says he felt the true power of his newfound knowledge while sitting on the porch of an old slave quarters in Clayborn, Alabama. ""That house down in Clayborn is where I started to put things together,"" he says. ""And right then and there, I sensed that my ancestors were crying out to me because they were lost for so many years, and here, their great-great-grandson is going on the journey to find who they were."" While Emmitt sat on the porch, it started to rain. ""It was coming to me all at one time, and it was incredible,"" he says. ""Oftentimes, people want closure, and I felt like my folks did not have closure. At that time, when I found that information, I felt like they were crying out, 'We got closure now.'"" After learning what he could from dusty record books, Emmitt took the next step in his genealogical journey and had a DNA test. The results showed him that he's 81 percent African, 12 percent European and 7 percent Asian, which is most likely Native American ancestry. Emmitt's journey has come to an end, but he encourages anyone who's curious about their roots to follow in his footsteps. ""You must go do this yourself,"" he says. ""It's extremely important. It's critical. It will help shape your vision in terms of how you go forward. It will also help you appreciate your past."" Oprah.com: Lisa Kudrow solves a family mystery .

"London, England (CNN) -- The attackers who planted a car bomb outside a courthouse in Northern Ireland Monday night gave only 17 minutes warning before the explosion, the Police Service of Northern Ireland told CNN Tuesday. ""It is a miracle that no one was killed or seriously injured,"" PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott said. ""It is only thanks to a member of the public contacting us that we are not dealing with fatalities this morning."" The car was packed with about 250 pounds (113 kilograms) of explosives, police estimate. A local hospital in the town of Newry got a warning call at 10:20 p.m. local time (7:20 p.m. ET) and a business was phoned two minutes later. The bomb went off at 10:37 p.m., a police representative said. That ""is not enough time to evacuate a public area,"" a police representative said. British police spokesmen traditionally do not identify themselves by name. A member of the public reported a car being abandoned at about 10 p.m., she said. That appears to have given police extra time to respond. Baggott blamed the attack on ""dissident republicans,"" pro-Irish militants who reject the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that sharply reduced violence in the province. They ""simply want to drag Northern Ireland back to the dark days of the past,"" Baggott said, condemning ""cowardly attacks"" by ""terrorists"" who ""want to destroy all that is good about Northern Ireland and have no place in a modern civilized society."" ""This is not an attack on a court building, this is an attack on people whose lives depend on the well-being of Newry,"" he added. ""This is an attack that broke and damaged places of worship... damaged the ability of Newry to be at the heart of our economic success."" Newry is about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of the provincial capital, Belfast. Prime Minister Gordon Brown's office ""strongly condemned"" the bombing, saying Tuesday it was the work of a ""tiny minority."" The ""attack"" is ""entirely unrepresentative of the views of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland,"" said a statement from Brown's Downing Street office. The court building was badly damaged and businesses in the area were evacuated, police said. Northern Ireland was wracked for decades by violence between pro-British unionists and pro-Irish republicans. About 3,000 people died in the ""Troubles,"" as the violence was known, before the tenuous peace agreement was hammered out in 1998. There has been sporadic violence since then. A booby-trapped car exploded on January 8, severely injuring Constable Peadar Heffron. A car bomb partly exploded outside the headquarters of the Policing Board of Northern Ireland on November 21, and another under-car booby trap exploded on October 22 in east Belfast, injuring a woman, the PSNI said. Two soldiers and a policeman were shot dead in separate attacks in March 2009. The two biggest parties in the province, the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and the pro-Irish Sinn Fein, reached a deal earlier this month to bring police powers under local control, averting a crisis that had threatened to force new elections.","Attackers who planted bomb in N.

"(CNN) -- The ""disgusting"" blob in Fred DeNegri's Diet Pepsi can was probably a frog or toad, the Food and Drug Administration said. Amy DeNegri took pictures of the can in question right after her husband gagged on its contents. DeNegri was grilling in his backyard tiki bar in Ormond Beach, Florida, when he popped open a can of Diet Pepsi, took a big gulp and started gagging, his wife, Amy, said. He emptied out the can down a sink but something heavy remained inside. He shook the can until something resembling ""pink linguini"" slid out, followed by ""dark stuff,"" Amy DeNegri said. But the heavy object inside the can never came out, she said. ""It was disgusting,"" said Amy DeNegri, 54. ""And now, what started out as a normal afternoon in our tiki bar has blown up into this crazy thing."" The DeNegris took pictures before calling poison control and the FDA, which showed up the next day to examine the can in question and collect it for lab testing. The couple received a copy of the completed report last week from the Food and Drug Administration Office of Regulatory Affairs, which concluded the foreign matter appeared to be a frog or a toad.  Watch CNN's Nicole Lapin discuss the results » . ""The animal was lacking internal organs normally found in the abdominal and thoracic cavity,"" the report notes. A second, closed can from the same 36-pack of Diet Pepsi from Sam's Club, was also submitted for testing, according to Amy DeNegri. No abnormalities were detected, the report states. The FDA also conducted an investigation at the local Pepsi bottling plant in Orlando from August 4 to 11 and ""did not find any adverse conditions or association to this problem,"" spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey said. ""We have not determined when or how the contamination occurred,"" DeLancey said in an e-mail. Pepsi says the FDA results ""affirmed"" the company's confidence ""in the quality of our products and the integrity of our manufacturing system,"" according to spokesman Jeff Dahncke. ""The speed of our production lines and the rigor of our quality control systems make it virtually impossible for this type of thing to happen in a production environment. In fact, there never has been even a single instance when a claim of this nature has been traced back to a manufacturing issue,"" Dahncke said in an e-mail. ""The FDA conducted a thorough inspection of our Orlando facility and found no cause for concern. In this case, the FDA simply was unable to determine when or how the specimen entered the package."" When asked if Pepsi believed it was not responsible for the animal getting into the can, Dahncke said, ""We have addressed the facts of the investigation and stated our position. It's not appropriate for us to comment beyond that."" But the DeNegris say they're hopping mad over Pepsi's handling of the matter. Amy DeNegri said she hasn't heard from Pepsi since the day after the incident occurred, when she spoke with someone over the phone. At first, the woman was apologetic, but DeNegri says her attitude changed after she told her that the FDA was coming to take the can for testing. ""She asked for my pictures, I sent them and never heard back,"" she said. The retired school staffer says she and her husband are seeking legal advice to examine their options. ""I want to see Pepsi fess up to it and compensate my husband for the negative publicity they have caused,"" she said. ""I'm easy, but they're the ones that are making it hard."" CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.","Fred DeNegri and wife found matter resembling ""pink linguini"" in Pepsi can in July .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Nine people killed in a military action targeting militants in eastern Afghanistan apparently were members of an insurgent network, a U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday. ""The operation was against a network of folks, who had been tracked for a while, involved in producing IEDs as well as some criminal activity,"" said the official, who asked not to be named. ""As a result of the action, the best info that we have is that nine of those militants in that network were killed. That's based on weapons and IED components at the scene,"" and it appears the nine were males, the official said. IED is the acronym for improvised explosive device, which is a roadside bomb. U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan said Monday they were investigating reports that 10 Afghan civilians, including eight students, were killed Saturday in a coalition operation in the Narang district of Kunar province. Said Fazelayallah, governor of Kunar province, told CNN Monday that 10 civilians, in fact, were killed. Coalition forces said they killed their targets, he said, but a delegation sent by the governor to investigate reported the civilian casualties. Civilian casualties in the Afghan war have stoked outrage among the citizenry and Afghan authorities. U.S. and other international forces have been working to stop such fatalities, and they have accused Taliban militants of putting civilians in harm's way. The United Nations in Afghanistan said on Tuesday that from January to October of this year, 1,404 deaths have been caused by insurgents; 465 have been caused by pro-government forces, such as NATO's International Security Assistance Force; and other causes have led to 165 civilian deaths. In this Kunar province incident, Fazelayallah said the operation was launched without the knowledge of government officials in the province. The U.S. military source said it was ""a joint operation with Afghan and U.S. forces."" The numbers of civilian casualties have fallen off in recent months, since Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal took over as U.S. commander in Afghanistan. The military's goal is to protect population centers to enable the government to improve security and governance, McChrystal told CNN's Christiane Amanpour earlier this month. Civilian casualties, he said, make it less likely that the Afghans will support the coalition. ""It is better to miss a target than to cause civilian casualties,"" he said. ""We can always target enemy leaders later. We can't make up for the fact that we killed civilians.""

"(CNN) -- Skeletal remains found in a hayfield are those of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police said Wednesday. The remains were identified based on dental records provided by the victim's family, spokeswoman Corinne Geller said. Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old education major, went to a Metallica concert at the University of Virginia's John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia, on October 17. She was separated from her friends and was the subject of repeated searches. ""Investigators are now working to determine how the remains came to be in this particular location, cause and time of death, and identifying who was responsible for the remains being there,"" Geller said in a news release. More information is expected after the completion of an autopsy, the spokeswoman added. Police said skeletal remains were found Tuesday morning by a farmer driving a tractor through a hay field on his 700-acre farm. The area has no public access point, police said. The farm is about 10 miles from where the concert was being held. The farm's owner, David Dass, told CNN affiliate WTVR that he was out looking for damage after wind and rain knocked down several trees in his yard over the past week. He told WTVR that the area is at least a mile and a half from a main roadway. ""I looked down and saw what looked like a human skull, and my first thought was that it was Morgan Harrington,"" Dass told WTVR, adding that he immediately called 911. WTVR: State police 'confident' remains are Harrington . There was significant evidence leading police to believe that the remains are Harrington's, Virginia State Police Col. W. Steven Flaherty said, though he declined to specify what the evidence was. Police said the area where the remains were found had not been searched during the early stages of the investigation into her disappearance. The girl's parents, Dan and Gil Harrington, were in town to identify the remains, WTVR reported. Dan Harrington, in tears, told WTVR that ""this is a horrible day"" for his family. Gil Harrington expressed concerns Saturday that there was beginning to be complacency in the search, she wrote in a blog on the Web site set up to help find their daughter. On Sunday, more than three months after Morgan went missing, Gil Harrington still clung to hope. ""Despite the length of time Morgan has been gone I remain hopeful,"" she wrote. ""Part of me is waiting to be surprised. Waiting for God to pull the rabbit out of the hat and bring Morgan home. ""I remember that the light always returns, it cannot help but return. Will the light of my life return soon? I cannot imagine that all the water of Morgan's potential is to run down the drain and be wasted. Can it really play out like that?"" Now, it appears, the Harringtons finally have their answer. Police say they have now switched their focus to finding out how Morgan Harrington ended up in the remote farm and who put her there. During the concert, Harrington left her friends to use the restroom, police said. When she did not return, they called her cell phone at 8:48 p.m. She told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its policy, police said, but told them not to worry about her and that she would find a ride home. There are restrooms inside the arena, police said, and police do not know how or why Harrington got outside. Witnesses who saw her outside the arena said she did not appear to be with anyone, police said. About 9:30 p.m. that night, witnesses reported seeing a person matching Harrington's description walking on a nearby bridge, police said. No further sightings were reported. Harrington's purse, with her identification and cell phone inside, was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena, police said. A friend had driven Harrington's car to the concert, she said, and was still in possession of the car keys when they got separated. Harrington was reported missing the day after the concert, when she did not show up at her parents' home to study for a math exam with her father. Working with police and the Texas-based Laura Recovery Center, the Harringtons organized community searches, saying they would not give up hope that their daughter would be found. A $150,000 reward has been offered for information leading to Harrington's whereabouts, police said. Of that, Metallica contributed $50,000. The couple was joined at a news conference after her disappearance by Ed Smart, whose daughter Elizabeth was abducted in 2002. She returned home nine months later, after police say they found her in the custody of Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. Harrington said he reached out to Smart last week to seek advice on how to go through the disappearance of a child. Harrington was wearing a black Pantera T-shirt, a black miniskirt, black tights and black boots when last seen.","NEW: Dental records confirm remains are Morgan Harrington, police say .

"Editor's Note: This story details how two members of the CNN Special Investigations Unit reported a story about controversial plans to spend $31 million to enhance two remote crossings on the border between the United States and Canada. The road to the border was so quiet it was safe for Drew Griffin to sit in the middle of it. SCOBEY, Montana (CNN) -- We were driving through some of the most remote country in the United States, chasing a story that seemed hard to believe. The Department of Homeland Security had announced it was spending $31 million to enhance and upgrade two remote border crossings -- just 12 miles apart -- on the border between Montana and the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The spending was lauded by Montana's two senators, even though only an average of 22 cars a day traveled through these border posts. We hopped a plane from Atlanta, Georgia, to Billings, Montana, and then headed to Scobey and Whitetail. The six-hour drive took us through some of this nation's most beautiful country into the high plains of the Missouri River Region. It was a drive punctuated with glimpses of cows and antelopes, but few people. In fact, Burl Bowler, editor of the Daniels County Leader newspaper, which serves the border towns, advised us where to stop for gas en route, so we wouldn't run out and then really be in trouble. Besides seeing a part of the country where Lt. Col. George Custer took his last stand, there was the added benefit (sorry CNN management) of having no phone or Blackberry access. In that respect, it was a peaceful drive. When we got to Scobey, the few people we encountered couldn't have been nicer. Everyone we passed stopped, said hello, or waved. But encountering people was the problem -- and in fact, the story: We just didn't encounter that many. Certainly not at the border, where we stood and even sat in the middle of the road to show viewers how few people travel to and from Canada here.  Watch just how quiet the border crossing was » . The Scobey border crossing itself seemed perfectly adequate. But the Department of Homeland Security had warned its agents not to allow us inside, so we don't know what the interior is like. If we came in, we would be too disruptive, one government spokesman had informed us. In Scobey, that claim seemed a little far-fetched, since there wasn't anything going on here -- disruptive or otherwise. On the Canadian side, farmer Marc Chabot, a U.S. citizen whose family has farmed the area on both sides of the border for generations, said he was grateful for the money his senators -- Democrats Max Baucus and Jon Tester -- steered to northeast Montana. But, he said, like others in the community, he gasped when he learned of the plan to spend $31 million expanding two border crossings that are rarely used. ""It would be wiser spent on something more useful to the public generally,"" he told us, adding that come winter, the average of 20 cars crossing a day in Scobey drops to almost none. Editor Burl Bowler told us the area could certainly use stimulus money for jobs, but not at the border. We asked both Bowler and Chabot about the possibility of terrorists creeping across the frontier. Both said that after the attacks of September 11, 2001, everyone needed to be more mindful of the porous border. But Chabot said the government had the area fairly well covered. ""Trust me, they know we are here right now,"" he said. And a massive new building costing more than $15 million in Scobey, Montana, wasn't exactly a deterrence to someone set on harming the United States, he added. Chabot joked that any stranger in the area certainly would not be a stranger long, since everyone knew everyone -- a point echoed by Bowler, who pointed out that while he hadn't told many people that CNN was coming to town, everyone seemed to know it anyway. In Whitetail, it was even quieter. The town has grain elevators and a post office. Bureau of Transportation statistics show only about two people a day cross the border there, and the agents' building seemed in good shape, save for maybe needing a paint job. The DHS planned to spend $15 million on the outpost. That would buy a lot more paint than the building seemed to need. So why did these two areas get so much money? Locals and critics suspect politics might have played a role. Baucus is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; Tester is on the Senate's Homeland Security Committee. Both took credit for convincing the DHS to give these towns millions for border crossings, bragging in a joint press release that they pressured the agency. ""This is good news for all of Montana and especially communities across the northern tier,"" Baucus said in the statement. Tester said the spending would ""pay off for generations to come by creating new jobs and opportunity that will benefit all of Montana."" As late as Wednesday, his spokesman reiterated Tester's support of the spending, saying that it would seal security gaps on the border. So, the nagging question: Did politics, rather than security, guide the DHS? Especially when a border town like Laredo, Texas, which sees 66,000 crossings a day, was getting not one dime of the $400 million in DHS border stimulus funds. Montana, in total, was to receive $77 million. In an interview Wednesday with CNN, Trent Frazier, the director of port modernization for the Department of Homeland Security, denied that politics played any role. ""We feel that these ports, like all ports of entry, are a vital part of the network of security that we have established across the border apparatus that we employ across the borders, and the investments we are going to do along these borders are a critical step in ensuring we can perform our mission,"" Frazier said. But if Frazier did not believe politics factored in the decisions, it appeared to play a big role by Wednesday afternoon. Fellow Democrat Sen. Byron Dorgan, from the neighboring state of North Dakota, sent out a news release urging DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano to suspend the stimulus program. He said that spending the money on such remote ports -- including the nine in his state -- was ""just nuts."" Dorgan said the plan ""just defied common sense."" Within hours, Napolitano announced she was ordering a 30-day review to see if the money was being spent appropriately. In her letter to Dorgan, Napolitano said 39 of the 43 Custom and Border Protection posts were located in the northern United States. She said most of the Southern ports were owned by the General Services Administration, and the money directed by Congress was earmarked for the Custom and Border Protection properties and required to be spent within 24 months. ""Nonetheless,"" she wrote, ""in order to ensure even further transparency in this process, I am ordering a 30 day review"" of all port construction decisions by officials who did not make the initial allocation decisions. So, for now, if you want to travel to Canada through Scobey or Whitetail, the agents who inspect your vehicles will be using the buildings now in place -- and according to the locals, you will be adequately served.","DHS planned to spend $31 million to upgrade remote border crossings .

"(CNN)  -- Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele might be reminding conservative activists of a past Republican leadership turned arrogant with power. Under Michael Steele's leadership, the RNC has been accused of spending campaign funds on private jets, booze, limousines, five-star hotels, overseas resorts and a party donor's trip to a Hollywood bondage club. Most conservatives will agree that these expenditures are a horrible waste of funds at a time when Republicans are hoping to enjoy sizable gains in the 2010 midterm elections. After the devastating results of the 2006 and 2008 elections, conservatives were unexpectedly able to energize their followers as the Tea Party movement emerged and President Obama experienced first-year difficulties. Local Republican victories in gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey boosted the spirits of conservatives who feared Democrats might be on the verge of another New Deal. But along comes the RNC scandals, which have had the exact opposite effect. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, told his followers that they should not write checks to the national party. Perkins said: ""This latest incident is another indication to me the RNC is completely tone-deaf to the values and concerns of a large number of people they are seeking financial support from."" The RNC scandals smack of the type of arrogance that was at the heart of the scandals that brought down key Republicans in 2005 and 2006. During these critical years, it became clear that party leaders had been abusing their influence by focusing on expanding their own power rather than advancing the agenda of the right. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was forced to resign in early 2006 after being accused of violating campaign finance laws in Texas. He was also tied to the lobbying scandals that centered on Jack Abramoff. California Rep. Duke Cunningham ended his career for accepting bribes from defense contractors who benefited from his decisions on appropriations. There was also the case of Florida Rep. Mark Foley, to whom Republican leaders turned a blind eye despite his highly inappropriate text messages to underage male pages. Even Ralph Reed, the darling of the Christian Coalition, had been in cahoots with Abramoff in schemes to mobilize activists to protest gaming with the intention of drumming up business for his long-time friend. It seemed that the attitude of Republicans in Washington had become ""anything goes."" The results were devastating. Many Republicans were forced to resign, and Democrats regained control of Congress in 2006. Polls showed that corruption was a major issue on Election Day. The chickens had come home to roost. Not only did the scandals offer campaign fodder for Democrats who wanted to challenge the Republicans' self-promotion as the righteous party, but even more importantly, they deflated the enthusiasm of conservative activists who believed their energy and money had been wasted and that their party was just as corrupt as the opposition. Rather than the party of Ronald Reagan, the GOP looked more like the party of Tammany Hall. The Steele scandals point to that same kind of arrogance. This time around, Republicans are in an even weaker position, given that they are in the minority and out of the White House, struggling to rebuild their battered party. In addition, Democrats have just achieved a major victory with health care, and it seems that the jobs market is finally starting to improve. Republicans will need to clean their house quickly and find leaders who do not look more interested in the lavish ways of Washington than in the more modest ways of Main Street. On Monday, the Republican National Committee chief of staff resigned, with many assuming he was fired by Steele in an effort to clean house. The resignation is a start. But much more needs to be done. If the Republican leadership does not respond more aggressively, recent efforts to revive the party won't amount to very much. Conservative voters will not be enthusiastic about supporting a party whose leaders partake in lavish and questionable activities, and Democrats will have more evidence that their opponents cannot be trusted with power. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Michael Steele and RNC spending spree is alienating conservative wing .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Demonstrators shouting ""Death to the dictator"" clashed with police in Iran on Monday as students took to the streets to mark a key national anniversary, witnesses said. At least two clashes occurred at Revolution Square, where police attacked demonstrators with batons and chased them onto side streets, witnesses said. A large number of security forces ringed Tehran University, where the gates were shut and large crowds inside also chanted ""Death to the dictator,"" the witnesses reported. Pro-government crowds also inside the university chanted slogans and waved the flag of the Islamic Republic, witnesses said. The witnesses asked not to be identified out of concerns for security. CNN could not independently verify the reports. The Iranian government did not allow members of the international media witness any possible protests this week. The state-operated Press TV acknowledged the protests. ""A number of anti-government protesters attempted to hijack the occasion to hold rallies in Tehran. Their efforts were foiled by the presence of security forces which are deployed in several parts of the capital,"" an anchor said while the station showed images of pro-government demonstrations. The demonstrations are being held on Student Day, an annual observance when Tehran extolls the virtues of the Islamic Revolution. The holiday commemorates three university students killed in 1953 by security forces of the Western-backed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran. He was toppled from power during the revolution two decades later. The students this year are demonstrating against the disputed June 12 presidential election. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner in what protesters say was a rigged election. The election result was met with nationwide protests and the imprisonment of hundreds of demonstrators. Allegations of torture, rape and other abuses have since emerged. Ongoing prosecutions of protesters have resulted in death sentences for some. Since the election, other key anniversaries have met with protests against the current leadership. Protesters and police clashed November 4, the anniversary of the 1979 siege of the U.S. Embassy in Iran. In September, demonstrators took to the streets in protest on Quds Day, an annual event that is meant to show Iran's solidarity with Palestinians. On Monday, police manned major intersections. Shopkeepers, fearing violence, shuttered storefronts. As the protests got under way, Iranian security and paramilitary forces tear-gassed, beat and arrested students on university campuses, said a group called the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. According to the human rights organization, protests have taken place at the following universities in Tehran: Amir Kabir, Tehran, Sharif, Elm va Sanaat, Honar, Tehran Markaz, Sureh, and Tehran Shomal. Protests also have taken place at universities in Isfahan, Kermanshah, Shiraz, Mashhad and Tabriz, and at Agricultural University of Karaj, the rights group said. Security forces fired plastic bullets at students and protesters outside the Amir Kabir campus, said the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. The organization's reports could not be independently verified. In central Tehran, plumes of smoke rose from a large garbage bin that had been set on fire, witnesses told CNN.","Authorities prepare for gatherings that could turn into demonstrations against elections .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Another aftershock rocked Haiti on Friday. Buildings shook. People looked around to see what else might fall. Then they returned to what they had been doing. At a park in the capital that has become a tent city, a group of kids resumed their soccer game. Aftershocks have become a way of life in this devastated country along with so many other life-threatening challenges. The aftershocks -- smaller earthquakes that follow a more powerful one -- ""will continue for months, if not years,"" the U.S. Geological Survey said. ""The frequency of events will diminish with time, but damaging earthquakes will remain a threat."" The quake Friday morning had a magnitude of 4.4, the Geological Survey said. That makes it much less powerful than the 7.0-magnitude quake that struck 10 days ago, leaving widespread death and destruction in its wake. An earthquake on Wednesday was the strongest aftershock so far, with a magnitude of 5.9. An earthquake that size is strong enough to cause ""considerable"" damage, the Geological Survey said, though the extent of damage that any earthquake causes depends on many factors, including its depth, proximity to dense population centers, and the strength of structures where it hits. An American adoption service provider in Haiti wrote in a blog that the aftershock Wednesday sent ""a wall tumbling down on our heads."" Save the Children said its staff ""heard already-weakened structures collapsing"" as a result. Yet the 7.0-magnitude quake was more than 40 times stronger than the 5.9-magnitude aftershock, researchers said. While each new earthquake can slow relief efforts, those efforts were advancing Friday, including at the port, where critical supplies are being shipped in. Full coverage | Twitter updates . The city's south pier was operating, though slowly. Authorities pushed Friday to clear the bottlenecks at the port. The north pier remained unusable, and the south pier is the smaller of the two. Bottlenecks at all points of entry -- the airport, roads, and ports -- have delayed food and medical aid to the estimated 3 million Haitians affected by the quake. About 120 to 140 flights a day were coming into the single-runway Port-au-Prince airport, compared with 25 a day just after the quake struck last week. The USNS Comfort, a U.S. naval hospital off the coast, received about 240 patients over 36 hours, said Capt. James Ware, the commanding officer. ""Most of those individuals are critical care types of injuries,"" he told CNN's ""American Morning."" At least 72,000 people have been confirmed dead in the quake, according to Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? As aid moves more quickly, those Haitians who made it through the quake with their health will have increased access to necessities such as food and water. More than 300 aid distribution sites are up and running, a senior U.S. administration official said. Rescuers continue efforts to find survivors who have defied the odds. A group of rescuers told CNN on Friday that each rescue gives them hope to keep working. ""We're still searching, we're still out there. ... And we'll continue doing that until the Haitian government and the local governments here decide that we're going to be going into a transition,"" said Capt. Louis Fernandez of Miami-Dade Urban Search and Rescue. His colleague Danny Whu said, ""The window is rapidly closing. These people, the ones who are entrapped without the ability of receiving food or water, they have to withstand heat indexes at or near triple digits. ... The body may survive a lot of days without food, but definitely they need water."" Impact Your World . International aid contributions since the quake have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars.

"Washington (CNN)  -- Ten million Americans a year are victims of identity theft. It's a growing problem in the United States, but fighting it doesn't appear to be a priority, a new report says. A report by the Justice Department Inspector General released Tuesday cites the wide-ranging costs and dangers of ID theft. Although the report has no new numbers, the financial losses are believed to be substantially higher than the $15.6 billion documented in 2005. Inspector General Glenn Fine found the effort to combat the problem, however, has lagged since the President's Task Force on ID Theft was established in 2007. ""We found that to some degree identity theft initiatives have faded as priorities,"" said Fine. He said the Justice Department has not developed a coordinated plan to combat ID theft and that some recommendations of the President's Task Force have not been addressed. No one has been appointed to oversee the efforts, the report says. The report says ""the specific crime of identity theft is not a top FBI priority."" However, the report adds that the FBI often addresses the issue through the Cyber Division's criminal intrusion program, which is a priority of the agency. Similarly, ID theft investigations are often part of larger federal criminal investigations into health care fraud, mortgage fraud and credit card fraud. ""Identity theft can also be a significant element of violent crimes, such as domestic abuse, and even terrorism, and a significant number of ID theft-related crimes originate overseas,"" the report said.","Justice Department Inspector General cites wide-ranging costs and dangers of ID theft .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Conflicting accounts of a botched NATO raid that killed five Afghans in February have led to a new investigation ordered by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, a NATO military spokesman said Monday. Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale, a NATO spokesman, said Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who oversees all U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, called for the review after receiving a briefing from Afghan officials in late March. On Sunday, NATO acknowledged that its troops killed five Afghans in the nighttime raid in February, after initially saying the civilians may have been the victims of an ""honor killing."" Although civilian casualties at the hands of NATO troops have fallen off in recent months, such incidents have strained the relationship between Afghanistan and the Western nations that make up the International Security Assistance Force. According to two U.S. military officials, in the March briefing, Afghan officials from the Interior Ministry told McChrystal that after the incident, they visited the compound where the Afghans were killed and found evidence of bloodstained walls being washed down and bullets being dug out. McChrystal wants a thorough review now to see why U.S. and Afghan accounts differ so greatly, according to one of the sources, a senior U.S. official familiar with the briefing. The senior U.S. official said that by the time the Afghan investigators got to the compound, the people who lived there may have been attempting to clean it up. NATO officials believe the U.S. and Afghan troops may have dug some bullets out of the wall for purposes of the initial investigation, which is a common practice, the official said. In March, the International Security Assistance Force released a statement denying a report by a British newspaper that NATO had covered up the involvement of troops in the incident. U.S. officials continue to deny that there was any coverup of U.S. involvement. ""We have no evidence to date anything improper was done,"" the senior U.S. official said. At the time of the February 12 incident, NATO said its troops went to a compound in the village of Khatabeh in Paktia province, believing it to be a militant hideout. A firefight ensued, and several insurgents died, NATO said at the time. When soldiers entered the compound, they found the bodies of two men and two women who had been shot ""execution-style,"" a senior U.S. military official said then. ""It has the earmarks of a traditional honor killing,"" the official said, adding that the women were found bound and gagged. An honor killing is a slaying carried out by a family or community member against someone thought to have brought dishonor to them. The senior U.S. military official said that at the time, it wasn't clear whether dishonor in the case stemmed from accusations of acts such as adultery or even cooperation with NATO forces. But on Sunday, NATO made an about-face from its earlier claims. ""International forces were responsible for the deaths of three women who were in the same compound where two men were killed by the joint Afghan-international patrol searching for a Taliban insurgent,"" NATO said in a statement. There was no explanation given for the cause of the third woman's death or why it wasn't mentioned previously. The two armed men whom troops killed were not insurgents, NATO said Sunday. ""The force went to the compound based on reliable information in search of a Taliban insurgent and believed that the two men posed a threat to their personal safety,"" the NATO statement said. ""We now understand that the men killed were only trying to protect their families."" NATO said a lack of forensic evidence made it difficult to determine how or when the three women died. But it concluded that they were killed when troops fired at the men. As for the initial report about the women being found bound and gagged, the NATO statement said it stemmed from a cultural misunderstanding. ""The statement noted the women had been bound and gagged, but this information was taken from an initial report by the international members of the joint force who were not familiar with Islamic burial customs,"" the statement said, without elaborating. NATO troops who went to the scene after the raid may have misinterpreted burial rites. Muslims wrap their dead in clean white cloth before they are placed in the ground. NATO said it will apologize to the victims' family members and offer compensation in accordance with local customs. The NATO admission follows the fatal shooting of five Afghan soldiers by troops in a friendly fire incident in northern Afghanistan on Friday. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has strongly criticized civilian deaths by international troops, and the deaths have bred resentment among many Afghans. The numbers have fallen off in recent months since McChrystal took over as U.S. commander in Afghanistan. ""It is better to miss a target than to cause civilian casualties,"" McChrystal said in December. ""We can always target enemy leaders later. We can't make up for the fact that we killed civilians."" CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NATO: Acknowledges killing 5 civilians in nighttime February raid .

"(CNN) -- Peruvian soccer star Paolo Guerrero has been punished with a record fine by his German club Hamburg for throwing a water bottle into the face of a fan who he claimed had insulted him. The striker made a public apology on Monday, but could face further disciplinary action from the German Football Association on Tuesday. The incident happened at the end of Hamburg's 0-0 draw with relegation-threatened Hannover on Sunday, a result which dented Guerrero's team's hopes of qualifying for European competition next season. ""I had a blackout,"" the 26-year-old told Hamburg's official Web site. ""I was insulted and I over-reacted. ""I am incredibly sorry. I hope that I get the opportunity to apologize personally to the spectator concerned. ""I have already done so to HSV. Of course I will accept any punishment from the club. I made a big mistake."" Chairman Bernd Hoffmann said Guerrero's behavior was ""absolutely unacceptable."" ""Something like that is not allowed to happen. Paulo will be heavily fined by us. He has assured us believably how sorry he is."" The amount of the fine has not been disclosed, but Hoffman told German football magazine Kicker that it would be ""the like of which there has never been in the club."" Ralf Bednarik of the Hamburg Supporters' Board told the club's Web site that fans should accept Guerrero's apology. ""Players have to deal with criticism,"" he said. ""But Paolo Guerrero has apologized for his behavior. Now it's up to us all to reappraise the things and to jointly look into the future."" Guerrero has played 24 times for his country, but missed many of the 2010 World Cup qualifiers after suffering injuries and being handed a six-game suspension for abusing a referee. Peru finished bottom of the South American group. He moved to Hamburg in 2006 after beginning his Bundesliga career at Bayern Munich, and played as a second-half substitute against Hannover after recently returning to action following seven months on the sidelines with a knee injury.","Paolo Guerrero hit with record fine for throwing a water bottle into the face of a fan .

"(CNN) -- Vatican officials failed to take action against a priest accused of sexually abusing two teenage girls in Minnesota despite repeated warnings from a local bishop starting in 2005, attorneys for one of the alleged victims said Monday. The Vatican's failure occurred despite the establishment of safeguards established four years earlier to deal with the growing abuse scandal inside the Catholic Church, they said. The priest -- Father Joseph Pavanivel Jeyapaul of Ootacamund, India -- served in a diocese in Crookston, Minnesota, for a little more than a year in 2004 and 2005, according to church documents unearthed in a lawsuit related to the case. Complaint letters from Crookston Bishop Victor Balke to Rome were acknowledged by Vatican officials, but no disciplinary action was taken, the documents show. Jeyapaul is now the head of a church education commission in Ootacamund, giving him continued access to children, lawyers said. ""This is systematic. All roads ... lead to Rome and the top officials there,"" said Jeff Anderson, a St. Paul, Minnesota, attorney representing the alleged victim. ""As horrific as the rape of children by Jeyapaul is ... the coverup of it is every bit as horrific and criminal."" Father Louis Rag, bishop secretary of the Ootacamund Diocese, confirmed Monday that Jeyapaul is still in Ootacamund. He refused to comment further, except to note that he had heard about the charges against Jeyapaul through media reports. Anderson revealed the church documents at a news conference in St. Paul. The county attorney's office for Roseau County, Minnesota, is trying to extradite Jeyapaul from India. The Crookston Diocese first received reports of ""inappropriate behavior"" on the part of Jeyapaul in September 2005, according to a letter Balke sent four months later to Cardinal William Levada, head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, a body established to deal with cases of alleged abuse. Pope Benedict XVI headed the congregation before being chosen to lead the Roman Catholic Church. Balke wrote that according to an internal investigation, Jeyapaul took a teenage girl to his rectory in the summer of 2005, where ""he proceeded to kiss her repeatedly, pulling her on top of him and at one point touching her beneath her clothing."" Balke also said in the letter that Jeyapaul had misappropriated ""a substantial amount of money belonging to the parish and also attempted to give a diocesan vehicle to a third party as payment for an outstanding debt."" The bishop went on to warn the Vatican that it is ""impossible to say that Father Jeyapaul does not at present pose a risk to minors."" ""I cannot in good conscience allow this matter to be passed over"" simply because Jeyapaul has now returned to India, Balke said. ""In my mind, that would be a shameful act of betrayal towards the women and girls in India to whom Fr. Jeyapaul could at present pose a serious risk."" A representative for Levada responded to Balke's letter in May 2006, acknowledging his complaint and writing that the Vatican had requested to church officials in India that ""Father Jeyapaul's priestly life be monitored so that he does not constitute a risk to minors and does not create a scandal among the faithful."" Six months later, Balke relayed a new series of allegations about Jeyapaul to Levada. Balke wrote that he had received reports ""of similar behavior having taken place between Fr. Jeyapaul and a second girl."" In both instances, Balke wrote, Jeyapaul had been counseling the girls about their religious lives. Church officials once again acknowledged Balke's letter but took no disciplinary or other action against Jeyapaul, the documents show. Anderson accused Vatican officials Monday of being more concerned with preserving their own reputations than with protecting children. ""We are sad because so many kids have been wounded and hurt because Catholic officials -- top Catholic officials from the Vatican on down ... don't get it and remain in denial,"" he said. ""They have a problem. ... They fail to do what is necessary to protect children across the globe.""

"(CNN) -- Two people were killed when unusually large and powerful waves crashed into a cruise ship in the Mediterranean Sea this week. Here CNN Senior Meteorologist Brandon Miller explains the science behind the deadly squall that hit the Louis Majesty as it traveled from Barcelona, Spain to Genoa, Italy. What caused the wave that hit the cruise ship? There was a strong storm moving through the Mediterranean which brought winds gusting well over 100 kph. Winds of this magnitude will result in a very rough sea state and large waves. Buoys nearby recorded significant wave heights (defined as the average of the largest 1/3 of waves over a 20 minute period) over 6 meters. The waves which hit the ship were reported to be between 8-9 meters. This would not be considered a ""rogue"" wave, as rogue waves must have a height at least double the significant wave height, but it is nevertheless abnormally high. Several factors can contribute to an increase in the size of the wave, including wind direction, ocean current direction, and shape and depth of the sea floor. How common are such waves? Waves of this height are not very common in the Mediterranean under normal conditions, but it would not be unusual to find waves of this magnitude within strong storms (as was the case with these waves). Rogue waves, especially those not associated with stormy conditions, are far less common, but present the biggest danger to ships due to their unexpected nature. Is it unusual for cruise ships to be hit by such abnormal waves? Cruise ships are frequently affected by large waves all over the world, although normally not to this extreme, and with minimal consequences. Cruise ships normally set their course to avoid storms and rough seas when possible. We hear of events such as this one every couple of years, such as in March 2001 when two tourist ships were impacted in the same week (the Bremen and Caledonian Star). Can abnormal activity in one ocean impact other seas or oceans? All the world's oceans are connected, and we know vary large scale events such as tsunamis can traverse and affect multiple ocean basins (a very large earthquake in the Indian Ocean could conceivably create a tsunami that would be felt in parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans for example). The waves which hit the Louis Majesty, however, were a much more localized event brought on by a storm system nearby. They were in no way related to the Chile earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Rough seas and high waves can be expected to occur near this storm as it moves eastward through the Mediterranean towards Greece and Turkey. How far from a storm can you find large waves? Large waves can occur at great distances from the storm that generates them. Hawaii, for instance, will often receive high surf and large swells from tropical storms located in the Western Pacific near Asia or Eastern Pacific near North America. In order for this to occur, the strong wind must blow in a consistent direction over a large distance (fetch), such as in large typhoons/hurricanes.","Powerful storm waves uncommon in the Mediterranean .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House rejected criticism Sunday that President Obama has not delivered on his promise of ""change"" during his first year in office. White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the president has brought about ""enormous change."" ""I think what we've seen is a dramatic difference in terms of how the United States is perceived around the world,"" Jarrett told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" on the final Sunday before the president's State of the Union address. Obama's travels have established relationships with world leaders that ""lay a foundation for keeping America safe and making us a partner around the world,"" she added. Jarrett also credited the president with having ""pulled back the economy from the brink of disaster."" ""That's an enormous amount of change when you consider where we were a year ago right on the brink,"" she said. ""And he's adding discipline in government to try to get control over our fiscal house. So I think that we've seen enormous change."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, on the same program, countered that ""if you look at the first year of this administration, we haven't made much progress."" He complained about the deficit in the president's budget and the health care reform package that Republicans oppose. But McConnell, R-Kentucky, was also on the defensive about the GOP, which critics have been calling ""the party of no."" Asked to characterize the performance of his own party this year, McConnell said, ""What we did is try to operate on principle. The president decided to go hard left. That's why he doesn't have many of my members [supporting his agenda]. If he chooses to govern in the middle, he will have broader support."" Jarrett insisted the president never wavered from his promised bipartisan approach. Discussing his health care initiative, Jarrett said Obama ""has sat down with the leadership and members of the Republican Party, both the House and the Senate.

"(CNN) -- Twitter was buzzing Thursday morning with news that several airlines are flying doctors and nurses to Haiti free of charge to help with relief efforts there in the wake of Tuesday's devastating earthquake. The only problem: The rumors are false, an American Airlines spokesman says. ""Last night's hoax on Twitter about American and JetBlue flying doctors and nurses to Haiti for free was just that -- a hoax. We don't know who is responsible, but it's a very low thing to do,"" airline spokesman Tim Smith said in e-mails sent Thursday. Twitter users also circulated a rumor that UPS would ship for free any package under 50 lbs. to Haiti. In a blog post Wednesday on UPS's Web site, a spokeswoman debunked the rumor and said that destruction of Haiti's roads and communications networks ""means our own shipping services to Haiti are on hold."" UPS is donating $1 million to help the people of Haiti through relief agencies, she said. On Wednesday, American and American Eagle sent three planes to Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, carrying 30,000 pounds of water, food and other nonperishable goods for its more than 100 employees who work at the airport there and for assistance at Port-au-Prince hospitals, the airline said in a news release. Three more relief flights are planned from Puerto Rico to Haiti on Thursday, and an additional three for Friday, the airline said. ""We've incentivized our 62 million AAdvantage members to give cash to Red Cross and receive bonus miles from us,"" Smith added. ""We cannot fly any passengers to Haiti at this time and our efforts on the humanitarian front are as described above."" A spokeswoman for JetBlue said the airline is flying relief workers from agencies such as the American Red Cross free of charge to Santo Domingo in the neighboring Dominican Republic, but only after they have been vetted by the Haitian Consulate. The consulate then arranges transportation for passengers from Santo Domingo to Port-au-Prince, she said. ""There have been a lot of people mobilizing on Twitter asking for our support. And I think that's where these rumors are coming from,"" JetBlue spokeswoman Alison Croyle said. ""We're not offering free transportation for just any doctors who walk up and want to fly there."" The American Airlines and JetBlue rumors erupted quickly on Twitter and other social networks, with people retweeting the Haitian Consulate's New York City phone number, which medical professionals could supposedly call for free flights. Calls overwhelmed the consulate, resulting in repeated busy signals for callers. But by late Thursday morning, word appeared to be spreading that the rumors were not true.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Be excited, but be scared. A world of mind-blowing possibilities is suddenly being thrust upon the world of video gaming. Detecting your thoughts: the EPOC headset is a breakthrough in brain - computer interfaces. The era of thought controlled games has arrived, and soon you could be required only to 'think' to operate a video game. Maybe you'll even have the chance to be completely immersed in a video game 'world'. The Emotiv EPOC headset - the first Brain Computer Interface (BCI) device for the gaming market is the technology behind the revolution -- and the company claims to have already mastered thought control. The EPOC detects and processes real time brain activity patterns (small voltage changes in the brain caused by the firing of neurons) using a device that measures electric activity in the brain. In total, it picks up over 30 different expressions, emotions and actions. The leap in technology has been met with excitement amongst many gamers. Singapore enthusiast Samuel Lau has even made a video showing his hopes for the future of gaming. But, for the creators, what possibilities does this open up for future video games?  View gallery of gaming through the years » . According to experts, the sci-fi scenarios depicted in The Matrix, and Star Trek's 'Holodeck' are now comprehendible realities in the future. President and co-founder of Emotiv Systems, Tan Le, said the brain-to-computer interface was undoubtedly the future for video games. ""Being able to control a computer with your mind is the ultimate quest of human-machine interaction. When integrated into games, virtual worlds and other simulated environments, this technology will have a profound impact on the user's experience."" What do you think video games of the future will look like? Le envisaged the lines between games and reality continuing to blur. ""In the long run, the user's interactions with machines will more closely mimic our interactions with other humans. Our technology will ultimately bring communities of people closer together to richly share their experiences,"" she said. Rick Hall, production director at the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy, is also open-minded about possibilities in future gaming. Hall, who has worked across machines such as the N64, Sony PSP, PS2, and Nintendo DS, told CNN that some of the concepts in The Matrix were now ""eerily reaching towards theoretical possibility"". ""If we can interpret basic control thoughts now, it isn't far off where we'll be able to interpret more complex thoughts, even potentially things you're not consciously thinking of. If we can now do it in a non-invasive fashion, it probably won't be long before we can read these things from across the room. And if we can ""read"" complex thoughts, then shouldn't we also be able to ""write"" thoughts into a person's brain? ""So add that up: a wireless, remote, brain reading/writing device that can scan, interpret, and communicate with someone across the room, without them even knowing it. Connect that to the Internet... and talk about brainwashing possibilities. What if some hacker could figure out how to write viruses to people's brains? It's actually a little scary."" But, it's not all optimism and imagination for the technology. American gaming analyst Todd Greenwald believes it may be some time yet before brain to computer interfaces reach a marketable standard, saying it is ""a bit too far out and speculative to say with any confidence"". University of Ulster video gaming lecturer Darryl Charles told CNN he was also uncertain whether Emotiv's technology would take off. ""It's a little bit harder to see. It's quite a complex thing to force your thought on a television screen."" However, Emotiv's Le strongly defended the headset, saying it ""works on a vast majority of people and can adapt to a wide variety of thought patterns. Emotiv has carried out tests with hundreds of people and so far we have had success on every single person,"" Le said. While the speed of the revolution pushing the gaming world is hotly debated, one thing all experts agree on is the underlying themes of future games. Gamers can be certain that social interaction and strong storylines will strengthen to form the core of games. Tan Le told CNN, ""The one thing that we believe will be core to the future of gaming is the social experience. Nothing a game developer can program can match the random nature of actually participating in a scenario with other live people."" Le said the social aspect was the key to growth of the industry, as it was opening the door to fresh markets. She acknowledged the new level of immersion offered with the Wii's interactive control had helped send the industry in the right direction. Charles believed a move closer towards the movie and television entertainment realm was also imminent. ""The big blockbuster game is going to compete more with Hollywood movies. They will be a lot more competitive in storylines... there is a lot of production values already coming from cinema."" Greenwald said downloading games straight from the producer could soon become a reality. A market where simple games could be downloaded for free and then add-ons to significantly improve the game were sold at a premium, could be a more financially rewarding for the makers, he said.","EPOC headset by Emotiv allows users to 'think' and video characters will 'do'

"(CNN Student News)  -- Discussion Questions . 1. When is Black History Month observed? When did Black History Month get its start? Who was Dr. Carter G. Woodson? What was his role in the establishment of Black History Month? 2. What are some significant events and milestones in U.S. black history? Who are some of the individuals who have contributed to black history? 3. How does black history help to tell the story of what it means to be an American? How have African-Americans enriched that story? What lessons can be learned from the experiences of black history makers? Learning Activities . Use these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history, culture and achievements of African-Americans. 1. A Milestone in U.S. History . Remind students that they have witnessed a truly historical event in their lifetime: the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American president. What will they remember about this milestone? What do they want future generations to know about it? Challenge students to write letters to students who will be in their place 100 years from now, describing the event and its significance for all Americans. Combine the letters into a book or a Web site, or create a video of students reading their letters. Present the finished product to your school's historian or media specialist for archiving. 2. Covering Black History . Ask students: What if CNN correspondents had been on the scene to record key moments in black history for the entire world to see? Organize students into small teams of reporters, and have each team select a time period in American history and a key figure or event that helped to define that time period for African-Americans. Then, have students imagine that CNN was there to cover the historical figure or event. Ask: How do you think that CNN reporters might have covered these stories? Encourage the teams to write scripts for news stories on their historical figures and events. After students have presented their scripts, have them compare their reports to eyewitness accounts and local newspaper reports that were written at the time. 3. Harlem Renaissance . Inform students that during the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American cultural movement occurred in the United States that was known as the Harlem Renaissance. It was a literary, musical and artistic explosion that was born in Harlem, New York, and it had a profound impact on African-American culture and on the U.S. as a whole. Have your class host a Harlem Renaissance cultural fair. Direct students to online resources to learn about some of the great artists, writers and musicians who were part of the renaissance and their contribution to this cultural movement. Have each student select one of these African-American artists and design a display that tells about the life and times of the artist and the importance of his or her work. Invite guests from your school and community to attend the exhibit. Have students serve as ""roaming curators"" to instruct and interest guests in the Harlem Renaissance and the creative works of these great African-Americans. 4. Profiles in Black History . Do your students show a personal interest in science, music, politics, theater, sports or education? Inspire them to celebrate the contributions of African-Americans by having them write profiles of African-Americans in the categories that interest them. For example, a budding young scientist might choose to profile the inventor of the ironing board, the lawn mower or the space shuttle retrieval arm, all of whom were/are African-Americans. Direct your students to online and print resources and have them conduct research on their chosen individuals. Then, encourage students to write proposals to have their selected persons commemorated in new postage stamps. Students should accompany their proposals with designs for the stamps. In their presentations, students should try to convince classmates why their profiled persons should have a stamp created in their name. Post the designs around the classroom. 5. Local African-American History . Valuable lessons in black history may be found just a few steps away in the stories and documents that can be found in local libraries, historical organizations, universities or colleges, and online. Encourage students to venture out into the community to investigate the history and contributions of black Americans in their city or town. Students might choose to use milestones in black history as a way to organize their research, gathering information on how those events impacted the community and its residents. They may also decide to profile influential black community members. Have students invite community members to a celebration of local black history. 6. Black History Museum . Celebrate black history by creating plans for a local Black History Museum. First, have students decide where the museum should be housed. Suggestions might include a school or local library, an exhibit in an existing history museum, or perhaps a virtual online museum. Next, discuss how the museum should be organized. Students may choose to categorize the content by theme, by specific time periods, by specific dates, by people or by local landmarks. Encourage students to include interactive elements and multimedia in their plans. Then, challenge students to consider what people, events or contributions to include in their Black History Museum. Ask: What messages or lessons do you want visitors to take away from the exhibits? 7. Not Just for February . Inform students that, while Dr. Carter G. Woodson chose the month of February to recognize the accomplishments of African-Americans, black history can be celebrated all year long. Challenge students to create year-long calendars or timelines that highlight the contributions of African-American newsmakers, illustrate key events in black history, and encourage an ongoing celebration of black culture.

"(CNN)  -- French star Franck Ribery scored the only goal of Sunday's match as Bayern Munich went to the top of the Bundesliga with a home win over fourth-placed SV Hamburg. It ended a long wait for the Bavarian giants who have not headed the German standings since winning the title in 2008. Their poor form last season led to the departure of former Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann, but his replacement Louis van Gaal has also been under pressure after a slow start to the current campaign. But since the midwinter break, Bayern have returned to winning ways and have been level on points with leaders Bayer Leverkusen, who had a better goal difference. Leverkusen's 0-0 draw at home to Cologne on Saturday extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to a record 24 games, but left the door ajar for Bayen to take advantage. Their three-point haul on Sunday gives them a two-point cushion at the top but it was not until the 78th minute that they made the breakthrough with a fine goal from Ribery. The influential playmaker left Hamburg goalkeeper Wolfgang Hesl no chance with a fierce shot. Visitors Hamburg were still missing their new signing Ruud van Nistelrooy through injury and could create little up front. In Sunday's other game, Hanover continued their slump with a ninth defeat in a row as defending champions Wolfsburg secured a 1-0 away victory. Bosnian midfielder Zvjezdan Misimovic scored the only goal of the match for Wolfsburg to complete a fine week which saw them progress to the last 16 of the Europa League on Thursday. In the Scottish League, Rangers all but sealed the title with a last-gasp 1-0 win over 10-man Celtic in the Old Firm derby. Rangers' American substitute Maurice Edu struck in injury time to send the defending champions 10 points clear with a game in hand over their nearest rivals. Celtic captain Scott Brown was sent off in the second half but they looked set to hold out for a point until Edu scored with the last kick of the game. In the Spanish Primera, the battle for third place intensified as nine-man Valencia lost 4-1 at Athletico Madrid. David Silva grabbed the opener on 20 minutes but Valencia defender Carlos Marchena was sent off for deliberate handball and Diego Forlan converted the penalty kick. Sergio Aguero and Forlan scored further goals for Atletico after the break before the visitors had Luis Miguel sent off in the 81st minute and Jose Jurado added the fourth. Earlier, Sevilla were held to a goalless draw by Athletic Bilbao and trail Valencia by three points. In Serie A, champions Inter Milan won 3-2 at Udinese and maintained their four-point lead at the top over city rivals AC Milan, who beat Atalanta 3-1 in the San Siro. A double from Brazilian Pato enabled Milan to keep up the pressure on Jose Mourinho's men while third placed AS Roma saw their title hopes slip away in a 2-2 draw at Napoli, having led 2-0.","Franck Ribery goal gives Bayern Munich 1-0 home win over Hamburg to top Bundesliga .

"(CNN) -- Parents should take precautions to minimize infants' exposure to the chemical Bisphenol-A, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday in an announcement that stopped short of saying there is a definite health risk from the chemical. In guidelines published on its Web site, the FDA said it has ""some concern"" about the safety of BPA, and supports efforts by industry to remove BPA from infant bottles and feeding cups. Dr. Josh Sharfstein, deputy FDA commissioner, said the agency is trying to determine whether it has the legal authority to quickly force such products off the market if manufacturers don't do it voluntarily. According to Sharfstein, the six largest makers of infant bottles and cups already use alternatives to BPA. Bisphenol-A is found in many products, but has drawn the most attention for its use in linings for canned food and infant formula, and as a hardener in plastic baby bottles and toys. A handful of states and cities including Minnesota, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois, have passed laws in some form banning BPA in products meant for children. The new position is a partial reversal of the FDA's declaration in 2008 that BPA has no adverse effects. That announcement came under fire from environmental groups that said it relied too heavily on industry-funded research. Since then, the agency says on its Web site, ""recent studies have reported subtle effects of low doses of BPA in laboratory animals. While BPA is not proven to harm children or adults, these newer studies have led federal health officials to express some concern about the safety of BPA."" The new position brings the FDA into line with guidance from the National Toxicology Program, which in its own 2008 report said there is ""some concern"" for BPA's effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland, in developing fetuses, infants and children. Other studies have found a possible link to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but the authors of those studies say it's not clear the problems were actually caused by BPA. At a news conference Friday, FDA commissioner Margaret Hamburg said further research is needed ""to determine if and when further action is needed."" The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has been allotted $30 million to study the health effects of BPA. Hamburg said that research would likely be complete in 18 to 24 months. In a separate review, the Environmental Protection Agency is weighing whether to list BPA as a chemical of concern under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act, which would trigger a formal process to develop possible restrictions on BPA. At the news conference, Hamburg and Sharfstein urged parents to keep the risk in perspective, saying the benefits of nutritious infant formula outstrip any potential danger from BPA. Other guidance includes: . • Discarding scratched or worn bottles and cups, which aside from harboring germs might also release small amounts of BPA . • Being careful when heating formula, as boiling or very hot liquid might cause the release of BPA into infant formula . • Checking labels to ensure that only microwave-safe products are used in the microwave, and dishwasher-safe products are put in the dishwasher, to avoid leakage . In taking a middle ground, the FDA managed to frustrate both industry and consumer safety groups. Steven Hentges, a scientist with the American Chemistry Council's global study group on BPA, said the guidance would ""confuse consumers,"" while a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council said the move was ""too little, too late."" Hentges painted the FDA decision as a victory, saying the announcement reflects scientific consensus ""that these products continue to be safe for use."" However, he complained that there was no scientific basis for the advice to discard older bottles and cups and insisted that studies have failed to find evidence of actual harm from BPA. Sara Janssen, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, agreed the advice was confusing, but said the FDA should have gone further and banned the use of BPA. Sonya Lunder, a senior analyst with the Environmental Working Group and a longtime BPA critic, says mothers can largely avoid BPA by using powdered formula instead of liquid. But she welcomed Friday's announcement. ""This is a huge step forward. The Bush administration wanted to close the books and declare this safe, and now that's not going to happen,"" Lunder said.","Bisphenol-A, known as BPA, is found in many products including baby bottles .
FDA stops short of saying there is a definite health risk from the chemical .
Industry says FDA goes to far; consumer groups say BPA should be banned ."
"Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- Candles in hand and singing hymns, hundreds of Cleveland residents stunned by the discovery of 11 bodies in a local home gathered outside the house Sunday night to remember the victims. But Inez Fortson, whose daughter Telacia was among the dead, said she could barely stand to look at the home. ""It's hard, because I want to burn it down,"" she said. ""I know my baby was in there, and she got killed in there,"" Fortson added. ""I know what other people feel like when they lost a child. I didn't, but I do now. That was my only daughter."" Telacia Fortson, 31, had three children, ages 2, 4 and 6, her mother said. She had last been seen in June. Her body was among the first identified in the home of Anthony Sowell, who is now facing five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. All of those found dead were African-American women. A Cuyahoga County judge has set bail at $5 million for Sowell, a registered sex offender who served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape case. He was released from jail in 2005. ""Whenever I see him on TV or think about him, I have to pray,"" Fortson said. ""Because I believe that one day, I'll have to forgive him for what he's done. But right now, I can't, because I'm numb."" About 500 people joined the march, which followed a packed memorial service at the neighborhood's Mount Olive Missionary Baptist Church. The turnout ""means that people do care,"" Fortson said. ""There is a little compassion in the world."" Mount Olive pastor Larry Harris Sr., who led the memorial service, called the Sowell home a house of ""horror."" ""It brings trembling to the bones to think about what all went on right here,"" he said. Sowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney, according to Sowell's public defender Kathleen DeMetz. A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it's unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury, the next expected step in the case. Police recovered the first bodies after they went to Sowell's home to follow up on a rape accusation. Last month, neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor, but no charges were filed. Neighbors called 911 after the October 20 incident. Firefighters and paramedics responded, and later notified police. The woman told officers that she was at the home and ""partying,"" when she fell off the roof. Allen Sowell, the suspect's half-brother, told CNN he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago. Their stepmother, who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison, said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time, Allen Sowell said. The stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he wasn't paying rent, Allen Sowell said. Anthony Sowell said he shouldn't have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father, who died in 2004, and remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007, his half-brother said. Agents from the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit are assisting Cleveland police, Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson said. The agents are preparing a profile of Sowell for police, tracing his life and habits, and his DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes. Allen Sowell said he was aware of his half-brother's prison record, but ""just couldn't fathom"" the accusations now facing him. ""I didn't think he was in that bad of a mental state,"" Allen Sowell said. ""You never think it would happen to your family. It's a horrible feeling."" At 66, Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half-brother, and the two didn't meet until Anthony Sowell was 9. He added, ""He deserves whatever he gets from the justice system."" CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","After vigil, ministers walk to Anthony Sowell home, where 11 bodies were found .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Linden, New Jersey, have launched a homicide investigation after the discovery Monday of a pair of trash bags containing the dismembered remains of two people, officials said. The medical examiner has confirmed the body parts are ""indeed human,"" the Union County Prosecutor's Office said in a news release. ""There were two bodies found inside trash bags near the intersection of Essex Avenue and Cranford Avenue,"" spokesman John Holl said in the release, adding that the remains are from adults, one male and one female. Yellow police tape surrounded the scene Monday afternoon, tied to the tree trunks lining the quiet residential street where the black trash bags were discovered earlier in the morning. Linden Mayor Richard J. Gerbounka, who was at the site, called the shocking discovery ""very unusual for this area."" ""We've got the homicide investigative team out and they're in the process of culling the area for evidence,"" he said. Along with the Linden Police Department, investigators from the county prosecutor's office and the city fire department also were at the site. Officials spread a white sheet around the trash bags before loading the remains onto two stretchers and taking them away for further study. Autopsies were scheduled for Monday afternoon, according to the prosecutor's office.","Dismembered remains found Monday in a pair of trash bags, officials said .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court dealt federal prosecutors dual setbacks Monday in efforts to prosecute the laundering of drug ring and organized crime profits. The Supreme Court considered a pair of cases involving hidden money and an illegal gambling ring. The justices ruled that merely hiding money headed out of the United States is not proof of money laundering. Justices also concluded that prosecutors had to prove that an illegal gambling ring had laundered profits of its betting, rather than just proceeds. In a unanimous ruling, the justices overturned the federal conviction of Humberto Regaldo Cuellar, who had run afoul of the ""transportation"" part of the international money-laundering law when his car was stopped by a deputy sheriff near Eldorado, Texas. Inside the car, officers found nearly $81,000 in cash wrapped in duct-taped bundles and hidden in a secret compartment covered with animal hair, presumably to trick drug-sniffing dogs. Police suspected the money came from drug trafficking and arrested Cuellar, who had been heading for Mexico when he was stopped. Cuellar was convicted and sentenced to 78 months in prison. Federal law requires proof the transportation was ""designed to conceal or disguise the nature, location, the source, the ownership, or the control"" of the money. Writing for the high court, Justice Clarence Thomas said prosecutors failed to prove the reason for moving the money across the border was to hide its source, as part of an alleged international drug ring. ""Although the evidence suggested Cuellar's  transportation would have the effect of concealing funds, the evidence did not demonstrate that such concealment was the purpose of the transportation "" Thomas wrote. Congress passed a law in 1986 designed to prevent the laundering, or ""washing,"" of criminal funds through legitimate enterprises and overseas bank accounts. In the other case, the high court split 5-4 in concluding that prosecutors failed to show money used to pay couriers in alleged gambling operation were ""profits,"" rather than ""gross proceeds."" The case involved Efrain Santos and Benedicto Diaz, convicted of running an illegal lottery in Indiana since the 1970s. Santos allegedly used a network of ""runners"" and ""collectors"" to run the enterprise, and Diaz was a collector who gathered money from the runners and delivered it to Santos. ""The money laundering charges brought against Santos were based on his payments to the lottery winners and his employees, and the money laundering charge brought against Diaz was based on his receipt of payments as an employer,"" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a very narrow opinion. ""Neither type of transaction can fairly be characterized as involving the lottery's profits,"" Scalia added. ""Indeed, the government did not try to prove, and the defendants have not admitted, that they laundered criminal profits."" Scalia noted the high court's ruling would not overly burden prosecutors, saying only one instance of ""profitability"" would be required to prove money laundering. ""What counts is whether the receipts from the charged unlawful act exceeded the costs fairly attributable to it,"" he said, adding the government ""exaggerates"" the difficulty it would have to do that. Although Scalia wrote the main ruling, it was Justice John Paul Stevens who provided the critical fifth vote for a majority, and his concurring views will probably provide the controlling opinion to guide lower courts in similar cases down the road. Stevens did not go as far as Scalia wanted, saying Congress failed by writing an ""ambiguous"" law that only confused judges. He said lawmakers seemed to want a broader interpretation of ""proceeds"" as the term applied to money laundering. Justices Samuel Alito, Anthony Kennedy, Stephen Breyer, and Chief Justice John Roberts dissented.","In one case, court rules that hiding money not same as money laundering .
In another, justices say prosecutors have to prove gambling ring laundered ""profits""
Cases involved cash hidden in car, illegal Indiana lottery ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Taken alone, a California woman's 20-minute video ""scrapbook"" is basically a collection of photographic memories spanning her 19-year-old daughter's all-too-brief life. Birthday parties, picnics, graduations -- all set to evocative music and narrated matter-of-factly by the mother. John Paul Stevens was one of three justices who wanted to grant further review of the defendant's case. What makes this video unusual is that it was presented at a California murder trial as ""victim impact evidence."" The Supreme Court on Monday gave an indirect endorsement to such videos when it rejected an appeal from a defendant who argued that the presentation violated his right to a fair trial. The high court also rejected a similar capital case, also from California, involving a woman who narrated a video montage of her slain parents. With the court's refusal to intervene, the death sentences imposed by the juries in the two cases were upheld. At issue was not whether any testimony can be used showing the impact a crime victim's loss had on family, friends and society at large. The question for the justices was how that testimony is presented. Some trial courts, but not all, have allowed such videotapes to be played in court, while often placing limitations on the content. One case involved Douglas Oliver Kelly, convicted in the 1993 slaying of Sarah Weir. The teenager had befriended Kelly at a Burbank gym. Her body was found stabbed 29 times, probably by a pair of scissors. During the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecution presented just one witness to provide victim impact evidence: the victim's mother, Martha Farwell, a Los Angeles-area attorney. She had prepared the video, describing how her daughter had been adopted from Canada and was a Blackfoot Indian. In the background is the music of Enya, an Irish singer and composer. Most of the video simply describes the photos and home movies, but near the end is a shot of Weir's grave and Farwell's narration: ""As time goes by, I try very hard not to think of Sarah in terms of this terrible tragedy that we've had to deal with here in court, but rather of her in a place like this."" Over photos of the Canadian landscape, Farwell concludes, ""This is filmed in southern Alberta, the land where Sarah's people lived for so many generations. This is the kind of heaven she seems to belong in."" The trial judge had allowed the video to be presented, calling it a ""very compelling tape"" and adding that ""it has more probative value than any prejudicial effect."" Kelly appealed, saying the video so influenced the jury that the panel was unable to render a fair assessment of the penalty. California's highest court allowed the verdict and death penalty to stand, but urged judges to use caution in allowing such video evidence. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, in a brief statement, said Monday he would have accepted Kelly's appeal of his sentence and held oral arguments on the issue. ""The videos added nothing relevant to the jury's deliberations,"" he wrote, ""and invited a verdict based on sentiment, rather than reasoned judgment."" But it takes four justices to grant further review of a case, and only Justices David Souter and Stephen Breyer joined Stevens. Breyer called the Kelly video ""poignant, tasteful, artistic and, above all, moving,"" but he noted that was the problem. ""Those aspects of the film tell the jury little or nothing about the crime's 'circumstances' "" the jury had to consider during sentencing. The companion case dealt with Samuel Zamudio, convicted in the February 1996 slayings of Elmer Benson, 79, and his wife Gladys, 74, in the South Gate area of Los Angeles. The defendant lived next door to the Bensons and owed money to them. He robbed and stabbed the elderly couple, and a jury sentenced him to death. The Bensons' daughter, Linda Bouffard, narrated 118 scenes from her parents' life. The trial judge forbade the playing of accompanying audio, and instructed Bouffard not to make inflammatory comments, an order she complied with. Courts around the country have offered differing rulings on the issue of such videos. Juries in Maryland, Missouri, Montana and Arkansas have been allowed to see video of victims playing the piano, with their families at Christmas time, and playing with their children. But a federal court in Massachusetts barred a video of about 200 photos of a victim, set to Beatles and James Taylor music. And a Texas court tossed out a murder conviction after a slain man's father showed a video tribute, also with Enya music, during the penalty phase. The Supreme Court in 1991 upheld the use of victim impact evidence, saying it balanced what the justices at the time said was almost unlimited mitigation evidence the defendant could offer. But the high court said such evidence has its limits. Then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote that a criminal defendant could seek judicial relief ""in the event that evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair."" The justices in 2006 unanimously upheld the conviction of another California killer after the victim's family members wore buttons with a picture of the slain man as they sat silently in front of jurors throughout the trial.","Case involved case of Sara Weir, stabbed to death in California .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is denying allegations of ""abusive behavior"" and ""volcanic eruptions of foul temper"" ahead of the publication of a new book by a top British political journalist. The claims come in a book by Andrew Rawnsley of the Observer newspaper, which will be released March 1. The newspaper began running excerpts on Sunday. ""These malicious allegations are totally without foundation,"" Brown's official spokesman said in a statement Saturday. The spokesman is traditionally not quoted by name. The Observer claimed that Brown's behavior upset staff at his office, 10 Downing Street, so much so that the head of the civil service launched an investigation and ""ordered"" the prime minister ""to change his behavior."" Britain has a professional civil service which runs the administration of the government, distinct from elected politicians. The Cabinet Office, a part of the civil service, issued a strongly-worded denial that Sir Gus O'Donnell had looked into Brown's behavior or warned him about it. ""It is categorically not the case that the Cabinet secretary asked for an investigation of the (prime minister's) treatment of Number 10 staff,"" his office said in a statement. ""These assertions have been put to the Cabinet secretary who has rejected them."" Before the publication of the excerpts from the book, there were rumors it would allege that Brown had hit staffers, which he denied Saturday. ""Let me just say, absolutely clearly, so that there is no misunderstanding about that: I have never, never hit anybody in my life,"" he said, according to a statement from his office. The book, ""The End of the Party,"" apparently does not claim the prime minister hit people. Brown is required by law to call an election by June this year. The date has not yet been announced, but it is widely expected to be May 6, and the election campaign has already started. One of the top strategists in Brown's Labour Party, Peter Mandelson, declined to deny that Brown had a temper, but painted his personality as a virtue. ""I don't think he so much bullies people as he's very demanding of people. He's demanding of himself, he's demanding of people around him,"" Mandelson said on the BBC's ""Andrew Marr Show"" on Sunday. ""He does not like taking no for an answer.... there is a degree of impatience about the man, but what would you like? Some sort of shrinking violet at the helm of the government?"" Mandelson asked. Mandelson laughed and dodged a question from Marr about whether Brown had ever hit him or shouted at him. But he said Rawnsley had a history of writing about events he had not witnessed. ""He's a very good, colorful writer, but that's it,"" Mandelson said.","Brown accused of ""abusive behavior"", ""volcanic eruptions of foul temper""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A letter penned by George Washington praising the new Constitution sold for $3.2 million at an auction, the highest price for a letter by America's first president. The four-page letter in Washington's slanting penmanship was written to his nephew Bushrod Washington in November 1787, according to Christie's, the company that auctioned it. It was in the possession of an unidentified British descendant of his family, Christie's said. Washington led the Philadelphia Convention, at which the Constitution was drafted in 1787. After the Constitution was produced, a nationwide debate ensued on whether to ratify it. In the letter written from Washington's Virginia estate, Mount Vernon, he endorses the Constitution and highlights the benefits of compromise and of states merging into one nation. ""The central issues must be consolidated -- and local views as far as the general good will admit, must be attended to,"" he says in the letter, according to Christie's. The company said the president confided in his nephew. ""Washington professed neutrality in public, but to Bushrod expressed his unequivocal conviction that the new Constitution must be ratified, in spite of opposition from many special-interest groups,"" Christie's said. The buyer was not identified. Christie's had earlier estimated that the letter would fetch $1.5 million to $2.5 million at Friday's auction. Washington served from 1789 to 1797, then died of a throat infection two years later. He died at his beloved Mount Vernon at age 67, plunging the nation into months of mourning. Last year, a 1864 letter in which President Abraham Lincoln replies to the abolitionist pleas of youth sold for $3.4 million.","Highest price ever paid for a letter penned by America's first president .

"(CNN) -- Long after she escaped a polygamist Colorado City, Arizona, community in 1986, Flora Jessop found another way to escape: cocaine. Flora Jessop says she ran away from a polygamist sect in 1986 after being married to her cousin. ""It killed the pain. It killed the hurt,"" she said. ""I didn't have to hurt so bad because I missed everything I knew."" Once she fled the fundamentalist Mormon sect, she was an apostate. She believed God hated her. Her parents and siblings thought she was wicked. Worst of all, she knew she was damned to hell, Jessop said. Jessop, then 17, began hitchhiking across the country, almost killed herself with cocaine, worked as a topless dancer and eventually became pregnant, she said. Fearing that church members would hunt her down, she looked over her shoulder for five years, she said. She occasionally drank alcohol -- she liked tequila best -- but preferred to use cocaine because it kept her alert. ""When you're running for your life, you can't afford to get to the point you cannot run,"" she said.  Watch Jessop explain how running was an education » . It was a need to protect her daughter that finally convinced her there was more to life, she said. Today, Jessop, 38, escapes by freeing others trapped unwillingly in polygamist sects: 84 to date. She finds particular solace in rescuing women and children, some of whom are child brides like she was. It was a marriage to her first cousin Philip that prompted Jessop to run. Her story strikes a common theme among those who have left the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a Mormon offshoot that disavowed the mainstream church in 1890 when it abandoned polygamy as a pathway to the highest level of heaven. The FLDS has strict rules, especially for girls: no pants, haircuts, drugs, booze or boys; just ""keep sweet"" and obey. So young women who leave often delve into worldly pleasures once outside, indulgences as innocent as blue jeans and as destructive as heroin and prostitution, survivors and an expert say. Jenny Larson experienced such urges in 1946, when her mother, Berna, left a polygamist household in Glendale, Utah, with seven of her nine children. In those days, however, rebellion bore a different hue. Larson, 73, recalls how ""you wouldn't have caught me wearing a long-sleeve blouse"" after leaving Glendale. ""I think I was one of the first girls in the seventh grade to wear lipstick. I put henna in my hair to make it red. I wasn't going to look like a little 'polyg' kid,"" she said, using the slang ""polyg"" with all the contempt of a racial slur. Larson -- who goes by Aunt Jenny to the dozens of girls she's helped escape and who wrote the book ""Brainwash to Hogwash: Escaping and Exposing Polygamy"" -- concedes it's rare that young women can shed the sect's psychological shackles. So how did she know polygamy wasn't for her? Larson recalls seeing her father, Vergel, smack her mother for expressing jealousy over his second wife, Mae.  Watch an ex-sect member say she's now free » . ""There was no way in hell I was going to live that way,"" Larson said. And Larson quipped of the men hounding her for her hand in marriage when she was 11: ""Some of them were so ugly I wondered how they could have sex without putting a sack over their head, but I'm being mean."" Larson's and Jessop's escapes are not typical. Many women don't want to leave, ex-sect members and an expert said. The purportedly rescued women often return to polygamy. An example is the 1953 raid at Short Creek (now Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City), where dozens of women and more than 260 children were placed in state custody. Three of the then-children taken in the raid recently said that they eventually returned to polygamist lifestyles, including Fawneta Caroll, who was 7 when she was taken from her family. She remembers clearly what she felt 55 years ago, and it wasn't relief, she said. ""We knew that the object was to take us away, adopt us out and we would never be back to our homes,"" she said. Religion -- the reason these women say they stay -- is also used to validate the brainwashing and, in some cases, physical abuse employed to keep women and children submissive, said Marci Hamilton, author of ""Justice Denied: What America Must Do to Protect Its Children."" The women are wholly dependent on the patriarchal community, Hamilton said. They often lack education and marketable skills, and they're told of ""terrible forces outside the compound,"" namely evil people who wish them harm, she said. And there's always the prospect of eternal damnation, said Hamilton, a professor at Yeshiva University's Cardozo School of Law who has studied polygamist sects for 10 years. ""It's not only physically dangerous to leave, you're also risking your soul,"" she said. ""Staying in the compound, even though they're being abused, may look like a smarter choice to a lot of these people."" Joni Holm has taken care of four children who escaped Colorado City, and she concurs that youngsters who leave the community have trouble shaking their indoctrination. ""You literally have to take them, deprogram them and reintroduce them to society,"" she said. Flora Jessop brought Fawn Holm, 16, and Fawn Broadbent, 17, to Joni Holm's Sandy, Utah, home in 2004.  Watch Jessop talk about life in a sect » . Fawn Holm, Joni's sister-in-law, feared that she was about to be married to now-imprisoned FLDS ""prophet"" Warren Jeffs, who is serving time in Utah for being an accomplice to rape. Broadbent's name had just been placed in the church's ""Joy Book,"" meaning she could be married off any day, and probably without warning. The ""two Fawns"" were smart, Joni Holm said, but had elementary school education levels. They had bizarre mannerisms and wouldn't look people in the eye. They would sometimes jump off elevators because ""they were taught they could never be alone with a man,"" she said. Fawn Holm began using drugs and alcohol, and Broadbent dabbled in drinking, Joni Holm said. It's a common phenomenon, Larson said. ""When you're held down and can't have any freedoms, they go the opposite way when they get out: drinking, drugs, sex. They're going to hell anyway; they just jump headfirst in."" Joni and husband Carl's greatest challenge, however, was teaching the teens to trust. So entrenched was their distrust of ""outsiders"" that they needed even the simplest things proved to them, especially examples of how the FLDS ""twisted"" the Book of Mormon, said Joni Holm, a mainstream Mormon. ""You have to show them factual stuff, because this is what their dad has taught them all their lives,"" she said. When Texas authorities seized 416 children from the FLDS Yearning for Zion compound in Eldorado this month, there were similar signs of indoctrination, said Helen Pfluger, whose Baptist church in nearby San Angelo volunteered to help feed and clothe the children and their mothers. ""They were very quiet and didn't want to look us in the eye,"" she said. ""We never knew for sure which child belonged to which mother. It was very communal."" They refused to play board games. Clothes had to be cotton and plain, no patterns and no red, ""the color of the devil,"" Pfluger said. The children shunned processed food, white bread and sodas, and essentially subsisted on yogurt, fruit and lots of almonds, she said. ""Another San Angelo church had brought some coloring pages and crayons,"" she said. ""They didn't know what to do with them, and their mothers didn't either."" Learning to color will be one of many challenges the children will face if they're permanently removed from YFZ ranch. Joni Holm said it takes five to 10 years for a sect child to learn how to live a life society would deem ""normal."" Larson said it could take longer. Jessop said she might never be normal. But Jessop said she would rather wage the battles she faces on ""the outside"" than live a life of submission and abuse. She reckons many FLDS children would feel the same way if given a choice, she said. It was difficult to give up the life she was taught was her only path to salvation. But she had to do it to get away from a culture that she felt was backward and malevolent, she said. ""The pain got so bad in heaven that I was willing to damn myself to hell to escape it,"" she said. E-mail to a friend .

"Maryland's attorney general said Wednesday that the state may legally recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The 45-page opinion from Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler was addressed to state Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. ""You have asked whether those marriages may be recognized under state law. The answer to that question is clearly 'yes,'"" Gansler wrote. He noted that his opinion is ""not itself the law of Maryland in the same sense as a statute enacted by the Legislature or court decision elaborating the common law or construing a statute."" Rather, it is an interpretation of law intended to guide courts and government agencies, he said. ""Thus, what we say in this opinion is a prediction, not a prescription, as to the how the court would approach this issue under current law,"" Gansler wrote. His office said that he cannot direct the actions of state agencies. But Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said Wednesday afternoon that the state ""will be guided by the attorney general's thorough analysis and legal advice on this matter."" He added, ""I am confident that the attorney general and his office will provide all necessary advice to state agencies on how to comply with the law, and I expect all state agencies to work with the attorney general's office to ensure compliance with the law."" Further details were not immediately available, and the governor's office did not return phone calls seeking clarification. It was unclear what the immediate ramifications of Gansler's opinion would be in Maryland. One state representative, Del. Emmett Burns -- who sponsored a bill earlier this year that would have barred the state from recognizing same-sex marriages performed in other states and other countries -- said the attorney general's opinion ""muddles the waters."" Burns' bill failed in committee. Referring to the opinion, Burns said, ""I don't think it's worth a bucket of warm spit. ... I don't think it's something that is going to make that big of a difference."" He said the issue is likely to be decided through legislation or in a court case. He noted that state Sen. Norman Stone is sponsoring a bill that mirrors Burns' failed one. Also, he said, the House Judiciary Committee is considering a bill that would allow same-sex marriage. ""It's going to be going pandemonium on the House floor"" if that bill makes it out of committee, he said. He added he believes there is much opposition in both the state House and Senate to same-sex marriage. ""I believe that the concept is going to have be settled through [public] referendum,"" he said. ""If it were to go to referendum, my side will win."" Maryland state law from 1973 says that only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid in the state. However, there are no laws or court cases regarding recognition of marriages legally performed in other places, the attorney general's office said. Madaleno said in a statement released through Equality Maryland that the opinion is ""welcome news"" for same-sex couples legally married in states where the practice is allowed, and ""nothing in the attorney general's opinion changes the fact that same-sex couples cannot obtain marriage licenses in Maryland."" Media reports said Madaleno had asked the attorney general in May whether Maryland may legally recognize same-sex marriages. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire and Iowa allow same-sex marriage. The District of Columbia has also passed a law allowing same-sex marriage, although it has not yet taken effect.

"London, England (CNN) -- Tiger Woods' marital ""transgressions"" may have cast doubt on the future of his corporate associations, but history shows that a dose of bad publicity does not always mean an end to the earning power of sport stars. The world's No. 1 golfer has not been seen in advertisements on American television since November 29 according to media research company Nielsen, with the blackout starting just two days after he crashed his car outside his house -- reportedly following an argument with his wife. But Nigel Currie, director of international sponsorship agency BrandRapport, believes that although  Woods faces an uncertain corporate future, his marketability will remain if he thinks creatively. ""It all depends on how long the story will stay on the front page. A story like this makes sponsors very nervous because they don't know if there's more to come,"" he told CNN. ""Most companies will have a morality clause as part of the contract with a big name like Woods. This is usually enforced because of drugs [or criminal issues], but in a situation like this which is ongoing, there's a good chance these companies will exercise their rights and jump ship."" However, while Woods --, the first sportsman to earn $1 billion -- might possibly lose some sponsors, other revenue streams could be exploited, according to Currie. Will Tiger Woods return to golf the same? ""This chink in his armor won't impact his earning capacity, but companies and brands will think differently in the future. It will open up new offers and close a few doors too,"" he said. While golf is traditionally a very conservative sport which attracts like minded backers, it is still possible to bring in sponsors even in cases as extreme as John Daly -- whose drinking, smoking and eating problems put his career at risk. Daly's less than wholesome image paid dividends in 2005 when the American teamed up with restaurant chain Hooters, known for its scantily-clad waitresses, in what seemed a mutually beneficial arrangement. Hooters vice-president Mike McNeil said in a statement on Daly's Web site: ""John is unique, successful and a man of the people who doesn't really worry too much about what the establishment thinks. In fact he's a lot like Hooters."" But the appeal of Daly's carefree attitude also proved to be his downfall when, in November 2008, the golfer was found drunk and face down in a flower bed outside a Hooters restaurant. Earlier this year, Hooters quietly relinquished their contract with the colorful, larger-than-life character. Another player who has successfully surfed the wave of marketing and endorsement despite a checkered personal life is European golfing legend Nick Faldo. Despite two divorces and a number of well-documented affairs -- including a three-year liaison with 20-year-old Brenna Cepelak which ended famously with the American student battering Faldo's Porsche with a golf club -- sponsorship has never eluded the golfer. Faldo also went on to cement his position among the game's elite when he captained the European Ryder Cup team in 2008. Time will tell if Tiger Woods' self-confessed ""personal failings"" will impact on his career, but his world-beating marketability may have to undergo some change.","Major sponsors have distanced themselves from Tiger Woods after his recent scandal .

"(CNN) -- Jury selection in the case of a deadly 2007 Connecticut home invasion was postponed Monday because the suspect was hospitalized, his defense attorney said. Steven Hayes was in intensive care, attorney Thomas Ullmann said. Jury selection in Hayes' murder trial was delayed. A status conference was scheduled for Wednesday, Ullmann said. ""We have no idea how long this is going to take,"" the attorney added. Hayes, 46, is one of two men charged with offenses including felony murder, kidnapping, sexual assault and arson in the July 2007 home invasion in Cheshire, Connecticut. Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky, 29, broke into the home of the Petit family. They say the two beat up Dr. William Petit; strangled his 48-year-old wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit; and set the home ablaze. The couple's two daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit, died from smoke inhalation. Trial's start stirs painful memories in Cheshire . Ullmann said he did not know why Hayes was hospitalized, but the Hartford Courant, citing unnamed sources, said he apparently overdosed on medication he receives daily. Superior Court Judge Jon C. Blue said in court Monday that Ullmann told him Hayes was found unconscious in his cell and may be in a medically induced coma. The University of Connecticut Medical Center referred questions Monday to the Connecticut Department of Correction. The department declined comment, citing a court-imposed gag order in the case. Authorities allege that during the Petit home invasion, one of the attackers drove Hawke-Petit to a bank to withdraw money. She was able to alert a bank teller that the family was being held captive, and the teller alerted police, authorities said. Media reports said that Hawke-Petit and Michaela Petit were sexually assaulted during the seven-hour ordeal. Prosecutors have declined to confirm details because of the gag order. The motive in the case remains unclear. Hayes and Komisarjevsky, who is set to be tried separately, could face the death penalty if convicted.","Steven Hayes, defendant in Connecticut home invasion case, reportedly in coma .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- So many doctors are answering Haiti's call for medical aid that the largest hospital in Port-au-Prince has a new problem: organizing and finding good use for them all. ""I think there is a lot of confusion,"" said Marivittoria Rava, a longtime volunteer with the charity Friends of the Orphans, which runs a children's hospital caring for some post-operative patients from the general hospital. Rava said that medical supplies and resources have improved, but the crush of volunteer doctors in Port-au-Prince can complicate treatment in the city while there is great need for help in other places hit by the earthquake. iReport:  Looking for loved ones in Haiti . The general hospital has nine operating rooms, but a near platoon of volunteer surgeons. That leaves many standing by for work, though there are relatively few nurses. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta learned medical teams are taking their first steps to organize and see how many of them are needed. Representatives from each volunteer doctor group at the general hospital gathered for a quick, to-the-point meeting over the weekend. ""We are all well-staffed,"" Dr. Paul Auerbach of Stanford University told the group. ""The issue is coordinating."" Auerbach is the point person to try and control the surge of doctors. Over the weekend, he and volunteer groups started tackling some basics of treatment: how to ID patients, keep records and make rounds. Among the problems with the large number of doctors, Auerbach said, is that patients can have their dressings opened three or four times in close succession as one and then another crew of doctors come to evaluate their wounds. To change that, charity groups have set up shifts and literally drawn lines, sketching maps on hospital walls showing who is working where. They are also identifying medical centers outside Port-au-Prince, where there is need for the booming supply of doctors in the capital. Full coverage . Space is also an issue. A team from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is carefully assessing the buildings that survived on hospital grounds, trying to find a stable place for post-operative care. Patients now recover in tents or are taken to other hospitals. As the city's main hospital is brimming with doctors, it is in need of nurses and physical therapists. Thousands of amputees will need significant, specialized help from physical therapists, but few are available. Nurses are in short supply. A nursing school on the grounds of the general hospital was crushed in the earthquake, killing some of the people who would be giving care now. The flood of outside volunteers is mostly doctors, not nurses. Interactive map of where to find aid, hospitals in Haiti . At one point over the weekend, a mass of 12 medical workers gathered around a tiny premature infant. Someone called out, ""If you're not a doctor, step away!"" Immediately someone else responded, ""We're all doctors!"" Even as they juggle an abundance of doctors, many volunteers said they worry the general hospital in Port-au-Prince could again face dire need after this first wave of medical staff rotates out of Haiti over the next two weeks. Those on the ground advise doctors who want to help Haiti to wait and volunteer in a few weeks or months.","Largest hospital in Port-au-Prince has too many doctors; coordination is a problem .

"(CNN) -- Universities nationwide were recovering Friday, a day after protests over education budget cuts hit campuses from coast to coast. Though many of the demonstrations were peaceful, some turned chaotic. On the West Coast, the University of California, Santa Cruz, was scheduled to reopen Friday. The crush of demonstrators on Thursday caused administrators to close the northern California campus. ""Please check back for information on the campus's planned return to service on Friday,"" the university Web site said. The protest, dubbed the March 4 National Day of Action, sent thousands of students, educators and supporters to the streets to challenge budget cuts and tuition increases. In Oakland, California, police arrested 160 protesters who shut down a freeway, authorities said. Police stopped students from shutting down a freeway near the University of California, Davis, in northern California. Demonstrations occurred in other states including Colorado, New York and Wisconsin. A blog called Student Activism, which compiled a list of the protests, said 122 events were slated in 33 states,  most on campuses and some at state capitols. Many of Thursday's demonstrations focused on cuts in state funding for colleges and universities, which supporters say drive up tuition, limit classes and make higher education unobtainable to many. State funding for the California State University system was reduced by nearly $1 billion for the academic years between 2008 and 2010. Schools have responded by increasing fees, canceling classes, cutting student support programs and furloughing professors. Fees have increased 182 percent since 2002. Class waiting lists have doubled or tripled. ""The less affordable education becomes, the less likely low-income students will be able to get a college education,"" said Lillian Taiz, president of the California Faculty Association and a professor of history at California State University, Los Angeles.","Demonstrations on Thursday caused administrators to close the northern California campus .

"(CNN) -- Osiel Cardenas Guillen, the former head of a powerful Mexican drug cartel, was sentenced to 25 years in prison and will forfeit to the United States $50 million in illegal proceeds, a judge ruled. Cardenas Guillen, 42, was the leader of the Matamoros, Mexico-based Gulf cartel until his capture in 2003. He was subsequently extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges in 2007. U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle handed down the sentence Wednesday, following an earlier guilty plea by the drug kingpin. Under Cardenas Guillen's leadership, the Gulf cartel was responsible for smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine and marijuana into the United States, the FBI said in a news release. According to the FBI, in 1999 Cardenas Guillen threatened to kill a U.S. undercover sheriff's deputy. In another incident, he threatened the lives of two U.S. agents. ""The successful prosecution of Cardenas Guillen underscores the joint resolve of the United States and Mexico to pursue and prosecute the leadership of the drug trafficking cartels, dismantle their organizations and end the violence and corruption they have spawned,"" U.S. Attorney Jose Angel Moreno said. Cardenas Guillen pleaded guilty to five felony charges, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, conspiracy to launder money and threatening to assault and kill federal agents. Tagle also fined Cardenas Guillen $100,000 and ordered him to five years probation once his sentence is served.

The commission said in a statement that it is ""disappointed at the resignation of an important member"" at a crucial time in the process. ""The (commission) remains dedicated to the elections process and will continue to work openly and honestly in the implementation of its mandate under the Afghan Electoral Law,"" the statement said. ""This will not distract the (commission) from continuing to focus on the task at hand."" Complaints of irregularities have dogged the presidential elections. The top United Nations official in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, admitted Sunday that the vote was marred by ""widespread fraud."" Eide's recently fired deputy Peter Galbraith told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that Eide earlier refused to share details of voting irregularities with Afghan election officials. Galbraith also said his former boss could have prevented some fraud by closing unsecured polling stations. Eide on Sunday denied the allegations of withholding information and defended his decisions to open as many polling stations as possible, despite security concerns. With findings of the fraud complaints investigation upcoming, Galbraith said he anticipates the commission will determine that Afghan President Hamid Karzai will not have enough votes to avoid a runoff. ""I think there's a very strong likelihood that the election complaints commission will find that he's below 50 percent, and then the question is whether Karzai will accept that decision and whether the Independent Election Commission, which is not independent but a pro-Karzai body, will accept that decision,"" Galbraith said.  Watch Galbraith's reaction to Eide's acknowledgement of election fraud » . ""If they don't, then the political crisis in Afghanistan, which has already done such damage to the overall effort there, will get much worse."" The Independent Election Commission is expected to soon finish an audit and recount of suspicious ballots; the results could be announced this week. The independent commission is a ""constitutional body"" that conducts ""free and fair elections"" in an ""impartial way"" according to its Web site. Galbraith has also accused Barakzai of favoring incumbent Karzai, even though the Electoral Complaints Commission says that it is also an independent body. Election tallies have yet to be certified because of the allegations. Last month, final uncertified results showed Karzai with 54 percent of the vote.

"New York (CNN) -- If President Obama had been forthright last week at the health care summit, he would have opened the meeting by stating: ""If you have health coverage, under our reform bills you are going to pay more and get less. If you are one of the 45 million elderly or disabled people on Medicare, you are going to get less. There is no such thing as free medical care. Somebody has to pay!  And in the end it is you."" Those are the facts! And as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stated to the Republicans : ""...you're entitled to your opinion, but not your own facts."" However, the facts, as the president has found out, are not exactly a compelling message to persuade a reluctant Congress and public to overhaul nearly one-fifth of the nation's economy. Adding 31 million people (45 million now don't have coverage) to the health care system will cost the taxpayers trillions over time. Many of that uninsured group can't afford health insurance, and if this legislation passes, the government will create an entitlement program to subsidize them. In the end, like the entitlement programs that have gone before them, they will far exceed any cost estimates on the table today. Just to remind you, Mr. President and members of Congress,  the taxpayers have a right to know the full fiscal consequences of this legislation. The United States is spending this year nearly $2.5 trillion on health care. That is 17.3 percent of the U.S. economy and it's rising at a rapid rate. We spent $134 billion more in the past year than in the year before. To put $2.5 trillion into perspective, that is more money than the federal government received in taxes and revenues this year. The problem is nobody knows (and especially the Congress) what a trillion dollars really means. A trillion is a million million. Still means nothing to most of us. If you spent a million dollars a day since the birth of Jesus Christ, it wouldn't even equal a trillion. If you stacked up a trillion dollars in dollar bills, it would reach 68,000 miles into the sky, about a third of the way from the Earth to the moon. Those numbers are too big for any of us. Somebody has to pay for the most expensive health care in the world. Many experts would argue it is also the very best health coverage in the world. Health care today is paid for by three entities. The government  (federal, state and local) pays more than 50 percent of the costs. That is us, the taxpayers. The insurance companies pay about one-third of the costs. That again is us. We pay the premiums and the insurance company pools the risk, and distributes our monies back for the medical services. They obviously add an overhead cost as does any business, but it's still our money being paid out. The third payer is again us. Out-of-pocket reimbursements or additional fees come directly out of our pocket and paycheck. Health care has changed as dramatically as anything in our society in the last half century.  First, we are living longer. In 2007, American men could expect to live 3.5 years longer and women 1.6 years longer than in 1990. We are long past the days when you walked into a doctor's office and the doctor -- armed only with a stethoscope, blood pressure monitor and a thermometer -- listened to our symptoms and made a diagnosis. Maybe in a rare case an X-ray was called for. We paid our bill and went to the drugstore and got our prescription.  There were no MRI's, no heart diagnostic tests, no CT scans or any of the wonder drugs that have extended our lives and in many cases made the quality better. It's not that people aren't seeing doctors. In the last several years, more than 1.2 billion annual visits to a physician's office have taken place, averaging more than three a year per person. Certainly, some efforts must be made to provide some insurance reform -- but that also means malpractice insurance reform. Some massive efforts need to be made to curb Medicare and insurance fraud. And efforts must be made to create more competition among insurance companies across state lines. The president's attempt to add some of the better suggestions from the Republicans addressing these issues is not going to add any support from that side of the aisle. They are minor changes that are positive but don't tackle the fundamental cost issues or address the new entitlements and mandates that Republicans object to most. Reducing costs in most cases means reducing services. Who doesn't want an MRI for their child injured in a car wreck? Who doesn't want tests done on a spouse or parent who has chest or abdominal pain? But if Reid and Pelosi shove this legislation through Congress against public opinion, they and their party will pay a price. Yet the price Democrats will pay at the polls in November won't be nearly as big a price as our kids and grandkids will pay when the bill comes through years hence. If you're going to have reform, make the system better. Take your time and do it right.

"Lisbon, Portugal (CNN)  -- Let's face it, footballers have a bad rep. They are labelled by many as overpaid selfish prima donnas who could not care less about the world around them. This may in reality apply to some players, but definitely not all of them. In Lisbon I recently met many who truly enjoy being role models and were honored to take part in the 7th edition of the United Nations (UN) Match Against Poverty. This year, in light of the tragic earthquake in Haiti, all of the proceeds went to the devastated country as 55 thousand people filled the Stadium of Light to greet some of the best footballers on the planet, both past and present. The likes of Kaka, Thierry Henry, Luis Figo and Zinedine Zidane lent a hand to this cause. Organizers were hoping to raise over $750 000 and in ticket sales alone, that target was reached. Having the privilege to be behind the scenes at this match in my home country, I spoke with various players about their involvement in it. One of the most concerned about the plight of the Haitian people was Thierry Henry. The Barcelona forward, who made headlines for the wrong reasons after his controversial handball which helped prevent Ireland from attending the World Cup, had already personally pledged $90,000 to the French aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres. ""I am very touched by this tragedy and it is very good that everybody should mobilize in order to help Haiti,"" Henry told his club side Barcelona's official Web site. ""This touches me because almost 20 years ago something similar happened in (the French Caribbean island of) Guadeloupe and I know what the Haitians must be going through. I have many friends over there. Haiti is a former French colony and it's as if we are cousins."" Henry showed true concern for a nation that needs all the help it can get to rebuild its infrastructure and its hope. Zidane, Kaka and Figo were others who told me they were shocked by some of the footage they saw coming out of Haiti. As the death toll rose, they felt they needed to do something to help, and were delighted so many high-profile names showed up. In all, some 40 international players participated in a match that was qualified as a success by all, including the former Arsenal striker. ""We must help them. I felt I should do something and that's why I have decided to make a donation to Medecins sans Frontieres,"" said the former Arsenal legend.","United Nations game in Lisbon raises over $750,000 for Haiti earthquake appeal .

"(CNN) -- Israel's Shahar Peer continued her superb run at the Dubai Open by beating Li Na of China to reach the semifinals of the WTA Tier One tournament on Thursday. Peer progressed to a match-up with Venus Williams as Li, who reached the semifinals of the Australian Open, retired with a back injury when trailing 5-7 0-3. Peer, who was refused entry to the United Arab Emirates for last year's tournament, is posing a security problem for organizers, who have scheduled her matches on an outside court with restricted access. With tensions high after last month's assassination of a senior Hamas official in Dubai, placing Peer on the 5,000 capacity Center Court for her last four clash is a step they may be unwilling to take. Peer, who has been in fine form in 2010, beat top seed Caroline Wozniacki to reach the quarterfinals and said after the match that despite the controversies in the past she was receiving a good reception. ""I get really amazing treatment here and they are so nice to me, all the people around me that are taking care of me,"" she told the official WTA Tour Web site. Against world number 10 Li, she was always on top as she headed for her fourth straight win in the tournament and her first over the highly-rated Chinese player. Defending champion Venus Williams showed her liking for the venue with a straight sets 6-3 6-4 win over promising young Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in their quarterfinal later on Thursday. In other quarterfinal action, seventh seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland saw off Russian qualifier Regina Kulikova in three hard-fought sets, 3-6 6-4 6-3. She will play fourth seed Victoria Azarenka of Belaus who brushed aside Russian Vera Zvonareva 6-1 6-3 to reach the last four.","Israel's Shahar Peer reaches the semifinals of the Dubai Tennis Championship .

"London, England (CNN) -- A letter written by Adolf Hitler in 1931 hoping for a ""truly cordial relationship"" between Britain and Germany goes on sale Tuesday and is estimated to fetch up to £12,000 at auction. The one-page letter was addressed to Sefton Delmer, a British journalist, in which Hitler expressed hopes of a new friendship between the two countries to replace the ""unhappy war-psychosis"" that existed after the First World War: . Hitler wrote the letter 16 months before he became chancellor and seized power in 1933. In the letter he said: ""I hope... that out of this crisis a new readiness will grow up in Britain to submit the past twelve years to a reappraisal. I should be happy, if as a result of this the unhappy war-psychosis could be overcome on such a scale as to permit the realization of the truly cordial relationship between the British and the German peoples so eagerly desired by myself and my movement. ""For I believe that the crisis now breaking in on us can only be solved by the closest political collaboration of those nations who see in the re-establishment of a natural European balance of power the first precondition to dealing with those great world problems under which Britain too suffers today."" Andrew Roberts, the British military and political historian, said the letter was a classic example of Hitler trying to lull Western democracies into a state of appeasement. Roberts said Hitler was saying there were underlying interests between Britain and Germany and that he wrote many such letters. ""He refers to 12 years which would make it 1919, the year the Versailles Treaty was signed... appeasement was his central message until the outbreak of war. Sefton Delmer would not have been taken in by any of this,"" said Roberts. Auctioneers at Bonhams in London said the letter has remained in Delmer's family until now but they could not release the name of the person selling it. Delmer was the Berlin correspondent of the Daily Express at the time when Hitler wrote the letter. He was born in Berlin and spent the first 15 years of his life there before his family were expatriated to the UK. He is reported to be the first British journalist to interview Hitler, who he later described as a rather ordinary looking man with hair that had been arranged too carefully.","Hitler wrote the letter 16 months before he became chancellor and seized power in 1933 .
