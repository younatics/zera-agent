"Melbourne, Australia (CNN) -- Dominika Cibulkova is proving that, at the Australian Open anyway, size doesn't matter. Cibulkova thumped Agnieszka Radwanska in the women's semifinals Thursday to move one match away from becoming the joint shortest grand slam singles winner in the Open Era. The 5-foot-3-inch Cibulkova needed a mere one hour, 10 minutes to dispose of the world No. 5, winning 6-1 6-2 to set up an encounter Saturday against now three-time Australian Open finalist Li Na. Li, the ouster of Canadian upstart Eugenie Bouchard 6-2 6-4, hasn't lost to Cibulkova in their four outings but the 20th seed will be buoyed by victories over former Wimbledon finalist Radwanska and four-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova this fortnight. Only a year ago on Australian soil in Sydney, Cibulkova didn't enjoy her time on court with Radwanska, handed a 6-0 6-0 double bagel defeat in the final of the Melbourne warmup event. Cibulkova is an anomaly in the current generation of women's tennis. A sparse three women in the top 100 -- American Lauren Davis and Japanese duo Misaki Doi and Kurumi Nara -- are shorter than Cibulkova. Last year, the women's grand slam winners were all 5' 6"" or taller. Li is just under 5' 8"". And since the Open Era began in 1968, no player shorter than 5' 3"" has claimed a major. Nancy Richey and Mima Jausovec, the same height as Cibulkova, claimed the 1968 French Open and 1977 French Open, respectively. ""It's not about how tall you are,"" Cibulkova, 24, told reporters. ""It's just you have to really believe in it. There is nothing more important than this."" According to seven-time tour winner Chanda Rubin, not a giant herself in tennis terms at 5' 6"", Cibulkova limits weaknesses and generates ample power. ""Obviously it's more difficult at times,"" Rubin, who peaked at No. 6 in the world, told CNN. ""You have to cover a lot more ground. You have to be quicker. You can't take a big step and cover half the court. You have that challenge. ""But when you see a player get to this level and see what she's achieved, it's because she's able to minimize any deficiencies and has those special skills -- the speed, the ability to create a little extra power even if she's not as tall, the ability to compete. Indeed, Cibulkova isn't the type to solely retrieve. Her power baseline game can leave opponents bamboozled. Cibulkova owns a 3-3 record against the 6' 2"" Sharapova, has downed world No. 2 Victoria Azarenka twice and tallied 11 of the first 14 games against the Belorussian in Miami in 2012 before nerves -- missing in Melbourne this year, judging by her sojourn -- intervened. Cibulkova attacked Radwanska's second serve, winning 14 of 16 points. Radwanska had beaten Azarenka on Wednesday to snap a seven-match losing streak against the two-time Australian Open champion. ""I feel like in slow motion today,"" Radwanska told reporters. Cibulkova said she wouldn't significantly alter her pre-match routine ahead of a maiden appearance in a grand slam final. The same could be said of her coach, Matej Liptak. He declined to be interviewed because he hasn't spoken to reporters during the Australian Open and didn't want to jinx his charge. ""I'm a little bit superstitious,"" he told CNN, while being congratulated by Czech-born tennis legend Martina Navratilova. Li raced to a 5-0 lead against 19-year-old Bouchard, the second Canadian player to make a grand slam singles semifinal, in about 15 minutes thanks to an array of winning shots and despite a wobble in the second set, advanced comfortably. She is bidding to win a second major following her success at the 2011 French Open. Even if the form book favors Li, 2001 Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic wasn't counting Cibulkova out. ""Women's tennis is unpredictable,"" he told CNN. ""From 15 matches I predicted I got them all wrong. ""If she can play tennis like she did today, it's impressive. It doesn't matter if she's 7-foot or 5-foot-3. She hits the ball so hard, it's good."" Third time lucky? However, Serena Williams' coach Patrick Mouratoglou is backing Li to make up for her 2011 and 2013 Melbourne defeats. ""It's the first time she plays a grand slam final being favorite,"" the Frenchman told CNN. ""She's the one who's supposed to win, she's playing a player who's much lower ranked than she is. The pressure is going to be much higher than what it usually is for her. ""On the other hand she has more experience. I liked the way she played this semifinal -- she handled it really well, which she couldn't do in the past. ""She served really, really well and the way she started the match was very surprising -- so aggressive from the start, she hit so many winners. ""It reminded me of Mike Tyson when he was boxing, stepping into the ring and 'boom boom boom.' It was like an uppercut to the chin and it took her (Bouchard) a long time to recover from that start. If she manages to start the same way in the final she's going to take a huge advantage. ""The second thing she did really well was the return, she was very aggressive. I think Bouchard won around 15% of the points on her second serve, which is really low. ""Cibulkova's serve is in a little way a weakness because she is a short player, so if she manages to do the same then there will be a lot of pressure on her opponent."" Injury worries . Mouratoglou said world No. 1 Williams is still recovering from the back injury she suffered ahead of her third-round match against Daniela Hantuchova, which also hampered her in the subsequent defeat by Ana Ivanovic. ""Her back is still bothering her,"" he said. ""I don't think it's too bad but it's very annoying -- she couldn't really express herself in the last two matches she played at the Australian Open. ""She needs more time and needs to see doctors in America and Europe, doctors who know her really well, to sort it out. I don't think it's bad, I think it's a matter of one week."" Mouratoglou said Williams, who suffered an ankle injury in Melbourne last year ahead of her shock quarterfinal exit, would use the loss to Ivanovic to motivate her for the rest of the new season. ""She hates losing so much, she's so competitive, in a way that's the best motive,"" he said of the American, who took her haul of grand slam titles to 17 in 2013. ""Sometimes it's good for her to have a few losses, it brings her back to even harder work."" In the men's draw, Stanislas Wawrinka is into the first grand slam final of his career after defeating seventh seed Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-7 (1-7) 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4). The eighth seed, who beat triple defending champion Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals, had never previously gone beyond the last eight at Melbourne Park. Sunday's final could see Switzerland's Wawrinka come up against his friend and compatriot Roger Federer, with the 17-time grand slam winner facing world No. 1 Rafael Nadal on Friday. Wawrinka and Federer won men's doubles gold together at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.","Dominika Cibulkova beats Agnieszka Radwanska to reach a first grand slam final .

"(CNN) -- Your friends don't need to know about every song you hear on the radio. That's the position Pandora has taken toward a new Facebook feature that lets users automatically publish information to their profiles about songs they listen to, videos they watch and articles they read. Pandora, which makes the popular personalized Internet radio service, isn't just concerned about clutter in your Facebook friends' news feeds. Some listeners could feel violated when they learn that an application is broadcasting information about their activities, Pandora executives said. ""It's true that music is a social experience, but it's also a very private experience,"" Pandora founder Tim Westergren said in a recent phone interview. ""We have to be very cautious."" Facebook is poised to release new features at a news conference on Wednesday that will allow users to automatically publish information from other websites and apps to their Timeline profiles, according to a person familiar with the project. These will go beyond the Facebook Music app that's already available, the person said. For example, a fitness program that tracks physical activities could send Facebook an update after a long jog. The plans were reported earlier by the website All Things Digital. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment. At a news conference in September, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said people would benefit from publishing more data and letting computer algorithms sort out what's important. ""No activity is too big or too small to share,"" Zuckerberg said. ""You don't have to 'Like' a movie. You just watch a movie."" Facebook will press on without the support of some major app makers, such as Apple, whose iTunes software is the No. 1 digital jukebox. An Apple spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Flipboard, an app that creates personalized magazines from social network feeds, has said the company doesn't plan to send information to Facebook about every article users read and will instead let users selectively post with a share button. She said people probably wouldn't want to broadcast everything. Pandora has supported many of Facebook's platform development efforts in the past. Pandora launched Facebook sharing features when they were first rolled out and was among the first to support Facebook's Instant Personalization program, which automatically recognizes a Pandora visitor's Facebook account. ""We have a great relationship with Facebook,"" a Pandora spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. ""We continue to be excited about what they are doing and more generally about the social dimension of music -- for example, there are a host of great new social features on the new Pandora.com site that we launched in September."" Pandora's feed can be tweaked or edited by each user, but only includes information when a user creates a new radio station or bookmarks or clicks the thumbs-up button on a particular song or artist. It doesn't post a feed of every song that plays. Facebook lets users manage which apps can publish to their profiles using a page called the Activity Log. In an interview with reporters in September, Facebook CTO Bret Taylor said the company's long-term goal is to have every app support the auto-publish features. Earlier partners have said that the tools have brought in hordes of newcomers to their websites. Pandora is one of many that is reluctant to sign on, but its absence from Facebook Music is noticeable. ""There is a segment for sure that wants to really promiscuously share and wants to hear about everything that their friends are listening to,"" Pandora CTO Tom Conrad told a small audience at a technology conference recently. However, they make up a minority, he said. ""There is a really large percentage of the Pandora audience that actually aren't interested at all in what their friends are listening to,"" Conrad said. ""They don't want to spam their entire social network with things they're discovering.""","Pandora does not plan to support Facebook Music and its auto-publish features .

"New York (CNN) -- A third person has accused Macy's flagship store in Herald Square of racial profiling after he purchased a $2,400 Louis Vuitton bag, according to his lawyer. Halim Sharif, a club promoter in New York City, claims the department store stopped him and unnecessarily searched his purchase because he was black, said lawyer Kareem Vessup. He is the fifth person to say he was targeted after shopping at a New York department store because of race this year. Three allegedly involved Macy's; the other two allegations were at Barneys New York. Vessup also represents Kayla Phillips, who claims that four NYPD plainclothes officers forcefully stopped her after she left Barneys with her purchase earlier this year in February. The incident involving Sharif occurred on April 19, 2013, when Sharif purchased the bag as a gift for a friend. On his way out of Macy's, a security alarm went off, his lawyer contends. Sharif was stopped by a loss-prevention member employee at Macy's who asked to see his receipt. Though Sharif provided his receipt, he claims that the employee started going through his purchase. ""They beat up the purchase pretty badly,"" said Vessup, who said, ""They [Macy's] became a little bit dismissive of Mr. Sharif."" Sharif managed to get cell phone video of the incident once a supervisor and manager intervened. Vessup says the video is not going to be released, but it shows other shoppers who set off the security alarm but were not stopped; none were African- American or Hispanic, he said. Sharif filed a complaint with Macy's but has received no response, according to his lawyer. Macy's said Saturday, ""We take any claim made by our customers very seriously and will investigate Mr. Sharif's allegation vigorously. Macy's has a zero tolerance for discrimination of any kind. ""If Macy's policies have not been upheld, we will take swift and immediate action. As Mr. Sharif's case is pending litigation, we cannot comment further on any specifics relating to the lawsuit."" Macy's signed a customer bill of rights earlier this month. Civil rights leaders met with retail chain representatives and agreed to create the document. The one-page document is to be posted to the department store websites, which will include Macy's, Barneys New York, Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue. ""Profiling is an unacceptable practice and will not be tolerated,"" the document states, drafted by the Retail Council of New York State, along with National Action Network and the Rev. Al Sharpton. ""Employees who violate the company's prohibition on profiling will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment,"" the document says. CNN's Rande Iaboni contributed to this report.","New claim made against Macy's in Herald Square .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Songs recorded by the Beatles 50 years ago went on sale Tuesday to meet a deadline that otherwise would have made bootlegging the music legal. If the music sounds familiar, you may have heard unauthorized, lesser-quality versions circulated by fans for decades -- or similar takes on the several anthology albums released over the years by the Beatles' label, Apple Corps. The 59 tracks downloadable on iTunes for $40 are previously unreleased. When John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr worked through a dozen or more takes of a song to get one they and producer George Martin liked, they likely hoped fans would never hear their mistakes. Some takes were so disliked that the tapes were destroyed. The surviving recordings became a liability for the record label, because their copyright on unreleased material ends on January 1, 2014. Independent labels could legally sell compilations of rejected versions of Beatles hits. Releasing them now gives Apple another 20 years' protection under a recent change in European law. The British government, following the change in European copyright law, implemented a law last month providing ""that if a record label is not commercially releasing a track that is over 50 years old, then the performers can request that the rights in the performance revert to them -- a 'use it or lose it' clause,"" the government's website said. Apple Corps did not comment to CNN on the motivation for the release, but the timing of the release and their naming it ""The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963"" suggests the connection. No doubt many hardcore Beatles fans around the world are bingeing on the 14 outtakes from three 1963 studio sessions, and the 44 songs from the dozens of BBC radio shows the group performed on when their fan base was mostly limited to the British Isles. The album also offers two demo recordings of songs written for others. The first Beatles Abbey Road session . The first several tracks came from their legendary 13-hour session with Martin on February 11, 1963. You'll hear three full takes of ""There's a Place,"" the first song they recorded that fateful day at EMI Studios in Abbey Road, London. Some of the tracks apparently were recorded for good measure after the group already got a take they were satisfied with. The new release includes the seventh take of ""Do You Want to Know a Secret,"" while the sixth one was released in 1963. At the end of the take McCartney comments about the ""the do-da-do bits"" in the vocal harmonies. The sixth take of ""Taste of Honey"" is included from that session. It was the fifth take with added vocals that made it on the 1963 album. The Beatles got only three complete takes of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" out of nine attempts during that marathon first session. One was released in 1963 and a second in a 1995 anthology project. The new release, the second take, is the third and only previously unreleased complete version. Two takes of ""Misery"" -- the first and seventh recording that afternoon -- are included. You will not hear Martin's piano, which was dubbed onto the final version a week later. Abbey Road Studio: March 1963 . The two tracks of ""From Me to You"" offer a glimpse of the group's studio demeanor during another Abbey Road session on March 5, 1963. They stop playing abruptly in the first take, with Martin asking why. ""I just thought I heard you talking actually. Did you whistle? "" One Beatle to another at the end of the second take: ""Ah, you missed the ending, baby."" ""George is to play the first bit of the instrumental, isn't he?"" Lennon asks before they start another take. ""Key right into the harmony."" ""Thank You Girl,"" a song written as a tribute to their already dedicated female groupies, is next. The new release includes the first and fifth of 13 takes from the March session. The song was used as a B-side on a single. Fans can enjoy a lot of chatter between the group on the two takes of ""One After 909"" in the March session. ""What are you doing?"" Lennon asks another when the first take falls apart. ""Are you out of your mind?"" The song was not released until the Beatles played it on a rooftop for the 1970 ""Let It Be"" album. The band seemed to struggle in that March session with ""Hold Me Tight,"" a song they later said they never cared for. The bootleg project gives you take 21. The last studio outtake on the album is ""Money (That's What I Want),"" recorded on July 18, 1963. Beatles on the BBC 1963 . The next 44 tracks are from the dozens of Beatles live appearances on BBC radio programs in 1963, including ""Saturday Club,"" ""Easy Beat,"" ""Here We Go,"" ""Side By Side,"" ""From Us To Us"" and the group's own weekly series, ""Pop Go The Beatles."" Several versions of their first big hit in England, ""Love Me Do,"" ""Taste of Honey"" and ""She Loves You"" are included. Some of the shows had live audiences, adding the flavor of screaming fans. The recording quality, none in stereo, varies from show to show, since the BBC was not trying to save the performances for later release. The tracks include the BBC hosts' introductions, which remind the listener of where the Beatles were in early 1963. ""For the moment the majority of the Beatles fans are in their hometown of Liverpool, and I have a very strong suspicion that it won't be long before they're all over the country,"" the announcer said as he introduced their performance of ""Love Me Do"" on the BBC's ""Easy Beat"" show on January 26, 1963.

"(CNN) -- Should blind people be granted gun permits? The question entered the crosshairs of some gun control advocates over the weekend, after a report about Iowa issuing permits to buy and carry firearms to people who are legally blind. That's legal under the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, which limits who can get guns nationwide. People who were convicted of crimes and served time for more than a year, people addicted to controlled substances and anyone who has been committed to a mental institution are among those who aren't allowed to possess firearms. Each state has different rules governing gun permits. In Iowa, at least, the visually impaired can get permits to carry firearms in public, The Des Moines Register reported on Sunday. That's for good reason, Jane Hudson, the executive director of Disability Rights Iowa, told the newspaper. She said blocking visually impaired people from getting weapons permits would violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. Some states, such as Nebraska and South Carolina, require applicants for gun permits to show ""proof of vision."" In Texas, lawmakers passed a measure in 2007 to help legally blind people hunt. The law allows legally blind hunters accompanied by a sighted partner to use laser sighting devices, according to the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action, which said the measure ""encouraged more disabled sportsmen to pursue their love of hunting."" After The Des Moines Register's story, word about Iowa's approach spread swiftly on social media Sunday. ""What could possibly go wrong?"" Jeff Smith, an assistant professor of politics and advocacy at The New School in New York, quipped in a Twitter post. ""At least on its face, it just seems totally absurd and absolutely in the other direction from the kind of common-sense gun safety restrictions that the president and others fought for earlier this year,"" he said. ""Just because we have a Second Amendment shouldn't mean that blind people can walk around with concealed weapons."" Earlier this year, blind entertainer Stevie Wonder weighed in on the matter. Wonder, who has called for stricter gun laws, told CNN's Piers Morgan that he had thought about going gun shopping with a friend to demonstrate how easy it was to get a weapon. ""Imagine me with a gun,"" he said. ""It's just crazy."" Last year, a blind New Jersey man fought for his right to own guns -- and won. The battle over Steven Hopler's gun collection lasted for years. Police seized six of his firearms in 2008 after he shot himself in the leg, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. Prosecutors argued he shouldn't have guns because he was a danger, the CNN affiliate reported. But last year, a judge ruled in Hopler's favor, citing the right to bear arms, WCBS said. His attorney argued that authorities had singled out his client. ""It's just simply that the police didn't want Steve Hopler to own firearms, because he's blind and they felt that that was improper,"" attorney Robert Trautman. After the judge's decision, Hopler told WCBS he was grateful to get his guns back. The victory, he said, wasn't about power. ""It's freedom,"" he said. CNN's Josh Levs and Lindsey Knight contributed to this report.","Iowa has granted gun permits to the visually impaired, a report says .

"(CNN) -- At least 10 people were injured Thursday when a private bus struck a concrete median on a highway in New Jersey, authorities said. The bus was still stuck on the center divider in Clifton hours after the 2:30 p.m. crash, snarling traffic, said Sgt. William Frank of the Clifton Police Department. There were 28 people -- including the driver -- on the DeCamp bus when a car in the center lane cut off the bus while trying to reach an exit, police said. The two vehicles collided and the bus slammed into the highway divider. Police said at least 10 passengers were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries. The driver of the car was uninjured. The accident comes one week after U.S. transportation officials shut down 52 bus companies in 22 states and the District of Columbia due to unsafe motor coach operations. Although there were a number of inspections of DeCamp Bus Lines, it has not been cited for safety violations, said Marissa Padilla, a spokeswoman for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In November, the National Transportation Safety Board expressed concerns with the thoroughness of investigations by the FMCSA, citing four deadly crashes involving operators who were already on the radar of the oversight agency. FMCSA officials said they re-examined the way they investigate passenger carriers to make their methods even more effective at preventing crashes. As a result of the investigation and inspections, 52 motor coach companies were put out of business and shut down for safety violations such as failure to maintain their buses adequately, inadequate drug and alcohol driver testing and overwork of drivers. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.","At least 10 people were injured in crash of a private bus in New Jersey .

"(CNN) -- As the story about the National Security Agency surveillance continued to unfold last week, some of President Obama's supporters, as well as some of his Republican critics, were quick to jump to his defense. Chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Mike Rogers warned that the allegations about the NSA were wrong. ""They are seeing three or four pieces of a thousand-piece puzzle and trying to come to a conclusion."" Speaking before a congressional committee, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said the monitoring of calls by 35 world leaders was just about spying, something that every country did and so there was nothing to be worked up about. ""Some of this reminds me of the classic movie 'Casablanca': 'My God, there's gambling going on here,'"" Clapper said. In a period of crippling partisan warfare that continually brings Washington to a standstill, the leadership of both parties seem to have easily reached bipartisan agreement that the existing national security programs should be left alone. But these arguments miss the importance of accountability in our national security operations. The notion that citizens should just trust the government to do the right thing on national security poses too many dangers. The United States has a long history of national security agencies, sometimes with presidential concurrence, misusing their authority and power to harass American citizens. This was the case in the 1960s, when Democrats and Republicans used government institutions to intimidate and harass social activists who were fighting for causes such as civil rights and to protest the war in Vietnam. With the approval of Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the FBI obsessively wiretapped the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., with the goal of finding evidence of the role of communism in the civil rights movement. What it found instead was information about his personal life as well as the background of top advisers that could be used against the movement if its demands caused too many problems. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover leaked information to the press and to King's opponents. A congressional report later found that the program sought to ""discredit Dr. King and to 'neutralize' him as the leader of the civil rights movement."" Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon agreed to have authorities bug and infiltrate anti-war activists. The administration spread damaging allegations and information to the media and to supporters of the war with the goal of rendering the activists illegitimate, and nurtured distrust and animosity within the movement so members would turn against each other. In 1975 and 1976, Idaho Sen. Frank Church conducted shocking hearings into the operations of the CIA and published a detailed report that revealed the agency had been secretly engaged in activities such as the attempted assassination of foreign leaders and illegal intelligence gathering of American citizens. Congress imposed new regulations and created a court to monitor their activities. In the end the regulations proved to be weak and since 9/11 they have essentially been rendered useless. After the reforms undertaken in light of the abuses of the 1960s and 1970s, intelligence agencies continued their expansion, part of the permanent national security apparatus the United States had established. ""The vast secrecy system shows no signs of receding,"" Sen. Patrick Moynihan wrote in the late 1990s. Then, after 9/11, the power of the government to conduct surveillance greatly expanded beyond anything the senator from New York could have anticipated. The United States is not alone in facing these risks. One of the reasons Germans have been so sensitive to the recent revelations is their own history of how surveillance has been used aggressively, and violently, to target their own citizens. Even if the NSA officials play by the rules and regulate themselves, their ability to contain information that could be enormously damaging to the United States and to individual citizens is greatly diminishing in the current era. They no longer are in full control, whatever their intentions might be. The stories about WikiLeaks as well as the impact of Edward Snowden have shown that the control of classified information is becoming extraordinarily difficult. It is foolhardy to assume that government officials will be able to contain all the data they gather and we must expect that more leaks will occur. When those leaks occur it is also remarkably easy for the information to quickly reach the public via the Internet. Given that the risks of leaks will continue to remain great, the most effective measures that Congress can take will be to work on regulatory checks at the point of gathering to make sure that national intelligence agents don't sweep up innocent civilians and important allied leaders in their sweeps. The worst outcome of the NSA revelations would be for Congress and the media to descend into a media-frenzy focusing primarily on the President's statements about what he knew. What would be much more useful to the nation would be for the executive and legislative branches to conduct a thorough review of how the NSA conducts its business and to put into place measures that will prevent unneeded activities that cause more harm than good, and which unnecessarily infringe the civil liberties of innocent people. In June, when the revelations first broke, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, ""Everyone should just calm down and understand this isn't anything that is brand new."" Whether or not this is brand new, the time has come for Congress to take a serious look at what the NSA is doing and how to impose needed regulations on what the agency can do. Representative James Sensenbrenner (R-Wisconsin) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) have started the debate with a bill with sweeping reforms, including a special court to monitor intelligence gathering. Reid and Speaker Boehner have offered cautious support for a review of the program. In the long run, such steps would have the potential to strengthen trust and confidence in the NSA, and allow it to do the work that is needed to secure the nation and our allies against the threats the United States continually faces. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Some officials dismiss the impact of NSA revelations, saying every country spies .

"London (CNN) -- A treasure trove of old photos has revealed how Queen Elizabeth once took to the stage -- sometimes dressed as a boy -- in a series of holiday pantomimes during World War II. The archives feature more than a dozen signed photographs of Princess Elizabeth and the late Princess Margaret, her younger sister, as the teenage stars in Christmas productions of the traditional plays at Windsor Castle in the 1940s. A pantomime -- or ""panto"" as it is also known -- is a mixture of slapstick and music performed across Britain during the holiday season. They are typically based on children's stories and usually feature male leads played by women (and vice versa), comedic twists and audience participation. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth -- the current queen's mother -- spent most of their time in London while their daughters remained in Windsor, just outside the capital. But at Christmas they would return to join a privileged audience at the luxury pantomimes their daughters starred in at the Royal School. In 1941 Elizabeth, then 15, played Prince Florizel, the male lead, in a pantomime of ""Cinderella"", while 11-year-old Margaret took the title role. The following year the future queen starred as Prince Salvador in ""Sleeping Beauty"" with Margaret as Fairy Thistledown. In 1943 Elizabeth won her first title role in ""Aladdin"" with Margaret as Princess Roxana. The next year the royal sisters starred as Lady Christina Sherwood and the Honorable Lucinda Fairfax, respectively, in ""Old Mother Red Riding Boots. "" The fascinating images are owned by the estates of Hubert Tannar, an amateur actor and headmaster of the school the princesses attended, and Cyril Woods, who shared the stage with the young Windsors and became a friend of the future queen during rehearsals. The archive of royal pantomime photos -- along with documents, Christmas cards and over twenty letters from the Queen to Tannar's widow -- are expected to fetch thousands of dollars at auction next week. ""This is the best royal archive I have ever handled,"" said Chris Albury, the senior valuer at Dominic Winter Auctioneers, based in Gloucestershire, England. ""The pantomime albums are highly atmospheric and you can see both princesses growing from childhood to adulthood, but the albums are further dramatically charged when you consider the wartime backdrop to these luxury pantomimes performed at Windsor Castle.""

"(CNN) -- Fifty-four years after the Duval County, Florida, school board ignored the wishes of students and named a Jacksonville high school for a controversial Confederate general, the school will be getting a new name. The school board voted 7-0 Monday to change the name of Nathan B. Forrest High School after the current school year ends. Officials will choose between the names Westside and Firestone in January. When it was opened in 1959, in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision that required racially integrated public schools, district officials chose to name the school after Forrest -- a former slave trader and Confederate commander whose troops were involved in the massacre of black Union soldiers at a Tennessee fort. He later served as the first ""Grand Wizard"" of the Ku Klux Klan. ""For too long and too many, this name has represented the opposite of unity, respect, and equality -- all that we expect in Duval schools,"" board member Constance Hall said in a statement from the district. The name-change was spearheaded by parent Ty Richmond, whose Change.org petition amassed 162,150 signatures. ""I'm very encouraged. Jacksonville is too much of a beautiful city to have that ugly blemish,"" Richmond told CNN affiliate WAWS. ""I don't want my daughter, or any student, going to a school named under those circumstances,"" he said in his petition. ""This is a bad look for Florida -- with so much racial division in our state, renaming Forrest High would be a step toward healing."" A kinder, gentler Ku Klux Klan? 'We don't hate anymore,' imperial wizard says . At the time it was named, the segregated school had an all-white student body. It is now 62% black, 23% white and 9% Hispanic, according to the district. Still, the decision to strip the name was not universally popular. More than half of the faculty opposed the change, as did 36% of students, the district said. A Missouri KKK leader also protested the change, saying those who want the name changed are ignoring ""the true historical facts surrounding this valiant man of honor."" Bedford fans have noted the commander's widespread reputation as a military genius, and have long said he was misunderstood. They say he disbanded the first version of the Ku Klux Klan after it grew violent and argue that he made efforts to reconcile with blacks in his later years. He is the subject of numerous monuments and other efforts to preserve his memory across the South. A monument honoring Forrest has been the subject of long-running controversy in Selma, Alabama, a focal point of the civil rights movement. The monument was located in a city building for a while but moved to a city-owned cemetery following protests. In 2012, someone stole Forrest's bust from atop the monument. Efforts to refurbish the monument have resulted in disputes. In 2011, a Mississippi proposal to create a license plate honoring Forrest brought opposition by civil rights groups and never saw the light of day.

"(CNN) -- As this election season unfolds, we are watching an age-old dream in politics go horribly smash. It isn't good for politics, and it sure isn't good for the country. President Franklin Roosevelt helped to fire up the dream during his second term in office. Coming off a massive landslide in 1936, he believed that it would be far better for governing if the Democrats became the liberal party and Republicans the conservative one. In the 1938 congressional elections, he barnstormed across the South trying to purge the Democratic Party of several incumbent conservatives. His efforts backfired -- the incumbents won and were sore at FDR -- but the dream became a staple of politics. In 1950, for example, in one of the landmark studies in political science -- one still read today by undergraduate majors -- some of the best minds of the day argued strongly that the nation would benefit from more ideologically ""coherent"" parties: that things would be better if Democrats stood firmly for a liberal ideology and Republicans for a conservative one. That way, people would have clear choices, they would know what they were voting for, and they could count on their party delivering if it were in power. ""Shoo out those racially suspect Sunbelt conservatives from Democratic ranks and those lily-livered Northeastern liberals from the GOP. And maybe some of those moderates, too."" So the thinking went. Well, in recent years, we have seen the dream come true. And guess what? It is producing a mess. As each of the parties has moved toward ideological purity, our politics have become ever more polarized, our governing ever more paralyzed. Extremists increasingly run the show. This campaign season is pointing toward a rough road ahead after the November elections. Yes, it is true that in selecting a presidential candidate, both parties have chosen men who on the surface seem moderate centrists. But each of the candidates has decided that in order to win, he must first stir up his ideological base. Would Mitt Romney have endorsed the Paul Ryan budget, a hard line against immigration and a condemnation of Planned Parenthood if he were not trying to prove that he's a ""severe conservative""? Meanwhile, Barack Obama has moved left, pushing taxes on the rich, piling up trillion-dollar deficits and bashing the same Republicans he would have to work with in a second term. One can see these trends in harsher relief amid campaigns for the Senate and House. Olympia Snowe, a moderate and much-beloved GOP senator from Maine facing her first primary challenge, is retiring because of a lack of bipartisanship and mechanisms to find ""common ground."" Sens. Richard Lugar and Orrin Hatch -- both stalwarts of the GOP who have committed apostasy by trying to work across party lines -- face primaries this season that imperil their survival: A poll Thursday morning found Lugar down 5 points to a tea party-backed challenger in Indiana, and Hatch failed to secure a 60% supermajority at his party's convention in Utah, sending his race to a primary. Only two years ago in Utah, another stalwart Republican who had worked with Democrats, Bob Bennett, was deposed by an ideologically purer primary challenger. In the House, meanwhile, the once-robust cadre of ""Blue Dog Democrats"" -- moderate to conservative members of the liberal party -- has been winnowed out, with two more members (Reps. Jason Altmire and Tim Holden of Pennsylvania) defeated in primaries this past Tuesday by opponents from their left flanks. As of 2010, there were as many as 54 Blue Dogs, but the midterms knocked their caucus down to 26. With retirements and primaries, that number will probably be well below 20 by next January -- an effect that further turns Democrats into the party of the left. Some activists -- conservative Grover Norquist among them -- argue that over time, this purification will be good for the U.S. But so far, the task of governing has gotten much tougher, and what little trust is left among the parties is evaporating. As the parties become more ideological, it's easier to demonize the other side and harder to rationalize working with it -- both to your colleagues and your constituents. Woe to be you in your next primary if you have consorted with the enemy. Under heavy pressures for party conformity, legislation by nature becomes a more partisan undertaking. Hard to believe it now, but big programs like Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s, or tax and Social Security reform in the 1980s, passed with broad bipartisan support. Our latest legislative achievements, on the other hand (think health care, the stimulus or Wall Street reform), have been almost entirely driven by one party. More often than not, gridlock and obstruction soon follow. As scholar Bill Galston has wisely noted, it becomes ""a zero-sum mentality: if they win, we lose."" As Galston and others have theorized, all this sniping saps the public's trust in the government, but it does something equally insidious, too: It saps trust between the parties, completing the vicious cycle and making compromise even tougher. So it's crucial to bolster the men and women of courage in politics: the ones who can act as ambassadors between these increasingly dug-in parties and who can kindle that small flame of trust that has almost gone out. Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tennessee) and Mark Warner (D-Virginia) and a handful of others, for example, have launched laudable work on this count in the Senate, pulling together small, quiet dinners with legislators from both sides of the aisle who are strong in principles but equally strong in their commitment to moving the ball forward for the country. Getting by on the little victories can help restore health to the process, too. The Congress coming together on patent reform at the end of 2011, the JOBS Act in early April and (potentially) on extending low interest rates on student loans in coming days may seem like small potatoes, but these compromises can be confidence builders. Like water over a stone, they can slowly but steadily wear away some of the mistrust and acrimony. Franklin Roosevelt was right on many big things, but on this one, he was dead wrong. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","From FDR in the 1930s on, some have argued that parties should be polarized .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- The Cuban government has agreed to allow all private businesses to hire employees,­ something previously restricted to a limited number of occupations, state media said Tuesday. A meeting of the Council of Ministers also approved a proposal to delay massive layoffs, Granma newspaper reported, without providing any details. Last year, President Raul Castro announced the biggest shakeup to the Soviet-style economic model in decades. He said more than a million state jobs needed to be eliminated. At the same time, he said more private enterprise would be allowed to help soak up some of the unemployed and provide new sources of income, via taxes, for depleted state coffers. The government published a list of 178 private occupations that Cubans could hold, from running a private restaurant to working as a plumber to being a party clown. Of those, 83 of them could hire employees. Now, the Council of Ministers has granted all small businesses the authority to hire employees and agreed to further loosen regulations on the self-employed, according to Granma. The newspaper said it would provide details at a later date. More than 200,000 Cubans have bought licenses to open small businesses since October. The plan for government layoffs was harshly criticized by Cubans worried that for the first time in 50 years they will no longer be guaranteed a job, no matter how small the salary. Castro originally had said that half of the layoffs from state jobs would come by March of this year. He later announced that the layoffs would be delayed, without giving a new timetable.","All private businesses are allowed to hire employees, the Council of Ministers says .

"London, England (CNN) -- Birdies are normally seen as a golfer's best friend but at one course in Northern Ireland members are getting increasingly irritated by a certain feathered felon. For the last few months, a large raven has been stalking Greencastle Golf Club in Donegal before swooping and flying off with people's balls. Several players have witnessed the burglar at work while others have struck what they thought was an accurate shot only to arrive on the green to find no sign of their ball. Billy McCaul, the golf club's office manager, says players are reporting stolen balls on a weekly basis. ""It started to happen about four months ago, when you had the odd comment about a ball being taken by a bird,"" McCaul told CNN. ""Because we are a seaside course, birds have picked balls up in the air so we took it to be something like that, but then it became consistent and persistent. ""At first I took it as a bit of fun, as did most members, but it has got to the extent where it is having an effect on prizes and competitions and various other things."" One member, a former ladies' captain, had two balls taken by the pesky bird in the same round, costing her a prize in the ladies' match play competition. ""The second time it happened she was walking to the ball with her partners, and the bird came down 15 meters away, looked at them, picked the ball up and flew away,"" says McCaul. ""It's a very brazen bird, it doesn't know any fear. It sees a ball, takes it and away it goes and we have absolutely no idea why it's continuing to do it."" Ravens have a wingspan of some 4 ft (1.2m) and have a reputation for picking up shiny objects like pebbles and coins. Some members think the bird is mistaking their balls for eggs. They claim to have beaten the thief by using yellow golf balls because the raven is only interested in snatching white ones. At least six ravens are housed at the Tower of London at the British Government's expense because of the traditional belief that if they are absent the tower will crumble and the Kingdom of England will fall. The birds are a protected species and officials at Greencastle have been warned off trying to catch their raven. ""I think it's here to stay,"" says McCaul. ""Most people are just taking it as a bit of a hazard down here. You have bunkers and you have rough and now Greencastle have got the extra hazard of a bird."" Ravens are not the only animals to have made enemies of golfers. Last year in Denver, Colorado-based TV station 9News carried a story of a man who had crafted a putting green in his garden only to wake up each morning to find a fox had stolen his golf balls. Tom Houk eventually managed to catch the thief at work, but not before it had taken more than 100 of his balls. At the Players Championship at Sawgrass in 1998, a seagull swooped down and snatched U.S. competitor Steve Lowery's ball off the green at the famous par-three island hole before dropping it into the water. On the European Tour in December, players mingled with crocodiles at the Leopard Creek Golf Club in Mpumalanga, South Africa, for the Alfred Dunhill Championship. At the only golf course on the island of Tonga there's a local rule which states that there's no penalty if a monkey steals your golf ball. And in Uganda, golfers at the Jinga Golf Club are permitted a free drop if their ball lands in the footprints of a hippo.","A large raven is stealing golf balls from the course at a club in Northern Ireland .

"(CNN) -- After a rocket landed late Saturday in its territory, Israel retaliated by going after ""two terror activity sites in the southern and in the central Gaza Strip,"" its military said. Israel Defense Forces said on its blog that the rocket fired out of Gaza landed in Sdot Negev Regional Council around 11 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), spurring sirens to go off there. The military subsequently tweeted that there were ""no injuries."" An IDF spokesman told CNN that the rocket caused no notable destruction, having landed in an open area. That led to Israel's retaliatory strike against targets that IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said are ""part of the terrorist support network, enhancing terror capabilities against Israel and it civilians."" ""As long as Hamas enables its henchmen to attack Israel, these sites will not be immune from our watchful eye and operational strike, while they are used to formulate, train and develop malicious terrorist intentions,"" Lerner said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- King Abdullah II dismissed Jordan's cabinet and prime minister on Monday, appointing a leading jurist to take over the government and undertake reforms leading to new election laws and government accountability, according to a statement from the Department of Information and Communication. Awn Khasawneh replaces Marouf Al Bakhit, whom Abdullah appointed as prime minister in February in a similar cabinet shakeout amid protests calling for reform in the Middle Eastern kingdom. At the time, the Royal Court said in a statement that Al Bakhit was to implement ""genuine political reform."" The statement issued Monday in Amman said the king told Khasawneh to form a new government with an eye to a national dialogue on electoral and political party law, the creation of an independent body to oversee elections and a comprehensive review of municipal elections. Khasawneh is also tasked with addressing government transparency and accountability, as well as ""freedom of the media without violation of national unity."" The king also named Faisal Al Shoubaki as the new head of the intelligence, according to a palace offical who was not authorized to speak to the media. He is currently Jordan's ambassador to Morocco. Khasawneh is a Jordanian jurist and former adviser to the country's late King Hussein. He has been a member of the International Court of Justice since 2000, according to his biography on the court's website. He has also served with the Foreign Affairs Ministry.","NEW: Jordan's king calls for new government, reforms .

"(CNN) -- A group of tech-savvy entrepreneurs are setting out to rock Nigeria's vibrant music scene by cashing in on the country's booming mobile phone market. Founded by three university friends, MyMusic.com.ng is an ambitious startup aiming to be the major online distribution channel for Nigerian music. The new digital service is focused on providing an easy and affordable way for music fans to access their favorite songs, which are often hard to find in one place. ""We have no single source of aggregated Nigerian music of African origin,"" says Tola Ogunsola, chief executive and co-founder of MyMusic. ""So Africa is missing on the world map in terms of musical content -- so the potential is huge."" Read this: 'Dropifi' startup takes on Silicon Valley . MyMusic is designed to work similarly to other digital music stores, such as iTunes. But its payment options are largely catered to deal with the characteristics of the Nigerian market, which is mainly a cash only society. Mobile phone users can select the song they want to download and pay instantly for it using their credit. Songs cost 50 naira, or about 31 U.S. cents. ""When users click the pay by mobile button, the download is automatically initiated on their mobile phones and the fee is deducted from their mobile credit,"" explains co-founder Damola Taiwo, who is also the startup's chief operating officer. Mobile boom . Nigeria, Africa's second biggest economy, is one of the biggest and fastest growing mobile markets in the continent, with more than 100 million active subscribers. It's this market that the young entrepreneurs behind MyMusic hope to tap, filling a musical void for the country's cell phone users. Read this: Africa's mobile tech startups . ""Mobile holds the biggest potential for us,"" says Taiwo, adding that more than 40 million phones in Nigeria are connected to the web. ""The majority of these users have their mobile phones as their only connection to the internet and any form of technology."" Computer users can also download songs via the pay by mobile method -- entering their phone number on MyMusic's website -- on top of the standard credit card and PayPal payment methods. From door to door . The startup's three founders, who've all studied computer science, say they have so far invested $45,000 of their own money into the business. They recently launched a test version of the platform at one of Europe's biggest tech conferences -- the Web Summit in Dublin, Ireland. The Lagos-based team is now planning a full scale release of the service in February 2014, targeting an initial offering of 5,000 songs. ""The goal now is to have a wide variety,"" says Taiwo. ""So from the up-and-coming artists to music of like 20 years ago or 30 years ago,"" he adds. Read also: 10 African tech startups you need to know . But to achieve that, and make the service successful, the young entrepreneurs have to put in a lot of leg work. ""What happens with most of these international sites is that they have a structured system where they can just go meet a record label and automatically get about maybe 100,000 songs, or as much as possible -- but in Nigeria, the structure is still growing,"" says Taiwo. Fellow co-founder Dolapo Taiwo explains that because most musicians in the country have their own record labels, the team has to approach each artist separately. ""Having to run after record labels one by one is a very big pain but I think it's a pain that we're happy to bear for now,"" he says. Turning problems into opportunities . Yet, going from door to door is not the only challenge faced by the developers of MyMusic. Finding outside funding in Nigeria has been difficult for the company, so the team is currently exploring international sources of investment to fund their marketing plan. Similarly, poor infrastructure and connectivity issues have both added to the challenge but failed to stop the entrepreneurs' efforts. ""Every problem is a potential opportunity,"" says Dolapo Taiwo. For example, he notes, Nigeria's bandwidth issues have prompted them to build ""very lean sites"" that offer users a trouble-free experience. ""Within two clicks you can download a song, so we're trying to overcome that challenge,"" he says. Looking ahead, the team has high hopes for the company's success and growth. ""We're looking to having a pan-African approach to this as time goes by because what we're actually solving is an African problem,"" says Dolapo Taiwo. ""A lot of Africans do not have access to formal banking methods -- we don't have a lot of credit cards in Africa so we're looking to deploy it across Africa."" ""It's a big vision for us and we're going to push it through,"" adds Damola Taiwo.","MyMusic.com.ng is a new digital store where Nigerians can access local music .
Customers can pay for songs using their mobile phone credit .
The new platform is scheduled for full-scale release in February 2014 .

"(CNN) -- If 2013 was an ""annus horribilis"" for McLaren, then next year provides a double chance of redemption for the motorsport giant -- and Russia will play a key role. By the time Sochi hosts the country's first Formula One race next October, McLaren bosses will know if the team has been able to bounce back from one of its worst seasons in more than two decades, with major technological changes required due to the sport's new engine rules for 2014. But well before then, the British manufacturer's innovations will have been put to the test at the same seaside resort, as Russia hosts its first Winter Olympics. McLaren is working with the UK team -- specifically skeleton and bobsleigh -- via its applied technologies operation MAT in a bid to help improve GB's medal chances in February. ""It's similar work to what we did with the Summer Olympics, concentrating on sports with a greater chance of medals,"" says MAT project manager Caroline Hargrove, who used to work for the McLaren F1 team and created the race simulator which drivers such as Jenson Button use away from grand prix weekends. For a team so synonymous with success -- 182 grand prix victories, eight constructors' titles and 12 drivers' championships -- this year has been an undoubtedly unwanted blot on McLaren's copybook. Button and Sergio Perez -- who has since been replaced by rookie Kevin Magnussen -- were ninth and 11th respectively in the drivers' standings, with the team a lowly fifth in the constructors' table, more than 450 points behind dominant Red Bull. But McLaren has previous success at the Olympics, with Team GB winning 30 of its 65 medals at London 2012 in sports with which MAT was involved: canoeing, cycling, rowing and sailing. Half of those were gold. It is a model that clearly works -- MAT also worked with skeleton racer Amy Williams to a lesser degree on her path to Olympic skeleton success at the last Winter Games in Vancouver -- and there is a sense of excitement of another medal haul at Sochi. Brought in by the government-funded agency UK Sport, MAT will focus on the downhill sledding disciplines. ""What we've done for the other sports, it's more generic in that we've done a little bit and still do a few programs with UK Sport, and we ran workshops recently with all the coaches for inspiration looking at other sports,"" Hargrove told CNN. ""In our case, we showed the side of Formula One, and the equipment and technical side of it."" The work done by MAT varies from use of its dynamic chassis rig -- also known as the shaker rig -- which is used on the development of F1 cars and now skeletons and bobsleds to run the rule over their respective suspensions. Its technology is used to make both the equipment and the kit worn by British athletes, but also in data analysis and how the human body reacts to the skeleton and bobs in question. However, in order to keep an edge on rival teams, the specifics are kept closely guarded. There are also strict rules which restrain MAT's area of operations. ""We don't have enormous margins for imagination,"" Hargrove says. ""They prescribe the type of steel and where rubber can be used -- and that's hardly anywhere. But like in F1, we are able to use attention to detail to make things as near to perfect and that we assemble things as well as we can."" The bobsleighs are being tested in France to measure the gains that have been made. ""We can see a tangible time difference that we have made with the bobsleigh,"" Hargroves adds. ""Our measurements are by the millisecond."" The Olympic projects are relatively small scale compared to MAT's other business strands, which span from pharmaceutical trials to working with the behemoths of oil and gas. A solitary MAT engineer is working fulltime on each of the skeleton and bobsleigh projects, even testing the equipment themselves on the ice at high speed -- true workplace immersion. At Sochi, MAT will be in direct competition with McLaren's traditional F1 foe Ferrari, which has been working with the Italian Olympic team -- in particular with the bobsleigh. ""There's definitely a little bit of rivalry with Ferrari in this,"" says Hargrove. ""You always want competition, it helps to push you on."" For Hargrove, who was brought up in Montreal, Canada, with a love of winter sports, this project is a perfect fit. And she sees the love of sport as being a key ingredient to her team's success. ""When I interview people for jobs, one of my questions is are they sports fans,"" she says. ""Sports fans tend to be inherently competitive and that is good for this working environment. It also means if and when you employ them you can bear them in mind for future sporting projects."" For all MAT's collective brainpower and tech nous, however, she acknowledges that there is only so much they can do for the competitors. ""It's all about the athletes,"" she points out. ""If an athlete gets injured, there is nothing the kit will do without the athlete. But we hope to support what we believe is very real potential for medals. ""It's great working with people that are so driven, especially the coaches who don't see much of the limelight."" UK Sport covers MAT's expenses and time costs -- though otherwise the work is done on a non-profit basis -- and has given open access to its data. However, not all the athletes are 100% compliant. Kristan Bromley, who runs his own skeleton-making business, is understandably loathe to share details of his intellectual property so he and his partner Shelley Rudman will be without MAT's backing in terms of their equipment. ""That said, Kristan has still worked with us on other aspects,"" adds Hargrove. In addition, there have been skeptics of what is, on the surface, an alternative approach to the Winter Olympics, and Hargrove relishes that. ""The thing is that we don't have all the solutions,"" she says. ""But by doing this it generally brings in more lateral thinking to the discussions."" Research from Infostrada has suggested that Great Britain is set for its most successful Winter Olympics, with a predicted five medals. Should that be the case, that will be in now small part down to MAT, and the world of F1.","McLaren Applied Technologies working with GB team in quest for Sochi medals .

"(CNN) -- Senators voted late Thursday to approve a defense bill and end an ugly standoff over presidential nominations, averting a third overnight session in two weeks. The Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act 84 to 15. It then voted 55 to 45 to break a filibuster on the nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas to be the deputy secretary of Homeland Security. On Friday morning, senators will begin a series of votes on the nominations of Mayorkas; John Koskinen to be commissioner of the IRS; and Brian Davis to be a federal district judge for Florida. The confirmation vote on Janet Yellen to be chairwoman of the Federal Reserve has been pushed to January 6. Progress has been difficult because the parties have been feuding over a new rule the majority Democrats forced through limiting filibusters over the objections of minority Republicans. Before the agreement on the voting schedule, Republicans had insisted on all time allowed for floor debate, even if no one was talking. Such a process would have kept senators working all night and through most of Saturday, cutting their holiday break short.

"(CNN) -- West Virginia has demanded a full list of any other chemicals that might have leaked from a Charleston-area storage plant after its owners revealed another compound had spilled into the Elk River. The state Department of Environmental Protection gave Freedom Industries until Wednesday afternoon to disclose ""any and all information"" related to the January 9 spill. The move came a day after the company told regulators that in addition to the methanol compound that escaped from a ruptured tank, a second chemical -- a mix of polyglycol ethers, known as PPH -- was part of the leak. PPH is not believed to pose any new health hazard for the people of Charleston, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. But the state environmental agency said failing to accurately report the makeup of the leak is a violation of state law. ""These materials were not included in the initial information regarding the composition of the spilled materials,"" the agency stated in a Wednesday order to Freedom. In a statement issued along with the order, DEP chief Randy Huffman called the late disclosure ""completely unacceptable."" More than 7,000 gallons of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM, leaked into Charleston's water supply after it leaked out of a Freedom Industries storage tank. The result was a do-not-use order that left about 300,000 people in the area unable to drink or bathe in their water, some for more than a week. The CDC said little is known about the health hazards of PPH, but it appears to be less toxic than MCHM and made up about 5% of the total volume of the leaking tank. ""Given the small percentage of PPH in the tank and information suggesting similar water solubility as MCHM, it is likely that any amount of PPH currently in the water system would be extremely low,"" it said. ""However, the water system has not been tested for this material."" Faced with numerous lawsuits as a result of the spill, Freedom Industries filed for bankruptcy protection last week. The company had no immediate response to Wednesday's demand from state officials, who have pledged to step up their oversight of the industry.","The second chemical isn't believed to pose new health risks, the CDC says .

"Arlington, Virginia (CNN) -- A volunteer army gathered Monday at Arlington National Cemetery to devote its best efforts toward preserving the final resting place of those who devoted their lives to their country. The Professional Landcare Network (PLANET) hosted its 16th annual Renewal & Remembrance beautification project at the sprawling cemetery. Scores of lawn and landscape professionals, joined by hundreds of volunteers including children as young as 3, spent the day working on the preservation of land surrounding thousands of grave sites. ""The opportunity to be able to come out, to give back, to preserve something, that really means a lot, not only (to me) as a veteran, but it means a lot to these volunteers,"" said veteran Tim Price, who fought in Iraq. Shelby Wanzor, a soon-to-be fifth-grader from Atlanta, was among the young volunteers and she, by virtue of an essay she wrote, got the honor of laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. ""My Grandfather, Aubrey Wanzor, was a crew chief for B-17s and B-25s in World War II. My Uncle John was trained as a medical doctor and a Captain in the Army. I also have a lot of other relatives who fought in the wars,"" noted Shelby in her essay, which was among the winning writings in PLANET's second annual Renewal & Remembrance essay contest. Shelby's mother, Elizabeth Wanzor, said volunteer work at Arlington National Cemetery gives children ""a chance to see history and a chance to see people who died for our freedom ... The kids are the future of our country, and it's important for them to see what's going on."" Young volunteers were tasked Monday with planting milkweed because, as Shelby Wanzor noted, ""It attracts monarch butterflies."" The professionals among the volunteers spread fertilizer and lime over Arlington National's acres of turf and worked with the cemetery's thousands of trees and plants. ""In addition to the fertilization, and the spreading of lime, we do tree work here, to protect the trees from lightening by cabling them, making them stronger and resisting wind and other storm factors.

""There are probably 20 to 30 funerals a day that take place here, and we have to stop and recognize them as they pass by,"" said Goldenberg.

"Washington (CNN) -- So there's this guy, Barry, who seems pretty liberal. Used to smoke pot and doesn't think it's as dangerous as alcohol. Says he wouldn't let a son play pro football. Some call him one of those late Baby Boomers who believe they can save the world. Maybe he used to be, but the last year has been pretty tough and he's sounding a bit more grounded these days when you actually sit down and talk to him. Barry could be any number of Americans -- an educated, white-collar guy having his idealistic vision blunted by midlife realities such as raising two daughters. In this case, he's the President of the United States on the fifth anniversary of his inauguration as the nation's first African-American commander in chief. An expansive profile by The New Yorker magazine shows Barack Obama as both impatient with and accepting of the political, social and personal limitations on his ability to achieve the bold hopes and dreams described in his now famous 2004 Democratic National Convention speech that elevated him to the national stage. ""I believe that we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity,"" he said that night in Boston. ""I believe we can provide jobs for the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that we have a righteous wind at our backs, and that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices and meet the challenges that face us."" A decade later, now-President Obama bears the political scars and graying hair of five years in the White House, and David Remnick's profile reveals the burden he carries. Obama would not let his son play football . ""Every morning and every night, I'm taking measure of my actions against the options and possibilities available to me, understanding that there are going to be mistakes that I make and my team makes and that America makes; understanding that there are going to be limits to the good we can do and the bad that we can prevent, and that there's going to be tragedy out there and, by occupying this office, I am part of that tragedy occasionally,"" Obama says in the profile. He continues the thought by adding ""that if I am doing my very best and basing my decisions on the core values and ideals that I was brought up with and that I think are pretty consistent with those of most Americans, that at the end of the day things will be better rather than worse."" The profile, which included one-on-one interviews, made news on some issues. Obama revealed a middle-ground stance on pot, saying he warns his daughters against smoking it as he did, but also complaining that too many young people face lengthy prison terms for something he says is less dangerous to the user than alcohol. He has no son, but if he did, he would stop the boy from becoming a pro football player because of the chronic debilitating injuries, says the Chicago Bears fan. On political and policy issues, Obama acknowledges he completed his evolution from noncommittal to fully supportive of gay marriage before making his stance public in 2012, a few months before his re-election for a second term. It was ""fair to say that I may have come to that realization slightly before I actually made the announcement,"" Obama admits in the profile. ""But this was not a situation where I kind of did a wink and a nod and a 180-degree turn."" Regarding the trifecta of international negotiations involving thorny Middle East issues -- Syria, Iran's nuclear ambitions and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict -- Obama concedes the chances for completing final treaties in any of them are less than 50%. Obama says marijuana 'no more dangerous than alcohol' ""In all three circumstances we may be able to push the boulder partway up the hill and maybe stabilize it so it doesn't roll back on us,"" he says in the profile. ""And all three are connected. I do believe that the region is going through rapid change and inexorable change. Some of it is demographics; some of it is technology; some of it is economics. And the old order, the old equilibrium, is no longer tenable. The question then becomes, 'what's next?' "" The theme of historical context and taking the long view runs through many of Obama's remarks in the profile. While he spent the 2012 election campaign touting his accomplishments -- recovery from the recession, health care reform, ending the Iraq war and winding down combat operations in Afghanistan -- Obama sounds more reflective now after a first year in his second term mired in political stalemate with recalcitrant Republicans over immigration reform, gun control and the endless battles over spending and taxes. Referring to the famous line from the film version of Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather,"" Obama says that ""it turns out Marlon Brando had it easy, because, when it comes to Congress, there is no such thing as an offer they can't refuse."" While he ascribes some of the relentless political opposition he faces to race, he also points out that he gets some benefit as the first African-American President. ""There's no doubt that there's some folks who just really dislike me because they don't like the idea of a black President,"" Obama says. ""Now, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I'm a black President."" He evokes the name and legacy of Abraham Lincoln in providing his own long view of both the role of a president and his own efforts in the Oval Office. ""Despite being the greatest president, in my mind, in our history,"" he says of Lincoln, ""it took another 150 years before African-Americans had anything approaching formal equality, much less real equality."" To Obama, ""that doesn't diminish Lincoln's achievements, but it acknowledges that at the end of the day we're part of a long-running story,"" he says, adding: ""We just try to get our paragraph right.""","In a major magazine profile, President Obama emphasizes historical context .

"(CNN) -- There are books -- and then there are books. And this one doesn't come cheap. So if you love Formula One and want to spend a year following the likes of Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso across the world, this is the only book for you -- if you have a spare million dollars. Weighing 37 kilograms, this 852-page book will come with the opportunity for its owner to hold four passes to every single day of each grand prix weekend during the 2014 season, access into the team paddocks and even tea with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone. Up for auction in December, with three bids already secured, ""The Official Formula One Opus BERNIE Edition"" also comes with a signature sheet adorned with the original autographs of the 22 F1 world champions. ""This book gives you the opportunity to experience F1 like never before,"" Opus Media chief executive officer Karl Fowler told CNN. ""You can go to every single race across the world, take in all three days, go into the paddocks, have a drink and see the drivers. ""You'll get to spend time with Mr Ecclestone and have a sporting experience you couldn't get anywhere else."" A former banker, Fowler set up Opus Media in 2007 and has since crafted a number of other books which have focused on the likes of Ferrari, Michael Jackson, NFL Superbowl and Manchester United. But the Bernie -- arriving in its carbon-fiber case, gleaming like a piece of treasure waiting to be plundered -- takes the concept to an altogether new level. ""We've already had three serious bids for the book,"" Fowler revealed. ""We always thought that the bids would come from two areas -- wealthy individuals who are looking to have some fun and great experiences or from corporate businesses. ""We've had one bid from a banking entity, one from a hedge fund and another from a Russian investment company. ""For a business, this is a great investment, especially if you have offices all over the world. You could take three different clients each day for three days on each weekend and you can do that 20 times a year. ""That's great for networking and business. It's a huge opportunity."" Whoever finally ends up winning the auction will also be able to sell individual races with Fowler estimating that the lure of the Monaco Grand Prix could go for as much as $100,000. The book has been nearly six years in the making with Fowler working with Ecclestone to produce arguably the most definitive look at F1. Beginning at the start of the F1 World Driver's Championship in 1950, the book charts the course of the sport, taking in those who are synonymous with the roaring engines of the sport. It takes in each and every circuit in detail, gives an insight into the colorful characters who entertained fans such as James Hunt and Juan Manuel Fangio before moving on to Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher and current four-time world champion Vettel. Chasing the 22 different signatures of F1 champions didn't prove easy. Fowler had two men flying across the world for two years to collect every autograph. They flew to Brazil to obtain Nelson Piquet's signature, secured Jack Brabham's in Australia and managed to catch Kimi Raikkonen in Finland. As well as the one-off edition, there are also 1500 copies of the silk-covered $3,200 ""classic"" which will be signed by Ecclestone, with the $32,000 ""champions"" edition accompanied by autographs of every single F1 world champion. Perhaps Ecclestone's involvement in the book has proved a welcome distraction from his ongoing legal problems. He has denied making corrupt payments to a German banker to facilitate the sale F1, testifying for four days in London's High Court before heading to this weekend's U.S. Grand Prix in Texas. ""Working with Mr Ecclestone is a combination of him being highly demanding, fun and challenging,"" added Fowler. ""You have to be on the ball because he always is. His attention to detail is phenomenal. ""He really bought into what we were trying to do which was present the sport on scale where all the iconic images are seen how they were meant to be seen. ""In 99.9% of the books, pictures have been heavily cropped. We want to show them in the way the photographer wanted them to be shown.""","""The Official Formula One Opus BERNIE Edition"" has $1 million reserve price .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian National Coalition voted Saturday to attend next week's peace talks in Geneva. The secret balloting among 75 representatives of Syria's main opposition group, which have been meeting this week in a luxury hotel on the outskirts of Istanbul, resulted in 58 votes in favor and 14 opposed, with two abstentions and one person who handed in an unmarked ballot, the coalition's media office told CNN. But the tally masked deep divisions within the opposition: another 44 members of the group refused to vote at all. And some of those doing the fighting in Syria have said that participation in the talks would be an act of treachery. Nonetheless, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry applauded what he called ""a courageous vote in the interests of all the Syrian people who have suffered so horribly under the brutality of the (President Bashar al-) Assad regime and a civil war without end. The top U.S. diplomat promised that he'd engage ""directly with the Syrian opposition and the international community"" when the conference starts next Wednesday. ""By voting to go to Geneva 2 with a mission to negotiate an end to the war, the opposition has chosen a path that will ultimately lead to a better future for all Syrians,"" Kerry said in a statement Saturday. The goal of the talks -- dubbed Geneva 2 in recognition of a similar effort in the Swiss city in 2012 -- is to set up a transitional government that would end the violence that has wracked the country since March 2011, killing more than 100,000 people. Kerry explained late last week that the meeting's goal is to implement the communique that was the fruit of the first such meeting. ""It is about establishing a process essential to the formation of a transition government body -- governing body -- with full executive powers established by mutual consent,"" he told reporters. Any names put forward for leadership of Syria's transition must, according to the terms of Geneva 1, be agreed to by the opposition and the regime led by President Bashar al-Assad, according to Kerry. ""That is the very definition of mutual consent,"" he continued. ""This means that any figure that is deemed unacceptable by either side, whether President or a member of the opposition, cannot be a part of the future."" In addition, he said, it ""defies logic that those whose brutality created"" the current situation could lead Syria toward a better future. The peace conference would not be the end, but the beginning of a process, he said. Al-Assad has said he does not look at the talks as a way for him to transition out of power. On Friday, his foreign minister announced that he'd given his Russian counterpart a proposal ""to determine the time and date where there will be an end to the military operations"" in Aleppo and urged him to help broker its passage. ""We will wait for Minister (Sergey) Lavrov to tell us the time and the date, the hour, and we will commit ourselves to these arrangements -- if he has enough guarantees that the other side will accept and commit themselves as well,"" Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said. If that succeeds, he said, Damascus is prepared to extend the plan to other areas of the country. Meanwhile, state-run Syrian media reported Saturday that the first shipment of aid has reached the Yarmouk Palestinian Refugee Camp outside Damascus, where dozens of people have died of starvation and lack of medical attention since the camp was cut off by warring factions last November.

Last week it was confirmed Vonn, the reigning Olympic and World Cup downhill champion, would miss the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi after failing to make a full recovery from a knee injury first sustained in February 2013. She re-injured the same knee in Val d'Isere, France in December. Vonn underwent surgery on ligaments in her right knee on Wednesday, with doctors confident that she will be fit to compete in Vail, Colorado. ""Lindsey Vonn underwent successful ACL reconstruction surgery yesterday,"" read a statement from Vonn's publicist. ""Dr. Jim Andrews performed the procedure and expects her to make a full recovery in time for next year's World Championships in Vail, Colorado.""

"(CNN) -- Another freezing wallop, thousands more flights canceled; travelers in the U.S. are scrambling again. More than 1,400 U.S. flights were canceled Wednesday, following 3,000 Tuesday cancellations. Here are some tips to ease your trip, but above all else, patience -- and caution -- will be key. Rebook your flight for free. Airlines have rolled out their customary winter weather waivers, so most passengers traveling to, from or through affected areas can make one itinerary change without paying a change fee. Delta, American, US Airways, United, Southwest/AirTran and JetBlue have all posted weather policies on their websites. Act quickly. Rebook your itinerary as soon as possible. Other passengers are snapping up open seats as you mull over a new itinerary. Be sure that your airline has your e-mail address and phone number, advises Rick Seaney, CEO of airfare tracker FareCompare.com. If you didn't provide this information when you purchased the ticket, go online and add it. Follow your airline and airport on social media. Many airlines and airports post the speediest updates to their Twitter feeds, so start following them now. Sign up for airline alerts to get flight updates e-mailed to your smartphone. If you're stranded, multitask. Get online, get on the phone and get in the ticketing line (if you're already at the airport). With thousands of flights delayed or canceled, competition will be fierce for seats when operations start humming again. Get airline apps for your phone and try to contact your airline on Twitter, Seaney suggests. Elite fliers should use their loyalty program hotlines and head to frequent flier lounges for better access to airline reps. ""This might be the time to spring for a lounge day-pass just to gain access to these folks,"" Seaney said. Use the NextFlight app and type in your city pair to get the next flights for the major airlines, suggests Benet J. Wilson, Aviation Queen travel blogger. Then, call the airline on your cell phone and give them your preferred options. Charge your devices. Hopefully, you're not among those travelers stranded at the airport, where jockeying for electrical outlets is inevitable. Charge up before you head out, and keep a car charger and a power pack or a few battery chargers for your portable electronic devices handy. Check your flight, no matter where you're going. Think you don't have to worry about bad weather because you're flying from sunny California to sunny Florida? Not so fast. ""Because airlines operate networks, a storm affects not only flights in its immediate location but even those in far-removed locations not affected by the storm,"" said Cynthia Barnhart, an MIT engineering professor who teaches airline schedule planning. Check your aircraft's journey on your airline website or with an app like Flightview. Don't be a jerk. ""The airline representatives did not make it snow,"" Seaney reminds travelers. ""We've heard many anecdotal stories over the years from airline representatives who tell us it's a lot easier to find a good flight for a pleasant passenger than for one who is screaming at you."" Use common sense: Don't drive into a storm. It's dangerous out there. Monitor your local and regional forecasts, and don't drive if you don't have to. AAA advises motorists to check tire pressure and make sure car batteries, cooling systems and antifeeze levels are in order. They also advise that you keep gas tanks close to full in order to be able to run the engine for heat in case you get stranded. AAA suggests keeping the following items in your car: a shovel, a bag of sand, a snowbrush, an ice scraper, jumper cables, a spare tire, windshield wiper fluid, a cell phone, car charger, blankets, gloves, hats, food, water and essential medication.

"(CNN) -- Can't stand the heat of the first tennis grand slam of 2014? Then you clearly haven't been doing enough Bikram yoga. That's the view of leading sports scientist Dr. Ross Tucker, who suggests any tennis star with designs on success at a sweltering Australian Open in Melbourne should have come already acclimatized to the hot and sweaty conditions. Canadian Frank Dancevic branded conditions at this year's tournament ""inhumane"" after he fainted during his opening match, while other players have complained of burned feet and melted water bottles in temperatures which have lingered above a sweltering 40 degrees Celsius. ""If you go there and you're not prepared for the heat, it's not going to be your grand slam,"" Dr. Tucker, who has worked with the U.S. Olympic Committee, UK Sport and the South African Olympic Confederation among others , told CNN. ""We know acclimatization makes a massive difference to performance in the heat. You become more efficient. There's a mental and a physical component to the training. It's those little nuances in preparation that make the difference."" World No. 4 Andy Murray has been a finalist in Melbourne in three of the last four years and for the last five years has been a bikram yoga practitioner - a sequence of 26 yoga moves done in a piping hot studio at temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsisus. While even Murray has questioned the wisdom of staging a tournament in soaring temperatures, world No. 1 Serena Williams revealed Wednesday the fear of dehydration was giving her sleepless nights. Not that the myriad of player complaints have influenced tournament doctor Tim Wood. Blog: Five players to watch in 2014 . ""We look into the health and well being of players, but we know over the years in different parts of the country and world they play under these conditions,"" Dr. Wood told a press conference. ""(Players) sit down every five to ten minutes for every 90 seconds at change of ends, so there is chance to lose some heat at that time. Tennis by and large is a low risk sport, and that's why by and large, like cricket, we can play in these conditions and not be too concerned. ""A lot of people get hot and look distressed and hot and bothered, as we all do. The actually risk to the health is relatively small compared to other sports."" Dr. Wood was equally bullish on players' fears surrounding dehydration.. ""Dehydration, look, we have never had anybody die from dehydration on a tennis court,"" he added. ""We have had players almost die from drinking too much. So the danger is overdrinking, not underdrinking and becoming dehydrated. ""Again, given the length of time tennis matches generally go for and the sweat rate of most normal, healthy athletes, they won't get to a state where they get too critically dehydrated. ""So, no, we have never had to put a drip in someone who has been so dehydrated that their vital signs, blood pressure and heart rate, have been compromised."" If the weather, in the eyes of the event officials, becomes too extreme for play to continue, tournament referee Wayne McKewen has the power to call a halt to proceedings. He makes the judgment, in consultation with other parties, using a scale which not only factors in the ambient temperature, but also wind and humidity. So far, according to McKewen, the relatively low humidity has meant conditions are fine for play to proceed as planned. In theory, unless humidity increases, play could continue even if the mercury hits 42, 43 or even 44 degrees. Murray used his press conference to voice concerns over players suffering from heart attacks or other serious health problems as a result of the oppressive weather. Despite Dancevic's collapse, and China's Peng Shuai vomiting and complaining of cramps, Dr. Tucker supported Wood's assessment that playing in the tournament would prove fatal for any of the players. Put simply; it's hot, it's horrible, but it's probably not going to kill you. ""I don't want belittle what the players are experience,"" explained Dr. Tucker. ""I'm of the opinion that the danger is a little bit overhyped. ""Death is a failure of normal physiology, it's not a normal situation. Your body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius, when you hit 40 degrees that's pretty much lights out but not death. ""Death happens when your body temperature is at 41 or 42 degrees and you have to be there for quite a long time. Your body has a defense mechanism which forces you stop exercising, to fail, to become fatigued, to potentially pass out at around 40 degrees. ""The risk is more about performance. Dancevic is fine, he didn't die and he wouldn't have. As soon as you remove yourself from the heat, the risk has gone."" To try and give the players respite from the blazing sun, organizers implemented an extreme weather contingency plan which allows for extended player breaks between the second and third sets. But there's a catch... It only applies to women's matches. It's a plan which has irked Murray, who called for greater equality between men's and women's games. ""You would need the same for the men,"" said Tucker. ""The men are bigger, being big in the heat is a disadvantage. The smaller you are the better you are in the heat. Big guys generate more heat, that's why long distance runners are always small. ""The rationale behind the break is good, but I don't know why they're only giving it to the women. If it keeps going like this they might need more of those kinds of breaks."" While he is receptive to the concerns voiced by players like Murray and Dancevic, not to mention Croatia's Ivan Dodig who was concerned for his life during his match, Dr. Tucker doesn't think the tournament needs to be relocated or rescheduled. ""It's a bit fatalistic to say the show must go on,"" he concluded. ""How many players have played? Only one has collapsed. ""I would argue that the story might be the 259 guys who haven't collapsed. Yes they're struggling and it's really challenging, but it's going to become one of the distinctive things about the Australian Open."" If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the Rod Laver Arena.","Temperatures at the Australian Open tennis tournament have exceeded 40 degrees Celcius .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two senior state officials in New Jersey are vehemently denouncing allegations of political strong-arming in the governor's name, the latest in a series of controversies lashing the Christie administration. Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno publicly denied an assertion by Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer that she conditioned Superstorm Sandy recovery money last year on Zimmer's support for a redevelopment project backed by Christie. Zimmer said the ultimatum came down in a parking lot and involved a project proposed by a real estate developer, the Rockefeller Group, with ties to Christie. She said Guadagno invoked Christie's name in laying out the condition for storm relief and has relayed her story to federal prosecutors. ""Mayor Zimmer's version of our conversation in May of 2013 is not only false but is illogical and does not withstand scrutiny when all of the facts are examined,"" Guadagno said at a Martin Luther King Jr. event in Union Beach. Zimmer, a Democrat, also said Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable made a similar demand regarding storm aid and the real estate plan. He called the allegations ""patently false and absurd on their face."" Constable added that he welcomes a ""full and thorough law enforcement review of her libelous claims."" Zimmer said she stands by her account, remains ""willing to testify under oath,"" and will answer any questions from the U.S. Attorney's Office. ""The bottom line is, Anderson, I mean, she came and she said this to me, you know, and I stand by my word,"" Zimmer told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Monday night, referring to her conversation with the lieutenant governor. ""She said she would deny it and she's denying it,"" the mayor said. Fuel on the fire . The accusations over the weekend added fuel to a political and legal firestorm that has consumed the Christie administration in recent weeks, mainly over suggestions top aides and advisers to the governor orchestrated traffic jams around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee last year to punish that town's mayor for not endorsing Christie for re-election. A state legislative committee investigating that matter issued subpoenas last week to key Christie appointees, some of them still in their jobs and others who have recently left. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman's office is also looking into the matter. Christie has denied knowledge of the alleged bridge scheme that gained steam this month with the release of explosive e-mails between Christie appointees before, during and after the September traffic fiasco. Having made his mark as a brash politician with cross-party appeal, Christie is viewed as a potential front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, if he decides to run. But the unfolding scandals have raised questions about his political and management style in a state where Democrats dominate at the local level. Despite the unfolding political turmoil at home, Christie remains popular out of state. He spent the weekend in Florida raising money for Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for re-election. Zimmer's accusation . Hoboken, a historically working-class town on the banks of the Hudson River made famous by favorite son Frank Sinatra, has experienced a resurgence in recent years. New development, cleaned up parks and neighborhood charm marketing nostalgia have boosted its image and attracted new residents and business. Zimmer, elected in 2009 as the city's first female mayor, said Guadagno approached her and told her that supporting the development project by the Rockefeller Group was critical for Hoboken receiving Sandy aid. Guadango said her dispatch was ""a direct message from the governor,"" Zimmer told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. It's ""stunning"" and ""outrageous,"" but true, Zimmer said. ""I stand by my word."" Zimmer told MSNBC on Saturday that three days after her run-in with Guadango, Constable delivered a similar message, that ""money would start flowing"" if she supported the project. Christie scandals: What you need to know . Zimmer met with Fishman's office for several hours at its request Sunday and provided prosecutors with her journal, which contained information about the parking lot episode. Guadango said she recalled having a conversation with Zimmer that day, but she remembered Zimmer arguing that Sandy recovery aid and redevelopment were the same issue, according to a source close to Guadagno who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""Kim remembers in their conversation that she was talking about redevelopment and making investments in Hoboken. She remembers Zimmer pressing Kim for money for Sandy. Kim remembers saying you can't tie the two together,"" the source said. ""And she remembers Zimmer continuing to press and showing her a map of the city and pressing for aid for Sandy."" Zimmer disputes that account and provided CNN with letters that she said back up her case. On April 23, she sent a letter to Christie's office that she argued says development and Sandy aid should not be connected. ""Just as shore towns are not being asked for development in exchange for protecting them from future storms, the solution to Hoboken's flooding challenges cannot be dependent on future development,"" the letter read. She sent another letter to his office on May 8 asking for help with funding pumps. Zimmer's conversation with Guadango happened just days later and the mayor said she believes the two events are related. ""When you look at all of the events together, you can see that it was a progression. It was a progression of pressure and she was sent in to really make that final message to me,"" Zimmer told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" Guadagno spoke Monday before mayors whose towns were also affected by Sandy, a storm of historic proportions that heavily damaged shore and waterfront areas up and down the mid-Atlantic coastline. The federal government authorized billions in aid. ""Frankly, I'm surprised that Mayor Zimmer has chosen to mischaracterize a conversation I had with her about development and job creation in Hoboken,"" Guadagno said in remarks that appeared carefully planned to discredit Zimmer's allegations. Christie aides push back . Christie spokesman Colin Reed said it was ""categorically false"" that Sandy funds were withheld. ""It's very clear partisan politics are at play here as Democratic mayors with a political ax to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television,"" Reed said in a statement. Building their case against Zimmer, Christie's administration hosted a conference call for reporters Monday defending how Sandy funds were allocated. Marc Ferzan, executive director of the Governor's Office of Recovery and Rebuilding, said that her accounting is ""a mischaracterisation."" After Sandy, Hoboken was 80% underwater. Zimmer said it received about $300,000 of the roughly $100 million in state funds the city requested for flood prevention. Ferzan said Hoboken has been approved for nearly $70 million in aid. But that aid was given mostly to individual residents and small businesses, not the city of Hoboken. The Hoboken allegation is the second to surface regarding Sandy money. A federal watchdog, the inspector general for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is looking at protocols around state spending for a marketing ad for Sandy recovery featuring Christie and his family. The Christie administration went with a firm that charged twice as much to produce the spot as another bidder. Christie marches on as controversy at home unfolds . Ad firm head: We were asked about using Christie in post-Sandy campaign . A different account . The governor's spokesman also said the mayor and Christie have had a ""productive relationship,"" noting an August tweet by Zimmer saying she's ""very glad Gov. Christie has been our governor."" Zimmer admitted to supporting Christie in the past, saying she is not a part of ""the Democratic machine."" But her comments over the weekend are a change from what she told CNN last week. She said then that she didn't think Sandy funds for her city were tied to any instance of political retribution. ""I don't think it was retaliation, and I don't have any reason to think it's retaliation, but I'm not satisfied with the amount of money I've gotten so far,"" Zimmer said. She did not mention her concerns about the redevelopment project. But Sunday morning, Zimmer told CNN she didn't speak out before because she didn't think anyone would believe her. CNN received images of journal entries that Zimmer said she wrote at the time. In one, Zimmer writes that the conversation with Guadagno left her upset and shattered the image she had of Christie. ""I thought he was honest, I thought he was moral -- I thought he was something very different,"" the journal entry says. ""I am so disappointed -- it literally brings tears to my eyes."" See the journal entries . CNN exclusive: Port Authority job created for Christie ally, source says . Debate about redevelopment . Zimmer's allegations center on a property owned by the Rockefeller Group, which had a plan for redevelopment of a three-block area of Hoboken that was rejected by the city's planning board. Instead, the panel voted to classify the area owned by the company as available for ""rehabilitation,"" which results in fewer tax incentives. Aides and advisers to Christie have ties to Wolff & Samson, the law firm representing The Rockefeller Group. Wolff & Samson lobbyist Lori Grifa was a former commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, and Wolff & Samson's David Samson is chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and was appointed by Christie. Samson was recently served with a subpoena in the George Washington Bridge case by an investigative committee seeking relevant documents. Another investigation? The chairman of the Democratic-led investigative committee tasked with looking into the George Washington Bridge scandal weighed in as news of the Hoboken allegations spread. New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski said in a statement that the allegations were serious and have ""certainly attracted our attention."" ""I think what we're going to do first is have a conversation with her to make sure that we understand all of the accusations being made,"" Wisniewski told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""She's the first one to make a specific allegation about a specific event with somebody in particular in the governor's administration. I don't think it would be appropriate for the committee to rush to any conclusions,"" he said.

"Beijing (CNN) -- To many people in China, Mao Zedong is the country's eternal father -- ""No Mao, no China,"" is the mantra often repeated by his supporters. His giant portrait hangs over the gate of Beijing's ancient Forbidden City like that of an emperor. Across the city, thousands flock every day to gaze at his body lying preserved in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square. His picture holds pride of place in many houses in villages across China. To these people he remains a symbol of strength, a man born a peasant -- albeit a somewhat comfortable one -- who rose to lead the people's army of the Communist Party and unite a warring country. Lately, Mao has re-emerged as the face of resistance and defiance more than three decades after his death. Young Chinese protesters have carried his image aloft during protests against Japan over disputed islands in the region. One young woman from Mao's home village in Hunan province lamented how weak she thought her country's leaders have become -- that if Mao were still alive then China would just take the islands. Despite this reverence, Mao's remains a flawed legacy. For those who see strength in his face, others remember fear: revolution, paranoia, famine, brutality and tens of millions of deaths. China suffered during high-profile campaigns introduced by Mao, such as the ""Great Leap Forward,"" where millions of people died through starvation or persecution during a catastrophic attempt to modernize China between 1958 and 1961. Another disastrous period, known as the ""Cultural Revolution,"" began in 1966 with the intention of reviving the revolutionary spirit of Communism. But over the next decade, millions of young people were forcibly removed from cities to learn from peasants in the countryside -- viewed as ideological role models by Mao -- causing massive social and economic upheaval. On the streets of Beijing, when we mention Mao's name, seeking people's opinion, some are wary. ""Why are you asking me this?"" asks one woman as she scurried away from our cameras. ""Where is your identification, you shouldn't be talking about this,"" she warned. Another young woman was more forthright: China needs no more of Mao. ""I think that Chairman Mao is a rather extreme person. We don't really need those who are too extreme; instead, we need people who can connect China with the international community. In the long run, this would be best for China,"" she said. But many are wrapped up in an almost revolutionary nostalgia. ""The current leaders should be as strong as Mao,"" one Beijing resident said. ""For the Chinese people, he represents belief, a great man,"" said another. As the Communist Party prepares for its 18th Party Congress on Thursday, when it will name a new leader, it will also reflect on a country that would be unrecognizable to Mao. This is no longer the land of gray suits and bicycles, it's all about Audi cars and Armani suits for many Chinese now. The country that once couldn't feed itself is now the world's second-largest economy and an emerging superpower to rival the United States. Mao's peasant revolution has given way to ""socialism with Chinese characteristics."" Yet Mao remains inescapable, not just in the minds of ordinary people nostalgic for the past, but at the heart of the party itself. Bo Xilai, once tipped as a potential future President himself whose father was a Mao acolyte, launched an audacious bid to re-model the party in Mao's image. As chief of the massive metropolis of Chongqing, Bo launched huge Cultural Revolution-style rallies, encouraging the singing of red songs -- songs popular during the country's revolution -- and chanting Mao-era slogans. Bo won great favor with ordinary people. But as his popularity rose, his standing in a nervous Communist Party diminished. According to those close to him, Bo played with fire. ""I think it was a huge misjudgment of Bo. Going back to Mao's path is definitely not an option. That has proven to be a dead end. Mao led a road to ruin,"" Wang Kang, a Chongqing scholar who knows Bo and his wife, told CNN. As the world now knows, Bo is in disgrace and never got a chance to spread his new ""gospel of Mao."" He's been stripped of his party positions and faces prosecution in the wake of a political scandal while his wife, Gu Kailai, is in prison convicted of killing a British business associate. This scandal has torn open the veil of secrecy around the party, and all of this in a year of political transition with a new generation led by Xi Jinping, the current vice president, preparing to take the helm. Like Bo, Xi is a ""princeling,"" the son of one of Mao's revolutionary inner circle. Xi will inherit a different party -- the days of one supreme leader are over, according to long-time China watcher Mike Chinoy. ""This is a system that is based on consensus, not structured any longer to have a single dominant figure like a Mao Zedong or a Deng Xiaoping,"" he said. Yet Xi must also walk the ""maze of Mao,"" for he is a son of China's past as much as a leader of its future. Like all Chinese, he will look at Mao's image and know the power of its symbolism, yet he will look past that and know his country's fate lies, perhaps, with moving even further from Mao's idea of China.","Mao Zedong can divide opinion in China, inspiring nostalgia in some and fear in others .
Mao's ""Great Leap Forward"" and ""Cultural Revolution"" was disastrous for China .
China is now less about one supreme leader and more about ruling by consensus .
The country has grown into the world's second largest economy behind the U.S."
"(CNN) -- At least one in six people worldwide doesn't have access to clean water, and this contributes to about 1.5 million preventable deaths each year, according to the United Nations. Doc Hendley, a top 10 CNN Hero in 2009, is trying to help change that. Through his nonprofit, Wine to Water, the former bartender from North Carolina has helped provide clean water to more than 150,000 people in 15 countries. Wine-tasting events are one way Hendley and his group raise the funds that enable them to distribute water filters and help install wells in communities around the world. And next month, bartenders from 16 countries will be donating their tips to the cause. For World Water Day, CNN's Meghan Dunn sat down with Hendley to talk about the crisis and his recent efforts to help some of the 3.6 million people displaced by the Syrian conflict. CNN: What should people know about the water crisis? Doc Hendley: It takes many women and children four and five hours, every single day, just to get water. And then it's absolutely filthy, and it's making their children sick. Diarrhea kills more children under 5 than AIDS, malaria and measles combined. And 88% of (those) deaths are caused by poor sanitation, unsafe drinking water and poor hygiene. A lot of people ask me, ""If this water crisis is so bad, how come we haven't heard much about it?"" Well, here in the West, we help support things that we can empathize with. We know what it's like to lose a loved one to a disease like cancer. We understand what it means to need a good, solid education for a child. So (those causes) get a lot of the spotlight. But it's hard for us to empathize with the water crisis. We wash our cars; we water our lawn. We just can't imagine what it's like to not have access to water. CNN: Why did you start working on this issue? Hendley: I began raising funds to support the fight against the global water crisis back in 2004, and I had an opportunity to live in Darfur, Sudan, during the height of the genocide there. My job was to (work in) refugee camps and get them access to water. When I first started witnessing these women and children and the effort they would go through for a cup of water, and then to see actually the water that they were providing to their kids -- when you see that firsthand, you can't help but be changed. When I came home, it's all I could think about. I dreamed about it. So I decided this is what I want to do with my life. CNN Heroes changed everything for Wine to Water and for me. When I was (honored) back in 2009, it had taken us five years to reach about 25,000 people in four different countries around the world. Now we're in 15 different countries around the world. Syria is our latest one we just added. CNN: Why did you get involved in the situation in Syria? Hendley: Right now in Syria, every single day, thousands of people are fleeing their homes because of this fighting ... going to an unknown future, with no resources. In these (displacement) camps, a lot of the men have either been killed or they're all fighting, so it's mostly populated by children and women. The vast majority is children. And as you know, a lot of these kids' systems are very weak, and they're drinking filthy water. My first thought was, ""Let's see if we can get some water filters into these camps."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Another big reason for me was that the first country I worked in, Sudan, was a predominantly Muslim country, and I've really felt a connection with the Muslim world ever since. I really wanted to get out there and reach out, to show that we want to help in any way we can. CNN: What are you doing to help? Hendley: We created a partnership with Zakat (a U.S.-based Muslim charity), and right now we're actively working in two camps in the northwestern region, near border areas between Syria and Turkey. I was able to (go) inside some of these camps, inside Syria, just a couple months ago. The living conditions, they're terrible. On that trip, I was able to bring about 350 filters with me. Until we can get each household to have their own water filter, which is the ultimate goal, we have a couple of distribution areas where people can come with their buckets of water and run (it) through a number of filters in order to clean it. When it's not an emergency situation, we can go into an area and teach them, using their local resources, how to build their own water filter. But in a war zone, like what's going on in Syria, we just need to get a clean water fix immediately. Syria is the very first location that we're using these Sawyer filters. We're really excited about them. If they're used properly, they will last 10 years and filter 250 gallons of water every day. We have another partnership with an organization called Stop Hunger Now that's going to be also sending meals over to Syria. So we're packaging a container with about 250,000 meals, and then we'll also be packaging 1,000 water filters in that, so there'll be about 1,350 filters altogether in these two camps. And this'll be just the first of many shipments, hopefully. If we can get the support of more people back home, we'll be able to send over a lot more filters. CNN: How can people help Wine to Water with this issue? Hendley: We have a really cool campaign going on right now where people can actually get involved from all over the world to help support our work. It's called Just One Shift. The whole concept is, bartenders from around the world are going to unite together and give up the tips from one of their shifts during one week (April 8-14) to support our efforts with Wine to Water. We've already had bartenders in 16 different countries sign up. You can go to our website, and we have a link for Just One Shift where you can click and see if there's a (participating) bar in your hometown and what night the bartender is giving up their shift. So you can go and have some drinks and know that all the tips that you're giving that night are going to be donated back to us at Wine to Water. And that will allow us to be able to bring more of these water filters into the displaced persons camps all throughout Syria. The service industry crowd, the bartenders out there, they're all people that love to build relationships, that love to talk about what's going on in the world and how can we fix it. With this Just One Shift campaign, bartenders around the world are going to prove that we can change the world. CNN: You visited Syria in December, and you're going back again next month. Do you ever worry about the risk? Hendley: Going inside Syria reminds me a lot of my time (in Sudan). When I was younger, I was a little more reckless; I didn't have as much to lose. Now I have a wife and two kids, and so I do find myself thinking, ""Is this work really worth risking my life over?"" You know, when you see these families get to access clean water, it makes the answer pretty easy: Of course it's worth it. A lot of people think because the number is so big, what can one person really do? It's just too overwhelming. But if you think, ""I could help one other person or five other people or one village,"" you can make a huge difference.","Doc Hendley, a top 10 CNN Hero in 2009, has expanded his Wine to Water initiative .

"(CNN) -- The Arab Spring seems a long time ago. The voices of Tunis and Tahrir Square, the uprising in Benghazi, the street protests in Yemen and Bahrain promised a popular awakening in countries where politics had been confined to an elite. The Western democracies -- if a little hesitantly -- took the side of the demonstrators. But with the exception of Libya, their contribution to the Arab world's new beginning comprised moral support and the promise of financial help once new governments were formed. The U.S. used some of its substantial political clout in the region to ease Hosni Mubarak and Zine El Abedine Ben Ali out of power in Egypt and Tunisia respectively. ""Soft power"" -- advice, mediation, persuasion and some aid -- was leveraged to influence events; the use of ""hard power"" as in Iraq was not even contemplated. As President Barack Obama put it in a speech in Cairo in June 2009, ""Events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible. ""Indeed, we can recall the words of Thomas Jefferson, who said, 'I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power, the greater it will be,' "" he said. The president's then-defense secretary, Robert Gates, expanded on the theme, saying that more needed to be spent on ""diplomacy, strategic communications, foreign assistance, civic action and economic reconstruction and development."" Opinion: For U.S., Syria is truly a problem from hell . The Obama administration has sought to reduce the U.S. military footprint abroad, pulling all U.S. troops out of Iraq and setting a timetable for the withdrawal of combat troops from Afghanistan. It is wary of the use of military power for all but the most forensic of operations (the raid that killed Osama bin Laden) or those that achieve defined aims at next to no political cost (drones over Yemen). Libya was the exception. Rare and rapid international agreement, blessed at the U.N., allowed for a swift military response to prevent a bloodbath in Benghazi, which had been taken over by opponents of the Gadhafi regime. The targets -- most of them along a strip of the Mediterranean coast -- were poorly defended and easily hit from the sea or airbases in Italy. Even so, NATO warplanes flew 21,000 missions over nearly six months to enforce a no-fly zone. And the result of all that military investment was a few weeks of euphoria with the ousting of Gadhafi -- and many months since of chronic volatility, as groups sympathetic to al Qaeda have sown chaos and turf wars have sapped the new government's authority. Before his death in Benghazi in September, Ambassador Chris Stevens' own communications revealed huge frustration and some anxiety about the proliferation of militia and growing violence in Libya. This week, Aaron Zelin of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a longtime watcher of jihadism in North Africa, wrote that one of the main militant groups, Ansar al-Sharia, ""has been taking advantage of the lack of state control by building local communal ties, which is strengthening its ability to operate in more locations than Benghazi."" Forcible intervention by superior powers can quickly demolish regimes that lack legitimacy. But in societies where there is no tradition of civic society or democracy, deep sectarian or ethnic fissures and desperate economic problems, helping to fashion the new is an almost overwhelming demand. While U.S. troops remained in Iraq, Sunni and Shiite political groups had to obey some rules of the road, and Iran had to exercise its influence discreetly. But since their departure, sectarian violence has surged to its worst levels in five years. When a group believes that it is in an existential struggle, it is unlikely to heed the advice of diplomats who soon will leave for home. Egypt's multilayered problems -- political, economic and demographic -- defy any short-term solution. There are more than 80 million Egyptians, most of them close to or below the poverty line and under the age of 25. Faint hopes for a democratic alternative to Mubarak have been snuffed out. Concerted diplomacy failed to persuade President Mohamed Morsy to be ""inclusive,"" as Obama put it, or take critical economic decisions. After Morsy was ousted, back-corridor pleas to the Egyptian military to avoid civilian casualties, not declare a state of emergency and open new channels of dialogue all fell on deaf ears. Missile strikes on Syria likely response to chemical attack . Obama's preference for diplomacy and international consensus goes only so far, especially when there's so little common ground that a U.S.-Russia summit is not even worth holding. But there is no appetite in the West for more muscular nation-(re)building, especially after the experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama recognized this when he said in Cairo in 2009, ""No system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other."" Such campaigns are unpopular at home and very costly, demanding multiyear commitments for very little reward. Groups that were at each other's throats suddenly turn their fire on a common enemy: the invader. Many observers expect that is exactly what would happen in Syria if there was a full-throated military intervention. And pacifying a country with so many weapons, so many open borders and so many sectarian fault lines would demand a force larger than the 168,000 combat troops deployed to Iraq at the peak of the U.S. commitment. That is not on the agenda. So the use of ""hard power"" in Syria would be limited to punishment strikes on the grounds that ""something must be done."" Such strikes would begin to degrade the Assad regime's military infrastructure and discourage it from using chemical weapons but would probably not tip the military balance decisively. And they may become politically unavoidable if the U.N. inspectors who have gone to Ghouta find irrefutable evidence that chemical weapons killed hundreds of people last week. They would also be welcomed by the regime's opponents in the hope that more would follow. But they would be a metaphoric slap on the wrist. There is no ""exit"" or ""end"" strategy in such strikes, and it seems likely that hardline Islamist groups would be best placed to take advantage of a weakening al-Assad regime. There is the faint chance that proof of the regime's use of chemical weapons would oblige Russia and China to at least modify their resistance at the Security Council to a tougher stance against al-Assad. But turning that into a common position would demand exceptionally deft diplomacy. The Western powers are not impotent in the Middle East. In Egypt, the generals' long relationship with their U.S. counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. The U.S. and Europe can also join the Gulf states in providing emergency aid to Egypt (the Saudis and others have already pledged $15 billion). In Syria, Washington can continue to cajole the moderate opposition to behave more coherently and reassert itself in the face of the Islamists' rise. It can continue to work with the government of Yemen in targeting al Qaeda operatives in more remote areas with drones. In Tunisia, there is still an influential, moderate strand in the ruling Islamist party, Ennahda, and a strong middle class with a secular outlook. The leaders of both countries have recently been in Washington. But as age-old sectarian and religious hatreds rage across much of the Middle East, from Tripoli in northern Lebanon to Tripoli in Libya, there is little more that outsiders can do but wait for the volcano to finish erupting.","Obama administration has sought to reduce U.S. military footprint abroad .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- As well as their potential for creating effective therapies for debilitating diseases, embryonic stem cells could open the door to improved pharmaceutical drug testing, according to a leading British stem cell researcher. Embryonic stem cells seen pictured through a microscope viewfinder in a laboratory. Speaking at a recent meeting of the British Pharmacological Society in Brighton, UK, Christine Mummery described how using embryonic stem cells to create human heart cells could be a viable and scientifically exciting alternative to animal testing. Mummery, a Professor of Developmental Biology at Leiden University Medical Center in The Netherlands told CNN: ""It could save a lot of time and effort of taking the wrong drugs through, or it may allow drugs through which are lost at an early stage, because they affect the animal cells but don't have an effect on human cells. ""It may also allow more and better drugs to come through the first tests or flag up safety issues at an earlier stage."" Drug development is an incredibly expensive and protracted process. Typically, it costs around $1 billion to bring a new drug to market and the whole process usually takes about ten years. Before new drugs can go forward for clinical trials, it's necessary for the chemical compounds which make up a drug to undergo thousands of tests for toxicity before beginning trials on animals -- initially on rodents and then often on dogs. It's here, at this ethically sensitive stage, that Professor Mummery believes stem cell research could transform drug development. ""Many drugs are designed to affect the heart deliberately, controlling beats and rates of contraction,"" said Mummery, who specializes in converting embryonic stem cells into cardiac and vascular cells. But, as she points out, plenty of drugs designed to treat other complaints can also have negative side effects on the heart -- the painkiller Vioxx being a notable example. ""It's really important for the pharmaceutical industry to have proper test systems to pick those sorts of things up,"" she said. Merck & Co withdrew Vioxx in 2004 because of concerns over increased risk of stroke and heart attacks. Lawsuits filed against the company have cost them billions of dollars and many litigants still await their day in court. Stem cell based drug testing is already being promoted in the UK with the public/private initiative ""Stem Cells for Safer Medicine"" which was set up in 2007. It's something Mummery hopes will be replicated in other countries and particularly in the U.S. under President-elect Obama who is a proponent of stem cell research. A 2007 sabbatical at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts gave Mummery first-hand experience of the ethical debates that have engulfed stem cell research debates in the U.S.. ""I was shocked at the light years we are away from the way people think about embryonic stem cells in the States,"" she said. ""It's very mixed up with the abortion issue. It's put into the same category."" Public funding, or the lack of it, under President George W. Bush has also stymied research. ""What's happened in the U.S. is that people have become very frustrated and a lot of private initiatives -- like the Harvard Stem Cell Institute -- were started up to circumvent the lack of National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. NIH researchers are either left behind or have a huge administrative burden,"" Mummery said. ""You go into a lab in the States and they say; 'this is our NIH lab, and this is our other lab'. They have to buy one microscope to look at NIH lines and another to look at other lines. They have to administer all the stem cells separately. There are even dotted lines in a lab which you can and cannot cross. It's completely ridiculous,"" she said. Drug company interest in stem cell drug testing was demonstrated in July 2008, when GlaxoSmithKline entered into a $25 million-plus agreement with the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. Commenting on the deal, Professor Patrick Vallance, Head of Drug Discovery at GSK said: ""GSK believes stem cell science has great potential to aid the discovery of new medicines by improving the screening, identification and development of new compounds."" Drug testing is an emotive subject not least because of animal testing. So how have anti-vivisectionists greeted the news? Chief Executive at the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV), Michelle Thew told CNN: ""We have some concerns about the technology in general because it will still use animal cells and animals, but we are positive about things which may reduce the numbers of live animals in testing."" Clearly, the BUAV would like to do away with all animal testing altogether. Their obvious ethical objections, are backed up by questions about its efficacy. ""One of issues with drug development,"" Thew said, ""is that animal testing is not very successful at getting drugs through the process because a lot of the tests aren't very predictive. They are also very expensive and time-consuming."" Even if stem cell drug testing does mark the beginning of the end for animal testing, the ethical vacuum is already being filled by another storm of controversy surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells. But, as Mummery points out, these objections will disappear should researchers from Japan and the U.S. continue to improve on early successes in creating stem cells from skin cells. Whatever the debate, the fact is at the moment, says Mummery, there are very few new drugs coming on to the market in the European Union. ""The drug companies are very nervous about the costs involved and the risks,"" she said. ""If there was a reliable system to flag up issues they would be much more confident of taking drugs through to market.""","Leading UK stem cell expert calls for embryonic stem cells to be used to test drugs .
Using stem cells could reduce costs and flag up issues prior to clinical tests .
Hopes for better funding in U.S. boosted by support of President-elect Obama ."
"Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- Tucked between snow-topped mountains, Lebanon's Bekaa Valley is home to dozens of ramshackle camps housing Syrian refugees who have little to protect them against the cold. It was the image of children with no shoes in the bitter winter and mud that Hala Habib Qiblawi, a designer and mother of three, couldn't get out of her mind over the past year. ""It was the first thing ... the only thing that stayed in my head,"" she says. This year, she decided to do something about it. She was in the process of organizing her campaign, procuring winter boots for children, when Lebanon was hit by one of its coldest spells and harshest storms in memory. That's when Qiblawi realized she wasn't the only one who felt compelled to do something. ""Everybody was so angry, angry at the government, angry at the silence,"" she says. ""Everybody was thinking of the refugees. And seeing that anger -- and I myself worried and angry -- I launched it."" She started a Facebook campaign, ""Rain Boots for Syrian refugee children,"" with a target of 2,000 pairs of boots. The response stunned her. She achieved her goal within the first 24 hours, ending up with thousands more pairs. And the boots keep coming. ""It's like really seeing, realizing that there is still humanity on earth, especially in this part of the world,"" Qiblawi says. Helping to organize the distribution is Sawa for Syria, a nongovernmental organization started over coffee with friends by Rouba Mhaissen, a 25-year-old Lebanese Syrian. A Ph.D. candidate living in London, Mhaissen came back to Lebanon two years ago for a visit and just couldn't leave. ""The number of refugees has reached a ceiling of 2 million in Lebanon with a complete chaos in NGOs, a complete lack of institutional coordination. So grass-roots organizations like us and many other initiatives are taking the lead to try and do something, but still the need is very very high."" Sawa for Syria now has some 2,000 members, all volunteers, and helps manage and distribute aid to camps across the Bekaa Valley. Among those waiting for their boots on this day is a group of friends that clamors around us. Amina, 9, shows off how she can write her name in English. The other girls chatter about wanting to go back home to Syria. But Suzanne, a 5-year-old with large brown eyes, stays silent as she slips her hand into mine, clutching it tightly. The older boys tell us her father is dead, killed by a sniper in Homs as he was riding a minibus. One of her brothers is missing in Syria, presumed detained by regime forces; another is still recovering from injuries after an artillery strike. We wade through the sticky mud to her family tent. She and her sisters show us where they shoved cardboard into the makeshift ceiling to absorb the rainwater. Outour, Suzanne's 13-year-old sister, hasn't been able to register in school. Over the summer she and one of her brothers worked in the fields. Without a father, it's the children's burden to help make ends meet. As we chat their mother arrives, her face etched with pain, eyes weary. ""My eldest, her husband died recently too. They had three kids,"" she says, her heart so broken she seems numb to it all. As for so many other Syrians, hardship and pain are the norm. In another world, Outour says, she would have continued her education -- she wants to be a journalist. One of her younger sisters wants to be a dentist, and Suzanne says she wants to be a doctor. But these children know the harsh reality of life too well. At least while they are getting fitted for their boots and showing us what they ended up with, there are those brief smiles and giggles. ""Sometimes you feel like no matter what you do, you are just doing 1% of the need,"" Mhaissen says. ""But at the same time when you see a child smiling, a mother happy that her son got something, those moments do count."" As Qiblawi says one of her friends put it: ""It's like giving them a Cinderella moment. It's true -- seeing the happiness on the children's faces, with dignity, they were all so proud and dignified.""","Syrian children in refugee camps in Lebanon lack basics to get through harsh winters .

"(CNN) -- In a move to squash dissent within North Korea's ruling elite, the once-powerful uncle of Leader Kim Jong Un was removed from his government position at a Ruling Workers' Party politburo meeting Sunday, North Korea's state news agency KCNA confirmed. Jang Song Thaek, who married Kim's aunt, was the vice chairman of North Korea's top military body and has often been pictured beside Kim, who has ruled North Korea since his father's death in 2011. ""Some see this as perhaps the last part of the power consolidation phase, that Kim Jong Un has in fact removed all of the old guard close to his father and is now finalizing the inserting of his own inner group,"" said John Park, a Northeast Asia analyst at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Jang and his allies were accused by Kim of double-dealing behind the scene, ""dreaming different dreams"" and selling off the country's resources at cheap prices, thereby threatening North Korea's economic development, according to the KCNA statement. Opinion: North Korea's young Kim there to stay . ""Jang desperately worked to form a faction within the party by creating illusion about him and winning those weak in faith and flatterers to his side,"" the statement said. The public document also scolds Jang for improper relations with several women, drug use, gambling, eating at expensive restaurants and getting medical treatment in a foreign country. Last week two close allies of Jang -- Lee Yong-ha and Jang Soo-kee -- were publicly executed, South Korean lawmakers said at a news conference. The lawmakers, including Cho Won-jin of the governing Saenuri Party, said this after receiving what they said was a briefing from South Korea's National Intelligence Service. CNN has not been able to independently confirm the report. North Korea, a state shrouded in secrecy, is involved in a protracted standoff with its neighbors and Western powers over its nuclear weapons program. Tensions between North and South Korea soared this year as Pyongyang reacted angrily to tightened United Nations sanctions imposed in response to its latest nuclear test. The two sides are still technically at war after the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953, ended in a truce, not a treaty.

"(CNN) -- I rarely get to experience fine dining. Mostly because, generally speaking, it also requires fine currency. And pants. Fortunately, I'm perfectly happy with Lean Pockets, and enjoying one of those rarely requires dignity. But don't judge. Even Napoleon shared my low-brow culinary interests. The dude loved Lean Pockets. Most people don't know that. And you won't find it in any history books. Seriously, I wouldn't look that up. All things considered, though, when I do get a chance to partake in a true quality meal at an upscale restaurant (read: when someone else is buying) I genuinely enjoy the odd experience of being served really small portions of elaborate food on really large elaborate plates, where 75 percent of the actual surface area is covered by tiny, elaborate flakes of garnish that, combined with the elaborate entrÃ©e, ultimately won't prevent me from just ordering pizza a few hours later when I get home so I can finally get to sleep all fat and bloated like I'm accustomed to. America. Still, while I'm hardly deserving of such things, I really do enjoy the fine dining experience. And it's partly because people leave their kids at home. Usually. Recently, however, a couple didn't leave their kid at home, and that's exactly what caused a heated online debate about the social acceptability of bringing your children to restaurants that don't have crayons or dancing, human-sized mice that may or may not have done time in Leavenworth. ""Hey kids! Who wants to hear about the time I shanked a guy!"" This particular fine dining incident all started when the couple brought their 8-month-old baby into one of Chicago's swankiest restaurants, Alinea, which has the incredibly rare distinction of being awarded three stars by a renowned tire company. Meals at Alinea start at $210. Reservations are sold as tickets months in advance, and are non-refundable. So I'm guessing they don't serve fajitas. The head chef of Alinea, Grant Achatz, later took to Twitter after diners began complaining when the aforementioned 8-month-old baby starting crying. As babies and columnists with crippling self-doubt sometimes do. Achatz tweeted: Tbl brings 8mo.Old. It cries. Diners mad. Tll ppl no kids? Subject diners 2crying? Ppl take infants 2 plays? Concerts? Hate saying no,but.. It seems that the couple's baby-sitter had canceled at the last moment, but they decided to go out for dinner anyway because, apparently, the family dog isn't a suitable or legal fill-in. ""OK, Snickers. You're in charge."" Not surprisingly, Achatz's tweet started a much larger conversation online where the general consensus was: Screw your kids. Now, before we go any deeper into this debate, let me first disclose that I don't have any children of my own ... at least outside of those who may or may not be living in Thailand. And it's not that I don't like kids. I do. They say the darndest things. It's just that ... they're also kind of sticky. And they require maintenance. Quite frankly, I prefer the company of dogs. Because, while I'm quite grossed out by the idea of changing a diaper, I'm somehow perfectly OK with wrapping my hand in a Kroger bag and scooping up a giant, six-pound pile of partially digested IAMS from my lawn. So, yes, I understand that I don't understand what it's like to have children. But I also understand what it's like NOT to have children. And it's amazing. I nap a lot. Whether this disqualifies me to comment on this subject is up for you to decide. Regardless, we have to ask: Should adults bring their small children to fine dining restaurants? Almost everyone I spoke to about this agrees with me that there's a certain level of swank where you sort of have to draw the line. It's a gray line. But it's a line. And it runs nowhere near Red Lobster. The kids and restaurant debate later took a bizarre and wonderful twist when somebody created a fake Twitter handle for the 8-month-old child. @AlineaBaby describes itself as ... a baby who likes fine food, fine drinks, and crying. So, you know. Now there's that. But what should the no-kids criteria be? Is it a price range? Is it a particular style of cuisine? Or is it something undefined that you just sort of feel? Chef Achatz eventually spoke about the incident on ABC's Good Morning America where he simply said, ""I could hear it crying in the kitchen."" And in response to the pop-up Twitter account for @AlineaBaby, he tweeted a photo of two giant fish heads and wrote: Definitely not baby food... And definitely not fajitas. I think we found our line. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.","A couple brought their 8-month-old baby into Chicago's ultra-swanky Alinea restaurant .

"New York (CNN) -- Police are investigating the death of a New York City college student after he was injured during a fraternity ritual on a trip to the Poconos, authorities said Wednesday. Chun ""Michael"" Deng, 19, a freshman at Baruch College, was brought to a Pennsylvania hospital by his friends early Sunday morning, authorities said. Deng was unresponsive and in critical condition upon arrival at the hospital. Physicians determined Deng had suffered major brain trauma and was placed on life support, according to a news release from the Monroe County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney's Office. The prosecutor's office identified the victim as Chen; the college gave his first name as Chun. Authorities learned that more than 30 members of the fraternity Pi Delta Psi had traveled to the Pocono Mountains, roughly 90 miles away from New York City, for the weekend. In the early morning hours, Deng, one of four pledges to the fraternity, was injured ""while partaking in a ritual"" in the yard of the residence where they were staying, according to the release. Authorities did not say what the fraternity ritual entailed. In a statement Wednesday, Baruch College said preliminary reports indicate Deng died while participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event that the college had no knowledge of. Baruch College has a ""zero tolerance policy regarding hazing,"" according to the statement. Deng's death is a ""deeply painful reminder that no individual should ever be put into a position where his or her personal safety is in jeopardy,"" the statement said. Along with its own internal review, Baruch is cooperating with law enforcement, the statement said. After Deng suffered the traumatic head injury, he was brought inside the residence and was unresponsive. Members of the fraternity later drove him to the emergency room, according to the district attorney's office. Deng died of his injuries Monday morning. An investigation is continuing, according to authorities. CNN's calls to Pi Delta Psi Fraternity, Inc., for comment were not immediately returned.","Baruch College freshman arrived at hospital after suffering major brain trauma .

"(CNN) -- Most issues in Hoboken, New Jersey, ultimately boil down to real estate. So it's no surprise to the residents of the small city that the dustup between their mayor and Gov. Chris Christie's administration centers around three square blocks in the north end of Hoboken. With multimillion-dollar high-rise views of the New York City skyline, beautifully restored 19th century townhouses on quiet side streets, and trendy restaurants, bars and boutiques along the main drag, real estate is a prime commodity in the city that gave us Frank Sinatra and the reality television show ""Cake Boss."" Hoboken mayor: 'It's true' Christie administration withheld Sandy funds . The Rockefeller Group, a major real estate holding company in the United States, wants to add to that landscape with a mixed-use development. Among the proposed apartment buildings and commercial spaces is a 40-story tower. It would be the city's tallest structure. The company best known for building Rockefeller Center in New York has been in talks with city officials since 2008 to develop the three blocks it owns in a mostly industrial section of Hoboken, but the economic recession slowed the project. Then, flooding from Superstorm Sandy left 80% of Hoboken under water. The approval process for the project slowed even more as city leaders explored ways to mitigate flooding in the future. Mayor Dawn Zimmer favors a plan that would divert water from the Hudson River into a new green belt around the city. The plans for that green belt skirt the Rockefeller Group's coveted development site. Zimmer said she isn't opposed to developing those three blocks. But she has concerns about congestion and a strain on public services in the fourth most densely packed city in the United States. ""My No. 1 priority is to do what's right for Hoboken,"" Zimmer said CNN's State of the Union with Candy Crowley. ""We have severe needs and we have to look at this comprehensively."" At the center of the controversy is Zimmer's claim that two members of Christie's administration made it clear to her that Sandy recovery funds distributed by his office would be contingent on her approval of the Rockefeller Group's development project. Christie's office, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and New Jersey Commissioner of Community Affairs Richard Constable have said that the allegations are categorically false. They called them a total fabrication. The real estate company denied any knowledge of a quid pro quo relating to its project. A statement from the Rockefeller Group said: ""We have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If it turns out to be true, it would be deplorable.""

"(CNN) -- Look to the heavens along the East Coast on Tuesday night, and you might be able to see the Air Force blast 29 satellites into orbit at once. The 29 satellites, the most ever launched at one time, will be aboard a single Minotaur I rocket scheduled to lift off from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia at 7:30 p.m. They include the main payload, the Air Force's Space Test Program Satellite-3, and 28 tiny satellites called CubeSats. The CubeSats are aptly named. Also called nanosatellites, they are small cubes, about 4 inches on each side, weighing about 3 pounds and with a volume of about a quart. Among the CubeSats is the TJ3Sat, built by the students of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia. It will be the first satellite made by high-schoolers to go into space.

"(EW.com ) -- It's an old accusation, but one that shows no signs of disappearing anytime soon: the Motion Picture Association of America is disproportionately stricter about profanity and sex than it is about violence. Relatively gruesome studio films like The Hunger Games or The Dark Knight Rises frequently win PG-13 ratings; relatively gentle films like Philomena, by contrast, are slammed with a much more restrictive R rating — initially, at least — simply for dropping one too many F-bombs. And then there's the MPAA's historically fraught relationship with gay and lesbian content, which often seems to be treated more harshly than heterosexual relations. The latest apparent victim of this unspoken rule: G.B.F., a new teen comedy about the hottest girl in school (Sasha Pieterse) and her gay best friend (Michael J. Willett). EW: Will the MPAA ever get the ratings right? ""I always thought of G.B.F. as a PG-13 movie,"" the film's director, Darren Stein, wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday. Unfortunately, he continued, ""we were given an R 'For Sexual References' while not having a single F-bomb, hint of nudity or violence in the film. Perhaps the ratings box should more accurately read 'For Homosexual References' or 'Too Many Scenes of Gay Teens Kissing.' ""I look forward to a world where queer teens can express their humor and desire in a sweet, fun teen film that doesn't get tagged with a cautionary R,"" Stein concluded. EW: 'Philomena' vs. the MPAA: Adam Sandler could be collateral damage . Clearly, G.B.F.'s team is very disappointed with the MPAA's decision.

""It's so silly when you really think about the MPAA in terms of how every 13-year-old in the country has seen hardcore pornography in this age of the Internet, and yet they can't go to a movie theater and see a movie like G.B.F.

"Acapulco, Mexico (CNN) -- A pack of masked and hooded gunmen broke into a beach bungalow on the outskirts of Acapulco and raped six women tourists after tying up a group of men with cell phone cables and bikini straps, officials said Tuesday. Another woman, also in the rented home, was spared in the 2 a.m. Monday morning attack just east of the troubled Mexican resort city, where a spate of recent violence has tarnished the reputation of what was once a top spring break destination. The victims -- Spanish nationals, ranging in age from 20 to 34 --  are now under the protection of Mexican authorities. Acapulco Mayor Luis Walton condemned the attack during a Tuesday news conference and vowed to apprehend those responsible as world attention homed in on Pacific port city. ""It's a very delicate situation,"" he said. ""We are going to have the full weight of the law against those responsible."" He called it regrettable, apologized for the gunmen's attack and said it would probably affect the image of Acapulco, which derives much of its revenue from tourism. ""We know that it's very unfortunate what has happened, but it happens anywhere in the world,"" said Walton. The mayor later apologized for his comment, saying he ""very much regrets the misinterpretation of his words, which were never meant to harm the victims, nor minimize the facts."" State prosecutor Martha Elba Garzon said her office would not reveal the names of the victims or anything related to the probe, but she vowed to uphold the ""responsibility to provide security to tourists and our people."" Military checkpoints have since been set up in an effort to apprehend five men that authorities believe are responsible for the attacks. The men, they say, do not appear to be a part of organized crime. Investigators have also cordoned off the area surrounding the bungalow, located in an open area with limited security in Playa Encantada, as they sift through evidence. Acapulco, in the mountainous state of Guerrero on Mexico's Pacific coast, was thought of as a relatively safe city despite rampant violence in the surrounding region. But a recent uptick in drug-related killings has compounded fiscal troubles brought on by the global financial crisis in the once glamorous Hollywood haunt. Its modern realities now stand in stark contrast to its older self as once a choice destination for America's elite. In 1953, John F. Kennedy took his new wife, Jacqueline, there for their honeymoon. Years later, Frank Sinatra immortalized the Mexican port city in his 1958 album ""Come Fly With Me."" And Elizabeth Taylor tied the knot for the third time in Acapulco when she married producer Mike Todd. But after a series of gruesome murders in Guerrero, American and British authorities have since issued travel warnings. In recent years, the region's drug wars are thought to have impacted the city's tourism sector as rival cartels vie for control of drug routes originating in South America. It is not clear whether Monday's attack was drug-related. And yet the port city has also shown signs of a rebound. Spanish tennis great Rafael Nadal is expected to play at the Acapulco Open later this month, and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim recently promised a series of new investment projects. Hotel occupancy rates inside Acapulco now hover around 65%, according to the city's Municipal Tourism Board. Image problem notwithstanding, Mexico has remained a top tourist destination for decades. It welcomed 20 million Americans in 2010, the latest year for which federal data is available. The city of Acapulco also brought in roughly half a million tourists last year. Most of them were Mexicans, including residents from the capital and Cuernavaca who flocked to beaches a four-hour drive away. But the U.S. State Department said resort city bars, including those in Acapulco, can be ""havens for drug dealers and petty criminals."" The agency said ""resort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the levels of drug-related violence and crime reported in the border region and in areas along major trafficking routes."" Spain's Foreign Ministry also advised travelers that ""while foreign tourists rarely are victims of kidnapping or extortion, they can be victims of assaults and robberies."" It said Guerrero ""should especially be avoided,"" or travelers should proceed with ""extreme caution."" An estimated 107,000 Spaniards live in Mexico. They reside mostly in the capital. CNN's Nick Parker, Laura Reyes Maciel and Salomon Kauffman contributed to this report from Acapulco. Ariel Crespo and Nadia Sanders in Mexico City, Al Goodman in Madrid, and Nick Valencia and Catherine E. Shoichet in Atlanta also contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- Jazz guitarist Jim Hall, who played with the jazz greats of the 20th century and influenced the younger ones, died Tuesday, his family said. He was 83. Hall's seven decades in music covered the evolution of modern jazz, and his role included showing that the guitar could replace the piano, said guitarist Julian Lage. Hall legitimized the guitar as an instrument in jazz and many other styles of music, he said. ""I wouldn't be doing what I am doing if not for him,"" said Lage, 25, who played for several years in Hall's trio. Hall became the first jazz guitarist to be given the National Endowment for the Arts' Jazz Masters award in 2004. ""One of the things that made Jim so special as a player, he had a beautiful sound on the instrument,"" guitarist Russell Malone told CNN on Wednesday. ""He had a really full, nice, round, sweet sound."" Hall died in his sleep of heart failure at his home in New York's Greenwich Village early Tuesday, his wife Jane Hall told CNN. He is also survived by a daughter, Devra Hall, who acted as his manager in recent years. ""There's not a person in the world who doesn't love Jim,"" his wife said. ""He was the kindest person in the world."" ""He was such a lovely human being,"" Malone said. ""I might get a call anytime of the night and it would be Jim Hall at the other end of the phone laughing and telling me how much he loved me."" ""Jim was one of the most generous, kind and funny people I have ever known and those attributes were so woven into his character,"" Lage said. Born in Buffalo, New York, but raised mostly in Cleveland, Ohio, Hall began playing guitar at age 10. After graduating from the Cleveland Institute of Music, he joined the Chico Hamilton Quintet in 1955. Hall toured South America with Ella Fitzgerald in 1960. He joined the Sonny Rollins Quartet in 1961, playing on Rollins' ""The Bridge."" ""The interplay between Rollins' fiery solos and Hall's classic guitar runs made this one of jazz's most essential recordings,"" the National Endowments for the Arts biography of Hall said. ""It was an electric guitar, but the natural acoustic qualities of the guitar were never lost,"" Malone said. ""It's the first thing that people hear. His sound was so appealing it made you want to listen to what he was saying musically."" ""He didn't play a whole lot of notes, but he always figured a way to play the notes that counted and they always meant something,"" Malone said. ""Nothing was ever wasted.""

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria is second only to South Africa as the country with the highest number of HIV/AIDS sufferers; one would have thought a better gift for the New Year from the government to its people would be to urge the national legislature to pass the anti HIV-discrimination bill that has been with them for a while. But alas, what the people received was a bill that further exposes them to violence and discrimination. While the signing of the bill has generated much reaction on both sides, most of its supporters have based their arguments on religion and African values, forgetting that what binds the nation together is not the divergence of religions but the respect for humanity that is enshrined in the 1999 constitution. What the same-sex marriage (prohibition) bill in fact does is negate the principle of fundamental human rights of association, expression and dignity. When a law does this, it runs the risk of breeding anarchy, an experience that people who are or are merely perceived to be gay know all too much about in the form of blackmail, extortion and fear of arrest. The law also acts against the principle of public health. With rates of HIV infection and AIDS running at 3.7% for the general population, and 17.2% among gay men, criminalizing organizations providing intervention for this population puts all Nigerians in jeopardy. Another thing to note is about the public perception of the law: while many perceive there's casual acceptance by many Nigerians of the bill, in fact many of those who have commented on the bill have not even read it. Aside from the fact that sections of this law are in direct violation of our fundamental human rights -- freedom of expression and assembly, freedom to have a private and family life -- and set back the provision of healthcare services, they effectively signify that it is open season to attack the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and mainstream society in general. Already 10 people have been arrested for their perceived sexual orientation by law enforcement agencies across Nigeria, a human rights group said. The witch hunt to arrest many more by forcing names out of those arrested is also gathering momentum. The disturbing factor here is on what basis these individuals were arrested; we believe most have been detained due to anonymous tips that are inaccurate in most cases. Many more of these violations of human rights will take place if this law is not repealed; blackmail and extortion will become commonplace against LGBT people and the Nigerians at large and little will be done to ensure that organizations providing healthcare service for this population are able to carry out their work in responding to the HIV/AIDs epidemic in the country. We therefore implore the Nigerian President and his good government to repeal this law, which, we fear, could blow into an unbearable catastrophe for Nigeria and its citizens.

"(CNN) -- With Thursday's debut of ""The Sound of Music Live!,"" NBC just might resurrect the live musical broadcast. In the 1950s, such productions were big television events, with viewers tuning in to see the likes of Julie Andrews performing in an enactment of ""Cinderella,"" which CBS aired in 1957. Yet more than half a century has passed without any major broadcast network daring to mount a full-scale musical on live TV -- until NBC decided to embrace the challenge. The result is a three-hour primetime production called ""The Sound of Music Live!,"" a TV revival of the beloved story that originally graced the stage. Country megastar Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer of ""True Blood"" have been cast in the iconic roles of Maria and Captain Von Trapp, and more than 600 kids came out to open casting calls for the Von Trapp children. The seven that were chosen committed to intense rehearsals that lasted for weeks prior to the massive television event, which airs December 5 at 8/7 Central. ""We've all worked so hard, we all just want to do the best we can and contribute to this legacy that is 'The Sound of Music,' "" Underwood said in NBC's behind-the-scenes special, ""The Making of The Sound of Music Live!"" NBC says the production will ""retell the story for a whole new generation,"" and CNN's senior media correspondent Brian Stelter agrees that it may resonate with younger viewers. ""Even in this age of Netflix where everything's available on demand, I would love to know how many people out there haven't (seen the movie),"" Stelter said. ""I have a feeling those younger people in NBC's audience that haven't seen it yet will discover it for the first time."" ""The Sound of Music"" originally reached Broadway audiences in 1959, followed by the popular 1965 film starring Julie Andrews. Andrews recently said on ""Larry King Now"" that she stands behind Underwood, although she can relate to the mounting pressure. ""A live broadcast! My God, poor lady!"" Andrews said. Live television is always a gamble because, simply put, anything can happen. ""The idea of doing it live is what's daring about it,"" said New York Times media reporter Bill Carter. ""They could have taped another version of this, but doing it live gives it a little frisson of excitement. What happens if the thing kind of goes wrong, you know? Now it's like seeing a Broadway show, staged, but they're only doing it once."" Stelter said NBC is banking on this element of surprise to bring in the ratings. ""One of the reasons why viewers will tune in is to see if the microphones work, to see if everybody's ready, to see if all the sets are functioning,"" he said. ""That kind of curiosity might help NBC."" Yet ""The Sound of Music Live!"" is up against competitive Thursday night programming, and NBC's challenge is to get people to tune in as the production unfolds rather than setting DVRs or using Hulu to watch the special later. Nonetheless, Stelter believes it's probably an experiment worth trying for the Peacock network. ""If it gets a lot of audience, they can go and do this again,"" Stelter said. ""Of course in television, when something doesn't seem to succeed, everybody else gets afraid of doing it. So the worst scenario here is that it bombs and nobody else tries this again. Because I have a feeling if you try this a few times, one of them would breakthrough."" The Twittersphere and ratings numbers will reveal the success of ""The Sound of Music Live!"" In the meantime, the cast is relying on the massive scale of production and their six weeks of grinding rehearsals to prepare for Thursday's big show. ""We all know that coming up is this massive live performance that we can all be terrified about then,"" Moyer said in NBC's ""The Making of Sound of Music Live!"" ""Our first preview is our press night and our final night! There is going to be a moment where, you know, once you've said the lines they're gone forever.""","NBC faces a challenge with a live primetime production of ""The Sound of Music""

"(CNN) -- German President Joachim Gauck will not represent his country at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, his office says. The announcement makes Gauck, a former pastor, the first major political figure to boycott the games, which will be held at the Black Sea resort in February. According to a report in the German publication Der Spiegel, Gauck made the decision in protest against human rights violations and the harassment of Russian opposition political figures. The magazine said the Russian government was informed of his decision last week. But Gauck's office is downplaying the report . ""He simply decided not to go,"" his spokesman Tobias Scheufele told CNN. ""We're not saying anything about his motivations."" Scheufele said Germany hasn't heard anything from Russia about Gauck's decision. Russia's Presidential Press Service said there was no immediate official reaction to the report. Germany's presidency is largely ceremonial; Chancellor Angela Merkel oversees the government. Some athletes have spoken out against Russia's new ""propaganda"" law that bans even discussion of homosexuality anywhere that children might hear it. The legislation, which President Vladimir Putin signed in June, gives authorities the power to impose fines as well as detain and deport foreigners who are deemed to have breached the law. Sochi 2014: Gay athlete promises openly defiant stance at Games . Some artists and activists have called for a boycott of the Sochi games, which run from February 7 to 23. ""I don't think that we should be going to the Olympics at all,"" Lady Gaga said last week during an interview on the British television show ""Alan Carr: Chatty Man."" ""I just think it is absolutely wrong for so many countries to send money and economy in the way of a country that doesn't support gays."" In August, British actor and writer Stephen Fry wrote an open letter to the International Olympic Committee and British Prime Minister David Cameron saying: ""An absolute ban on the Russian Winter Olympics of 2014 on Sochi is simply essential. ""Stage them elsewhere in Utah, Lillehammer, anywhere you like. At all costs Putin cannot be seen to have the approval of the civilized world,"" he wrote in the letter posted on his website. Putin said in an interview on state television in September that gay people would not be discriminated against at the Sochi games. But that appeared at odds with statements made by government officials that the anti-gay propaganda law would be enforced. Putin also later said everyone would be welcomed to the Winter Olympics in Russia, regardless of sexual orientation, state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. The IOC in August said it received assurances ""from the highest level of government in Russia"" that the law would not affect people attending or taking part in the Games. The next month, the IOC said the law did not violate the Olympic Charter. U.S. President Barack Obama rejected calls for the United States to boycott the Games, saying such a move would hurt American athletes who trained and sacrificed to qualify. Earlier this year, Sen. Lindsey Graham suggested a possible boycott of the Olympics if Putin allowed NSA leaker Edward Snowden to remain in his country and if Putin continued supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- When 23-year-old magazine editor Liu Xinda looked to make his first investment in 2012, he considered the stock market. Many Chinese investors have jumped on the skyrocketing property market, but it was too rich for Liu's blood. Instead he decided to invest in bitcoin. ""I believed in bitcoin as a more secure way to store the value than renminbi,"" Liu said, referring to China's currency. ""I trusted in its mechanisms."" Liu's trust paid off -- he purchased bitcoin when it was trading at 60 yuan (U.S.$9.85) on the Chinese market and sold when it was trading at 700 yuan ($115) in June. Last week, bitcoin was trading at 7,000 yuan ($1,149). With bitcoin now reaching prices equivalent to an ounce of gold, more investors are turning toward the digital currency for a return on investment. And Chinese investors seeking similar investment success like Liu are feeding the bitcoin frenzy. More than a third of the world's bitcoin transactions now flow through China's largest bitcoin trading website BTC China, according to bitcoin data websites. China has surpassed Japan's Mt.Gox and Europe's BitStamp, reaching 100,000 Bitcoins in daily trading volumes, or more than 400 million yuan (U.S.$65.7 million) in daily transactions. Infographic: What is bitcoin? ""We think it's because bitcoin presents itself as a new asset class, albeit digital in nature. And given China is a country with strong practice of savings,"" Bobby Lee, CEO and co-founder of BTC China, told CNN. ""It is quite understandable that the Chinese would want to explore bitcoins as yet another potential asset class for investing some of their savings."" In recent years China has been pushing to internationalize the yuan, adding more value to the once tightly controlled currency on international markets. But despite the changes, controls mean individuals still find it difficult to invest in assets outside China. As a result, more Chinese are looking to invest in alternative assets like bitcoin. Trading in the digital currency has been extremely volatile. Early in November the currency rose to what was then an all-time high of $900 earlier, only to fall back to $500 in the span of 28 hours. By last Friday, it was trading as high as $1,242. Bitcoin worth almost as much as gold . ""Chinese interest could play a huge role in turning bitcoin into the first trillion dollar non-fiat currency,"" Stan Stalnaker -- founding director of Hub Culture and the Ven, an asset-backed Internet reserve currency -- recently wrote in a CNNMoney opinion piece. ""Ironically, it is the United States, the 'free market' financial heavyweight in the world, that finds itself moving slowly to figure out how to adopt bitcoin,"" he wrote. ""Meanwhile, China is proving to be a leading player in this 21st century currency."" However, digital currencies are not officially recognized as legitimate in China. In 2009, the government restricted the use of QQ coin, a popular virtual currency created by tech tycoon Tencent, to only virtual products. Now Bitcoin faces a similar move. China's central bank warned late on Thursday that Bitcoin carries substantial risks and issued new rules to prohibit financial institutions from dealing in the digital currency. Ron Paul: Bitcoin could 'destroy the dollar' Under the new regulation, financial institutions in China are banned from trading, underwriting or offering insurance in bitcoin. In addition, websites in China that provide trading services are required to report investors' identities to regulators and take steps to prohibit money laundering. Following the central bank's announcement, the bitcoin price on the Chinese market shrunk by more than 20% and is still in decline. While the central bank did not outlaw or prohibit individuals from owning bitcoin, the guidelines specify that it is not to be considered a currency. With his past gains, Liu is happy to besitting out the current bitcoin boom and bust. ""The ongoing trend is nothing more than a hype to attract geeks,"" he said. ""It's still very hard to spend. And I'm not investing more in bitcoin until I can use it to buy things from Taobao and Amazon."" ""These are speculators that don't have faith in Bitcoin's value. They'll bailout from the market immediately after they suffer a deficit,"" he added.","NEW: Chinese authorities crack down on bitcoin .

"(CNN) -- He's invented breathable food, flavor clouds and olfactory telephones. Now David Edwards is bringing edible food-packaging to the table. Called Wikipearl, the wrapping is held together by calcium ions and can include particles of chocolate, nuts and seeds. The idea came out of a conversation Edwards, professor of biomedical engineering at Harvard, had with a sculptor about the concept of tensegrity. ""It's a really interesting property and relevant in terms of rethinking our packaging,"" he says. ""Suddenly packaging becomes part of the culinary experience."" Wikipearl ice cream and yoghurt were launched in selected Paris stores last June. Read this: The solar-powered watercrafts of the future . Edwards began as a biomedical engineer in universities including MIT and Penn State. He left the latter in 1998 after he came up with the idea for inhalable insulin and was approached by Polaris Venture Partners to start a company, Advanced Inhalation Research, with three friends from MIT. It was sold in 1999 to biopharma company Alkermes. After three more years in academia at Harvard, Edwards left in 2005 for a sabbatical in Paris.

"(CNN) -- Big banks have found few political friends in recent years. Excoriated by President Barack Obama and progressive Democrats like Elizabeth Warren for their ""greedy"" policies, rejected by Tea Party conservatives for being too cozy with Washington, and even seemingly scolded by Pope Francis in his Evangelii Gaudium last month, it's almost as if Wall Street has been sent to the woodshed. And after the 2012 presidential election, it's not hard to understand why no one wants to appear too comfortable with the ""plutocracy."" Many have argued that Mitt Romney's Bain Capital pedigree and his comments at the Boca Raton, Florida, home of private equity manager Marc Leder about the ""47%"" helped tank his campaign. Fate sealed: Romney-the-plutocrat was cooked. But perhaps the big banks have found an unlikely new ally: Hillary Clinton. An article in Politico Magazine this week, one that elicited little response from Democrats, recounted Clinton's recent remarks to Goldman Sachs executives and a few hundred major investors, seemingly to reassure them that she didn't think the banks were all bad. According to the story (ironically headlined, ""Lament of the Plutocrats""): . ""...Clinton offered a message that the collected plutocrats found reassuring, according to accounts offered by several attendees, declaring that the banker-bashing so popular within both political parties was unproductive and indeed foolish. Striking a soothing note on the global financial crisis, she told the audience, in effect: We all got into this mess together, and we're all going to have to work together to get out of it. What the bankers heard her to say was just what they would hope for from a prospective presidential candidate: Beating up the finance industry isn't going to improve the economy -- it needs to stop. And indeed Goldman's Tim O'Neill, who heads the bank's asset management business, introduced Clinton by saying how courageous she was for speaking at the bank. (Brave, perhaps, but also well-compensated: Clinton's minimum fee for paid remarks is $200,000)."" It's hard to imagine how this will square with Obama's renewed progressive, middle-class agenda for Democrats. According to the White House, raising the minimum wage and lessening income inequality will be major parts of Obama's 2014 domestic plan -- as well as his State of the Union address and budget. More problematic is how Hillary Clinton's bighearted rhetoric toward Wall Street will accord with Democrats generally. You don't have to go to Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts or Bill de Blasio in Manhattan; it isn't hard to find a Democrat, be they union machinist, single mom, or Wal-Mart cashier, who wants to punish the banks and weaken their influence in politics and everything else we do. Hardest of all to figure is how this will square with Clinton herself. Since leaving the State Department, she's made concerted (and some would argue necessary) efforts at rebranding herself as more progressive, speaking on voting rights, women's issues, and gay rights. In a recent New Republic piece by Noam Scheiber titled ""Hillary's Nightmare? A Democratic Party that Realizes its Soul Lies with Elizabeth Warren,"" the writer describes Clinton's hard left turn this way: ""she recently used the word 'progressive' so many times in a single speech it was tempting to describe her condition as 'severe.'"" Indeed, is Clinton in danger of becoming the next Mitt Romney? Heir(ess) to the throne, the natural front-runner, but out of touch with ""the little people,"" stuck in the rhetoric -- and passÃ© politicking -- of the 1990s? I talked to several Democratic strategists who were incredulous that Clinton cozied up to the bankers, and wondered how long it would take for progressive groups -- or Republicans -- to jump on it. Her bizarre tryst with Goldman and friends, and her nurturing message to them, doesn't only put her to the right of progressive superstars like Warren and DeBlasio -- and to the right of Obama, and to the right of most Democratic voters -- but also to the right of many anti-bank, populist conservatives. That's tough -- and odd -- territory for Hillary Clinton to stake out in the run-up to a presidential election. But will Democrats hold her accountable? Or will she get a pass because she's (sigh) Hillary? Elizabeth Warren, where are you? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S.E. Cupp.","S.E.

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets of Thailand's capital Sunday, some surrounding the home of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, whom they want to oust. An estimated 90,000 protesters were marching in Bangkok, Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, Thailand's national security chief, told CNN. He said that number rose to 150,000 at the peak of the rally in the late afternoon. He earlier said 10,000 had surrounded the premier's home while she tours the northeast provinces. The demonstration there was later disbanded. In a bid to cool tensions, Shinawatra dissolved the nation's parliament earlier this month and called for new elections, to be held on February 2. But the move has done little to appease anti-government protesters, who remained on the streets by the thousands. The main opposition party, the Democrat Party, has said it will boycott the polls. Speaking on one of the main stages set up at the rally, protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban asked demonstrators to surround a sports complex where candidates seeking to put themselves forward for the election will have to register their names. Candidates have from Monday to Friday to do so. Security beefed up . Security at the complex was being stepped up ahead of the start of registration, Paradon said, but he could not give figures. During the weeks of demonstrations, protesters have occupied various government offices. The rallies have been mostly peaceful, but there have also been deadly clashes between protesters and government supporters. Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the older brother of Yingluck. That's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with Thaksin, who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to Thailand's rural heartland. Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas. If he returns, he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction, which he says was politically motivated. The current protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck Shinawatra's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return. That move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother's puppet, an allegation she has repeatedly denied.

"(CNN)  -- William Kamkwamba dreamed of powering his village with the only resource that was freely available to him. William Kamkwamba fits a lightbulb to a house in his village in Malawi. His native Malawi had gone through one of its worst droughts seven years ago, killing thousands. His family and others were surviving on one meal a day. The red soil in his Masitala hometown was parched, leaving his father, a farmer, without any income. But amid all the shortages, one thing was still abundant. Wind. ""I wanted to do something to help and change things,"" he said. ""Then I said to myself, 'If they can make electricity out of wind, I can try, too.'"" Kamkwamba was kicked out of school when he couldn't pay $80 in school fees, and he spent his days at the library, where a book with photographs of windmills caught his eye. ""I thought, this thing exists in this book, it means someone else managed to build this machine,"" he said. Armed with the book, the then-14-year-old taught himself to build windmills. He scoured through junkyards for items, including bicycle parts, plastic pipes, tractor fans and car batteries. For the tower, he collected wood from blue-gum trees. ""Everyone laughed at me when I told them I was building a windmill. They thought I was crazy,"" he said. ""Then I started telling them I was just playing with the parts. That sounded more normal."" That was 2002. Now, he has five windmills, the tallest at 37 feet. He built one at an area school that he used to teach classes on windmill-building. The windmills generate electricity and pump water in his hometown, north of the capital, Lilongwe. Neighbors regularly trek across the dusty footpaths to his house to charge their cellphones. Others stop by to listen to Malawian reggae music blaring from a radio. When he started building the first windmill in 2002, word that he was ""crazy"" spread all over his village. Some people said he was bewitched -- a common description for people with perplexing behavior in some African cultures. ""All of us, even my mother, thought that he had gone mad,"" said his sister Doris Kamkwamba. Villagers would surround him to snicker and point, Kamkwamba said. Ignoring them, he would quietly bolt pieces using a screwdriver made of a heated nail attached to a corncob. The heat -- from both the crowd and the melted, flattened pipes he used as blades -- did not deter him. Three months later, his first windmill churned to life as relief swept over him. As the blades whirled, a bulb attached to the windmill flickered on. ""I wanted to finish it just to prove them wrong,"" he said. ""I knew people would then stop thinking I was crazy."" Kamkwamba, now 22, is a student at the African Leadership Academy, an elite South African school for young leaders. Donors pay for his education. His story has turned him into a globetrotter. Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, an avid advocate of green living, has applauded his work. Kamkwamba is invited to events worldwide to share his experience with entrepreneurs. During a recent trip to Palm Springs, California, he saw a real windmill for the first time -- lofty and majestic -- a far cry from the wobbly, wooden structures that spin in his backyard. Former Associated Press correspondent Bryan Mealer, who covered Africa, wrote a book, ""The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,"" after hearing Kamkwamba's story. The book was released in the United States last week. Mealer, a native of San Antonio, Texas, said he lived with Kamkwamba in his village for months to write the book. The story was a refreshing change after years of covering bloody conflicts in the region, Mealer said. Kamkwamba is part of a generation of Africans who are not waiting for their governments or aid groups to come to their rescue, according to the author. ""They are seizing opportunities and technology, and finding solutions to their own problems,"" Mealer said. ""One of the keys of his success is ... he's never wanted to rest on his laurels.""","Malawi had gone through one of its worst droughts seven years ago .

"(CNN) -- A young man jangles a stack of coins, organizes his passengers like they're shapes in a game of Tetris, then bangs on the side of the colorful bus. We move off, clattering along the noisy, dusty road. The city is Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's biggest and the place President Obama hung out on his July visit to East Africa. The man is the conductor and his bus is a ""dala dala"" -- hordes of which toot and rattle along the key arteries through Dar es Salaam every day. This city is often ignored by travelers heading to Tanzania's big tourist destinations -- it's not hard to see why. ""Dar"" has few obvious attractions and can get hot and sticky. Its streets are filled with traffic, exhaust fumes and dust. Yet it has charm and for anyone willing to experience some ""Bongo flava"" via one of these eccentric buses, the rewards can be great. (""Bongo flava"" is the Tanzanian brand of R&B/hip hop, which originates here in Bongo Town, the local nickname for Dar). More: Can the Maasai survive modernity? Dala for dollar . Dala dala get their name from the slang term for five Tanzanian shillings (""dala"" for dollar), the bus fare in the 1970s and 1980s when these vehicles started operating as a response to poor public transportation. Now a standard trip costs 400 shillings (25 cents), though the fare can be more if you're going a long distance. Dala dalas are an attraction in and of themselves, their bright exteriors painted in set designs and colors that indicate the route. Dala dalas are featured in one of the most popular Tanzanian TV shows, with random people being picked up to discuss issues of the day as they get a ride to work. I spend a day exploring the city via dala dala, invariably slotted into a sweaty squeeze, forehead dangerously close to the metal frame hanging from the roof. Yet however crowded it gets inside, the atmosphere is friendly. When I ask where to get off for Kariakoo market, a fellow passenger offers to escort me there. He turns out to be a fisherman on a day off. Conversation along the way ranges from Tanzania's chances in the football World Cup qualifier against Ivory Coast to the best fishing and diving spots. More: High peaks and wildlife put Tanzania on the tourist map . Kariakoo market variety . Kariakoo market, the largest market in East Africa, is worth the stop. It covers several blocks of shops, stalls and courtyards all set around an imposing indoor market built in the 1970s. Its high vaulted arches provide an odd setting for the small hardware sellers who inhabit it. Downstairs there's a huge basement complex where fruit and vegetable traders dwell in semi-darkness. Above ground Kariakoo is full of color and trade in a huge variety of goods, from farming tools and food to bows and arrows. It's a good spot for sampling Dar's abundant street food -- a combined product of the fertile Tanzanian soil and Indian influences. Options include chipsi mayai (chips/fries in an omelet -- a Tanzanian staple), samosas, chapattis, roasted corn served with chili and lime, mandazi (something like a doughnut), sugarcane and tropical fruits. Drinks include coconut juice straight from the coconut or coffee from one of Dar's renowned mobile street coffee vendors. Dar is a port city, so also a place for seafood. For this it's best to go to source. Fried octopus snacks . A short dala dala ride from Kariakoo, the main fish market assaults the senses; it's full of activity, shouts, smells and a variety of fish and sea creatures. At one end the market, a concrete wall drops down to the natural harbor where fishing boats sit on the white sands or at anchor in the water. At the other end, their haul is cooked up in huge sizzling frying pans. Still chewing some deep-red fried octopus, I board a dala dala moving along the seafront. Although color-coding makes them they look like a single organized collective, dala dalas are private enterprises and feature a range of individual touches representing the owners' tastes and allegiances. The most obvious of these are slogans many carry on the windshield sunshade, ranging from religious (""Allah Akbar,"" ""Jesus Power"") to sporting (""Liverpool Forever"") to cryptic (""New Passion,"" ""Simba Family""). In this sense they're cousins to the jeepneys of the Philippines. The one taking me along Kivukoni front features tassels around its windows and has a sound system playing Bongo Flava. The dala dala travels along the line of distinctive old colonial government buildings built by the Germans in the 1890s and British in the 1920s (well preserved and used by the current Tanzanian government) followed by impressive Catholic and Anglican cathedrals. From here, it's a short hop to the Asian Quarter, Kisutu. This part of town has a different feel to the African Quarter where Kariakoo is located. It's filled with art deco buildings, mosques and Hindu temples and the women are as likely to be wearing an Indian sari as a Tanzanian kanga. The roof terrace of the nearby Sapphire Hotel offers a panoramic view of the city, as well as a good gin and tonic. Looking out at the Dar skyline you can see the jumbled high-rise blocks jutting over the older, squatter buildings. Look harder and you can see the dense slums that house most of the city's population. More: 7 things every first-time Africa traveler should know . Luxury and opulence . The final dala dala ride of the day takes me to Msasani Peninsula, a prime example of the city's recent rapid re-development. Located in the north of the city, beyond the popular hangout of Coco Beach, the once largely uninhabited peninsula is now home to many of Dar's richer inhabitants, including much of the expat community. This is Dar's newest face: marina, luxury apartment blocks, upmarket shopping precinct, restaurants, bars. Many have Maasai security guards standing outside. These members of the famous pastoralist tribe (easily recognizable by their tall, robed frames) have been forced by drought and other factors to leave their traditional lifestyle and move to the towns and cities in search of work. Dar es Salaam is a place of uncomfortable contrasts. Nevertheless, the dala dalas make it a worthwhile stop alongside Tanzania's more obvious attractions. How to catch a dala dala . To catch a dala dala you have to be at, or at least near, a bus stop. There's no timetable; frequency depends on traffic but they generally come around at least every 10 minutes. A standard journey costs 400 shillings (25 cents). The conductor will let you know if you need to pay more. The main dala dala stops in downtown Dar are Posta (center), Fire (west center -- next to the Fire Station near Kariakoo) and Kivukoni (east center, covering the fish market and waterfront). Dala dalas for Kivukoni are painted green. Ask where you should get off for the fish market. Lots of buses go past Kiriakoo. For Msasani Peninsula, get a bus going to Msasani (dark blue), or one going to Mwenge (light blue), get off at Mbuyuni and walk. Dala dalas heading for Mwenge go past the Mwenge carvers market and the village museum.

"(CNN) -- Up and down the East Coast, residents and naturalists alike have been scratching their heads this autumn over a simple question: Where are all the acorns? Some scientists fear a mysterious shortage of acorns this fall in the eastern U.S. will affect squirrels. Oak trees have shed their leaves, but the usual carpet of acorns is not crunching underfoot. In far-flung pockets of northern Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and other states, scientists have found no acorns whatsoever. ""I can't think of any other year like this,"" said Alonso Abugattas, director of the Long Branch Nature Center in Arlington, Virginia. Louise Garris, who lives in the Oakcrest neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia, first noticed the mysterious phenomenon early this fall when doing yardwork beneath a canopy of large oak trees. ""I have lived in the area my entire life and have never not seen any acorns!"" she said. Garris checked with some local plant nurseries and they confirmed her observation. The mystery has found its way to the Internet, where a ""No acorns this year"" discussion on Topix.com yielded more than 180 comments from people reporting acorn disappearances as far away as Connecticut and North Carolina. ""WHAT IS GOING ON?"" posted a resident of Maplewood, New Jersey. ""Now we are finding dead squirrels! SHOULD WE ALL BE CONCERNED?"" Not necessarily, naturalists say. Last year Garris reported a bumper crop of acorns, which scientists say may be one clue to this year's scarcity. Virginia extension agent Adam Downing said acorn production runs in cycles, so a lean year is normal after a year with a big crop. ""It fits with the physiology of seed reproduction. The trees are exhausted, energy wise, from last year,"" Downing said. But even he is surprised at the complete absence of nuts in parts of Virginia. ""There are plenty of acorns in most of the state, but zero acorns in some pockets,"" he said. Downing said recovery from last year's big crop, combined with a much wetter-than-usual spring, probably accounts for the acorn absence. Meteorologists say the Washington-Baltimore area saw about twice as much precipitation last May as normal. Kate McNamee, who runs a Washington-area, volunteer tree-planting project called ""Growing Native,"" lends specific numbers to the acorn shortage. Her group collects hardwood seeds and plants trees to protect rivers and streams in the Potomac River watershed. ""Last year we collected 25,000 pounds of seeds, most from a bumper crop of acorns,"" said McNamee. ""This year we only collected 10,000 pounds, and 90 percent of that was walnuts."" Even though this acorn shortage has not risen to the level of a crisis, scientists say it is important to watch closely. If the shortage continues for several years, other forces might be at work. iReport.com: Skillful squirrel raids bird feeder . Garris said her observations got her thinking about other recent environmental issues. ""I had read about the collapse of the bee colonies, and it made me wonder, is something else going on here? Could this be affecting other systems?"" At the Long Branch Nature Center, calls and e-mails have been pouring in from people who want to donate acorns they've gathered in areas where they are plentiful. It's also hard to think of acorns without thinking about squirrels. What happens to them when their favorite food disappears? Some Eastern Seaboard residents have reported seeing skinny, aggressive squirrels devouring bird feed. ""Especially in the depths of winter, there's not much else for the squirrels to eat. Some may switch their diet, many others probably won't make it,"" said Abugattas. ""Squirrel and deer numbers will almost certainly go down."" But Doug Inkley, senior scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, said that wild animals can be resilient when their usual food sources go away. Inkley cited a blight that destroyed 3.5 billion American chestnuts from 1900-1940, wiping out a common food source for squirrels, deer, mice and wild turkeys. But those animals adapted and survived, he said. Barbara Prescott, a wildlife rehabilitation expert, agreed that squirrels are not fussy about their diet. She suggested that residents leave whole (not crushed) corn, peanuts and sunflowers in the seed as backyard treats. John Rohm, wildlife biologist for Prince William, Loudoun, Fairfax, and Arlington counties in northern Virginia, has faith in the furry population. ""Animals are resourceful,"" he said. ""If they're hungry, they're gonna find something to eat."" CNN.com's Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.","Naturalists are baffled this fall by a shortage of acorns in the eastern U.S.

"(CNN) -- A 57-year-old Washington man fishing from a kayak off a Hawaiian island has died after being bitten by a shark, authorities said. The man was identified by Maui police as Patrick Briney of Stevenson, Washington, about 45 miles east of Portland, Oregon. The attack took place Monday morning half a mile off a point near Little Beach in Makena State Recreation Area on the island of Maui, the Department of Land and Natural Resources said. The victim's companion, who was also on a kayak, told the department that his friend was fishing for baitfish with artificial lures when a shark bit one of his feet, which was dangling over the edge of the boat. Swimmer killed in shark attack at New Zealand beach . The man's companion, who was about 500 yards away when the attack took place, paddled over to him, tied a tourniquet to try to stem severe bleeding and called on a tour boat in the vicinity for help, authorities said. The tour boat brought the man to shore, and he was taken to a hospital. But authorities believe he died of his injuries during the boat journey, said Rod Antone of the Maui County mayor's office. Shark attack claims Brazilian teen's life . High number of shark incidents . ""We offer our condolences to the family of the victim. Our thoughts and prayers are with them,"" said William J.

Beaches in the area remain open, but the Natural Resources Department said people are advised to stay out of the water. The area will reopen at noon Tuesday if no more sharks are seen in the vicinity, the department said. Shark attacks teen in waist-deep water . The attack is the 13th shark incident reported in Hawaii this year, and the eighth on Maui, authorities said. That's well above the state's average of four unprovoked shark attacks per year over the past 20 years. The 10 incidents reported in 2012 were unprecedented at the time, the Natural Resources Department said. ""We are not sure why these bites are occurring more frequently than normal, especially around Maui,"" Aila said. ""That's why we are conducting a two-year study of shark behavior around Maui that may give us better insights."" Aila said authorities hope and expect ""that numbers of incidents will return to a more normal range in the near future.""

"(CNN) -- A social media thread proved strong enough to pull a New Jersey teenager back from possible suicide, according to authorities. And it was a social networking first for officers from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department -- using Facebook and other outlets this week to track down and help a troubled 18-year-old whose three-word online posting seemed to say suicide. ""Thinking of jumping,"" the teenager posted to his Facebook profile, alongside a photo of the George Washington Bridge spanning the Hudson River. A concerned Facebook friend who saw the post contacted police in Paterson, New Jersey, alerting authorities to the apparent suicide threat, according to Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo. The alert was just the beginning. Pentangelo gave this scenario of events: . Paterson police called Port Authority officers, who serve the major bridges and tunnels of New York and New Jersey. A photo of the young man was downloaded from his Facebook page and distributed to officers searching the bridge -- unsuccessfully -- for the teen among the bridge's pedestrians. An officer assigned to Port Authority police's emergency services, Lt. Thomas Michaels, set out to contact the young man through Facebook, leaving his cell phone number on the page and urging the teen to call him. And Port Authority Sgt. Nadine Rhem also took to Facebook, sending more offers of support and assistance. Other Facebook friends of the young man saw what was happening and sent messages of their own on the social networking site, urging the teen to call Michaels. Within a matter of hours, Pentangelo said, Michaels received a phone call. It was the young man. He told Michaels he was on a bus in Patterson, and Michaels insisted they meet in person to talk. After the officer and the teen met and talked, Pentangelo said, the teen volunteered to be taken to a local hospital for help. While Port Authority police have used social media before to investigate threats and gather information, Pentangelo said, this was the first time social media was used to reach out. And a potential suicide subject reached back.","A New Jersey teen posts on Facebook a bridge photo and ""Thinking of jumping""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. military, facing continuing protests over drone strikes, has halted military cargo shipments from Afghanistan, citing a potential risk to drivers and contractors along the route once it enters Pakistan. ""We are aware protests have affected one of the primary commercial transit routes between Pakistan and Afghanistan. We have voluntarily halted U.S. shipments,"" Defense Department spokesman Mark Wright said. Halted operations through the Torkham Gate border crossing impacts more than half of all military shipments out of the war zone each month as American involvement in the war winds down. On average, the United States ships about 33,000 tons of cargo out of Afghanistan each month. The action was taken to stop shipments along the route from the border crossing to Karachi ""to ensure the safety of the drivers contracted to move our equipment. We anticipate that we will be able to resume our shipments through this route in the near future,"" Wright said. If the crossing does not re-open, shipments out of Afghanistan could be made by air, or longer land routes to the north, but both would be more costly in the long run. There is no indication what specific cost would be involved or how long the stoppage could last. The decision also comes as the United States is trying to get Afghanistan to sign an agreement to keep some U.S. troops in the country after 2014. But the majority of the gear for the 47,000 troops still in Afghanistan will have to be brought out.","U.S. cites risk to drivers and contractors along route to Pakistan .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has expressed ""regret"" over South Korea's decision to expand its air defense zone to include an area claimed by both countries, the country's official Xinhua news agency has reported. South Korea's move came after China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea last month. The Chinese zone covers a disputed reef, called the Suyan rock by China and Ieodo by South Korea. China's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said on Monday that the two countries had maintained communication over the zones. ""The Air Defense Identification Zone is not territorial airspace. It is established by a country in public airspace outside its territorial airspace for identification and early-warning. It has nothing to do with maritime and air jurisdiction,"" he said. The expanded South Korean zone will go into effect on December 15. South Korea Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the move was in accordance with international norms. ""The new KADIZ's southern region was adjusted so that it is in line with Incheon Flight Information Region, which is internationally used (recognized) and does not overlap with that of neighboring countries. ""The adjusted region includes airspace over Ieodo waters and Marado and Hongdo islands which is our territory.""

"(CNN) -- Princeton University will make a meningitis B vaccine available to all undergraduate students, graduate students living in dorms or the Graduate College and annexes, and other university community members with particular medical conditions, the school said Tuesday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have officially recommended that these groups of people receive the vaccine, Princeton said. The CDC's Institutional Review Board approved this measure Tuesday afternoon, spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said. The vaccine, which is not licensed for use in the United States, will not be provided to anyone else or given out anywhere else, the school said. Young adults and individuals with certain medical conditions have an increased risk of meningitis, especially when living in close proximity to one another, such as in dormitories, the school said. The vaccine is called Bexsero and is made by Novartis. It has been approved in Europe and Australia. The first dose of the vaccine will be available at the school's Frist Campus Center from December 9 to December 12, and the second dose will be available in February. For maximum protection, individuals must receive two doses. Princeton will cover the cost of the vaccine. The vaccine would be recommended for about 5,000 undergraduates and 550 graduate students in dorms, university spokesman Martin Mbugua had told CNN previously. Additionally, around half a dozen people with conditions that fall under the recommendation would also be affected, although there may be more who have not yet disclosed their conditions, he said. These include conditions where the spleen is compromised, or certain other immune system disorders. The school announced Friday that an eighth case of meningitis B had been reported, the latest in a string of cases reported this year. All eight were caused by a rare meningococcal bacteria known as serotype B. Also last week, the University of California, Santa Barbara, reported that three students were being treated for meningococcal disease and that their cases were caused by type B bacteria -- the same bacteria strain causing the Princeton outbreak. However, no link has been found between the California cases and those at Princeton, the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department said. New Jersey state law requires all students at Princeton living in dormitories to receive a different meningitis vaccine, which is licensed in the United States. That vaccine protects against some other strains, but not serotype B bacteria. Any Princeton student who received the usual meningitis vaccine would not not be protected, Princeton said. What is meningitis B? Meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. Infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation, according to the CDC. Meningitis usually develops in response to bacteria or viruses, but there can be other forms and causes, such as physical injury, cancer or certain drugs, according to the CDC. The bacterial form is rare in the United States, and the group B bacterial strains are even more rare. Meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing, coughing, sharing drinks and living in close quarters, such as in dormitories, according to the New Jersey state health department. Symptoms can include a stiff neck, headache, fever, vomiting, rashes, sensitivity to light and confusion. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment, brain damage, limb amputations and death. Antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis ""should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly,"" according to the CDC. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States, according to the CDC. Of those, 160 were group B. School activities continue . Several students told CNN that their peers are not overly afraid of getting meningitis, but that it's definitely a topic of conversation. ""I think students do know that it is an important and fatal issue that is spreading on campus -- and each student individually decides to what degree to protect themselves,"" Stephen Cognetta, a junior, said in an e-mail. In Princeton's statement Tuesday, the university said: ""The CDC and state health officials recommend that classes and activities at Princeton University continue as planned, and the surrounding community can continue to attend events on the campus. They do not recommend any travel restrictions for members of the University community."" The university celebrated its football team's victories over Harvard and Yale on Sunday with a bonfire.

"(CNN) -- According to popular wisdom, attempting to reinvent the wheel is the ultimate in design folly. But this didn't stop object designer Duncan Fitzsimmons from giving it a go. When he sat down at his desk to begin work on the Morph Wheel, Fitzsimmons took on the design challenge -- and the results might just turn out to be revolutionary. In both senses of the word. The Morph is a detachable wheelchair wheel that can compress to around half of its original width. It is designed to provide greater flexibility and mobility to the estimated 65 million people around the world who need a wheelchair. The folding wheel was originally created as a folding bicycle wheel by Fitzsimmons when he was a graduate student at the Royal College of Arts in London. But calls from the wheelchair community suggested to him that the design would possibly be more useful to wheelchair users. ""When people say 'is this reinventing the wheel?', that's a phrase that everyone knows,"" Fitzsimmons says, ""but it's really redesigning the wheel to make it just a little bit better. That's really what you're trying to do when you're designing any product."" The main advantage of the Morph, the designer says, is that it can fit into small spaces, allowing wheelchair users greater flexibility when traveling by car, train or airplane. ""This project started out by looking at the problems caused by large wheels if you're looking at folding bicycles, or the space needed for a folding wheelchair,"" says Fitzsimmons. ""Having a small wheel or a large wheel dictates the entire design of the wheelchair and what you can do with it. If you can fold a big wheel up into a smaller space, then suddenly for the first time you can get the best of both worlds. You can have a wheelchair that has all the advantages of having a large wheel, but can also be stored into a much smaller space."" David Constantine co-founder of Motivation, a charity that aims to help people with mobility impairments, says that in his view the Morph wheel could be useful in both developed countries and the developing world. ""I can see all kinds of uses for this,"" says Constantine, ""certainly in the context of the US and more developed countries ... car boots, airplane lockers, any sort of small space you might want to pack a small chair into. ""Not everybody uses a chair every day, so if it has got quick-release wheels and you fold the chair up and you fold these down flat storage is easy for people who don't use a wheelchair all the time. ""In the context I work in developing countries, if it's low-cost enough, people often live in one room with the whole families, so they often want a folding wheelchair just to keep it out of the way when they're either in bed or sat on the floor cooking, and so again, something that packs down as small as this would be extremely useful."" The Morph wheel has received awards around the world, including the transport category at the London Design Museum design of the year awards 2013, and the 2013 Popular Science Best of What's New award in the Health category. Morph Wheels are available online from Maddak. Andrew Stewart and Matthew Ponsford contributed to this article .","London-based designer invents foldable wheel for wheelchair users .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Reggae legend Lucky Dube was remembered Wednesday as a music icon whose death last week in a carjacking robbed South Africa of one of its brightest stars. Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans. About a thousand people packed a memorial service for Dube held at Johannesburg's Bassline Jazz Club. Another thousand watched the service on large screens outside. ""It's a sad moment in my life,"" said one fan outside the music venue. ""To many people, he inspired and uplifted their lives."" Dube, 43, was killed during a carjacking last Thursday as he dropped his children off at a relative's house. He was one of South Africa's most famous musicians and had toured extensively around the world during a 25-year career. His sudden death shocked and saddened the country just as it was preparing to cheer on its rugby team at the World Cup final. Police said Tuesday that five men had been arrested in the case. ""Today we are here to mourn, but we are also here to celebrate an icon,"" said Sipho ""Hotstix"" Mabuse, a fellow South African musician who spoke during the service. He said Dube was ""someone who made us proud as South Africans through his music, his spirituality."" Mabuse was one of a string of speakers -- including Dube's brother, Job Dube -- to pay their respects at the service. Written messages of condolence from musician Peter Gabriel and various African presidents were read aloud and Dube's former bandmates played two reggae songs. A group from Dube's church sat on the floor at the front of the club and occasionally sang and danced. South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked. If there was any anger in the crowd, it wasn't apparent -- though one Rastafarian called for a return of the death penalty for the carjackers. Ivor Haarburger, the chief executive of Gallo Music Group, called Dube's death ""senseless"" and ""disturbing."" ""His great spirit has been taken from us. It is a loss felt by millions of people,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .","South African reggae legend Lucky Dube remembered at a memorial service .

"Chobe National Park, Botswana (CNN) -- There are few places in the world that conjure the same kind of imagery as the Chobe National Park in Botswana. Drifting through the savannas, torrents of water wind-off into a sunlit horizon; cheetahs stalk their prey as flocks of gazelle prance through the long, parched grass; and African elephants traverse hundreds of miles in search of greener pastures and fresh watering holes. Poniso Shamukuni, a professional guide at Botswana's Chobe Park, said the country's environment and wildlife is like no other. ""I enjoy seeing the biodiversity and I enjoy seeing the natural resources,"" he added, ""when tourists are really into it... taking pictures of animals, I also enjoy that."" An oasis of wildlife, located in northern Botswana, Chobe is part of an international conservation region in southern Africa, spanning five countries and nearly 440,000 square kilometers. The Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area -- known as KAZA -- is a partnership between Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Namibia. Read more: Namibia: A wildlife photographer's paradise . Twice the size of the UK and larger than Germany and Austria combined, KAZA is considered the world's largest wildlife preservation. The area draws tourists from all over globe and is also home to Victoria Falls, one of the seven natural wonders of the world, located on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia. To protect the region's natural beauty and attract tourists and investors worldwide, international cooperation between the five countries aims to pool resources to preserve each nation's delicate ecosystem while also opening borders. But visa restrictions mean that traveling between countries is an exasperating and tricky affair for visitors. Read more: Could South Africa's horn sale end rhino slaughter? KAZA program manager Frederick Dipotso said the process is also very expensive, with tourists currently required to apply for visas at border gates. But Dipotso is confident member governments can eventually come to an agreement. He said: ""The KAZA visa is meant to have a one-stop shop where you get your visa and then you can easily travel to Angola ... Namibia, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe."" The organization is now working with Zimbabwe and Zambia on a pilot visa. Dipotso added: ""We expect the pilot to be completed by end of February 2014."" Read more: Kenya implants microchips to fight poaching . An international pact would allow visitors to experience the full extent of Africa's natural wonders. Tourists visiting KAZA can see the continent's ""Big Five"" of leopards, rhinos, buffalo, lions and the world's largest population of African elephants, as well as 650 different species of birds and 160 types of fish. Safari holidaymakers also have the opportunity to spot rare creatures roaming the region's dusty plains, including the black rhino, cheetahs and African wild dogs. Read more: Botswana economy set to sparkle after diamond deal . Shamukuni, who leads expeditions into the park every day, said: ""October and November are the biggest months, that is when we see a lot of tourists coming just before the rainy season."" Covering 36 protected areas, KAZA also plays a vital role in the war against poaching as the organization seeks to engage and employ local communities in return for preserving the wildlife. Dipotso said KAZA has a good chance of being successful in the future because of the area's lack of mineral wealth, meaning few international disputes over territory are likely to arise. He added: ""Currently there are no minerals; minerals sometimes take priority over conservation."" Dipotso said that tourists, predominantly from Europe and Asia, have nothing to fear when it comes to past political turmoil or violence in member KAZA countries, notably in Angola and Zimbabwe. He added: ""Things are quite calm... throughout the KAZA Partner countries; perhaps there has not been proper communication on the stability of the region.""

"(CNN) -- Olli Heinonen, the former deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency recently asserted that Iran having passed the ""point of no return"" in its nuclear weapons program could within two weeks have the ability to enrich enough missile-grade uranium to build a bomb. Yet U.S.-led direct negotiations with Iran broke down in Geneva while the potential remains for the unraveling of sanctions. Israel wants Iran's enrichment of uranium set back by 12 months along with the dismantling of numerous centrifuges. The U.S., however, is willing to set it back by five months. Israel fears the problem with the U.S. timeline is if Iran kicks out inspectors, Washington would not have sufficient time to gear up militarily. At Geneva, Iran opposed suspending work on its plutonium-producing reactor at Arak and downgrade its stockpile of higher-enriched uranium. Israel notes that recently Iran has planned for 34 new nuclear sites to be constructed along the country's Persian Gulf and Caspian coasts. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the head of the Iranian parliament's foreign affairs committee recently asserted that Iran will never agree to dismantle the Fordow uranium enrichment facility. Ilan Berman, the Vice President of the American Foreign Policy Center notes that this was a key concession that officials in the U.S. and Europe had expected Iran to make. GCC countries such as Saudi Arabia and UAE have been able to push back against U.S.-led negotiations with Iran by allowing countries like France to curry favor with them. Thus it is possible that France scuttled the deal on offer in Geneva in order to win energy and military contracts in Saudi Arabia and the UAE at the U.S.'s expense. France has also increased defence ties with Israel. For these reasons there is little chance that Israel and Saudi Arabia will not lobby to derail P5+1 talks when they reconvene in November 20. A skeptic urges: Give Iran talks time . Israel is also concerned that the unraveling of sanctions accompanied with Iran's increased enrichment of uranium will be blamed by the Obama administration on its settlement policy. Secretary Kerry's harsh criticism of Israel's settlement policy is linked to President Obama's original position that the road to Tehran runs through Jerusalem. In an interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, U.S. Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel described one of the main strategic interests of the U.S. in the Middle East as resolving the Israel-Palestinian issue. This is at a time of more than 100,000 people killed in Syria with a mass refugee crisis spilling over the borders threatening the stability and security of Jordan, Turkey, and Iraq. Middle East borders drawn by the Sykes-Picot Accord are disintegrating. Red lines have been crossed in Syria as chemical weapons have been used by the Assad regime which suffers no consequences while subsequently being increasingly reluctant to reveal all its sites or offer access to them to chemical inspectors. Iran could follow suit by avoiding tougher sanctions by appearing to cooperate with the U.S., playing for time while creating and exploiting differences between the U.S. on one hand and Israel and Saudi Arabia on the other. They already did this by backing out of the Geneva point at the last hour. Iran could maintain their core nuclear program making peripheral relinquishments so that they could reconstitute their program and a nuclear weapon in a moment's notice. A Sunni-Shiite war is brewing across the region with the U.S.'s policies ironically emboldening Islamism by supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and its hands-off approach that emboldened jihadists in Syria. At the same time the U.S. is relinquishing its role in the Middle East to Russia much to the consternation of Saudi Arabia and Israel. At a time of austerity leading to the slashing of military budgets and a less than comprehensive foreign policy it is surreal that the Obama administration would seek to focus on imposing a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The U.S. was reluctant to commit troops to Libya or Syria where mass slaughter has been committed, and yet is willing to commit troops to the Jordan valley. Amid austerity, the U.S. has abandoned the promotion of democracy, prevention of humanitarian catastrophe and resisted becoming involved in ""someone else's civil war."" Thus President Obama is incompetent by being unable to prioritize security threats and strategic interests. A senior Israeli defence official told me that the alternative is that President Obama genuinely thinks that the Palestinians and Israel are the problem -- the source of all the region's ills. He revealed his country's national consciousness saying gravely, ""Jews have heard that accusation before but today is different, the state of Israel exists and we refuse to be vulnerable."" US-Israel rift over Iran nukes now in the open . Israel does not see the U.S. as a reliable ally, especially in light of leaks from the White House on targets that the U.S. had of Syria's military instillations and chemical sites giving the Assad regime the time to disperse it into densely populated areas; and more recently on Israel's strike on Hezbollah's weapons shipments giving Hezbollah an excuse to strike back. The combined result is that the U.S.'s allies in the region -- mainly the Gulf and Israel are feeling cornered with the high probability that Israel will feel forced to strike Iran before the Obama administration decides to proceed with independent negotiations with Iran and unilaterally roll back sanctions allowing Iran to become a nuclear threshold state. Saudi Arabia and Israel care more about U.S. sanctions than EU ones; EU and U.N. sanctions hurt Iran less than U.S. ones as even if EU banks don't offer letters of credit to Iran, it is because of the U.S. sanctions. If EU does not buy oil from Iran, Iran will go and sell it to China. Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey will also seek to go nuclear in the event that the U.S. fails to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear status. Former Israeli defence officials that I spoke with that were previously averse to the idea of a military strike on Iran are increasingly warming to it. GCC States and Israel have increased their intelligence sharing to counter an Iranian threat. It was the former that Wikileaks revealed urging President Obama to ""Cut the head of the snake."" The international community including the U.S. and Gulf States will publically denunciate Israel's actions while privately offering a sigh of relief in the same way that it did in the aftermath of Israel's strikes against Saddam Hussein's nuclear facility in Osirak in 1981. It is foolhardy to write off Netanyahu's threats as mere bluster and one has to understand the Israeli psyche. An Iranian bomb would be the death knell for Zionism. Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in the past observed that targeting Israel by the, ""application of an atomic bomb would not leave anything in Israel but the same thing would just produce damages in the Muslim world."" It would be a historical irony if after over half a century of declaring ""Never Again"" and posing as an insurance policy for the physical survival of the Jewish people, Israel become a state ghetto with a concentration of Jewish people becoming vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Israel considers the Geneva talks as contributing to just that.

"(CNN) -- With little notice, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign has been quietly laying the groundwork for an online social network that could be a crucial weapon in his battle to take the White House. Called MyMitt, the platform is tucked away on MittRomney.com, accessible only if you choose to register on the Action page and unadvertised in any proactive way. There's no button pointing to it from the homepage, and the MyMitt Action Center looks like it's only partially finished. Nevertheless, close to 100,000 Romney supporters have created an account on MyMitt, a substantial number at this stage in the race. Here's why this could be a big deal. In 2008, Barack Obama's campaign built its own social network at My.BarackObama.com. Known as myBO for short, the platform made it easy for Obama supporters to create their own profiles on the campaign website, to write their own blog posts, start or join interest groups, organize their own house parties and, most important, initiate and track their own fundraisers. Two million people eventually joined, and 35,000 generated more than $70 million in campaign contributions from their own personal networks. Enabling your supporters to visible share their enthusiasm with each other is a powerful way to grow a political network. Even more useful: The myBO platform also allowed the campaign to figure out which supporters were the most passionate activists and to concentrate attention on these ""super-volunteers"" for a variety of vital tasks. While Obama's re-election campaign brags about getting its millionth individual donor, basks in its 23 million-strong Facebook following and spends millions on building a sophisticated online campaign operation, it might be tempting to write off the Republican presidential candidates as hopelessly behind in the chase for support on the Web. But this doesn't worry Mindy Finn, who ran Romney's online operation in 2008 and this year worked on the now-defunct Tim Pawlenty campaign. She said, ""Don't count out the Republican campaigns in this area yet. Several of the Republican campaigns show promise of going toe-to-toe or besting the Obama operation by the time they would come out of the primary as the nominee."" Right now, MyMitt isn't nearly as robust as MyBO, but the seeds are there. Built on the Drupal content management system by the campaign's own tech team, MyMitt lets supporters make donations, create their own fundraising pages to rally their friends around, purchase official campaign gear or volunteer by making calls from home on behalf of the campaign. On October 15, the campaign held a National Call Day for volunteers to ""share Mitt's pro-growth message and build support."" About 37,000 calls were generated by a couple of thousand volunteers. That may not seem like much compared with the 3 million calls the Obama campaign says its volunteers made between the beginning of July and the end of September. But Zac Moffatt, the campaign's digital director, says the call-day effort showed that the Romney operation is able to activate volunteers from all 50 states. Moffatt, whose firm Targeted Victory rose to prominence running online operations for Republican candidates like Marco Rubio in 2010, is reticent to provide many details about the Romney campaign's plans for MyMitt. ""We want to make it a platform for people to engage with,"" he said. When I suggest that this kind of user-centric toolkit isn't standard operating procedure -- the Rick Perry campaign offers only a personal fundraising page, for example, and Michelle Bachmann makes volunteers fill out an online form and wait to be contacted -- Moffatt demurs. ""Every campaign is going to create a single log-in for their supporters,"" he said. Maybe he's suggesting that MyMitt isn't worth paying attention to. Or perhaps he doesn't want his competition to realize they're in danger of being lapped. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Micah Sifry.","Mitt Romney's new social media platform may be crucial to his presidential campaign .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Cui Shufeng is a retired government worker in Beijing. She is one of the lucky homeowners who bought her place long before the housing sector galloped out of reach for the average Chinese salary worker. ""It is ridiculously high,"" she says pointing to apartments in her neighborhood. ""These homes near the school here are CNY 70,000 (USD$11,400) per square meter. It's not even worth 7000 yuan (USD$ 1140) per square meter because it's not even good quality."" Her concern is on the radar of the central leadership that is expected to discuss economic reforms at the plenary session starting Saturday. For Chinese leaders, the property sector is an emotional and political hot potato. The dream to own a home is a far out of reach for tens of millions of Chinese citizens. In the latest housing data, new home prices for September rose at the fastest pace in almost three years. In Beijing, new home prices were up 16%, Shanghai 17% and Shenzhen 20% from a year ago. ""The problem is Chinese people have very few investment vehicles. They've lost trust in the stock market so they turn to real estate,"" says Xu Si Tao, China Director of the Economist Intelligence Unit. Xu says the central leadership needs to make bold steps in financial reforms to give citizens more options to invest their money. One measure China is considering is to allow banks to set their own interest rates, creating more competition. I was in Beijing two weeks ago and visited a luxury villa compound. It was a large site with tens of dozens of completed but mostly empty villas. A worker in the sales office told me the average home was priced at CNY 23 million (USD$3.8 million) and most were sold. He said half were owner-occupied (though I saw very little sign of residents) and the other half purchased as investments. I was told the supermarket in the center of the compound was open and often used by residents. It was clearly still under construction. When I pointed this out, I was then told the grand opening would be next year. Message: The bubble is alive and growing. These villas are a pretty -- and by most appearances, empty -- place to park money. Cui shakes her head at the dilemma facing the government. She doesn't believe recent curbs will work like a ban on third home loans in Shanghai. ""I don't think home prices will drop sharply because our economy is still doing okay,"" she says. ""Our child bought a home in the U.S. recently. The price was about the same as a flat in Beijing, but the area is a lot bigger and the quality is much better.""","Despite Beijing moves to cool the property market, prices continue to rise .

"(CNN) -- A bride is in mourning. Hours after the wedding, groom William Riley Knight, 49, of Crown Point, Indiana, was run over and killed. His new wife was not injured. They had just left their reception, according to Patti Van Til, a spokeswoman with the Lake County, Indiana, Sheriff's Department. ""She was still in her wedding dress,"" she said. Knight was acting as a good Samaritan on Saturday night when he stopped to assist Linda Darlington, whose vehicle had slid into a ditch along a road in Crown Point. He climbed out to help while his wife waited in the car. He and Darlington, 42, were struck multiple times as they stood by the side of the road. She was also killed. According to CNN affiliate WBBM, which spoke to Knight's ex-wife, he had four children, including two stepchildren. He acted in community theater, was a hunter and reportedly served in the U.S. Army Rangers before retiring in the mid-1990s. ""He was very outgoing, always wanting to help somebody,"" said friend Rob Biella, CNN affiliate WLS reported. ""He was good to be around my kids. I'm glad they got to know him."" All drivers remained on scene, and there is nothing to suggest that alcohol was a factor in the crash, according to Van Til. The accident remains under investigation.

"(CNN) -- The small town of Steubenville became a household name for the wrong reasons, thanks to social media, but when two teenage boys were arrested there, accused of raping a 16-year-old girl, very few people in the Rust Belt town in Ohio were eager to talk. And someone may have tried to cover up for them. An Ohio school official was jailed Monday without bond after being indicted in connection with the case, the Ohio Attorney General's Office said. William Rhinaman, 53, director of technology at Steubenville High School, faces four counts: tampering with evidence, obstructing justice, obstructing official business and perjury in connection with the case, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said. Rhinaman was arrested Monday. If convicted, he could face four years behind bars, more time than the two convicted boys will serve. Details of the indictment, including what kind of evidence was allegedly tampered with, were not immediately available. ""This is the first indictment in an ongoing grand jury investigation,"" DeWine said in a prepared statement. ""Our goal remains to uncover the truth, and our investigation continues."" Convicted teen classified as sex offender . Rape convictions . Authorities said star Steubenville High School football players Ma'lik Richmond and Trenton Mays, who were respectively 16 and 17 at the time, raped the girl during a series of end-of-summer parties in August 2012. Photos and videos of the victim, sent out with lurid text messages, hit social media and attracted the attention of bloggers, who questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the integrity of the investigation. Richmond and Mays were convicted of rape in March after a trial that divided their football-crazed town of less than 20,000 souls. Mays also was found guilty of disseminating a nude photo of a minor. At the heart of the case was the question of whether the victim, who testified that she remembered little, was too drunk to understand what was happening to her and too drunk to consent. Richmond was sentenced to a minimum of one year in a juvenile correctional facility. Mays got two years. Opinion: Steubenville case shows how the rules have changed . Silent town . After the two teenagers were convicted, DeWine revealed that 16 people had refused to talk to investigators. A grand jury would determine whether other crimes had been committed. Rhinaman will be arraigned in Steubenville at the Jefferson County Court House on Wednesday, attorney general's office spokesman Dan Tierney said. Court-appointed counsel will represent him. ""I am aware of the situation, and I will get you a press release on Tuesday, "" Mike McVey, superintendent for Steubenville City Schools, said in an e-mail response. Despite rape case, coach gets contract extension . Bob Fitzsimmons, the family attorney representing the 16-year-old victim who was raped, told CNN that the grand jury's first indictment is a significant first step. ""I think it's important that this shows some fruits from the investigative grand jury and also considers the importance of those responsible for reporting and/or preserving evidence after a crime is committed involving a child, in this case a girl 16 years of age,"" Fitzsimmons said.

"(CNN) -- The recent West Nile virus outbreak is the largest ever seen in the United States, according to new numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of cases so far this year is the highest recorded through August since the disease was first detected in the United States in 1999. As of Tuesday, 38 states had reported human infections. The cases reported to the CDC as of Tuesday total 1,118, including 41 deaths. Arkansas, Michigan and Mississippi have each reported an additional death. ""The peak of West Nile virus epidemics usually occurs in mid-August, but it takes a couple of weeks for people to get sick, go to the doctor and get reported,"" said Dr. Lyle Petersen, the director of the CDC's Vector-Borne Infectious Disease Division. ""Thus we expect many more cases to occur."" Fast facts on West Nile virus . Petersen said that the reason for the high number of cases this year is unclear, but that unusually warm weather could have fostered favorable conditions for the disease's transfer to humans. About 75% of the cases are in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Dakota and Oklahoma. Texas has been at the epicenter of the outbreak, with 586 confirmed cases and 21 deaths, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Here are five things you need to know about West Nile virus: . 1. Most mosquitoes do not carry West Nile. In areas where mosquitoes carry the virus, only about one in 500 mosquitoes is infected, according to the Connecticut Mosquito Management Program. 2. Most people bit by West Nile mosquitoes do not get sick. About 80% of people bit by a mosquito infected with the West Nile virus do not get sick, according to the CDC. About 20% will have relatively mild symptoms, such as fever, headache and vomiting. Symptoms can last for as short as a few days or as long as a few weeks. About one in 150 people infected with West Nile will develop a severe illness, which can include paralysis, coma or death. 3. You can help prevent West Nile with the ""four Ds."" • Use mosquito repellent with DEET . • Dress in long pants and long sleeves . • Be especially careful at dusk and dawn . • Drain any standing water, such as kiddie pools or bird fountains, where mosquitoes like to breed. 4. People over 50 are most vulnerable. Those older than 50 are the most likely to become severely ill with West Nile and should take special care to avoid mosquitoes, according to the CDC. 5. Seek medical care immediately if you have severe headaches or confusion. If you develop symptoms of severe West Nile virus illness, such as unusually severe headaches or confusion, seek medical attention immediately, according to the CDC. Severe illness usually requires hospitalization. Milder cases improve on their own and do not necessarily require medical attention.

"(CNN) -- Sub-Saharan Africa's economic renaissance is fueling an investment drive by fast food joints looking to tap the continent's growing middle class. The likes of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Domino's pizza are opening up in African growth markets from Nigeria to Angola to give consumers a taste of U.S. cuisine. Elias Schulze, managing partner of The Africa Group, a boutique Africa-focused investment consultancy, said U.S. takeout stores are rapidly becoming ""aspirational brands"" for cosmopolitan Africans with disposable income. He said: ""An upwardly mobile, confident, Western-leaning and young consumer class bodes well for an American burger boom."" And the battle for the African market is well underway. This year, Yum! Brands -- owner of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut -- is expanding into Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. The Louisville-based restaurant giant already has outlets in 14 African countries, with more than 700 KFCs in South Africa and plans to open a further 45 stores in 2013. Read this: South Africans thirsty for craft beer . And with growing political and economic stability, Western fast food brands are approaching the region with a renewed sense of optimism, according to Schulze. He said KFC is an established brand on the continent today, adding: ""My general sense is that markets beyond South Africa in sub-Saharan Africa are in the investing phase given their level of infancy and may not have reached a payback point quite yet."" And more big players are beginning to follow suit. In May, Burger King opened for business in South Africa and last year Domino's -- the U.S. pizza chain -- opened its first African store in Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation. With two stores already, Domino's is planning to launch three more African branches by the end of this year. To cater to local tastes, the pizza chain launched a Chicken Jollof pizza -- a rice-based dish popular to West Africa -- and a Suya special, consisting of spicy marinated meat. Charbel Antoun, partner at Eat N Go, which helped launch Domino's in Nigeria, said that adapting the menu to the local culture and food was crucial to the brand's success. He added: ""To compete in the market we have very competitive prices. Ninety-five percent of our customers are Nigerian ... and these are the consumers we're looking to attract."" Read this: African firm invests billions in U.S. Price competitive . However, the cost of Western fast food brands in many parts of Africa relative to wages remains high, excluding many people, who simply cannot afford it. While sub-Saharan Africa is home to some of the world's fastest-growing economies, millions of people are still languishing in extreme poverty. For example, the cost of a KFC meal in Malawi -- including a burger, fries and drink -- is more than $9 but with 50% of the country's population below the World Bank's poverty line, fast food is an unaffordable luxury for most. Across the continent Western brands remain high compared to other parts of the world, according to Schulze. He said the average cost of a KFC meal in Africa is roughly 40% higher compared to a branch in Brooklyn and 80% more than a similar meal in Shanghai. Still, the future looks bright for sub-Saharan Africa. On average, the region is set to grow at more than 5% between 2013-15 as millions of new consumers emerge from poverty and commodity prices continue to rise, according to data from the World Bank. A McKinsey & Company 2012 report on African consumers projects $410 billion in growth for consumer-facing industries across Africa by 2020; of this roughly 45% or $185 billion will flow from apparel, consumer goods and food businesses. The report also found Africans remain ""exceptionally optimistic about their economic future"" and very brand conscious in purchasing decisions.","U.S. fast food brands are increasingly opening branches across Africa .

"(CNN) -- As authorities searched Thursday for a surfer missing after wiping out on a 20-foot wave off Oahu's North Shore, his family released a statement that reads like an obituary. Kirk Passmore, a business owner and restaurant manager, was last seen late Wednesday morning at a surfing spot known as Alligator Rock in Haleiwa, CNN affiliate KHNL reported. Witnesses told the station that the experienced big-wave surfer fell off his board on the 20-foot swell and was hit by another wave. His partially damaged surfboard was found down the beach. ""He started coming to Hawaii when he was 14 and was an experienced and expert surfer. He was not new to big wave surfing, having surfed most of the well-known big wave locations,"" said a statement from his family posted on the Brigham Young University-Hawaii website. The statement, which is under the heading, ""Kirk Passmore, February 11, 1981 to November 12, 2013,"" says the Utah-born and Carlsbad, California-reared 32-year-old enjoyed sports, including football, basketball and baseball, ""but his love was in surfing."" It also says he is ""survived"" by his mother, father, stepmother and three siblings. Jamie Sterling, a surfer who saw Passmore wipe out, told KHNL, ""He was seen swimming down with his feet up above the surface, and we think he broke his eardrum because what happens when you break your eardrum is you have complete loss of balance and you have vertigo."" Coast Guard crews, Ocean Safety lifeguards, the Honolulu Fire Department and fellow surfers searched for Passmore on Wednesday to no avail. The Coast Guard continued searching through the night, while other rescuers suspended their search until sunrise. A helicopter, jet skis and a Coast Guard cutter were used in the search, KHNL reported. Oahu's North Shore was under a high-surf warning, with waves reaching 25 to 35 feet, and some surfers questioned why Passmore wasn't wearing a flotation vest in the perilous conditions. ""See, what would have saved him is if he had a float vest on. Everybody wears float vests nowadays,"" Chris Owens, who searched for Passmore after seeing him go underwater, told KHNL. Added champion paddle boarder Jamie Mitchell, ""Some of the best big-wave guys in the world are out there today and they all had their flotation vests and stuff. I guess it just goes to show that it can happen to anyone at any time."" Steve Matthews, who told the station that he co-owned a surf shop with Passmore, said Passmore moved to the North Shore from California about two years ago, but he has many years' experience riding large waves in Hawaii, Mexico and elsewhere. Passmore's co-workers at the Banzai Sushi Bar in Haleiwa said the restaurant closed down for the night out of respect for Passmore. Passmore is 6-foot-3 and weighs about 185 pounds. He has reddish hair and hazel eyes and was wearing black board shorts at the time of the wipeout.","32-year-old surfer had many years' experience riding big waves, business partner says .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's less of a tongue-twisting jumble than the phrase ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."" ""Obamacare."" The sleek, slang word used by some to describe the health reform law signed by President Barack Obama has taken on a roller-coaster trajectory of its own, first coming into favor with Republicans as a criticism of the law, and more recently, as the subject of Democratic efforts to reclaim it. The Supreme Court is expected to hand down a decision on the law's constitutionality this week. What the court has to say could shape the next step in the word's evolution, experts say. It premired before the president was elected or even became the Democratic nominee. And it premired long before the heated congressional debates over the law. Around the peak of its use in Congress, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, rose in objection to the word being used in the House of Representatives. ""Mr. Speaker, is it a violation of the House rule wherein members are not permitted to make disparaging references to the president of the United States,"" she asked on February 18, 2011. ""In two previous gentlemen's statements on the amendment, both of them referred to the Affordable Care Act, which is the accurate title of the health reform law, as 'Obamacare.' "" That month, a record -- which was broken a few months later -- was set for the number of times 'Obamacare' had been uttered in Congressional speeches: 272 times, according to an analysis by the Sunlight Foundation. That analysis showed the word has been used nearly 3,000 times since its debut as a phrase on Capitol Hill in July 2009. The word was first put in print in March 2007, according to The New York Times, when health care lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott penned it in a health industry journal. ""We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' to go along with 'McCain-care,' 'Edwards-care,' and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s,"" she wrote. It first appeared on the campaign trail in May of that year, when Romney distinguished his effort on health reforms as governor of Massachusetts. ""In my state, I worked on health care for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over heath care,'"" he said in Des Moines, Iowa, advocating for states to find free market solutions. ""And let me tell you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, or whatever you want to call it."" On the campaign trail since, he has defended himself from charges of similarities between ""Romneycare"" and ""Obamacare"" -- including a critique from a rival presidential candidate that the two amount to ""Obamneycare."" Perhaps confronted with the pervasiveness of the word, Democrats began an effort to redefine it -- an effort which began after it was signed in the summer of 2010. By August 2011, Obama was using the word in some of his own speeches. ""So part of the Affordable Care Act health care reform, also known as 'Obamacare,' "" he said at a town hall meeting in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. ""I have no problem with folks saying ""Obama cares."" I do care. If the other side wants to be the folks who don't care, that's fine with me."" A CNN/ORC International poll released this month showed 43% of Americans favor the law, 37% think it too liberal, and 13% oppose it because it is not liberal enough. David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, commented in a March interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on the messaging of the law's opponents. ""We've had hundreds of millions of dollars spent in propaganda against this law, just a torrent of money distorting it,"" he said. That month, Obama's campaign encouraged supporters to tweet their support of the bill marked with a social media tag, ""#ilikeobamacare."" But George Lakoff, professor of cognitive science and linguistics at the University of California at Berkley, does not see near-term success in attempts to associate the word with a positive connotation. ""It's possible but it's very difficult,"" he said. ""Obamacare activates the conservative viewpoint, that part of the brain."" Part of the trouble for Obama lies in the law's official name -- the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- said Lakoff, who writes about the messaging of health care politics in his new book, ""The Little Blue Book: The Essential Guide for Thinking and Talking Democratic."" ""He could have called it 'The American Plan.' It would be harder to argue against 'The American Plan,' "" he continued. ""Any cognitive scientist could have told him that was a dumb name."" Martin Medhurst, professor of rhetoric and communication at Baylor University, puts significant stock regarding the word's future in the upcoming constitutional judgment. ""It was applied with a negative connotation, but were the Supreme Court to uphold the law, Obamacare might overnight become a positive context,"" he said. ""Just because something is intended to be framed in one way doesn't necessarily mean that it will be interpreted that way forever."" The law's most steadfast opponents may not change their views based on the court's ruling. It could have an impact on the way the important November constituencies think about it. ""You only have to convince the people who were ambivalent or are in the middle,"" Medhurst said. But for now, the actual language of the law is not as important as the way it is discussed and debated. ""Most of the language people are hearing is not the law itself because nobody has read the law,"" Medhurst said.","The word has taken on a roller-coaster trajectory of its own .
It has been used nearly 3,000 times since its debut as a phrase in July 2009 .
Confronted with the pervasiveness of the word, Democrats began an effort to redefine it ."
"(CNN) -- A boy takes a condom. He inflates it slowly, each breath meticulously measured as the creation begins to take shape. He takes some plastic and carefully wraps it around the condom, ensuring it can't be punctured before using pieces of shredded tire and an old rope to tie around the oddly shaped sphere. This is football -- rural African style. No grass, no shoes, just a machete knife on hand to chisel out the thorns which get stuck in the players' feet. Welcome to Chicome -- a small village in Mozambique, located 150 kilometers off the beaten track and an eight-hour drive through the bush. Chicome exists without electricity or running water -- instead it lives off the ""Three F's"": farming, family and football. ""Having less is interesting because it makes us see things in a different way,"" renowned international photographer Jessica Hilltout told CNN. ""What I know is that everyone says the same thing, how can people be so content? ""Happiness is a state of mind. You see people with so much who are buried in their belongings and burdened by their attachment to possessions. ""Those who have less also have less worries and are more focused on what is essential."" Chicome was one of the places where Hilltout's photos spoke loudest. Football is what keeps the village breathing. Every evening a match takes place amid noise and a carnival of color. At 4pm each and every day the whistle sounds to signal the start of play with people arriving from all sides of the bush onto the field. ""It was a moment of magic,"" Hilltout said. ""They forget the hardship of the day and people just had fun. Not just for the players but for fans, the wives, it was real delight. ""It was a real African match. Bare feet, getting thorns, cutting them out with machetes, dressed in individual fashion. It was fantastic."" Hilltout is well qualified to explain the attitudes and role of football in rural African society following the success of her ""Amen"" project. In her father's Volkswagen Beetle, Hilltout traveled across Africa, documenting in each and every shot just how crucial football is to the survival of those battling against the odds. ""It wasn't easy at the beginning. I was sitting in my tent, crying, why am I doing this?"" she recalled. ""I hated football. It's such a male world, then there is a little white woman, and everyone was looking at me. ""With time on the terrain I learned that the best thing for me was to settle in an area where I felt a good vibe. I wanted to use my senses, feel, talk to people, make friends, see the fields and spend time with people to explain the project and gain their trust. ""People are suspicious because white people take photos and make money off the back of it. I had to break that. I think that people saw I was putting love into my log books they saw it wasn't a commercial project. ""They saw that when I was stopping to write their names down and put some memorable quotes in that there was more to it."" Hilltout is no stranger to Africa. Her tour of Madagascar in 2007 whetted the appetite for something which delved deeper into the everyday lives of those living across such a vast and enriching continent. It was while spending Christmas with her father in South Africa five years ago that the idea of a football project was born. ""I love Africa and my father loves football. He did the design of the book and I took the pictures and the traveling,"" she said. ""I'm not a football fan at all. I did watch the World Cup, but I'm really not a big fan. ""During my travels through Africa I had often seen handmade balls which I thought were beautiful and symbolic of so much. But I thought there was something wonderful about showing what life is like in Africa through football. ""I wanted to do a study of football in its purest sense, without all the corporate sponsors, television and stuff which goes with it. ""I wanted to show people playing just for the pure pleasure."" Hilltout spent a total of nine months traveling throughout Africa, taking in Lesotho, Malawi and South Africa on her first trip before visiting Ghana, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Niger, Togo and Benin. ""Every time I stopped somewhere, I found someone who could speak the dialect and English or French and they would be my link to the population. I wanted to have fun,"" she said. In Kumasi, Ghana, another story was brought to life through the lens. ""I'm OK, I'm OK,"" said Sani Pollux, manager of the famous Anokye Stars side. Pollux, a quiet and humble man, has been training children since he was 14 and has been responsible for unearthing some of Ghana's most talented players. The club, which is made up of 150 boys, has teams in several age groups and survives by selling players to the bigger teams. The likes of Milan's Sulley Muntari, former Leeds striker Tony Yeboah and international midfielder Isaac Boakye have all passed through the Anokye Stars set up. Kids from across the country flock to attend trials, as Pollux runs the rule over ""these young dancers in the dust,"" according to Hilltout. ""The boys look after Sani, and he looks after them,"" she said. ""He lives in a 10 square meter home, in old Suame neighborhood. ""On the roof is a huge satellite dish with all the sport channels. The living room is the center of this house. Here they listen to his massive old-fashioned radio, eat and watch football. ""The place is an organized mess with footballs hanging up, old photos of successful young boys, old boots, cups, trophies and a dangerously low ceiling fan."" The project has sparked reaction from across the globe with hundreds of people donating both new and old equipment, while Adidas has also contributed. ""It has gone beyond all expectations,"" she said. ""I was always attracted to the world of image. I assisted photographers to make sure I actually wanted to do it. I did a trip in a Land Rover from Brussels to Mongolia and then up to Africa when I was younger. ""It really formed my way of seeing the world. I wanted to see the imperfect, the banal and all the simple things in life which we sometimes forget about. ""For anyone, whatever their passions is, when you give a project everything you've got and push yourself that bit further, there's always some kind of magic that happens."" Amen to that.","Photographer Jessica Hilltout traveled across Africa capturing role of football in society .

"(CNN) -- Two World Wars have been fought, Empires lost, the atom split, the worldwide web invented and social media proliferated, but all the while a unique set of quintessential English sporting events have remained in their own self-regulated time warp, with only minor concessions to modernity. Glorious Goodwood and Royal Ascot, Henley Royal Regatta and Wimbledon, Cowes Week and Polo at the Guard's Club at Windsor are an integral part of the ""English Season"" where royal patronage and tradition are the key ingredients and woe betide any attempt to change them. ""These events are set in aspic,"" leading social commentator Peter York told CNN. So that means a strict dress code, certainly if you want to be allowed into the Royal Enclosure at Royal Ascot or its equivalent at Glorious Goodwood, which starts on Tuesday. Top hat and tails at the former, Panama hats de rigeur at the latter. Jeans or shorts? Don't bother to try, you will be ever so politely turned away. Dress code . For ladies, hats should be worn and dresses and skirts ""should be of a modest length defined as falling just above the knee or longer,"" according to the official Royal Ascot website. It's no different at Henley, but entry to the Stewards' Enclosure is restricted to members only and invites to the Royal Box at Wimbledon to watch Andy Murray strut his stuff are limited to the great and the good. With all those barriers to overcome just to be seen in the right place, it's even more surprising that in York's opinion the majority of the people at these iconic sporting events, could not care a jot about the sport itself. ""That's the thing about the English social season, it's just a pretext to have a good time, a lot of people spending a lot of time not watching but eating and drinking and having a generally good time,"" he said. So while top jockeys wrestle with the cream of thoroughbred racehorses, Olympic and world rowing champions strain every sinew down the Straight Course at Henley and Roger Federer plays a sublime cross court winner at Wimbledon, the cry will come up ""more Pimms please."" According to official figures, 45,000 pints of Pimms -- a quintessential British summer drink -- were consumed at Royal Ascot alone, not to mention 51,000 bottles of champagne. Social events . York, renowned for his wry and sometimes acerbic observations of the upper classes, could be accused of exaggeration, but he is only repeating a famous observation of former monarch King Edward VII, who described horse racing at Goodwood as ""a garden party with some racing tacked on!"" Edward was renowned for his flamboyant lifestyle, but like his great grand daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, he had a genuine interest and love of racing and horses, so perhaps he did bother to watch, particularly as he owned some of the contenders. For others said York, ""it's the chance to wear splendid clothes and do some social climbing."" Having the right connections as well as sticking to the rules, the other key requirement is a stoicism and stiff upper lip in the face of the inclement and unpredictable English weather. So beware washouts at Wimbledon (unless you are at Centre Court where there is a roof), high heels stuck in the mud on the Polo field at the Guard's Club, boaters blown off in the wind at Henley, or choppy waters for the spectator flotilla at Cowes. For the dedicated ""sports fans"" who battle the elements, it's all worth it to rub shoulders with the right type of person and soak up the very Englishness of it all -- not to mention have a very good lunch. Glorious Goodwood . The sporting part of the ""season"" comes to an end with Glorious Goodwood and Cowes, but with Britain's rare heatwave proving an exception to the rule, attendances are booming. 120,000 people plus are expected at Goodwood this week and York believes the festival's success is deserved because of the work of Lord March, the heir apparent to the Duke of Richmond, who owns the race course and the vast estate. ""It is especially interesting, it isn't just a race course, it belongs to a real live person with a real live family influence,"" added York. ""There's just so much to do, it's a wonderful place and you will never be bored, it's loved by the discriminating."" March, who took the reins from his father in 1994 has diversified to run the Goodwood Festival of Speed and a vintage car revival event, both incredibly popular. While not by strict definition part of the ""English Season,"" as defined by Debrett's Peerage, the events have become an unofficial part of the social season and a must for those hoping to catch the eye for any number of reasons. Debutantes delight . By repute, the ""English Season"" was apparently designed to allow Members of Parliament and the House of Lords, the ruling class, the chance to amuse themselves while stuck in London rather than on their country estates. But its real purpose became to introduce their daughters, debutantes, into the social scene after being officially presented to the reigning monarch at a special ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth II ended the tradition, curtseys and all, in 1958, fearing it had become outdated in a period of rapid social change. But young women, still encouraged by their parents to meet an appropriate member of the opposite sex and preferably of the same class, continued to flock to Ascot and the others events in their droves. And a new breed of ""debuntante"" emerged, the ""Sloane Ranger,"" young women who mainly frequented the exclusive south west area of London around Chelsea and South Kensington. They were epitomized by Lady Diana Spencer, who was to marry Prince Charles in 1981 and become an iconic global figure. York and his co-author Ann Barr captured the mood of the times perfectly in their 1982 best seller ""The Official Sloane Ranger Guide"" which sold over a million copies and acquired cult status. Sloane Rangers . By repute, ""Sloane Rangers"" loved equestrian events, so Badminton Horse Trials, the Epsom Derby, Royal Ascot and Glorious Goodwood, all part of the English Season, were very much in vogue. Ironically, despite sporting the traditional tweed and green welly look, Princess Diana did not enjoy country pursuits of her followers, but did attend Wimbledon to present the trophy at the 1995 men's singles championship, won by Pete Sampras. Her tragic death in 1997 left a nation in morning, but the ""Sloane Ranger"" style and their male equivalents, cruelly named ""Hooray Henrys"" persisted. York updated the earlier offering with ""Cooler, Faster, More Expensive"" in 2007, co-written with Olivia Stewart-Liberty, and current British Prime Minister David Cameron was in his sights. ""He's the classic male Sloane Ranger,"" York said. Not surprising then to see Cameron frequenting the Royal Box at Wimbledon to cheer on Murray to victory this year, although to be fair his arch political rivals Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond and Ed Miliband, the leader of the Labour Party opposition in the UK parliament, were also watching. Global super-rich . With the global super rich now buying up large chunks of London property, ""Knightsbridge is a branch of Dubai or Bahrain, Mayfair is for the Russians,"" observed York, the clientele at some of England's sporting jewels in the crown has also changed. Overseas visitors are also a growing feature. ""These events are steeped and tradition and history and cannot be replicated anywhere in the world,"" said Rebecca Holloway, head of PR at VisitEngland. ""To experience one of these events, is to experience a true insight into English culture, pomp and ceremony and all,"" she added. As Holloway says, impossible to recreate, with heritage dating back to the 19th century, one suspects that even in 100 years time the essential elements that make up the England's sporting summer will remain largely untouched and perhaps the better for it.","Sporting events integral to English social ""season""

All quintessential English events with unique heritage and tradition .

"(CNN) -- Egypt expelled the Turkish ambassador and scaled back diplomatic relations at the weekend over Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's vocal and persistent criticism of the interim government that replaced the former short-lived presidency of Mohamed Morsy, who hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood. The decision marks the demise of attempts by Erdogan to play a leading role in the Middle East. His ideological affinity to the Brotherhood was a staging post to influence other Islamist parties across the Arab world in order to restore the regional prestige of Turkey. That plan has come crashing down. Besides Egypt, Turkey is now at odds with the majority of the Gulf Arab states, Algeria, Israel, Jordan, Morocco and neighboring Iran, Iraq and Syria. It is mistrusted by Russia and is largely bypassed by the United States. Europe is disappointed by the deepening isolation of this strategically-located republic straddling East and West. To break out of this self-imposed exile, Turkey has recently sought to mend relations with newly elected Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has visited Baghdad and met key Shia and Sunni leaders while also cultivating ties with Iran. Turkey is seeking the assistance of both countries to contain the fallout from the Syrian quagmire, including the reduction of the ceaseless flow of refugees along the porous 910km Turkey-Syria border. Nonetheless, the abrupt change of direction will probably not repair the tensions on a durable basis. Countries in the region suspect that Turkey is merely reacting to developments and is not committed to a balanced foreign policy. After all, Turkey's rapid shifts in the past -- from befriending to outright hostility towards Nuri al Maliki and Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, for example -- will most likely reinforce those perceptions. Moreover, the volatility of Turkey's external posture seems to significantly undermine the once-unassailable appeal of Erdogan to Arabs. Just two years ago, at the peak of ""Arab Spring"" fever, a Zogby poll showed that his popularity ratings standing at 80 per cent in Morocco and above 90 per cent in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. Similarly, a 2011 survey by Pew Research revealed that his favourability ratings as 78 per cent, 72 per cent and 64 per cent in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon respectively. Any contemporary polling will, however, arguably reveal plummeting support for Turkey and Erdogan. Turkey is no longer viewed as a template for democratic pluralism, civil liberties and economic rejuvenation after the disproportionate security response to the mainly peaceful Gezi Park protests in central Istanbul during May-June of this year. Reporters Without Borders ranks Turkey 154th in the world in terms of media freedoms compared to 98th several years ago. In addition, the golden age marked by a debt-fuelled consumer-driven economic boom, one of Turkey's crowning achievements, is at an end: as slow ""recessionary"" growth becomes the new normal for Turkey, as estimated by the IMF, it needs to urgently implement major structural reforms, which does not look likely in the foreseeable future. Despite the growing challenges to Turkey's regional position, its NATO membership and strategic geographic location ensure that it cannot be ignored in the Middle East. But that reality is a far cry from the euphoria and expectations that surrounded the rise of Turkey's regional and global profile over the last decade.

"(CNN) -- The family behind A&E's ""Duck Dynasty"" rallied around its patriarch Thursday, one day after the network suspended Phil Robertson over controversial remarks he made about gays and blacks in a magazine interview. ""While some of Phil's unfiltered comments to the reporter were coarse, his beliefs are grounded in the teachings of the Bible. Phil is a Godly man who follows what the Bible says are the greatest commandments: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart' and 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' Phil would never incite or encourage hate,"" the Robertsons said in a statement. The family called into question the future of the show. ""We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for expressing his faith, which is his constitutionally protected right. We have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm. We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of Duck Dynasty,"" it said. In the January issue of GQ, Robertson said homosexuality is a sin and puts it in the same category as bestiality and promiscuity. ""It seems like, to me, a vagina -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man's anus. That's just me. I'm just thinking: There's more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical,"" he's quoted as saying. When asked what he thought was sinful, Robertson replied: ""Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men."" But homosexuals aren't alone, Robertson said. ""Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers -- they won't inherit the kingdom of God. Don't deceive yourself. It's not right."" Opinion: 'Duck Dynasty' suspension doesn't violate First Amendment . A&E said it was troubled by Robertson's statements. ""We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty,"" the network said in a statement Wednesday. ""His personal views in no way reflect those of A+E Networks, who have always been strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community. The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely."" In addition to his comments about homosexuality, Robertson also spoke about race and growing up in Louisiana before the civil rights era. ""I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once,"" he told GQ. ""Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field. ... They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, 'I tell you what: These doggone white people' -- not a word! ""Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues,"" GQ quoted Robertson as saying. Did A&E make the right decision? Share your view . Outrage and support . The NAACP and the Human Rights Campaign wrote a joint letter to the president of A&E expressing ""outrage and deep concern about the recent racist, homophobic, and ill-informed remarks made by Phil Robertson."" ""Mr. Robertson claims that, from what he saw, African Americans were happier under Jim Crow. What he didn't see were lynching and beatings of black men and women for attempting to vote or simply walking down the street,"" the letter states. ""And his offensive claims about gay people fly in the face of science. In fact, it's important to note that every single leading medical organization in the country has said that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being LGBT -- it's not a choice, and to suggest otherwise is dangerous."" But by early Thursday night, more than 70,000 people had signed a change.org petition calling for A&E to bring Robertson back. ""Homosexuals have their convictions and Christians respect them,"" the organizer of the petition wrote. ""There is a difference between respecting someone rights to exercise free will and imposing on others what we believe. Phil has done nothing more than state what he believes in. Just because homosexuals do not agree, does not mean Mr. Robertson needs to be suspended."" Similarly, the Facebook page ""Bring Back Phil Robertson"" had more than 190,000 ""likes"" by Thursday night. Robertson responded to the brouhaha in a statement late Wednesday. ""I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me,"" he said. ""We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity."" ""Duck Dynasty"" follows a Louisiana bayou family that has ""made a fortune on duck calls,"" as A&E puts it. Robertson founded the Duck Commander company, ""which sold a line of custom-made duck-hunting calls that quickly became popular among avid hunters for their uncanny accuracy in replicating the sound of a real duck,"" the GQ article states. Videos of his family's duck hunts led to a show on the Outdoor Channel and eventually A&E, the article says. Season 5 of is set to premiere on January 15. According to A&E, its fourth season premiere in August drew nearly 12 million viewers to become the No. 1 nonfiction series telecast in cable history.

"(CNN) -- All her life, Carmen Figueroa believed she was born in the United States. It was what her mother had always told her. But a State Department investigation found that she was born in Sinaloa, Mexico, and brought into the country illegally at a young age, CNN affiliate KVOA reported. The discovery brought an abrupt end to Figueroa's 10-year career with the Arizona state police. Figueroa, 42, was forced to resign or be fired. Under Arizona law, an undocumented immigrant cannot be a peace officer. Her record as an officer included praise and promotions. The case is a reminder of how the country's immigration laws can turn lives upside down. It raises questions about how potential public employees are screened, and how easily facts about something as basic as a birthplace can be obscured. ""She was great, well-liked. The whole thing is a sad story,"" said Bart Graves, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety. Figueroa had joined the force as a highway patrol officer 10 years ago and became a detective in 2010. The detective likely would have continued to serve if not for the State Department investigation. Figueroa's brother had applied for a passport while he was in the Air Force, Graves said, and during that process the State Department flagged him about his citizenship. ""When she was informed by the State Department that she and her brother were not U.S. citizens, that was the first she'd heard of it,"" Graves said. ""Her mother had told her she was born in this country."" Figueroa learned of her immigration status in June, but she didn't inform her agency, Graves said. ""She knew in June about her status and by law was required to report it immediately,"" he said. ""She waited for us to find out about it in August."" Once it found out, the Department of Public Safety placed Figueroa on paid administrative leave until Monday, when she resigned. The State Department conducted a criminal investigation and in October decided that it will not file any charges against Figueroa, Graves said. Arizona continues to work with federal officials to determine if any state criminal charges will be filed, Graves said. Figueroa could not be reached for comment despite repeated calls. In Arizona, a state known for its law cracking down on illegal immigration, the case has sparked debate. It's unclear what's next for Figueroa, KVOA reported. ""A situation like this where someone has been in the U.S. for 30 or 40 years believing that they're a U.S. citizen is pretty rare,"" immigration lawyer Maurice Goldman told the CNN affiliate. But one immigrant rights activist told CNN en EspaÃ±ol such cases aren't as uncommon as you might think. Dulce Matuz said she knows people who've found out they were undocumented when they went to get driver's licenses. Many of them grew up during a different climate surrounding immigration, she said. ""This is a topic that wasn't talked about,"" Matuz said. ""It was taboo. ... Now we are seeing that children are realizing at a very young age the immigration status of their parents and themselves."" CNN's Stan Wilson and journalist Valeria Fernandez contributed to this report.","NEW: Activist: Such cases aren't as uncommon as you might think .

"(CNN) -- ""Fast & Furious 6"" studio Universal is doing its part to honor Paul Walker's memory. After the actor's death in a fiery car wreck Saturday, the studio has pledged to give a percentage of the proceeds from the home entertainment sales of ""Fast & Furious 6"" to Walker's charity, Reach Out WorldWide. The 40-year-old founded the organization, which works with local experts to provide disaster relief, in January 2010, after Haiti was devastated by an earthquake. On the day of his death, Walker was attending a holiday toy drive for the organization. ""With the passing of Paul, the world has lost a man who spent a great deal of his life in service to others,"" the chairman of Universal Pictures, Donna Langley, said in a statement Tuesday. ""We share in the deep grief of his family, friends and the countless fans who love him. We keep Paul's memory alive and honor his legacy through continued support of Reach Out WorldWide, the non-profit he founded to give hope to those who must rebuild after they have experienced natural disasters."" ""Fast & Furious 6"" was a juggernaut at the box office when it was released in May, and went on to earn $238 million domestically and $788 million worldwide. The DVD and Blu-ray will be released on December 10. Walker's family has requested that grieving fans and friends donate to Reach Out WorldWide in lieu of sending flowers. ""It's comforting for them to know that the son, brother, and father they love so much is equally adored, respected, and appreciated by so many,"" the actor's family said in a statement. ""Paul founded the organization with the genuine desire to help others, and it's important to his family to keep his memory alive through ROWW."" The seventh installment of Universal's blockbuster ""Fast"" franchise was in the works at the time of Walker's death, and it's still unclear what will become of the project, which is scheduled to bow in July 2014. In the meantime, Walker's ""Fast & Furious"" co-stars are trying to cope with a stunning loss. Jordana Brewster, who worked closely with Walker in a number of the ""Fast"" films, said in a statement that Walker ""was an enormous presence in my life for the past fourteen years."" As others have, Brewster made it a point to note Walker's generous spirit. ""While many would be satisfied with material success it made Paul more convinced of the need to help others,"" the 33-year-old star said. ""He never spoke of his immense generosity or philanthropic endeavors unless I prodded, however. This is what made Paul, Paul. He lived with integrity, humanity and humility and seemed most happy when talking about his daughter, Meadow.

"(CNN) -- Overwhelmed doctors frantically scurried over the weekend to help scores of patients left ""dying on the floor"" amid a punishing air assault on the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. ""There was a big massacre today,"" Dr. Ammar Zakaria told CNN via Skype on Sunday from the country's largest city and rebel stronghold. ""We were treating shrapnel wounds, deep abdominal and brain injuries. I just lost count of the amputations."" The Syrian government continued to relentlessly fire on rebel-held sections of the city after days of continued air raids. The city has been targeted for more than a week by helicopters carrying so-called barrel bombs -- drums packed with explosives and shrapnel. The bombs can level entire buildings with one hit. ""A lot of victims died before arriving to the hospital. Many were inside the hospital, and we didn't have the resources to help all the cases,"" added Zakaria, detailing the bloody aftermath. ""We didn't have enough beds to help them all. People were dying on the floor."" With medical supplies spread thin, each anxiety-filled second was spent suturing the fine line between life and death. Images taken by Zakaria show a mangled ambulance stopped in its path and doctors operating in pools of blood, watching children cling to their last breath through a breathing tube. ""In Aleppo, there is a huge influx of wounded in local hospitals ... less and less security and more bombing on civilian areas,"" Simon Schorno, Syria spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, told CNN by phone from Damascus. The Syrian government said the operations are targeting ""terrorist groups"" in neighborhoods of Aleppo, saying ""scores of terrorists were killed and others were wounded,"" according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. Hundreds have been killed since the bombing began. At least half a million people have been wounded across the country, and millions remain displaced and tens of thousands detained, according to the ICRC. On Sunday alone, 166 people were killed across the country, 92 in Aleppo, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria. CNN cannot independently verify daily death tolls, but the United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since 2011. ""Supplies of food and other basic necessities are running dangerously short, especially in besieged areas,"" said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC delegation in Syria. Schorno described difficult conditions for delivering aid. ""We don't get the necessary authorizations to get in. The government needs to green-light our movements through the checkpoints and we have to go in on foot, and we cannot do that under current conditions,"" Schorno added. The death toll continues to mount as misery for the millions of displaced is exacerbated by the record cold temperatures across the Middle East. The hospital has become home for many Syrian doctors like Zakaria. ""We live in the hospitals because we cannot expect the timing of the shelling; we have to be ready all the time.""","Hundreds have been killed in Aleppo in recent days, opposition group says .

"(CNN) -- Iranian authorities have moved imprisoned American Saeed Abedini to a more dangerous prison and are now prohibiting visits from the family of the Christian pastor, according to the public interest law firm representing Abedini's family in the United States. Abedini, 33, is an Iranian-born U.S. citizen who makes his home in Boise, Idaho, with his wife and two small children. He converted to Christianity from Islam. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, a Muslim who converts to another faith can face the death penalty. Abedini was arrested in June 2012 during a visit to his native country. In a news release, the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) said that one of Abedini's Iranian family members went to visit him at Evin Prison in Tehran on Sunday and was told that Abedini had been moved the previous day to Rajai Shahr Prison near Karaj. The family member then made the hour-and-a-half drive to Karaj and was told that Abedini was not permitted to receive visitors. The ACLJ pointed out that the transfer occurred at the same time demonstrators in Iran were chanting, ""Death to America!"" in rallies observing the anniversary of Iranian protestors seizing the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says Iran has detained Abedini since Sept. 26, 2012, sentencing him to eight years in prison, ""on charges related to his religious belief."" Kerry has called for Iran to release him. Appearing on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" on September 24, near the one year anniversary of his imprisonment, Abedini's wife, Naghmeah, said, ""His charge was undermining the Iranian government, the basis for the charge was Christian gatherings."" She said that at the time of Abedini's arrest, he was in Iran with that government's permission to build a nonsectarian orphanage on his parent's property. She said that he had worked with house churches on visits prior to the one during which he was arrested. U.S. President Barack Obama also has called for Abedini's release. On September 27, Obama spoke by phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani when Rouhani was in the United States for a speech at the United Nations. The call was the first time presidents from the two nations have spoken directly since the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Iran following the Islamic Revolution and the seizing of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. A senior official in the administration told CNN that the president ""noted our concern about three American citizens who have been held within Iran -- Robert Levinson, Saeed Abedini, and Amir Hekmati -- and noted our interest in seeing those Americans reunited with their families."" Levinson, a retired FBI agent, vanished during a business trip to Iran in March 2007. Amir Hekmati is a former U.S. Marine who was jailed in Iran in 2011, with the Iranian government accusing him of espionage . Faraz Sanei, Iran researcher with Human Rights Watch, said that ""prisoners of conscience"" incarcerated at Rajai Shahr Prison are comingled with violent offenders, such as those serving time for murder convictions. He also cited reports of overcrowding, lack of running water, lack of heat in the winter, and negligence on the part of jailers. He said prisoners regularly do not receive needed medical care, and some have staged hunger strikes in an effort to receive more humane treatment. Regarding Saeed's case Sanei said, ""Saeed Abedini is among the dozens of Iranian Christians who have been subjected to surveillance, harassment, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and unlawful convictions during the past few years because of the Iranian government's crackdown on Christian converts and the home church movement. ""Iran's judiciary should immediately free Abedini and others like him, and allow Iran's Christian community, and particularly members of the country's besieged home church movement, to practice their faith free from government interference.""","Authorities have moved Iranian-American pastor, Saeed Abedini to a more dangerous prison .

"(CNN) -- The United States government's hunger for information on Google users is continuing to rise. The tech company had more requests for user information in the first half of this year from the United States than any period before, according to the bi-annual Google transparency report released on Thursday. The United States government continues to make the most requests in the world for user data, with 10,918 requests for 21,683 user accounts during the first six months of 2013. The United States also has the highest success rate at getting Google to comply with its requests. The search giant turned over user information for 83% of the U.S. queries. India, Germany and France rounded out the top four, each making between 2,000 and 3,000 requests for user information. In its most recent transparency report, Google has done something different. It now breaks down U.S. criminal legal requests by type, showing what percentage of the orders are subpoenas, wiretap orders, warrants, PEN register orders, or emergency disclosures. The majority of requests were subpoenas, followed by warrants. There were seven wiretap requests. The numbers show how the volume of requests has increased steadily over time. The total amount of requests from all governments has doubled since Google started tracking them in 2009. This is the company's eighth transparency report since it started publicly sharing the statistics in 2010. Google has led the way for tech companies with its transparency reports, which are becoming industry standard. After this year's National Security Agency revelations, other companies including Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo and most recently Apple joined in and released their own similar reports. The companies have also petitioned the U.S. government to allow them to publish information on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requests they field. Google continued to express frustration with the United States government for limiting what companies can disclose about national security requests. ""We believe it's your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies,"" said Google legal director Richard Salgado in a blog post.","Google releases its eighth transparency report on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- An elk's close encounter with a photographer prompted Great Smoky Mountains Park officials to euthanize the animal. The video of the young bull elk nudging and head-butting James York, who was sitting on a North Carolina roadside, spread quickly through Facebook, Twitter and YouTube last week. While most people saw a fascinating exchange between human and beast, wildlife biologists saw danger. ""By initiating physical contact with a visitor, the elk displayed an unacceptable risk to human safety,"" a park statement released Monday said. Humans visiting the Cataloochee area of the national park had apparently been feeding the young bull elk, which then ""lost his instinctive fear of humans,"" officials said. ""After becoming food conditioned, the elk did not respond to any attempts to keep it out of the area and away from humans,"" they said. ""When wildlife exhibits this behavior it often escalates to more aggressive behavior creating a dangerous situation for visitors."" The animal had a history of ""approaching visitors seeking handouts,"" they said. Wildlife biologists ""made the difficult decision to euthanize an elk"" last Friday. Park officials knew of this elk's familiarity with humans before the video racked up millions of views online. ""Between September and last week, park biologists aggressively hazed this elk 28 times to discourage it from approaching the road and visitors,"" they said. ""They captured, sedated, tagged, and re-released it on site."" ""The behavior that it learned from park visitors who had given it food had been too strongly ingrained,"" making it unlikely the elk would change his offensive ways, they said. York, who hunched over and and remained still through much of the encounter, was not injured, but ""if the animal had approached a child instead of an adult, the outcome for the visitor could have been very different,"" park officials said. This elk was the first euthanized in the park since the animals were reintroduced there by park officials 13 years ago, the release said. Elk once were populous in the area but were gone from the region by the mid-1800s due to over-hunting and loss of habitat, according to the national park's website. CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.","Video of elk nudging James York spread quickly through Facebook and YouTube .

"(CNN) -- Apple is developing iPhones with curved-glass screens and enhanced sensors that detect different levels of pressure, according to a new report. Two models â€” with screens of 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches â€”are in the works, and both would use glass that curves downward at the edges, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source familiar with the plans. These screen sizes almost rival that of Samsung's Galaxy Note 3, which boasts a 5.7-inch screen. For its part, Apple's iPhone 5S has a 4-inch screen.

"(CNN) -- A dramatic confrontation in Hong Kong between Michael Bay's film crew and men who wanted money might be better set in a Jackie Chan movie. The street vendors allegedly became violent when Bay refused to quadruple the payment they would get for the disruption caused by filming for the fourth installment in his ""Transformers"" film franchise. ""Yes, some drugged up guys were being belligerent asses to my crew for hours in the morning of our first shoot day in Hong Kong,"" Bay said in a posting on his website Thursday. ""One guy rolled metal carts into some of my actors trying to shake us down for thousands of dollars to not play his loud music or hit us with bricks."" Bay, 48, is in Hong Kong filming ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz, which is due in theaters next June. ""Every vendor where we shot got paid a fair price for our inconvenience, but he wanted four times that amount,"" Bay wrote. ""I personally told this man and his friends to forget it. We were not going to let him extort us. He didn't like that answer."" The man returned an hour later, ""carrying a long air-conditioner unit,"" according to Bay. ""He walked right up to me and tried to smack my face, but I ducked threw the air unit on the floor and pushed him away."" Police officers providing security for the production ""jumped on him,"" Bay said. ""But it took seven big guys to subdue him. It was like a zombie in Brad Pitt's movie 'World War Z.' He lifted seven guys up and tried to bite them. He actually bit into one of the guard's Nike shoe. Insane. Thank god it was an Air Max, the bubble popped, but the toe was saved."" Faithful to the over-the-top action and special effects of any Bay production, it ended with an army. ""It took 15 Hong Kong cops in riot gear to deal with these punks,"" Bay said. ""In all, four guys were arrested for assaulting the officers."" A Hong Kong police spokeswoman identified two people arrested as brothers with the surname Mak and ages 27 and 28. She said the men demanded that Bay give them 100,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is about $12,000 in U.S. currency. The younger Mak brother, who was charged with blackmail and assault on a police officer, was taken by ambulance to a hospital for treatment of his injuries, the spokeswoman said. The older bother, who complained that he was not feeling well, was arrested on a charge of common assault and assaulting a police officer, she said. Three police officers suffered minor injuries, the spokeswoman said. While Bay did not acknowledge any injuries in his statement, the police report said the director suffered a facial injury but didn't go to a hospital.

"(CNN) -- A plume of black smoke rose over Cairo early Friday after a powerful explosion hit the city's police headquarters, killing at least four people and wounding more than 50 others, Egyptian authorities said. The blast struck a key symbol of authority in a country that has been shaken by political turmoil and violent unrest in recent years. It was followed by two smaller explosions near police stations in the Cairo area, one of which killed one person. And later, a fourth explosion outside a movie theater in Giza city, near Cairo, killed one person and injured seven others, state television said. The blasts took place at a time of high tension -- the day before the third anniversary of the 2011 revolution that eventually brought down authoritarian leader Hosni Mubarak. And they come amid the instability ushered in by the military's overthrow last year of the democratically elected former President, Mohamed Morsy, and the ensuing crackdown by security forces on the Islamist movement that supported him, the Muslim Brotherhood. Suicide bomber suspected . The first blast appeared to have been caused by a suicide attacker who tried to drive a vehicle laden with explosives into the police headquarters, said Maj. Gen. Hany Abdel Latif, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, citing preliminary reports. Guards stationed in front of the headquarters in the Abdeen district of Cairo opened fire at the vehicle, and the explosion went off in the building's vicinity rather than inside, he told state news agency Egynews. The blast destroyed the front of the first and second floors of the eight-story building, he said, and damaged the third floor. Most of the building's windows appeared to have been blown out. Air-conditioning units dangled by cables from the shattered facade. At least 51 people were wounded in the explosion, state-run broadcaster Masriya TV reported, citing the Health Ministry. Visiting the ruined building, Egyptian Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim condemned the bombing. ""These are nothing but desperate attacks in an attempt to create chaos, but the citizens here will remain resilient,"" he told Masriya TV. Ibrahim said security forces will ensure that Egyptians will be able to celebrate the anniversary of the revolution Saturday ""as if nothing happened today."" A powerful blast . CNN's Reza Sayah said the blast appeared to be ""the most powerful bomb attack that we've seen here in central Cairo in recent memory."" Speaking from near the scene of the blast, he said the attack will probably intensify the fight between Egypt's military-backed government and the groups that oppose it. It wasn't immediately clear who was behind that bombing. Friday is a holiday in Egypt, so the police headquarters is unlikely to have been as busy as it would have been on a weekday. The blast happened around 6:30 a.m., according to state media. Hundreds of people -- some stunned, some angry -- gathered around the scene, Sayah said. Many of those in the crowd were quick to blame the Muslim Brotherhood, despite no official word on who might be to blame. The Muslim Brotherhood denied responsibility for the bombing and issued a statement condemning it. ""The Muslim Brotherhood condemns any acts of violence or killing, regardless of who are the perpetrators, and the (Muslim Brotherhood) emphasizes that the revolution that has continued for seven months is a peaceful revolution and it will insist to remain peaceful."" Separately, the Muslim Brotherhood called for protests and sit-ins across multiple sites in and out of Cairo in a show of defiance. The group said security forces fired live ammunition on demonstrators in Beni Suef on Friday; surrounded and mistreated worshippers at a mosque in Suez on Friday; and thugs attacked a funeral in Alexandria on Thursday, among other grievances. Police arrested 111 protesters across the country, the Interior Ministry said. Egypt's armed forces condemned the bombings, as did the U.S. government. ""It should be clear to all ... Egyptians that violence has not and will not move Egypt's political transition forward,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""Ongoing unrest and cycles of violence surrounding protests hurt Egypt's prospects for political and economic stability."" A U.S. State Department official said that Washington is ""aware of reports"" that one of its citizens ""has been detained in Egypt."" But the official said the U.S. government wouldn't comment any more than that. Fears of more turmoil . Friday's second explosion was much smaller and went off near a police station in Dokki, a residential area of Cairo, wounding several people, authorities said. And in the Al-Haram district of Giza city, a small bomb was thrown at a moving police vehicle near a police station, killing one person, deputy Giza security chief Mahmoud Farouk told state TV. This new wave of violence follows a referendum earlier this month in which Egyptian voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution proposed by the military-backed government, according to the country's electoral commission. But supporters of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood had boycotted the vote in response to a continuing government crackdown. Rights groups have expressed concern about what they call an increasingly repressive environment in Egypt, where more than 2,200 people have been killed since Morsy's ouster. Some anti-government groups have resorted to violence. Bomb attacks and shootings against the security apparatus have taken place across the country in recent months -- a situation described by some as a low-level insurgency. The government has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for many of the attacks, even though the movement has condemned them. The bombing of the Cairo police headquarters suggested the violence is taking on a more serious, high-profile form.

"(CNN) -- Amazon, Apple and Google: All of these big tech companies have announced major robotics initiatives or investments in recent months. Amazon, in particular, managed to capture the public imagination when founder Jeff Bezos outlined a plan to deliver packages by drones. As drones become more mainstream, the prospect of excessive surveillance and other dangers loom. Drones drive down the costs of surveillance to a worrisomely low level. For example, it wouldn't be surprising if Amazon delivery drones were equipped with cameras for loss prevention. So what would stop law enforcement from asking Amazon for all of its drones' footage in a given neighborhood where there had been a crime? Simultaneously, drone technology has the potential to revolutionize delivery, agriculture, photography and possibly disrupt major industries. Imagine that you're shopping at Barnes & Noble. You ask for a book that the store does not carry. Rather than send you online, Barnes & Noble flies the book over from another store while you shop or take a coffee break. Or imagine that you're a farmer whose livelihood depends on catching crop disease early. You could use drones to fly over thousands of acres in an afternoon to spot problem areas. These are exciting uses for drones. But the real innovation will come when companies such as Amazon mix their robotics strategy with their love for open platforms. What does that mean? Recall that the first personal computers did not come to the market until the mid-1970s. Before that, government and industry purchased or leased computer equipment dedicated to a particular purpose such as database management. That's analogous to what Amazon and other companies are doing today. Amazon paid nearly $800 million for the robotics firm Kiva Systems for the specific purpose of helping to organize its warehouses. The company is now experimenting with drones for the second task of delivery. The real explosion of innovation in computing occurred when devices got into the hands of regular people. Suddenly consumers did not have to wait for IBM or Apple to write every software program they might want to use. Other companies and individuals could also write a ""killer app."" Much of the software that makes personal computers, tablets and smartphones such an essential part of daily life now have been written by third-party developers. As author Jonathan Zittrain points out, it would be hard to name a category of important software -- from word-processing to e-mail -- that some computer hobbyist did not create first at home. Today, popular apps such as Snapchat or Instagram are used by millions of people. Yet, both were created by just two or three people in their 20s. There are, of course, problems with apps for robots. You do not necessarily want a live-action version of Angry Birds using drones. And who is responsible should someone get hurt by interacting with robots? Once companies such as Google, Amazon or Apple create a personal drone that is app-enabled, we will begin to see the true promise of this technology. This is still a ways off. There are certainly many technical, regulatory and social hurdles to overcome. But I would think that within 10 to 15 years, we will see robust, multipurpose robots in the hands of consumers. Worried about your kid getting to and from the bus? A drone app lets you follow her there by trailing her phone and returning when she waves. Selling your house? An app on a drone will command it to fly around your property and stitch together a panorama of photos for a virtual tour. Same drone, thousands of possibilities. Put another way, the day when Amazon or Apple opens a drone app store is the day when drone innovation takes off. On an open model, the sky is quite literally the limit. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ryan Calo.","Tech companies such as Amazon or Google are planning major robotics initiatives .

"(CNN) -- More than 400 homes were evacuated in a small northern Ohio community overnight after a train tanker began leaking a flammable chemical late Tuesday, a city official said. A 26,000-gallon tanker began leaking styrene monomer after a derailment at a train yard in Willard, City Manager Brian Humphress said Wednesday morning. Because the chemical is highly flammable, officials ordered the evacuation of more than 400 homes in and near the city -- in about a half-mile radius from the rail yard, Humphress said. The spill was contained around 4:20 a.m. ET Wednesday, and officials hoped to get people back into their homes by late Wednesday morning, Humphress said. No injuries were reported; details about what led to the derailment weren't immediately available. A private contractor was handling the cleanup in the community, where about 6,000 people live. State environmental officials were monitoring the scene, Humphress said. Styrene is a synthetic chemical used to manufacture plastics, rubber and resins, according to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.","Flammable chemical leaks from train tanker at rail yard in Willard, Ohio .

"(CNN) -- Forty years after rising to the top of the boxing world and outdueling Muhammad Ali, Ken Norton lost his final fight -- a battle following a stroke -- at a Nevada medical facility, a friend said. He was 70 years old when he died Wednesday at a Veterans Affairs' medical facility in Henderson, Nevada, according to Gene Kilroy, who had managed Ali and more recently visited Norton as he recovered from a stroke. While some younger people may know him best as the father of former Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers linebacker Ken Norton Jr., the elder Norton was one of the most prominent figures in all of sports during the 1970s -- in large part because of his consistently great bouts with Ali. Their first showdown, in 1973, ended with Norton earning a split-decision victory -- and breaking Ali's jaw in the process. But Ali got his revenge six months later, winning their rematch in another split decision. When Ken Norton broke Ali's jaw . The two fighters faced off one more time in 1976 at New York's Yankee Stadium, with Ali again taking the win in what Norton's website calls ""a highly disputed split decision."" Well before he became Ali's archrival, Kenneth Howard Norton established himself as a standout athlete. Raised in small central Illinois city of Jacksonville, Norton earned a football, basketball and track scholarship to Northeast Missouri State College. Norton didn't begin boxing until being introduced to the sport while serving in the Marines Corps between 1963 and 1967. There, he soon flashed his talent in the ring en route to becoming a three-time All-Marine Heavyweight Champion, according to the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame, which inducted Norton into its 2004 class. He also earned a North Carolina Golden Gloves, International AAU and Pan American titles while still in the service. The year he left, in 1967, Norton went pro. It took him six more years to get a shot at a championship against Ali, and he won. While he lost that title back to Ali later the same year, a first-round knockout of Duane Bobick earned Norton the honor of being champ again in 1977. That same year, the Boxing Writers Association of America named Norton its Fighter of the Year. Still, that championship also proved short-lived after Norton lost a grueling 15-round fight to Larry Holmes. He retired from boxing in 1981 after amassing a professional record of 42 wins (including 33 knockouts), seven losses and one draw. The International Boxing Hall of Fame inducted Norton in 1992, hailing him as ""a fixture in the heavyweight ranks during a time that many consider the finest era of the division."" His profile on the hall's websites notes Norton ""possessed an awkward and powerful style and always entered the ring in great condition."" One of the other elite fighters of the era, George Foreman, said upon news of Norton's death that Norton deserved his spot in the upper echelon of the sport. ""They called us all handsome,"" Foreman tweeted. ""Muhammad they called pretty. But The fairest of them all Ken Norton."" Yet he was more than a boxer. Starting with Dino De Laurentis' film ""Mandingo,"" Norton appeared in about 20 movies. He also fathered five children, including his namesake, now a linebackers coach with the NFL's Seattle Seahawks. Norton also became close friends with Ali, whom he visited in the hospital the day after their first bout. According to Kilroy, Ali told Norton, ""You hit so hard."" His website also notes that Norton was once counted out before: in 1986, when he refused to accept a doctor's prognosis he wouldn't be able to walk or talk again after a serious accident. ""At first they thought I might die, and if I didn't die, I wouldn't be coherent,"" he said later. ""Now I'm talkin' and walkin' and I can even chew gum at the same time."" His more recent health crisis, a stroke, left him communicating by blinking his eyes, Kilroy recalled. Still, the former Ali manager said there was a lot of laughter in the room during Kilroy's visit along with other legendary boxers Mike Tyson, Earnie Shavers and Thomas Hearns. ""Now that he's gone, he has no pain,"" Kilroy said. ""He's sitting up there in the heavens right now talking with the other greats like Joe Louis."" Beyond touting Norton the boxer, Tyson on Wednesday remembered him first as ""a great man"" who was ""always nice to me even when I was an amateur fighter."" ""He always treated me like I was somebody,"" Tyson tweeted.""Remarkable man."" People we've lost in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- Mark and Kristine Wathke knew they were going to die. Stuck in a foot of snow on a road somewhere outside Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the couple from Wisconsin pulled all the clothes out of their suitcases and wore them, trying to keep warm in their car with temperatures dipping below zero. They rationed the bread and water they had with them, and ran the car's engine periodically to get some heat. There was no service for their cell phone. This wasn't the end they'd envisioned for their national parks tour. The Wathkes left Yellowstone's northeast entrance on October 29 at 4 p.m., planning to head to Montana. They plugged the address for their hotel into Google Maps and hit the road. Their route took them on Beartooth Highway, but they said they didn't see any signs warning that the road was closed. In fact, the highway was shut down in mid-September due to heavy snow, with signs posted saying so, the Park County Sheriff's Department said. The Wathkes' Kia got stuck several miles in. They thought for sure they'd be found, probably the next day. But it didn't happen, and with each passing day, their hopes dimmed, they told the Billings Gazette. They decided to write letters to loved ones, and recorded a message saying goodbye. Meanwhile, Troy Barnett, who owns the K Bar Z Guest Ranch near Cody, Wyoming, heard about the missing couple when his wife spotted it on Facebook Sunday night. ""I decided about 9 o'clock that it was too late to go out,"" Barnett told CNN. Monday morning, Barnett got out the snowmobile he hadn't used since last fall, made sure it was in running order, loaded it into his pickup truck and set out to look for the Wathkes. ""There are only two roads in this area, so I kinda knew what road they needed to be on,"" he said. He drove for more than 20 miles, until he couldn't anymore because of the snow. Then he got on the snowmobile and minutes later, found the couple just about where he thought they'd be. ""The car was stuck in the middle of the road. It wasn't buried but it had some snow on top of it. It kind of worried me a bit, and there was no movement,"" Barnett remembered. Inside the car, the couple heard something. ""Mark heard it first and he was like, 'Kris! Kris! Kris!,'"" Kristine Wathke told the Billings newspaper. ""We saw him coming up the road and I was just crying."" Barnett parked right next to the vehicle, and the door opened. ""They were really grateful and there were some tears,"" he said. ""I asked if everyone was okay and if they need medical attention and if they were warm enough."" Barnett loaded Mark and Kristine on his snowmobile and drove back to his truck. He called a friend with a radio and had him get in touch with the sheriff, and then took the couple to his house, where they called their family. The sheriff says Barnett's actions saved the Wathkes' from serious harm. ""I commend him for his unselfishness,"" Sheriff Scott Steward said. Barnett said it's not the first time he's helped someone in that area. ""We help people off there quite a bit,"" he said. ""It's really rural up here, we're just up in the mountains.""

"Shanghai (CNN) -- China's recent crackdown on corruption has netted a growing number of high-profile officials, often through campaigns that began with the posting of rumors and incriminating photos on social media. But those same campaigns are also exposing a seedier side of social media, which has become a tool for opportunistic reporters, bloggers, and crime syndicates to engage in vindictive rumor-mongering and even extortion. The opportunists and vigilantes alike have thrived by using the nation's increasingly influential social media platforms -- most notably the Twitter-like Sina Weibo -- in the name of rooting out corruption under an austerity campaign by China's new leaders. While many of the resulting smear campaigns are based on genuine corruption, some are also clearly motivated by personal gain. Such smear campaigns would have much more difficulty gaining traction in the West, where traditional media play a more effective watchdog role over issues like government corruption. But with China's state-owned media often muzzled by local interests from reporting corruption, decentralized and privately-owned social media platforms are more effective. One of the earliest and most famous corruption scandals uncovered by netizens occurred in 2011, involving a young woman named Guo Meimei who claimed to work for a Red Cross Society of China affiliate on her Sina Weibo account while posting photos of herself with luxury cars and designer goods. Her lavish lifestyle led to a public outcry over what appeared to be abuses of charity funding. Guo quickly apologized for her ""ignorant behavior"" on her Sina Weibo account. The Red Cross also conducted its own investigation and found Guo had no connection to the organization. But other instances of mismanagement were later uncovered, and general skepticism toward charities seriously damaged the Red Cross' reputation and ability to raise funds in China. Two years later, the organization's reputation remains in tatters. Last week, the bribery trial of the ""sex-tape official"" Lei Zhengfu opened. A former Chongqing city official, Lei's downfall began last year with the online posting of a graphic video of him having sex with a mistress. The woman was later revealed to have colluded with a property developer to lure Lei into a ""honey trap"" to extort him for money or favorable business contracts. Lei argued in court that the 3 million yuan (US$488,000) loan he helped the property developer secure should not be interpreted as a bribe. In more recent cases, incriminating photos led to the downfall of government officials for such transgressions as owning too many luxury watches and hosting overly lavish banquets at taxpayer expense. In many of these cases, the officials in question were already found guilty in the court of public opinion before any legal proceedings began, and anything they said in defense was largely ignored. In April, police in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou reportedly broke up a crime ring of 80 people who posed as journalists and threatened to write negative stories about people who refused to pay hush money. Such extortion has become common even among genuine media. An acquaintance at a major Sino-U.S. joint venture recently complained to me that she was forced to buy advertising from a newspaper after a reporter threatened to write a negative story if she did not pay up. The government is aware of these growing problems of vindictive rumor-mongering and extortion and is trying to take steps to fix them. The official Xinhua news agency reported in May that six people were charged for secretly taping illicit sex videos of officials in Chongqing from 2008 to 2009 and trying to extort the officials afterward. The Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, also ran an editorial last month saying that spurned mistresses may not be reliable whistle-blowers in corruption cases. In addition to prosecuting extortionists, the government has also taken steps to bring order to China's unruly social media platforms, where scandalous messages can often go viral in a matter of hours. More than a year ago, the government announced a controversial new policy requiring all social media users to register with their real names. It said the move was designed to eliminate the cloak of anonymity enjoyed by rumor-mongerers, although many critics feared the policy was designed to limit free speech. Social media platforms themselves have also taken their own steps to make their users more accountable. Last year, Sina Weibo rolled out a user rating system whereby each user is rated on a scale of 10, with 1 being the least reliable and 10 the most trustworthy. The posting and spreading of unfounded rumors lowers a user's rating. The most obvious solution to these problems would be greater freedom for traditional media, which would relieve social media vigilantes of their unreliable role as government watchdogs. But in the absence of such liberalization, the Chinese government and private Internet operators will be forced to find new and innovative ways to ensure the quality of material posted on their sites.","Many corrupt officials in China exposed by vigilantes on social media .

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis put the ideals of professionalism, service and holiness to the fore Saturday in his first Christmas message to the Curia, the Roman Catholic Church's governing body. The Roman Curia, which includes Vatican staff, priests and cardinals, gathered in the ornate Clementine Hall. The pope praised those who have worked in the Vatican for ""many years with immense dedication, hidden from the eyes of the world."" The church needs ""people who work with competence, precision and self sacrifice in the fulfillment of their daily duties,"" he said. Without professionalism, Francis warned, ""there is a slow drift downwards towards mediocrity"" and ""dossiers become full of trite and lifeless information"" that fail to inspire. Without an attitude of service to bishops and churches worldwide, he said, ""the structure of the Curia turns into a ponderous, bureaucratic customs house, constantly inspecting and questioning, hindering the working of the Holy Spirit and the growth of God's people."" Holiness encompasses an openness to God, prayer, deep humility and fraternal charity in relationships with fellow workers, Francis said. ""It also means apostleship, discreet and faithful pastoral service, zealously carried out in direct contact with God's people. For priests, this is indispensable,"" he said. He also urged the Curia to avoid indulging in gossip, saying: ""Gossip is harmful to people, our work and our surroundings."" Francis has already taken a number of steps to try to reform the Vatican's administration in the nine months since he was elected to the papacy. CNN's Vatican reporter John Allen, also a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said Saturday's speech was brief but set out some core principles. ""He said very clearly he wants a Vatican that is focused on service, rather than power,"" Allen said. In July, the pope set up an expert committee to recommend reforms to the economic and administrative structures of the Holy See. He has also ordered more scrutiny of the Vatican bank, which has been plagued by financial scandals for years. Earlier this month, he announced the creation of a commission to prevent the abuse of minors and to support victims of abuse. The Catholic Church has faced calls for reform in the wake of scandals involving the sexual abuse of children by priests and allegations of corruption. Since taking charge, Francis has also shifted the tone of the church toward a focus on service, compassion and helping the poor and addressed controversial issues such as homosexuality and the role of women in the church. At his final general audience of 2013 in St. Peter's Square on Wednesday, the pope spoke about the birth of Jesus and the importance of humility. ""It is an ugly thing,"" he said, ""when you see a Christian who doesn't want to humble himself, who doesn't want to serve, a Christian who struts about everywhere: it's ugly, eh? That is not a Christian: that's a pagan!"" In a measure of the impact he's already had as pontiff, Francis was named as Time magazine's ""Person of the Year"" this month. The Vatican welcomed Time's selection, while making it clear the man so widely recognized for his own humility didn't seek the award and didn't want its light to shine on him but on the mission of the church. Pope Francis calls for big changes in Roman Catholic Church .","Pope Francis urges the Curia to be professional and to serve the rest of the church .

"(CNN) -- The Miami Dolphins have suspended Pro Bowler Richie Incognito after allegations of misconduct lodged by linemate Jonathan Martin, who left the NFL team last week in the middle of the season. Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin told reporters Monday he made the decision the previous night to suspend Incognito ""based on the information that I had at that time."" He didn't give a reason for the move. ESPN, NFL.com and other media outlets reported that representatives for Martin submitted voicemails containing racial slurs and threats of physical violence to the league and the Dolphins. One of the messages, from April, contained a reference to Martin's biracial background, according to ESPN's sources. ""Hey, wassup, you half (expletive) piece of (expletive). ""I saw you on Twitter, you been training 10 weeks. I'll (expletive) in your (expletive) mouth. I'm gonna slap your (expletive) mouth, I'm gonna slap your real mother across the face (laughter). (Expletive) you, you're still a rookie. I'll kill you."" The team said Sunday in a statement that Incognito, a nine-year veteran at offensive guard, was suspended for detrimental conduct. ""We believe in maintaining a culture of respect for one another and as a result we believe this decision is in the best interest of the organization at this time,"" the team said in a statement on its website. The Miami Herald reported that a Dolphins official said Incognito is ""done"" with the team. A Dolphins spokesman had no comment. Cafeteria incident sparked departure . Last week, the Dolphins announced Martin had taken ""a leave of absence."" Philbin said Martin left the team after an incident at the team's cafeteria. Jay Glazer, an NFL analyst for FoxSports.com, reported that some of his teammates got up from a lunch table as a joke when Martin sat down. The lineman threw his food tray hard to the ground, he reported. Glazer later tweeted the incident was a final straw for Martin. The coach said representatives for Martin contacted the team Sunday with their concerns. The Dolphins spent Sunday gathering information, after which he suspended Incognito, Philbin said. Several media outlets said Martin had left the Dolphins because of bullying, something Incognito denied on Twitter. ""Shame on you for attaching my name to false speculation,"" one of the tweets said, according to Bleacher Report. That tweet and others addressed to various media outlets were deleted later. A post from Sunday remained a day later: ""Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth -- Buddha."" Philbin said he met with Martin and also talked with members of his family before Sunday, and the second-year player didn't say anything about player misconduct. CNN reached out multiple times to representatives for each player but hasn't received comment. 'Teddy bear off the field' Chris Draft played with Incognito when both were with the St. Louis Rams in 2007 and 2008. Incognito's onfield aggressive persona was nothing like his personality away from the playing field, Draft said. ""He was really kind of a big teddy bear off the field. My wife actually loved him,"" he told CNN. The Sporting News takes a yearly poll of NFL players, and in 2009 they dubbed Incognito the dirtiest player in the league. The Rams released Incognito in December 2009 after an argument during a game with then-head coach Steve Spagnuolo. He played with the Buffalo Bills for three games before joining the Dolphins. Incognito, who played in the Pro Bowl all-star game in January, appeared to have calmed down on the field, according to a profile on NFL.com. Incognito pointed to meditation as a positive tool he used. The NFL will review the case, league spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday. ""I will tell you that if the review shows that this is not a safe atmosphere I will take whatever measures are necessary to assure that it is,"" Philbin said. ""I have that obligation to the players that I coach on a daily basis."" The NFL Players Association has said the union has not started an investigation. NFL's pecking order . Rookie Will Davis said he hasn't experienced any acts of bullying or hazing. ""I think a lot of people think of hazing as being cruel, but I don't see anything like that in this locker room,"" he said. ""But it depends on how you take hazing. I've always thought the guys in here were great."" He said everyone on the team loves Incognito. ""I was shocked,"" he said. Wide receiver Mike Wallace said there was a lot of respect for both players. ""I know both of those guys personally,"" he said. ""I feel like they are both good guys."" Former Dolphins linebacker Channing Crowder told ""Piers Morgan Live"" that a locker room is often a place where players are trying to establish a pecking order. People cannot compare it to working at a regular job, he said, because we are talking about physically aggressive men with big egos competing and trying to prove their manhood. NFL players are ""a bunch of testosterone-filled alpha males who are trying to find their place on the totem pole,"" he told CNN. He said when Incognito joined the team, he would test people to see where he stood with them. ""He is a guy that needs to know his place with you,"" Crowder said. Incognito also apparently liked to play pranks. In a segment shown on a HBO series that follows one NFL team during each preseason, Incognito figured out a teammate's iPad password. He then teased the player about a status update he made for the player and joked about the player's fiancee. ""Hard Knocks"" has given audiences a look inside team dynamics, sometimes giving viewers a glimpse at life for rookies. And inevitably some of the younger players get hazed. Hazing on the decline? Still, former Dolphins running back Ricky Williams said it occurs less frequently in the NFL than most people think. ""Really I haven't see much hazing,"" he said in an interview on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" He said its a well-known ""rite of passage"" for a high draft pick to pick up a big dinner bill for some other players on the team. ""Once you sign that contract there's a lot of rules, written and unwritten, that you are expected to follow,"" he said. ""For me, this is something that should be handled internally. I don't think the media, I don't think fans, I don't think anyone outside is really in a position to really fully understand what occurs inside of a locker room and inside of a football team.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- Twenty-year-old Li Xue has a passion for learning but has never spent a day at school. The only way she could study was by borrowing books with her elder sister's library card and begging her for lessons. As a second child born under the strictures of China's one-child policy, she was not entitled to a state education. Nor did she have access to subsidized health care that most city dwellers enjoy. She used her mother's and sister's identity cards to buy medicine when she fell ill. ""She kept asking me why she can't go to school, why she can't while all others do, and I had no idea how to respond her except repeating that she is a second child,"" her mother Bai Xiuling, a former factory worker, told CNN from her modest bare-brick home. Li says she was not jealous of her 28-year-old sister, but grateful because she tutored her in her spare time. ""I want to learn as much as she does but it's different because she can go to school and I cannot."" Her mother fell unexpectedly pregnant in 1993. Despite the risks, she went ahead with the pregnancy. A childhood bout of polio damaged her leg and she wanted to have another child to take care of her in old age. China's family planning laws require most families living in urban areas to have one child. The policy is looser in rural areas and can also be skirted by those who can afford to pay the eye-watering fines. But Li's parents could not pay the 5,000 yuan ($820) penalty and authorities denied Li her household registration documents, or ""hukou,"" which entitle city residents to subsidized health, housing and education. Reform? The one-child policy, though applauded by many for slowing down China's population growth, has been widely criticized for resulting in forced abortions and hefty fines that are sometimes used to enforce it. Some critics say the law hurts China's elderly, who typically rely on their children for support in old age, and even constrains economic growth as the working age population begins to decline. In August, Xinhua, China's state news agency, said China was deliberating relaxing the policy to allow couples, where one parent is an only child, to have two children. Currently, both parents must be sole children to be eligible for a second child. The government is also debating a two-child policy after 2015, according to state media. ""We are optimistic that an end to the one-child policy will soon be confirmed,"" economists Ting Lu and Xiaojia Zhi wrote in an August report for investment house Bank of America Merrill Lynch. They said that reform of the three-decade old policy could happen after a key four-day gathering of China's top leaders -- the Communist Party's third plenum -- which began on Saturday. But even if the policy is eased, it is unlikely to make life easier for Liand others like her. Her family have campaigned relentlessly for her to have the ""hukou"" documents they believe she is entitled to in order to live a normal life. They have petitioned local and national authorities and are pursuing their case through the legal system, but, so far, to no avail. Instead, her mother and father said they have been beaten and harassed by the local police. ""Li Xue's father and I were beaten brutally in 2001. I couldn't get out of bed for almost two months, and her sister had to take care of me,"" said Bai. Local police declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Chinese newborn, allegedly sold by doctor, is returned to parents . 'Never give up' In September, the family received notice that their case would be heard by the Beijing High People's Court but they are not optimistic that the case will be resolved in their favor. A spokesperson for the court told CNN that the case is now being examined and an announcement will be made in due course. There were two possible outcomes; either the case would be retried or the original verdict affirmed, the spokesperson said. ""The only thing we want is an explanation of why our daughter has no ""hukou"", and no more,"" said Li's father, Li Hongyu. In 2011, Li started a microblog on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. She hopes her online presence will help draw attention to her plight, and she wants to use the platform to initiate more positive change for people in her position. When asked what she would major in if she had a chance to go to university, Li says she would like to become a lawyer. ""I do enjoy studying law and hope I could use this to help other people, but right now, I have to be practical and solve my most urgent problem -- becoming a legal second child,"" she said. ""Sometimes I doubt whether what I do will change anything, but I think I'll carry on,"" she said, echoing the name of her blog -- Little Xue never give up.

"(CNN) -- Nicole and Chad Oulson, the parents of 22-month-old Alexis, didn't get many date nights, let alone an entire day together. So Nicole was delighted the two were headed to a Wesley Chapel, Florida, movie theater for some adult time. ""I was just looking forward to spending the day with the love of my life,"" a tearful Nicole Oulson said Wednesday. ""And just to think that, in the blink of an eye, my whole world just got shattered into a million pieces, and now I'm left trying to pick them up and put them all back together. And It's so hard, and it's so unbearable."" Nicole Oulson, speaking for the first time since her husband was gunned down January 13, wore a pink cast over her arm, covering a gunshot wound that police say she suffered while trying to protect her husband from Curtis Reeves that harrowing afternoon. Flanked by her attorneys, she spoke for only a minute, thanking those who have offered support and prayers in ""this horrible time of grief and sadness."" Her main focus right now is taking care of Alexis, she said. ""Right now, I'm just still trying to recover from the shock,"" she said. Asked how Alexis was handling the loss of her father, attorney TJ Grimaldi said the toddler was fortunate to be so young. ""I think we're all lucky that she's as young as she really is,"" he said. ""She doesn't understand everything right now, so all she knows, I think, is that Daddy's not there. And in my opinion, being a father, that's enough."" Reeves, a 71-year-old retired Tampa police officer, got into an altercation with Chad Oulson because Oulson was texting Alexis' babysitter during the previews for ""Lone Survivor,"" police said. The 6-foot-1, 270-pound Reeves, who was also with his wife for the matinee at the Grove 16 Theatre in suburban Tampa, left the auditorium, apparently to complain to management, police said. Reeves returned ""irritated,"" a witness said. The argument continued and popcorn was thrown. ""The defendant advised that the victim turned and stood up, striking him in the face with an unknown object,"" a police report said. ""The defendant advised that he removed the .380-semi-auto handgun from his pants pocket, firing one round, striking the victim, and that he was in fear of being attacked."" The witness said after Reeves shot Oulson, he sat down and put the gun in his lap. Attorneys Grimaldi and Stephen Leal would not discuss many details of the case, but they did address Reeves' claim of self-defense and his defense team's efforts to persuade a judge to grant him bail. ""You can claim self-defense or you can claim your client had a mental health issue,"" Leal said, explaining his opinion that Reeves' attorneys had limited options. ""It's one or the other."" Grimaldi added that Nicole Oulson ""doesn't understand what he was defending himself over."" For Reeves to be eligible for bail on his second-degree murder charge, he would have to demonstrate that he isn't a flight risk and that he poses no danger to the community. Defense attorney Richard Escobar told a judge earlier this month, to no avail, that Reeves had close ties to the community, was a former Hernando County Crime Stoppers president, lived with his wife of more than four decades in a neighboring county, and had two children, one of whom is a Tampa patrol officer with more than a decade of service. The attorney also said that Reeves was the victim in the altercation and that Chad Oulson was the ""aggressor."" Neighbors and family friends told CNN affiliates that Reeves was a friendly fellow, completely unlike the man described in news reports about the shooting. Nicole Oulson's attorneys did not discuss whether Reeves was a flight risk Wednesday, but they both expressed doubt that the community would be safe if he was released before trial. Leal said he doubts anyone could ""reasonably"" convince a judge that Reeves posed no risk to the public. ""Everyone with a cell phone is at risk. You never know when this guy's going to go off again,"" Grimaldi added. The attorneys thanked Westshore Pizza and Sky Powersports, where Chad Oulson worked, for arranging fund-raisers and setting up a memorial fund that has garnered about $20,000 for the Oulsons. The attorneys said they will manage the fund and dole out the money as needed to Nicole Oulson, whose hand is ""getting better."" Couple describes encounter with Curtis Reeves .

"(CNN) -- Forget the Loch Ness Monster -- Scotland has a new pair of mythical beasts to lure curious tourists to its shores. Standing proudly 25 miles from Edinburgh, ""The Kelpies"" are the world's largest equine sculptures, and it is hoped they'll become just as famous as old ""Nessie."" The name, rooted in Celtic folklore, refers to a supernatural water horse that was said to stalk the rivers and lochs of Scotland. Despite that fertile source of inspiration, sculptor Andy Scott opted to shun the esoteric to stay rooted in reality, creating a piece that performs a dual role -- as a monument to industry and a beacon of regeneration. ""Rather than go along the line of the mythical sea horses and all that wifty wafty Scottish stuff, I erred much more towards the heritage of workhorses and our industrial and agricultural past,"" he told CNN. ""The horses would have drawn the barges along the canals originally, so there was a great relevance with central Scotland and the Falkirk area. ""They really are quite imposing, it's a flat estuary down there and they really have a presence on the landscape and work very well against the hills. ""That sense of scale was really important to me and I've been justified in my intent there."" Standing 30 meters tall and utilizing six kilometers of steel, ""The Kelpies"" were seven years and $8 million in the making. They are part of a wider $70 million project to transform 350 hectares of land in the Forth Valley, equidistant between Edinburgh and Glasgow, in the hope that up to 350,000 tourists will visit each year. Billed under a project called ""Living Landmarks,"" the sculptures underline the impact that art on a grand scale can have in transforming an area. ""I can only hope that is what happens and they do act as a catalyst for a sense of pride and regeneration, to draw people to the area,"" Scott said. ""It would be churlish to ignore the impact of 'the Angel of the North' (by Antony Gormley), and one of my personal favorites, Anish Kapoor's 'Cloud Gate in Chicago.' ""I've been over there a few times to have a look at how it's been instrumental in regenerating that area of Millennium Park in Chicago. These things can have that effect."" So what is it about these great set-pieces that strike such a chord with the public? ""Partially, it is the scale -- the sheer monumental nature of them draws people to them,"" Scott explained. ""Media awareness, social media, word of mouth spreads the word, it spins out the attraction as it were, gives it that 'must see' status. ""Already the story of 'The Kelpies' has gone round the world and that really sets them on people's agenda and makes people want to come and see them for themselves. ""I think another thing these large pieces do is that they change as an artwork and your perception of them from a distance, when you might see them as horses on the landscape but then the closer you get they become much more of an architectural feature. ""I was determined from the beginning that the public should be allowed inside them, to actually see the engineering and the scale from the inside. ""They are recognizable objects and that immediately throws out a line of engagement with the audience that perhaps some other abstract pieces don't. ""I think the figuratively, recognizable nature of the horses seems to be drawing a fair amount of comment."" The two sculptures were modeled on actual Clydesdale horses called Barron and Duke, and Scott made two small-scale maquettes standing three meters high. The 18,000 components that made up each Kelpie were then forged in Yorkshire before they were painstakingly assembled on-site over the course of six months. Not only is the scale so striking but the dynamic between the two horses captivates too -- one looking down, the other rearing up. ""What I wanted to do was create some sense of dramatic tension between the two,"" Scott said. ""I mulled over different options of poses but I reckon that dynamic tension creates a bit of a narrative, and the viewers can make up their own stories and engage with them. ""It would have been arguably much simpler to make a mirror image of each on either side of the canal, but that certainly creates that more dramatic sight line. ""You always catch a glimpse of the other one from the other side.""","The Kelpies in central Scotland are the world's largest pair of equine sculptures .

"(CNN) -- This past Sunday's ""60 Minutes"" and the latest issue of Newsweek bring back to the fore the complicated issue of money and politics. Both highlight a new book by Peter Schweizer, ""Throw Them All Out,"" which rails against what Schweizer calls ""honest graft."" Schweizer charges that leaders from both houses of Congress have been drawing on insider knowledge to make money in the stock market -- a practice that is banned in American industry and restricted in other sectors of government.  And although he is a conservative at the Hoover Institution, Schweizer is an equal opportunity scourge, attacking both Democratic and Republican leaders. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Republican speaker John Boehner have fired back, asserting that Schweizer has misrepresented them and they have done nothing wrong. Until competent legal authorities investigate, both deserve the benefit of the doubt. The public does, of course, deserve a more thorough airing of the facts. Equally important, Congress ought to have rules about conflicts of interest that are as demanding as those for people who work in the executive and judicial branches; so far, Congress skates free. But whatever the rebuttals from Capitol Hill, this controversy underscores a deepening sense that money plays far too large a role in politics. If anything unites the tea party and the Occupy Wall Street protesters, surely it is the sense that the system is rigged in favor of big shots in Washington and against little guys back home. Money is at the heart of it. A new book that should receive far more attention makes an even more sweeping and thoroughly researched case against money in politics -- ""Republic, Lost: How Money Corrupts Congress -- and a Plan to Stop It,""  by Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig. The author is a man of many parts: Lessig made his name as a legal theorist in issues surrounding new technologies, but he also has a keen interest in politics. He was the youngest member of the Pennsylvania delegation that nominated Ronald Reagan at the Republican convention in 1980, clerked for conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and later endorsed his friend and former University of Chicago Law School colleague Barack Obama for president. Lessig, who lately has been working to organize a movement for a new constitutional convention, is disillusioned with both right and left and blasts away at them for essentially selling the republic out. But his charge is not that politicians in Washington are taking money on the side, à la Spiro ""Pass the Bags"" Agnew.  He doubts much of that goes on today.  Rather, he is deeply troubled by what he calls ""dependence corruption"" -- the degree to which politicians have become dependent on money from lobbyists in order to pay for their campaigns, and the ways in which that dependence has increasingly distorted public policy in ways that do serious harm to the country, while also (and just as perniciously) undermining public trust. His argument is wide-ranging and impossible to do justice to in a brief column. But a few of the most striking facts he marshals are worth recognizing. Among them: . -- The cost of getting elected to Congress has exploded: from 1974 to 2008, Lessig notes, the average cost of a re-election campaign ballooned from $56,000 to more than $1.3 million, a more than twentyfold increase that far outpaces inflation. -- Fundraising is a constant concern: Candidates have to spend between 30% and 70% of their time raising money. (Lobbyists, however can ease this pressure through many kinds of what Lessig calls ""legislative subsidies"" -- advice, research, support, and most of all, campaign cash.) -- The revolving door between Congress and lobbyists is spinning faster: In the 1970s, just 3% of retiring members of Congress went into lobbying. But by 2004, in the previous seven years more than half of all senators and 42 percent of House members had made the switch. -- The incentives for lobbying are clear. A 2009 paper found, for example, that firms get between $6 and $20 back for every $1 they invest in lobbying for tax benefits. With regard to taxes and regulation, Lessig's observations are particularly sharp. Business leaders argue, for example, that they are not investing as much as they might in new jobs because they face so much uncertainty that they don't know what to expect from the government from one year to the next. Many citizens are likewise baffled by some regulations and, especially, the tax code: Why is it so massive, so confusing, sometimes so seemingly wasteful and preferential? Lessig's explanation is that this complexity and uncertainty is no accident, and that's because politicians in Washington have an interest in keeping business guessing and the rest of us confused. Pass a tax law for five years and lobbyists won't need to come around with contributions for a long time; make it a one-year law and they'll be back next week. Likewise, keep the code incomprehensible, and the voters won't know if they're getting hosed. Those are fascinating insights. One of Lessig's heroes is Henry David Thoreau, and he likes to quote the American philosopher as saying, ""There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."" Lessig sees the role of money in politics as the root of the country's current ills, from health care to education to the economy. He also thinks it explains why the parties appear to have grown closer in economic ideology -- where the concentrated corporate lobbying money is -- while growing more polarized in social ideology, for which more extreme viewpoints yield a bigger haul. He is quick to note that this corruption is ""not the product of evil"" -- it leads to ""great harm,"" but is the result of ""no bin Laden."" Without ""great evil,"" Lessig reflects, he is ""not yet sure that we can muster the will to fight."" That's a deep concern, and it calls to mind the memorable formulation of the economist Charles Schultze, who once divided our problems into two categories: a wolf at the door, or termites in the basement. As a nation, we've always been a lot better at handling the first than the second. But if Lessig is right about the campaign finance system, it's a major case of termites in the basement -- and addressing it will require more than simply throwing all the bums out. In Lessig's view, it may require laying a whole new section of our foundation instead.

"(CNN) -- If you've ever been fired, you know the desire to get even with your boss. So when Jim Knight was fired from his position as head chef for The Plough, a restaurant in the UK, he had a special opportunity. He tweeted: ""Calling all chefs. Is there some sort of forum for naming and shaming bad employers?"" Someone responded: ""I Just like to use twitter"" to which he responded ""well I better get on the case ;)"" The chef created the Twitter account for his now former restaurant (with its permission, he says) back in October, but it appears his former bosses never got around to revoking his access to it. So he still had control of the public face for his former employer, and he definitely had something to say. The headline for The Plough's Twitter page now reads ""Let this be a lesson to all bad catering employers ..."" and Jim's view of events got the light of day: . ""We'd like to inform you that we've just fired our head chef,"" he wrote on the restaurant's official page. ""Unfortunately he wanted to have a weekend off this month and Christmas Day this year for family commitments so we thought we'd sack him ... yeah a week before Christmas! We don't care that he has a 7 1/2 month old baby daughter."" Nearly a full day after the tweets were posted, they've been retweeted thousands of times, and they continue to live on the website. Calls and e-mails to the restaurant from CNN have not yet been answered. But the restaurant's landlord has responded to the tweets, The Oxford Times reported Monday. ""When Jim, as head chef, informed me that he would not be working on Christmas Day, and other Sundays in the near future, I was left with little choice but to end our arrangement,"" it quoted Steve Potts as saying. ""I had been quite clear with him when he started here in October that Sundays are our busiest days of the week, and that all our chefs have to work that day."" The chef has taken to his personal page to explain his actions a bit more. ""I stand by my comments whole heartedly,"" he said . Less than 10 days before Christmas, Knight is now unemployed, but his representative says he's been offered a new job elsewhere since his actions got noticed.

"(CNN) -- As violence again roils Iraq, the United Nations reported more than 65,000 people had fled conflict areas in the past week. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in a report that those Iraqis fled from the cities of Falluja and Ramadi in Iraq's central Anbar province. More than 140,000 people have been made homeless since new fighting broke out at the end of 2013, according to Iraq's Ministry of Displacement and Migration. It is the largest displacement in Iraq since the sectarian violence of 2006-2008. That figure adds to the 1.13 million people already internally displaced and mostly residing in Baghdad, Diyala and Ninewa provinces. Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the refugee agency, told reporters in Geneva that its staff and other people in Anbar had reported many civilians were unable to leave conflict-affected areas where food and fuel were in short supply. ""Most of the recently displaced remain outside Falluja city, accommodated by relatives or staying in schools, mosques and hospitals where resources are running low,"" he said. ""Host families are having difficulties sustaining the burden of caring for the displaced."" More violence was recorded on Friday. Seven people were killed and nine others were hurt in separate incidents when Iraqi Army mortars landed in residential areas in Falluja, health officials there told CNN.","More than 65,000 have fled Falluja and Ramadi in past week .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities raided the office of a University of Florida professor on Wednesday who, along with his wife, is suspected of defrauding NASA. The FBI searched the school's Innovative Nuclear Space Power and Propulsion Institute, founded by Samim Anghaie, and his office on campus, said university spokesman Steve Orlando. Anghaie is a professor of radiological engineering. FBI spokesman Jeff Westcott would only confirm the searches on campus, referring all questions to the U.S. attorney's office. Calls to the U.S. attorney's office were not returned Wednesday. According to an affidavit filed February 19, investigators from the FBI and NASA said that since 1999, the government has awarded 13 contracts to the couple's company, New Era Technology Inc. (NETECH), and deposited $3.4 million into the company's corporate account. Investigators allege they diverted much of the money from the corporate account into personal accounts to buy cars and property. According to NETECH's Web site, the company was established in 1988 as a research and development firm to perform ""high-tech, cutting edge research."" It boasts ""a highly skilled staff of research scientists, engineers, and physicists"" and lists NASA, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy among its employers. Anghaie's wife, Sousan, is president of NETECH, which is listed under the couple's residential address in Gainesville, according to court documents. The couple have two sons; Hamid, 28, and Ali, 31. Since 2001, Hamid Anghaie, who lives in Tampa, has been director and vice president of the company. Before Hamid took over, his father had the post, according to court documents. Ali Anghaie, who lives in Manchester, Connecticut, works for an aerospace firm, Pratt & Whitney, also listed among NETECH's employers. Calls to the home of Samim and Sousan Anghaie were not immediately returned Wednesday. Authorities said the Anghaies took advantage of two federal grant programs set up to stimulate technological innovation in the private sector and strengthen the role of small businesses. Under the NETECH name, they ""submitted multiple fraudulent certified contract proposals to NASA, in order to receive the maximum funding for proposed research contracts,"" according to court documents. The couple allegedly submitted fraudulent invoices to reimburse payments to ""alleged employees,"" which ultimately resulted in the government overpaying the company, the documents say. The money was allegedly diverted to personal accounts through the intentional overpayment of employees, including Samim Anghaie, or the payments made to ""illegitimate"" employees, including the two sons, according to the documents. Samim Anghaie, who has worked for the University of Florida for nearly 30 years, has been placed on administrative leave with pay, Orlando said. CNN's Samira Simone and Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.","FBI raids office of Florida professor accused of taking money from NASA .

"(CNN) -- Minneapolis-based Caribou Coffee is closing 80 locations next week and plans to convert 88 others to Peet's Coffee & Tea shops within the next 18 months, the company announced Monday. ""Over the past few months, we at Caribou have revisited our business strategy, including closely evaluating our performance by market to make decisions that best position us for long-term growth,"" the announcement said. As a result, 80 ""underperforming"" stores will close for good on Sunday. After that, 88 other Caribou locations will become Peet's as Caribou becomes extinct or critically endangered in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, Illinois, eastern Wisconsin and Washington. When the purge is complete, Caribou plans to continue to operate 468 locations in Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, western Wisconsin, North Carolina, Denver, Colorado, and 10 international markets. Customers who have Caribou gift cards will still be able to use them at CaribouCoffee.com, the company said on Twitter. It was referring all consumer questions to the toll-free number 888-Caribou (888-227-4268). As of 2009, Caribou employed more than 6,000 people and had 2009 revenue of $262 million. The company, founded in 1992, was taken private in a $340 million deal in December 2012 by German equity company Joh.A.Benckiser Group, which also owns Peet's. Starbucks, the king of the coffee forest, reported revenue of $13.3 billion in fiscal year 2012. Fans of the rustic-themed Caribou coffee shops reacted Monday with dismay, with a certain amount of anger stirred in. Caribou's promotional Facebook page was sprinkled with comments such as, ""Out of respect for the employees who are losing their jobs the least you could do is stop these posts,"" and ""Go to hell. Why would I try it when you are closing my store in LaGrange IL and forcing good, hardworking people out of a job?"" A community called ""Caribou Coffee, putting 1,000's of people out of work"" popped up on Facebook and had 120 likes by 7 p.m. ET. Here is a sampling of comments from distraught Twitter users: .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- It's her lunch break on a sunny afternoon in Phoenix and instead of chatting with friends in the courtyard, 17-year old Maria Castro is standing in front of a white board inside Carl Hayden Community High School. She has a fat red marker in her hand and is furiously scribbling around a triangle while muttering about sine and cosine. ""We're studying for a final,"" she explains while solving for angles. ""We have a math final today."" It is mid-January, just days into the new semester, which is a strange time for a final, but then, this math class is unusual. It is taught after school and crams two years of math into two semesters. Maria, a junior, is not complaining. She's the one who lobbied for the class once she figured out during her sophomore year that she wasn't on track to take calculus before graduation. ""To get into a good university,"" she tells me earnestly, ""I have to have, at minimum, calculus."" Pushing kids to math and science . Maria's sights are set very high. Her first-choice college is Stanford University. ""She's an exemplary student. I am very proud,"" her mother tells me in Spanish as I sit on the Castro front porch. Maria is successful in high school while so many of her peers are struggling. She is studying accelerated math, honors English, honors chemistry, honors economics and she's in robotics, where she is vice president of the team. Half of them are girls. Maria's teammates call her 'Mom,' because of her tendency to nudge and encourage. And the team has been successful,  winning a roomful of awards, including one national prize. But the lessons Maria is learning are about much more than gears, sensors and computer code. ""One of the things we talk about being on a robotics team is that you can't let things happen to you. You have to go out and make things happen,"" says Faridodin ""Fredi"" Lajvardi, her robotics coach. Watch Maria in the trailer for ""Education in America: Don't Fail Me"" For Maria, that meant writing up a proposal for an accelerated math class, roping in 31 other students to take part, and then literally begging the principal to find the funding. Lajvardi -- the kids call him Ledge -- has been teaching at Carl Hayden for 23 years. The school is 94% Latino. He says most parents of his students are working-class immigrants who have survived by working in food service or landscaping. He says they have made a living without higher education and believe their children can get along that way, too, ""but that can't happen."" ""More and more of those kind of jobs are just disappearing,"" Lajvardi tells me. ""Things are getting automated. ... If you don't keep your education level up, you will be left out."" He's most worried about Latino students. They make up one-fifth of the school-age population in the United States and will be 30% of the adult population by 2050. At Maria's school, half the students don't pass Arizona's proficiency exams, which means they don't meet the bar for basic knowledge in math, reading and science. Time.com: Why the Hispanic student crisis is going ignored . Nationally, only half of Maria's Latino peers graduate on time. The reason is complicated, but stems mostly from issues connected to poverty. ""In many cases the schools lack the resources and personnel to respond adequately to student needs,"" explains Pedro Noguera, a professor of education at New York University. ""Many of the students attending such schools also feel pressure to find jobs to support themselves and their families. If they don't see college as a real option they are even more likely to dropout."" Most of the kids who attend Maria's school are poor. More than 83% of its students are eligible for free or reduced lunch. The school is ""Title I,"" meaning it receives federal assistance because it has a lot of high-poverty, high-risk students. None of Maria's six siblings who attended Hayden before her graduated from there on time. But Maria is a go-getter. Through tears, she tells me a heart-wrenching story about overhearing her father speaking with one of her favorite teachers at her quinceanera -- her 15th birthday celebration. The teacher was raving about Maria's dreams and strong academics. ""It's just a matter of time before she fails,"" Maria says she heard her dad tell the teacher. ""It doesn't really matter what she does now, she will eventually give up."" Maria recalls the story for me as tears roll down her cheeks. Where many students would be disheartened by what they heard, Maria was spurred to achieve even more. ""I kinda just took it and flipped it around like, 'Well I'm going to show you,'"" she explains. ""I can prove to myself that I can do it."" Her focus means a grueling schedule. After school, there is math class, dancing, band and taking care of her little sister, 10-year-old Azucena. And, of course, robotics. By the time she entered Carl Hayden, the school was renowned for its robotics team. The team has six weeks to build a robot from a box of parts. They compete with about 52,000 students around the globe. Those who think it's all about the robot don't fully get it. How the U.S. lags in math, science -- and how to improve . ""The robot is just the thing that gets all the kids here in one place,"" Lajvardi tells me. ""What's really important is all the working together with the different mentors and the adults learning how to deal with people, learning how to solve conflicts, learning how to solve problems ... the biggest thing is learning how to be successful and that what they do matters."" The robotics competition -- called FIRST: For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology -- was designed to get high school students interested in math and science careers. The United States ranks 27th among developed nations in the proportion of college students receiving undergraduate degrees in science or engineering. Maria doesn't need convincing. She believes hard work in math and science classes will get her where she needs to go. ""I'm competing with the rest of the world and the rest of the world isn't sleeping, isn't eating, is just going that much farther to succeed. And to be at their level, I have to be better than them. I have to try that much harder."" ""They want to be successful,"" Lajvardi says of Maria and her teammates. ""Once they find out that they're the only person that will limit what they can do, and they decide they want to do something, they're going to go for it."" He says Maria learned that lesson quickly, in her freshman year. ""And she grabbed on with both hands and she's making the most of it,"" he says. ""I want to shoot for the moon,"" Maria says repeatedly. It's become her mantra. ""In case you miss you always hit a star. Aim high. That's my thing."" So far, so good. She got an A on the math final she took the day we were with her. It's one of many she is piling up in her quest to gain entry into Stanford. But 24 of the 32 original students have dropped the math class, most of them because the material was too advanced. Her dream after college is actually to aim for the sun. She wants to become a solar engineer, a job that pays about $80,000 per year. ""All the energy the sun gives us in one hour can power the whole Earth for a whole entire year."" She wants to figure out how to control all that power. ""We need to find a way,"" she says confidently. Maria is reaching toward the sky, a big stretch for a young girl growing up in poverty in Phoenix. Maria's father, Antonio, came to the United States in the 1960s with a sixth grade education. He used to work in restaurants, but now they live off his Social Security checks. Antonio says he doesn't know how to help her with college -- these are just things he doesn't understand, and knows he can't afford. During a walk with Maria's father I ask him if he is proud of Maria and her ambitions. ""Sure. Very proud,"" he confides. And when I ask if he believes she can get into Stanford he says, ""I know she can do it."" The conversation is quick. His answers are short, but to Maria they are long on meaning. It's something he's never said to her directly. ""It's nice,"" she says with a smile. ""It's good.""","Maria Castro, 17, is an honors student despite low expectations and odds.

"(CNN) -- In my book, Physics of the Future, I make scores of predictions for this century, based on interviews with over 300 of the world's top scientists, who are inventing the future in their labs. Here are some top game-changing predictions that they make: . Fusion and space-based power . Because cheap oil will eventually run out and because burning fossil fuels drives global warming, new forms of energy are desperately needed. Within a decade, solar/wind/renewable technologies will drop in price and be competitive with oil, due to the rising cost of fossil fuels. But by 2019, fusion power becomes a major player. That is when the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) becomes operational in southern France. Costing over $10 billion dollars, it is a crash project designed from the start to generate more energy than it consumes. Rather than burning uranium (which creates vast amounts of nuclear waste and the danger of meltdowns) fusion reactors cleanly burn hydrogen, which is found in sea water. Fusion is the energy source which powers the sun, the stars, and the universe. A decade after that, commercial fusion power plants may proliferate around the world, thereby solving the energy crisis and global warming. Clean, safe, and renewable, fusion power promises to energize our economy by mid century. Space elevator . Hollywood dreams of colonizing the universe have been stunted by a simple four-letter word: C-O-S-T. It costs $10,000 per pound to just put you in near Earth orbit over the planet. That is your weight in solid gold. To put you on the Moon costs roughly $100,000 per pound. And to put you on Mars costs roughly $1,000,000 per pound, or your weight in diamonds. But late in the 21st century, a new game changer might be possible -- the space elevator, in which you simply push the ""up"" button and then the elevator climbs effortlessly into outer space, like Jack and the Beanstalk. Like a ball spinning on string, it does not fall to the Earth because of centrifugal force. Here is where nanotechnology comes in. The strongest substance known to science, stronger than diamonds, is graphene, made of a single atomic layer of carbon atoms. It is strong enough to support a space elevator without breaking. (It is so strong you can balance an elephant on a pencil, which then rests on a layer of graphene, and the graphene sheet will not tear). Read more: Car the size of a molecule . At present, we can only produce tiny, millimeter-sized portions of this pure carbon, but in the future, if we can solve the technical question of creating miles of this substance, then this technology may eventually open up outer space, so that we become a true space-faring civilization. Stop the aging process . For millennia, kings and queens have sought the Fountain of Youth without success. We still don't have it, but biotechnology may eventually allow us to stop and maybe reverse the aging process. After centuries of confusion, we now know what aging is: the build-up of errors, at the molecular, genetic, and cellular level. But it is possible to create error-correcting mechanisms which might reverse this process. At present, for example, we can double the life span of most organisms, from yeast cells, to spiders and insects, rats and mice, rabbits, dogs and cats, and now primates. Eventually, a combination of several therapies (e.g. gene therapy, caloric restriction, telomerase, sirtuins, etc.) may allow us to unlock the aging process. Already, about 60 genes have been isolated where aging seems to be concentrated. In the future, when everyone has their personal genome on a disk, we will use computers to scan millions of genomes of young people, then the genomes of the elderly, and then simply subtract. In this way, we will isolate the genes involved in aging. (For example, we are 98.5% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. But we live twice as long. So, among a handful of genes are the ones which have doubled our life span.) Our grandchildren may have the option of reaching the age of 30, and then stopping at that age for many decades to come. Intelligent machines . Artificial intelligence has proven to be more difficult than scientists originally thought back in the 1950s, when it was predicted that we would have mechanical maids, butlers, and companions by 2000. At present, our most advanced robot has the intelligence of a cockroach, barely able to recognize and navigate among simple objects in a room. But in the coming decades, great progress will inevitably take place. Our robots will eventually become as smart as a mouse, then a dog or a cat, and finally a monkey. The robotics industry may eventually become larger than the automobile industry today. Read more: The future of warfare . No one knows when a robot will approach human intelligence, but I suspect it will be late in the 21st century. Will they be dangerous? Possibly. So I suggest we put a chip in their brain to shut them off if they have murderous thoughts. But once robots surpass us in intelligence, will we wind up in the evolutionary dust bin, surpassed by our own creations? Some suspect they might put us in zoos, and throw peanuts and make us dance behind bars. This may leave open one last option: merge with our creations. This may not sound as preposterous as it first appears. And there are perks involved with merging with our robotic creations, such as immortality and perfect, superhuman bodies. The replicator . The Holy Grail of nanotechnology is the replicator, a device which can create anything from almost nothing. In science fiction, it is a chamber where you put in the raw materials, and then ask for anything you want, whether it be dinner, a computer, or jewelry. The key to creating the replicator is the ""nanobot,"" a robot the size of a molecule which can cut and rearrange molecular bonds, turning junk into valuable commodities, atom for atom. At first, this seems impossible. But actually Mother Nature has already created a nanobot. It is called a ribosome, and can cleanly cut and paste molecules together like a master welder. This allows nature to take hamburgers and French fries and then convert them into a baby in nine months. However, it may take a century to master the intricate art of reshaping matter from almost nothing. But when it happens, we will be able to take a rabbit out of a hat, literally, and change civilization in the process. Hunger and poverty may be banished if everyone had a replicator. This could open up a Golden Age for humanity.

"(CNN) -- Brazil's image as host of next year's FIFA World Cup took a hit Sunday when police fired tear gas at fans of rival football teams during a deciding league match in Santa Catarina state. The fighting erupted in the stands just 10 minutes into the game Vasco da Gama needed to win to have a spot in the top league division. Their rival, Atletico Paranaense, had scored the first goal when people in the stands started throwing punches and kicks. One man wielded a metal pipe and swung it toward a fallen fan. Security forces fired tear gas into the crowd. The game was interrupted, and a helicopter landed on the field to take away an injured spectator. Photos from the stadium show emergency workers carrying bloodied fans on stretchers. Dr. Jose Eduardo Dias, one of the first doctors to arrive at the scene, said three people were critically injured. ""One was taken by the helicopter, and two others were taken on an ambulance,"" he told SporTV, a sister network of CNN affiliate TV Globo. There were 80 private security guards inside the stadium when the fight broke out, Military Police Cmdr. Adilson Moreira told SporTV. Afterward, there were 160 government troops inside, he said. Moreira said he didn't think heavier policing would have stopped the brawl. ""The fight could have broken out even if we were policing the area,"" he said. ""It is the culture of the Brazilian fan. When they want to fight, they come to the stadium ready to fight. And unfortunately, even with our presence, this would have happened."" Vasco's goalkeeper Alessandro Oltramari told SporTV that he could see all the violence. ""This is very regrettable, especially since the country will be hosting the World Cup next year. It's regrettable when things like this happen,"" he said. Tensions were high coming into the game between the Vasco and Atletico-PR teams in the final round of a high-profile tournament. Days earlier, a post on a website for Atletico-PR's fans warned that violence was possible. ""Because of the high risk of fights and confrontations on the road and in regards to the high number of fans from rival teams coming to the last round of games,"" the website said, ""we will not be selling tickets to women or children."" The game resumed after more than an hour, and Vasco lost 5-1.

"London, England (CNN) -- The portrayal of alien life on far-flung planets has been a favorite storyline for filmmakers down the years and is a perennial hit with audiences. ""Avatar"" has proved no different with the film doing record business at the box-office. Director James Cameron's latest offering has once again renewed speculation that a real-life alien moon ""Pandora"" could be found. Scientists all over the world are constantly gazing skywards looking for life in the distance reaches of the universe and powerful telescopes like Hubble and NASA's recently launched Kepler telescope are casting light into new previously undiscovered corners of the universe. Colin Stuart, an astronomer at the world famous Greenwich Observatory in London told CNN: ""With cutting edge technology now, we can start to look at the composition of the atmosphere of those planets. The tell-tale signs are oxygen and methane."" If you find those two gases, you could find life. And with the latest technology astronomers expect to transform our knowledge of the solar system and hopefully confirm once and for all the existence of alien life. Launched in 2009 NASA's Kepler mission is already showing the potential to detect Earth-sized objects. On Monday NASA announced that the Kepler telescope had discovered five exoplanets (planets beyond our solar system). Lisa Kaltenegger, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, thinks that there is every chance a real-life Pandora already exists and is just waiting to be discovered. ""Alien moons orbiting gas giant planets may be more likely to be habitable than tidally locked Earth-sized planets or super-Earths,"" Kaltenegger said in a Harvard Smithsonian press release last month. ""We should certainly keep them in mind as we work toward the ultimate goal of finding alien life."" When NASA launches the James Webb Space Telescope in 2014, Kalteneggar believes that if Earth-sized objects are found the telescope will be able to study their atmospheres and detect key gases like carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water vapor. ""If Pandora existed, we potentially could detect it and study its atmosphere in the next decade,"" she said.","James Cameron film ""Avatar"" sparks renewed interest in real-life aliens being discovered .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia and the United States share principles of unity and tolerance and both can benefit from strengthened ties that will bolster trade and combat terrorism, President Obama said in a highly anticipated speech Wednesday. The address at the University of Indonesia was considered a highlight of Obama's two-day stop in the southeast Asian nation where he spent four years of his childhood. As the nation with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia was chosen as the site for Obama to further address U.S. relations with the Islamic world following his speech on the topic last year in Cairo, Egypt. He referred specifically to the Cairo speech of June 2009, noting he called there ""for a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world -- one that creates a path for us to move beyond our differences."" ""I said then, and I will repeat now, that no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust,"" Obama said. At the same time, he promised that ""no matter what setbacks may come, the United States is committed to human progress."" America ""is not, and never will be, at war with Islam,"" Obama insisted. ""Instead, all of us must defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates, who have no claim to be leaders of any religion -- certainly not a great world religion like Islam."" Indonesia has been rocked by terror attacks such as bombings on Bali in 2002 and 2005, and Obama noted the nation's progress ""in rooting out terrorists and combating violent extremism."" However, Muslims staged rallies across Indonesia on Sunday to protest the American president's visit, and about 20,000 people attended the demonstrations, a spokesman for a protest group said. ""We don't see the differences between Obama and (former U.S. President George W.) Bush. They both oppress Muslims. They both have blood on their hands,"" said Ismail Yusanto, a spokesman for the Muslim group Hizbut Tahrir. ""That's why we reject Obama and we don't believe that he's reaching out to Muslims."" In his speech Wednesday, Obama reflected on his years in Indonesia, referring to how he and his family were warmly accepted. He got cheers when he sprinkled sayings from the local Malay language, such as ""Selamat Datang"" -- a greeting of welcome -- and the national motto ""Bhinneka Tunggal Ika,"" which means ""unity in diversity."" Noting that Malay is one of hundreds of languages of the archipelago nation, Obama lauded Indonesia for its spirit of inclusiveness despite its diverse population and history of dictatorship. ""But even as this land of my youth has changed in so many ways, those things that I learned to love about Indonesia -- that spirit of tolerance that is written into your constitution, symbolized in your mosques and churches and temples standing alongside each other; that spirit that is embodied in your people -- that still lives on,"" he said. Now, Obama said, he returned as the U.S. president seeking ""a deep and enduring partnership"" with Indonesia, ""because as vast and diverse countries; as neighbors on either side of the Pacific; and above all as democracies -- the United States and Indonesia are bound together by shared interests and shared values."" ""America has a stake in an Indonesia that is growing, with prosperity that is broadly shared among the Indonesian people -- because a rising middle class here means new markets for our goods, just as America is a market for yours,"" Obama said. The U.S. leader called for Indonesia's continued development and warned that would require ""a refusal to tolerate the corruption that stands in the way of opportunity,"" along with a commitment to transparency and protecting the freedom being honored on the Heroes' Day holiday Wednesday marking Indonesian independence. ""Our nations show that hundreds of millions who hold different beliefs can be united in freedom under one flag,"" Obama said. ""And we are now building on that shared humanity -- through the young people who will study in each other's schools; through the entrepreneurs forging ties that can lead to prosperity; and through our embrace of fundamental democratic values and human aspirations.""

"(CNN) -- Frigid weather that gripped much of the United States created a crisis in northwest Nevada, where rescue teams have been searching a mountainous area for two adults and four children. James Glanton, 34, and Christina MacIntee, 25, are missing, along with a 10-year-old, two 4-year-olds and a 3-year-old, the Pershing County Sheriff's Office said. The six set out Sunday for Seven Troughs mountain range and haven't been seen since. Fears for their safety grew as the temperature was expected to hit 6 below zero Tuesday night. Amanda Fitzpatrick, mother of the 10-year-old, Shelby Fitzpatrick, told CNN's Piers Morgan in a telephone interview that she'd joined the search. Rescue teams have tried to stay positive, she said. ""It's been extremely hard, probably the hardest 24 to 36 hours of my life,"" she said. ""It's my baby girl."" The relationship between the two adults and the other children was unclear. At least 15 people have died because of the weather, mostly in traffic accidents. Eight died in Oklahoma alone, including a 6-year-old who fell through ice on a creek in Tulsa and men who died in house fires in Westville and Tulsa, the state Department of Emergency Management reported on Monday. Temperatures across the country are expected to stay very low, usually 10 to 20 degrees below normal, for the rest of the week in regions struggling after days of wintry weather, according to the National Weather Service. Dallas is still trying to shake off the effects of a weekend ice storm and had about 20,000 customers without power on Monday, according to power company Oncor. Anchorage, Alaska, has been warmer than St. Louis and Denver. ""It's very unusual,"" CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said. ""This literally spreads across the entire U.S., and we're 12 days from the official start of winter."" Even if snow leaves, the cold will remain. More sleet, snow and freezing rain will smack Washington on Tuesday morning. The storm will move off the East Coast in the afternoon and night, the National Weather Service said, but the mercury won't rise above freezing until Friday. The forecast is about the same for Philadelphia and New York City, though those cities won't see temperatures above 32 until days later. Portland, Oregon, should have more snow and freezing rain this week; Chicago, too. The nation's airports appear to be getting back to normal. The website Flightaware.com says only 304 flights have been canceled for Tuesday, up from 1,700 on Monday and 2,600 on Sunday. Florida is pretty much the only place in the country to escape the cold, with Punta Gorda, a town on the Gulf Coast, reporting Sunday's national high temperature of 87 degrees. Mimi Huddleston, a bartender at Harpoon Harry's, has a message for the rest the country, and to her credit, it's not ""nyah nyah."" ""We live in paradise,"" she said Monday. ""Snowbirds"" from the North who come in for a drink are always talking about the weather back home. ""They say it's too cold for them and they like it here."" The country's coldest spot on Monday was Daniel, a community of about 150 people in western Wyoming. It registered 29 degrees. Rachel Grimes of the Sublette County Chamber of Commerce said people are busy ""recreating"" on skis and snowmobiles. ""We normally don't get cold weather like this until after the holidays,"" she said. ""The wind is blowing today, so it feels colder."" Tuesday's storm in the East could drop up to 5 inches of snow in Virginia before moving out to sea, the National Weather Service said. Much of the Plains and Rocky Mountains will stay very cold through Wednesday, with the lowest temperatures probably found in the higher elevations of the Great Basin eastward through the Dakotas and into Minnesota. Travel will remain hazardous in spots. In Arizona, a Saturday night snowstorm stranded 300 vehicles along Interstate 15. Rigs jackknifed and passenger cars slid into rigs, causing chain-reaction crashes and an enormous backup, Arizona Department of Public Safety Officer Bart Graves said. Authorities shut the interstate for more than 12 hours to clear it. ""We had travelers running out of gas. They provided them food, water and blankets,"" Graves said. Some residents in the Dallas suburb of Plano had to deal with an unusual danger: sheets of ice cascading from buildings to the sidewalks and streets. ""The apocalypse has started,"" one man said shortly before layers of ice fell onto cars. Late Sunday night in New York, there was a 20-car pileup on the Bronx River Parkway. Forty people were injured, none seriously, authorities said. Along Interstate 95 outside Stamford, Connecticut, Paul Lee captured frightening video of cars sliding and spinning across ice. Freezing rain is expected to fall from central Virginia to southeast New York on Monday. Some parts could see up to a quarter-inch of ice.

"(CNN) -- In a controversial essay published on his website Sunday, popular British graffiti artist Banksy criticized the design of One World Trade Center, referring to the building as a ""shyscraper"" and a ""betrayal."" The famously anonymous British street artist describes the building, which will be completed in 2014, as ""vanilla"" and ""something they would build in Canada."" He added, ""It looks like it never wanted to be built in the first place."" According to The New York Times, Banksy submitted the op-ed -- entitled ""The biggest eyesore in New York is not the graffiti, argues Banksy, it's under construction at ground zero"" -- and artwork, but the paper declined to publish it. ""We couldn't agree on either the piece or the art, so it was rejected,"" Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The New York Times, told CNN. Instead, Banksy published the scathing piece on his blog, which he has been using to unveil new works of art around New York from his monthlong series ""Better Out Than In."" ""Today's piece was going to be an op-ed column in the New York Times. But they declined to publish what I supplied,"" Banksy wrote on his site. Instead he took his familiar graffiti medium, stenciling, ""This site contains blocked messages,"" on a wall in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. In his essay, Banksy writes the tower is a construction sign that says New York has lost its nerve. ""It would be easy to view One World Trade Centre as a betrayal of everyone who lost their lives on September 11th, because it so clearly proclaims the terrorists won,"" he wrote. New Yorkers who were directly affected by the attacks on September 11, 2001, were insulted by Banksy's remarks. ""I think it's a disgrace to New York City and all the families who lost loved ones on 9/11,"" said former fire department Deputy Chief Jim Riches, whose firefighter son, Jimmy, was one of nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks. ""The attacks of September 11th were an attack on all of us and we will live out our lives in their shadow. But it's also how we react to adversity that defines us. And the response? 104 floors of compromise?"" wrote Banksy. ""He is looking for publicity,"" Riches said, ""I don't think anyone should care what he says."" Designed by architect David Childs of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, One World Trade Center is a 1,776-foot tall, 3.5-million-square-foot building that includes office space, an observation deck and high-end restaurants, according to the World Trade Center website. It is one of five skyscrapers to be built at the site. ""To have the marker in the sky is an important thing for people traveling around the city. But as a marker, it also says downtown is back. It now has a place that responds to the midtown of New York that was missing for so long,"" Childs told CNN in April 2012. During his visit to New York, Banksy has also referenced September 11 in a street art stencil of the Twin Towers in Tribeca. He placed an orange daisy near where the planes struck the north tower. Sally Regenhard, a leading voice for families of 9/11 victims, lost her firefighter son, Christian in the attacks. ""To me it wasn't a flower. It looked like an explosion, a fire explosion,"" said Regenhard. Regenhard told CNN she is not against Banksy. ""It's just a PR thing,"" Regenhard said. ""I'm more concerned with the safety of the building than design."" Riches looks forward to the new skyscraper. ""It's part of our skyline,"" Riches said. ""It's what future generations will look at."" Century 21 Department Store had planned to show Banksy's work starting Tuesday, but after the artist's essay, the iconic retailer has reconsidered. ""Due to recent controversial comments, Century 21 Department Store has decided to cancel the Banksy exhibit,"" said spokeswoman Heather Feinmel. The Century 21 in downtown Manhattan is very close to the World Trade Center and had to be evacuated after the building was badly damaged on September 11. The store was closed for five months before reopening at the same location. Banksy was not directly involved with the show.","Banksy criticizes design of One World Trade Center, calling it a ""shyscraper""

"(CNN) -- Despite being an 18-time world-record holder, Japanese swimmer Mieko Nagaoka is determined to win more medals and break more world records. But Nagaoka is not your average ambitious sportswoman. She is 99 years old and only took up swimming when she was in her early 80s. ""I don't care about my age,"" says Nagaoka. ""I can't believe I'm 99. I still feel I like challenging everything."" Her coach is also full of praise for Nagaoka, saying she is ""the type who just doesn't want to be defeated and is strongly determined to win more gold medals, world records."" See also: The ancient forests of Yakushima, Japan's eco-paradise . Nagaoka is among a growing number of elderly Japanese who not only challenge but also shatter stereotypes of what aging means in the country. Japan's demographic crisis is well-known: around one quarter of the Japanese population -- 31.86 million -- are 65 or older, according to government figures published in September, a record high. It is estimated there are over 54,000 centenarians, a 6% increase from 2012. With the world's longest life expectancy (84 years), and one of the lowest birthrates, Japan is expected to see sales of adult diapers overtake those of baby diapers by 2020. However not all senior citizens are enjoying retirement. With 1 in 5 senior citizens employed, according to the Statistics Bureau of Japan, the country has the highest proportion of working seniors in the developed world. Financial necessities and boredom are among the most commonly cited reasons. But even if they don't have to work for a living, many elderly Japanese don't want to live in isolation. Though not all can replicate the active achievements of Mieko Nagaoka, many senior citizens still have enough energy to spare or keep an active social life. Take for example, the Pom Pom Grannies, a cheerleading squad with an average age of 67. The routines are not just a physical exercise, according to the 81-year-old founder Fumie Takino, but help keep one's mind sharp as well. In an attempt to deal with swelling pension costs, Japan is gradually raising the retirement age to 65, from 60 last year. See also: Mapping Mount Fuji with Google Street View . But, active seniors say the public is so used with the stereotype image of the elderly who are frail or walking with a cane that many Japanese have difficulties with the idea of seeing the elderly stay active, let alone shouting and prancing with a pom-pom. ""Some people deny, cannot accept us. Why?"" says Takino. ""Japanese senior ladies are supposed to be decent and, you know... not this."" Many of the women shared their bewilderment at the younger generation. ""They just play on this, er, what do you call it? Facebook? They don't talk much. They just exchange on this Facebook. That's not good thing,"" says Takino. That is surely one lesson these active seniors can teach the younger generation. Yenni Kwok contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- ""Sehwag, go back to Ranji!"" The jingoistic crowd was screaming when the portly batsman Virender Sehwag was dismissed in the game between the Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Daredevils in an Indian Premier League (IPL) semi-final game in 2008. That Sehwag was one of India's leading players of the decade apparently didn't matter. The spectators were delivering their ultimate insult: Telling him to go back to the staid version of the Indian domestic circuit, the Ranji Trophy. The crowd IPL attracted was different from the traditional Anglophile test cricket fan. They were raucous, participative and young. They were happy to see legends succeed, and happier to see them fail if they played for rival teams. The fans were united -- and partisan. Six years after that inaugural edition, the world's top cricket players have once again been put up for sale in the annual IPL auction. The auction is the televised sale of cricket players to IPL franchises through an open bidding process. This year's auction is marked by rule changes which ""nudge"" teams into buying players from other teams rather than retain existing squads. The league has exploded into a brand estimated to be worth more than $3 billion, negotiating huge deals with TV and sponsors and getting the force of India's huge fan base behind it. The IPL's rapid rise has not been without hiccups. As the auction gets under way a high profile report on match fixing suggests a deep rot in Indian cricket overall and the IPL in particular. But, as fans debate whether even average players should be paid more than 200 times the average Indian's annual income for less than 20 hours of ""real"" work, it is worth considering how the IPL became such a force in world sport. To do that, we need to step back more than 160 years. In 1850, cricket was much bigger than baseball in parts of the United States. Newspapers in New York and Philadelphia reported cricket more often than baseball. The moment was right for a great England-U.S. cricketing rivalry, but cricket then was run with a more imperial mind-set, and Britain's colonies and dominions such as Australia, New Zealand and the West Indies were more compliant territories to establish the game. Then AG Spalding, a leading baseball pitcher of the 1870s, spotted the gap in the U.S. market for a people's ball game. He positioned baseball as a ""made in America"" game. In doing so, he relegated cricket into a colonial relic and launched a sporting empire. And so, for decades, America snubbed cricket. Then, just a few years ago, the sport started morphing into something distinctly American. In 2006 Andrew Wildblood, from sports marketing group IMG, and Lalit Modi, a scion of the Godfrey Philips cigarette empire, realized that the game of test cricket had one problem: length. To be precise, five days in the sun. Even the one-day game lasts more than six hours, which is about three times the attention span of young India. Modi and Wildblood would have known that a shorter game would attract more fans, and began developing a proposal based on this. The shorter, Twenty20 structure had already being trialled successfully around the world. Each side would get only twenty overs or 120 legitimate deliveries to play. However the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI), the world's biggest cricket ""market,"" resisted the new format. But Modi understood that eyeballs, not duration of game, would determine advertising revenue. He then single-handedly took an English game and single-mindedly Americanized it for a new India. Modi, a U.S. college graduate, understood the NFL, the NBA and Major League Baseball, and applied his insights to the new project. This led to his meteoric rise in Indian cricket in the hierarchy, followed by a fall from grace. But how did he overcome resistance from BCCI? It was set on its path to success in 2007, when media house Zee Entertainment Enterprises launched a rival Twenty20 league, called the Indian Cricket League. This forced BCCI into the arms of Modi as they tried to compete. Other factors played also into the IPL's success, including timing. The league was launched just after a rookie Indian team unexpectedly won the World Twenty20 Cup in 2007 in South Africa. The younger generation of fans could relate to this game and to the new stars easily. Modi's IPL business model was conceived using the proven American sports franchise model. The tactics included copying the NFL Draft with the IPL auction, cheerleaders and plenty of timeouts for advertising. Like the Superbowl, Modi embraced showbiz. Katy Perry performed at one of the opening ceremonies. To this ""Made in America"" mix, Modi added Bollywood. For years, cinema and cricket had been the principal forms of escapism for Indians. By having film stars involved in the league either as owners or ambassadors, the IPL was to provide a double dose of escapism at one shot. In another savvy move, star players were allocated to specific franchises, ensuring they were identifiably ""Indian,"" while international cricketers created a global feel. Franchisee owners were in ferocious competition, leading to a disproportionate investment in players and marketing. Finally, there was luck. In the inaugural game, New Zealander Brendon McCullum played one of the greatest Twenty20 innings, and the nation was hooked. The IPL energized cricket in India. It is unabashedly capitalist, has brought a new generation of fans to the game and brought financial windfalls to players. However, like an unregulated banking industry, it is now in a race against its own inability to set and implement ground rules on ethics, codes of conduct and self-discipline. Whether it will be remembered as cricket's greatest party or its biggest hangover will depend on how fast the administrators can convince fans and media that the games they are watching are clean. Meanwhile, as the IPL franchises compete in an open market for players this week, it is also time to reflect whether the auction is confirmation that cricket's soul is now no longer English but American.

"(CNN) -- It was a quiet Sunday morning in Johannesburg and I was photographing people who were registering to vote. It was my third day in South Africa and I was wondering if I'd made a mistake, hopping on a plane and flying for over 20 hours to document a struggle that I had made my struggle since I was 10 years old, growing up in Detroit. Then the serenity of the scene was pierced by a thunderous noise and a succession of pops that I thought were gunshots. I ran for cover behind an open van door. I looked up and realized that a bomb had exploded. I paused in fear, then touched the small cross that my grandmother had placed on me before I left the States, clutched my camera tightly and ran towards the bomb -- as if I'd been doing that all my life. On that Sunday morning, the struggles for freedom in South Africa became all too real to me. As an only child raised by a single mother in the inner city of Detroit, I was fascinated with South Africa, her racial divide and her struggles. I was in middle school when I first really understood what apartheid in South Africa meant. Black children, just like me, being beaten and segregated by the ruling government. The cruelty. The injustice. It just wasn't fair. So, I couldn't imagine that years later I'd be standing next to and ultimately spend significant time with the hero of that struggle, Nelson Mandela. As a photojournalist, I've had the privilege of covering Mandela nearly a half dozen times over the past two-and-a-half decades. I was there when he was elected in 1994. And when he was inaugurated a few days later. I watched as he raised his hand and took the oath, rising from prisoner to president. I was with him for his retirement in 1999 and his 90th birthday celebration at his tribal home in Qunu in 2008. Related: 91 world leaders head to South Africa to honor titan . There will never be another like Nelson Mandela. I'm so grateful to have met and briefly gotten to know him through my lens. I first covered Mandela in 1990 right after his release from prison, when he visited Detroit where he was honored and received his UAW union card at the Ford factory. He was honored for his work with and support for organized labor. On his visit I was at once touched by how amazingly pleasant he was after having been imprisoned for 27 years. There wasn't even a hint of the bitterness or anger. His calmness puzzled me. I understood clearly that he had struggled through great oppression, but how could he have emerged so at peace? How could anyone endure such pain and forgive his enemies? It was 1997, three years after I witnessed Mandela become President of South Africa. I had decided to attend Bill Clinton's presidential inauguration, but wasn't sure what angle I was going to take. While journalists and everyone else were obviously there for Clinton, I found out ""Madiba"" -- a term of endearment for Mandela -- was going to be there. I said to myself, ""That's who I'm interested in."" As I wrestled through the logistics and security, I was told by someone at the door, ""Not only will you not get a photograph of him, you won't be able to get in a room with him."" In a moment of self-doubt, I believed that. Then I remembered his own struggle, what he went through. In that moment I determined I would not -- I COULD NOT -- be deterred. Well, I not only got in a room with Mandela -- thanks to the encouragement of a man named Floyd who worked in Rep. John Conyers' office -- I photographed him and was able to talk with him. After I was initially turned away, it was Floyd who told me that I could do anything I set my mind to. I have always been believed that you have to act like you belong, so with that in my mind and the extra encouragement, I managed to talk my way into the room. I explained to President Mandela that I had been selected to be in the motorcade when he was in Detroit a few years earlier, and that I was honored then, as now, to photograph him. I don't remember what he said, His lips moved but I probably couldn't hear him over the loud beating of my heart. I do remember he smiled. That smile. Although my heart was fluttering, I was able to stand right in front of Nelson Mandela as he smiled and patiently waited for me to take the picture. I didn't just photograph him; he graciously let me take pictures with him. The last time I photographed Mandela was at his home in Qunu, for his 90th birthday celebration. During the party, there was a special moment for me when I just waved at him and he smiled at me. I couldn't believe it. The way he smiled, I was in awe. He was so gracious, so down to earth, so real, that there was no logical reason for me to feel awestruck. Nelson Mandela comes into the world only once. He was someone who not only wanted peace, but lived his life full of love, so much so he was able to forgive his enemies and strive for unity. When you were in his presence, he gifted you with his genuine smile and strong spirit; he generated a sense of calm serenity. It was as if he knew something the rest of us did not, and clearly, he did. In my eye -- and in my lens -- his is the standard for leadership based in love. I look at things differently because of him. The experience of being exposed to Nelson Mandela has made this little girl from Detroit grow into an unapologetic, world-travelled woman, inspired to remain fearless in the face of adversity. Madiba changed my life, my world and how I see it. Forever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Monica Morgan.","Monica Morgan first photographed Nelson Mandela during his visit to the U.S. in 1990 .

"(CNN) -- At dinnertime the other evening I walked into a seafood restaurant in a small strip mall off U.S. 41 in southwestern Florida. The dÃ©cor was faithful to an under-the-ocean theme, right down to bubbling water behind portholes built into one wall. Along a corridor, on the door to the men's room, was a framed photograph of a young, smiling Kirk Douglas. You couldn't look at it without grinning. Even if you had never set eyes on him in your life, you would know in a glance that this guy was some sort of star. The business he was in -- the movie-star business -- has always been built on instant visceral reaction. You've got star quality, or you don't. With Kirk Douglas, there was never a question. He was golden. I bring this up because Sunday is Douglas' birthday. He is turning -- believe it or not -- 96. He is the last man standing of all the great name-above-the-title stars of Hollywood's so-called Golden Age. John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, Jimmy Stewart, Clark Gable -- all of them, except him, gone. I knew exactly why that photograph of Douglas was on the door to the men's room in the submarine-themed restaurant. One of Douglas' most unforgettable movies was 1954's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,"" adapted from the Jules Verne saga. Douglas played the swashbuckling seafarer Ned Land. From the archives: Kirk Douglas, 92, takes stock of his life . It was the first favorite movie of my life. I must have seen it at least six times in the big palace of a downtown theater in our Midwestern hometown. I kept making my parents take me. The whole movie was thrilling, but one scene topped them all: . Douglas, in a red-and-white-striped T-shirt, a guitar in his hands, sang a song called ""Whale of a Tale"" to his shipmates: . ""Got a whale of a tale to tell you, lads. . . ."" No textbooks are needed to define what constitutes star quality. That one bit of film contains all the information necessary. About 25 years ago, I saw in the paper that ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" was scheduled to be broadcast in prime time on ABC. This was in the pre-YouTube, pre-Netflix era; if a wonderful old movie was going to be aired, your one shot at seeing it was at the whim and convenience of a network. I eagerly awaited -- especially for the chance to see and hear Kirk Douglas sing ""Whale of a Tale"" one more time. I watched the movie -- every minute of it. No ""Whale of a Tale."" They had cut it out, for time reasons. ""Edited for television."" I couldn't believe they'd done it. The next morning, I remembered that I knew someone who knew someone who claimed to know Kirk Douglas. I made a few phone calls, and was given a California number that I was told was Douglas' business office. I called, expecting to leave a message. And Kirk Douglas picked up the phone. I asked him if he'd heard about how the movie had been edited. He hadn't. ""I rarely watch my own films,"" he said. ""They're for other people, not for me."" I told him that ""Whale of a Tale"" had been taken out of the TV version. He became livid. Furious. ""That's a sacrilege,"" he said. ""I had no idea they'd done that. If they can't use 'Whale of a Tale,' then they shouldn't run the picture at all."" I could barely concentrate on what he was saying, because it was hard enough processing the fact that I was talking with Kirk Douglas. ""It was really a rollicking song that everyone liked,"" he said. ""'20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' holds a very special place in my heart, because it was the movie that made me a star to young kids. In my earlier movies I had played rather rough characters -- characters that kids probably shouldn't have seen. But when I played Ned Land in '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,' all of a sudden I had a whole new audience."" From the archives: Douglas deals frankly with stroke, depression . And then, in the middle of our conversation, without prompting, he did something that will stay with me forever. He started to sing ""Whale of a Tale"" over the telephone: . ""Got a whale of a tale to tell you lads, a whale of a tale or two. . ."" The sound of that voice, across all the years. The magic of a movie star: . "". . .'bout the flapping fish and the girls I've loved, on nights like this with the moon above, a whale of a tale and it's all true, I swear by my tattoo."" Being 96 is often not much fun for those who make it to that age, and Douglas has battled health problems in recent years. The last of those legends with the special something that turns out to be eternal. All those indelible roles, in ""A Letter to Three Wives"" and ""Ace in the Hole"" and ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" and ""Strangers When We Meet"" and ""Spartacus"" and ""Seven Days in May"". . . . When Douglas started making pictures, Charlie Chaplin was still acting in movies. Douglas' son Michael has already had a long and full movie career. Ninety-six. I stood in that restaurant and looked at him grinning off the painted door, the wattage of the smile above his cleft chin undimmed. Happy birthday, sir. What a life for Issur Danielovitch, as he was named by his parents on December 9, 1916, in Amsterdam, New York -- what a life for the self-described ragman's son who decided he would be Kirk Douglas, and see where that might take him. A whale of a tale, and it's all true. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene .","Bob Greene says Kirk Douglas is Hollywood's last remaining Golden Age idol .

"(CNN) -- U.S. intelligence officials would not rule out the possibility on Tuesday that admitted National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden has been meeting secretly with Russian authorities, who have given him asylum from U.S. prosecution. The subject of Russia dominated a House Intelligence Committee hearing, featuring testimony from the director of national intelligence, as well as the heads of the CIA, FBI, and Defense Intelligence Agency. DNI James Clapper told lawmakers it was ""certainly a possibility"" Russian intelligence services have spoken with Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor whose disclosure of sensitive surveillance methods has caused a political uproar. ""I would find it incredulous if they didn't,"" said Clapper, about any efforts to influence Snowden by the FSB, Russia's state security organization. At least a half-dozen lawmakers raised broader concerns about Russia's global influence in areas like: . -- The civil war in Syria, where Russia has long supported the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. -- Support of Ukraine's current leadership, whose policies have prompted massive citizen demonstrations in the capital Kiev in recent weeks. -- The Winter Olympics, which begin later this week in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. U.S. officials have raised concerns about what they call a lack of security cooperation to ensure the safety of American athletes and interests. ""I do think that this is somewhat reflective of current leadership in Russia,"" said Clapper. ""I think there is clearly a desire to return to great global power status. And I think that colors the behavior of the Russian government in the pursuit of their interests in which they are competitive with us."" Committee chairman Mike Rogers pressed FBI Director James Comey about whether journalists or news organizations could be held accountable for publishing sensitive material Snowden might still have in his possession. Documents he has admitted taking from secure NSA databases were exposed last summer, revealing the existence of vast American surveillance of electronic metadata relating to phone records and e-mail. ""So if I'm a newspaper reporter for, fill-in-the-blank, and I sell stolen material, is that legal because I'm a newspaper reporter?"" Rogers, a Michigan Republican, asked. ""Right, if you're a newspaper reporter and you're hocking stolen jewelry, it's still a crime,"" Comey replied. Rogers then asked: ""And if I'm hocking stolen classified material that I'm not legally in possession of, for personal gain and profit, is that not a crime?"" Comey responded: ""I think that's a harder question, because it involves a newsgathering function. It could have First Amendment implications."" He would not talk specifics, calling the Snowden leaks an ""active investigation."" Clapper later said less than 10 percent of the documents Snowden allegedly took with him overseas has to do with ""domestic surveillance."" He also had a personal message for Snowden, who has been charged in federal court with espionage. ""Snowden, for his part, claims that he's won and that his mission is accomplished,"" said Clapper. ""If that's so, I call on him and his accomplices to facilitate the return of the remaining stolen documents that have not yet been exposed to prevent even more damage to U.S. security."" Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, highlighted concern over the Olympics, and whether Muslim fundamentalists in disputed regions of Russia -- or other groups -- could launch deadly attacks on selected targets. Russian security forces have cracked down on suspected militants in the restive North Caucasus republic of Dagestan and elsewhere in recent weeks, after twin suicide bombings in the city of Volgograd in December. ""The primary threat, from a terrorism perspective, comes from Imarat Kavkaz, probably the most prominent terrorist group in Russia. It's made its intent clear to seek to carry out attacks in the run-up to the games,"" said Olsen. ""We think the greater danger from a terrorist perspective is in potential for attacks to occur outside of the actual venues for the games themselves in the area surrounding Sochi or outside of Sochi in the region."" Against that backdrop, was the announcement on Tuesday that U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul would leave his post later this month. He cited a desire to return to his family in California. McFaul has been a controversial figure in Russia, with some state-run media viewing him with suspicion for his outspoken support of pro-democracy groups. One U.S. senator had tough words for Russia, while praising McFaul for his efforts to implement President Barack Obama's ""reset"" policy to improve relations with Moscow. ""I have been deeply disturbed by the campaign of harassment the Russian government initiated and supported against Ambassador McFaul throughout his admirable service in Moscow,"" said Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican. ""In my view, such conduct by the Russian government warrants concern for other U.S. officials working in the country.""","Top U.S. intelligence official said it was possible Russian intelligence has spoken to Snowden .

"New York (CNN) -- Two New York state men have been charged in a bizarre plan to develop a mobile X-ray system that would be used from afar to silently kill people that they deemed ""undesirable,"" federal officials said. Glendon Scott Crawford, 49, and Eric J. Feight, 54, were arrested Tuesday after an undercover operation by the Albany FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force. They were charged with conspiracy to provide material support for use of a weapon of mass destruction, according to the criminal complaint. Crawford and Feight were developing a device ""intended to be mobile ... designed to turn on remotely from some distance away"" that would emit ""some dangerous levels of X-ray radiation,"" according to John Duncan, executive assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York. Individuals who might have been ""subject to this X-ray radiation, would not immediately know that they had been harmed until some days later when they would either be injured, or it could result in their death,"" he said. The suspects intended to use the device to harm and kill ""enemies of Israel,"" a Department of Justice news release said. 'Swimming upstream,' white supremacist groups still strong . Undercover agents allegedly heard Crawford, a self-described member of the Ku Klux Klan, state that he ""harbors animosity towards individuals and groups that he perceives as hostile to the interests of the United States"" and refers to them as ""medical waste."" He specifically identified Muslims as belonging to this group, according to the criminal complaint. Crawford and Feight appeared in court Wednesday. If convicted, each faces up to 15 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and five years of supervised release. Feight appeared with a lawyer, while the judge appointed one for Crawford. CNN attempted to contact the attorneys late Wednesday but was unsuccessful. Though the device had extraordinary potential for harm, the public was not in danger because of the early involvement of authorities, Duncan said. Photos: a Klansman's run for sheriff . Andrew St. John, a friend of Feight's for 30 years, called Feight a ""pacifist"" and a ""smart guy."" Crawford, a manufacturing employee at a GE plant in Schenectady, New York, worked with Feight, an employee at a nearby automotive company often contracted by GE, according to the investigation report. The automotive company did not comment. Since the arrest, Crawford has been suspended from the company, which is fully cooperating with authorities, according to GE spokesman Shaun Wiggins. ""We have no reason to believe the act took place on GE property, nor is there any information indicating that our employees' safety was ever compromised,"" Wiggins said. According to the criminal complaint, Crawford repeatedly used another GE employee as a proxy ""to covertly obtain the parts list for the remote initiation system"" among other things, at times meeting in GE's parking lot. Wiggins told CNN on Wednesday that he could not speak to those allegations. Crawford contacted two Jewish organizations in April 2012 for funding assistance of an ""off the shelf"" technology that could be used by Israel to defeat its enemies by killing them while the slept, according to the criminal complaint. KKK wants ACLU help to adopt highway . A lengthy federal investigation then began. Agents met with Crawford and Feight, posing as both potential middle men and customers for this ""radiation emitting device,"" according to the criminal complaint. Crawford said the lethal machine would be capable of emitting 8 to 10 grays -- a unit of radiation dose -- toward the target Muslim community, according to the criminal complaint. The radiation-emitting device would be ""Hiroshima on a light switch,"" Crawford said, and that ""everything with respiration would be dead by the morning."" Feight was recruited by Crawford to develop a ""remote initiation device"" powered ""by a plug-in cigarette lighter electrical source,"" according to an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Geoffrey Kent. The system would have three parts -- the X-ray, a power source and a remote initiation device -- and it would fit into a truck, the complaint said. In October, Crawford traveled to North Carolina to meet with a high-ranking KKK official and two businessmen affiliates, all working with the FBI, to discuss his scheme and raise money, according to the complaint. Feight was introduced to undercover FBI agents in November and called the design of the lethal machine ""incredibly smart"" because it gives ""a lot more isolation from the ... issue,"" according to a recorded dialogue in the criminal complaint. Feight seemingly explains his rationale for involvement in the same meeting. ""When I started seeing how things, the direction things were going ... after the elections,"" Feight said, ""You know, the only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."" Crawford was apparently concerned about not surviving a surgical procedure he underwent during the development of the machine. According to the criminal complaint, Crawford made arrangements with colleagues to contact his wife to retrieve his computer and phone, containing important data, so they could move on with the operation. In an e-mail to an unidentified person, Crawford said: ""if something happens I don't want this to go away, it can serve our people well.""

"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Peasants in eastern Paraguay opened fire Friday on police trying to evict them from private property, initiating a clash that ended with at least 17 dead, local authorities and state-run media said. The violence occurred in Curuguaty, a remote community about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion near the Brazilian border. About 300 law enforcement officers arrived Friday morning to serve the order when some of the approximately 100 farmers who had been occupying the land illegally for more than a month began shooting at them, authorities said. Curuguaty Hospital director Gustavo Gonzalez told the state-run Paraguay Agency of Public Information that seven policemen and more than 10 farmers were killed. About 80 more police and civilians were wounded and were receiving medical treatment, Gonzalez added. Three of the police officers were flown to Asuncion for treatment, the official news agency said. Authorities did not detail the number of civilians killed, but they did confirm the deaths of seven police, including the chief and deputy chief of the national police's special operations unit. ""The police entered and tried to get the people to leave, to get out of the place,"" Interior Minister Carlos Filizzola told Telefuturo. ""There were shots against the police and, well, from there a confrontation was produced."" Police said the peasants had been camping on land owned by Blas Riquelme, a businessman and politician active in the South American nation's Colorado Party. But Jose Rodriguez, the leader of the ""tent people"" -- so named because they live in tents, told Radio Nacional that the peasants were on public lands that Riquelme had acquired illegally. Rodriguez lamented the loss of life, but said the peasant leaders did not order the attack on police. He added that the institutions of government don't work and there is a need for agrarian reform. After the incident, President Fernando Lugo sent soldiers to the zone. ""All the resources of government security and strategic air are working at this moment to restore calm and tranquility to this region of the country,"" he said. ""I have ordered the armed forces to develop their specific mission in support of the police operation."" In a special session, the House of Representatives observed a minute of silence in honor of the dead, the Agency of Public Information reported.

"(CNN) -- New York Police investigators are probing whether three men arrested last week with a stash of Apple products possibly bought with gift cards altered with stolen credit card data may have ties to a broader network of scammers, a law enforcement official said. Prosecutors in Brooklyn charged the three suspects, who were arrested on Thursday following a traffic stop. In their car, prosecutors allege, the men carried 17 Apple iPad Air and 11 iPad Mini tablets, 7 iTouch players, one X-Box, and 9 $25 iTunes cards. They also had a stash of 39 gift cards with magnetic strips that had been altered to carry stolen credit card data, according to court documents. Investigators believe they used similarly altered gift cards to buy the Apple haul from Target stores in Brooklyn and Long Island, a law enforcement official said. The arrests followed disclosures by Target that the retailer had been the victim of a major breach that may have exposed the credit and debit card data of as many of 40 million shoppers who patronized Target stores in the three weeks after Thanksgiving. The timing of the arrests and the Target breach prompted New York Police financial crimes investigators to alert the U.S. Secret Service which is investigating the Target breach. There is no indication that the Brooklyn arrests are related to the Target matter. Police and other local authorities routinely turn over information on credit card thefts to the Secret Service, which investigates such crimes. A Secret Service spokesman declined comment beyond saying the agency continues its investigation of the Target case. Law enforcement officials and experts said altering gift cards, or other so-called stored-value cards, is a favored way for scammers to launder money and stolen credit cards. Rather than making new fake credit cards with the stolen data, thieves use gift cards to avoid detection since cashiers are less likely to be suspicious. Point of sale machines in stores read the magnetic strip data and won't detect that a gift card is carrying stolen credit card data.","Three men arrested in New York last week after a traffic stop .

"(CNN) -- More than 100 people who attend or work at a southern California high school will be treated with antibiotics after being exposed to tuberculosis, a spokesman for the Riverside County Health Department said Monday. Of the 1,471 students and staff at Indio High School, 126 -- or 8.6% -- were exposed to tuberculosis, but only one student actually has the illness. The health department said the students exposed had a 10% chance of getting tuberculosis during their lives if left untreated. Officials have said they do not fear an outbreak. The exposure rate is actually less than the 10-15% rate the county expected from the population. Tuberculosis is an infection caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis that mainly affects the lungs. It can also infect other parts of the body including the kidneys, spine and brain. TB spreads through the air when a person with an active TB infection coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings. Germs can stay in the air for hours. It cannot be spread through handshakes, sharing food or drink, or kissing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately one-third of the world's 6 billion people are infected with TB. Treatment of TB requires antibiotics for at least six to nine months, the Mayo Clinic says on its website. CNN's Casey Wian and Michael Martinez contributed to this story.","Less than 9% of the people from Indio High School were exposed, health officials say .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Long gone are the days of ice sculptures and crepe suzette served up as a matter of course in first class cabins on airliners. But what is presented to premium passengers can still rival some top hotels or restaurants, and can often act as a good barometer for the health of an airline's fortunes. ""When times get tough, food is one of the costs airlines can cut without jeopardizing safety,"" says Andreas Weber, general manager of airline catering company, Gate Gourmet. ""It has changed back and forth (over time); airlines go through crises,"" he says. ""(Today) more airlines are investing substantially in their first and business class products. Making people comfortable in big seats, everyone is doing that already, but what is left is the catering experience."" Responsible for getting 15,000 meals a day onto planes departing Hong Kong International Airport, Gate Gourmet is well versed in meeting the demands of both airlines and passengers. It is one of three catering companies operating at the airport. Read more: How airlines choose high-flying wines . Erich Seifert, head of production at the facility that employs over 300 people, is often faced with demands for a particular meal for a first class customer at short notice. ""The customer is always right, we have to make it,"" he says, noting that special requests from airlines can come less than a couple of hours before a flight's departure. Being able to react to last-minute requests for wagyu beef or whatever form the fancy of a passenger takes is down to a strict process -- from taking delivery of fresh ingredients in the morning to rolling out the meals on trolleys, all plated up on trays ready to be served on an evening flight. Read more: Google Street View goes inside the A380 . ""We're not like a lab yet,"" says Seifert of the kitchens that look much like any large-scale catering facility. ""We have lots of standards and procedures; we can trace every product, everything is recorded, what is cooked, when and how."" That is to ensure that should anything go amiss or the food is not satisfactory Seifert can tell where in the process it might have happened. But if the whims of premium passengers must be indulged as one-offs, general safety and hygiene are constant with the 24-hour operation. ""It's essential for us the food is safe, this is our first priority. The first thing our people learn is the rule to wash hands, change clothes, cover hair, no jewelry and recording of all items,"" says Seifert. Gate Gourmet's facility at the edge of the airport could almost be a drive-thru for planes, it's just a few hundred yards from the southern runway. Read more: Place your bid for an upgrade . With the roar of jet engines in the background, dedicated chefs in the Indian, Middle Eastern and Chinese sections of the kitchens oversee the production of different meals for 17 international airlines. The ""blast chillers"" are one exceptional piece of kitchen kit not usually found in regular restaurant kitchens. They are used to quickly bring the temperature down from cooking temperature to around 4 degrees Celsius; the required temperature food must be when delivered to planes. Much of the first and business class cuisine, from scallop dumplings to macaron desserts, are hand-made and prepared directly to an airline's specifications. Many of these carriers have a celebrity chef behind the creation of the menu. ""Usually the higher-end airlines send their own menus, or others will ask us to for the whole thing to develop it for them,"" says Siefert. ""Most of them will make proposals; our proposals will combine with theirs, and they give us roughly a vision of their food and they will come to our facility. It can be a very stressful day actually... you have to change this and you have to take all the weights and record it all down to make sure it is exactly like this."" Read more: Economy class goes gourmet . Those plating up the meals have pictorial guides, so when the food is served or the foil lid removed, passengers don't lose their appetite with sloppy presentation. ""That's what the customer wants and that's what the customer insists,"" says Siefert. For those who don't have the luxury of sitting at the front of the plane, the hardy perennials of airline food -- beef, chicken and fish -- will continue to be the mainstay of dining in the sky. ""Most of the flying public they are not adventurous ; you won't be finding braised rabbit or pigeon on an aircraft,"" says Weber. ""But we work with a lot of international customers so there's a high expectation, especially as Hong Kong is a culinary hub.

"(CNN) -- There are less than five months to go until the World Cup begins in Brazil but the clock is ticking for another of the global football fiesta's host cities. Curitiba, the capital of the southern state of Parana, is so behind with its stadium renovations that FIFA could strip it of its host status. On a trip to inspect the venue Tuesday, Jerome Valcke, secretary general of the sport's governing body, told reporters: ""You cannot organize games if you do not have a stadium -- that's obvious. ""If you don't have a stadium then you cannot have four games taking place here. So that's why again there is this emergency situation."" FIFA has now given builders in the city of Curitiba a new deadline of February 18 to show a marked improvement in the stadium. The Arena de Baixada venue, home to Atletico Paranaense, is being expanded for the World Cup with new seats added alongside the pitch and capacity raised to 40,000. It is understood to now be 90% complete but has progressed little since the end of November, when it was 88% done. Work on the stadium was also halted in October when a local judge intervened because of concerns that workers were at serious risk of being injured. ""We are not expecting the stadium to be ready on February 18,"" Valcke continued. ""What we are expecting is to see a progress and to understand where we are going and that is what is being put in place today."" Luis Fernandes, executive secretary of Brazil's Ministry of Sport, agreed with Valcke's criticism, saying: ""If the pace of work at the stadium in Curitiba were to be kept as it is, then it would not be ready to host the World Cup. ""With this is mind, we agreed that we would take steps to guarantee that the arena would be ready to host the games scheduled to be held there."" Those steps include ""scaling up"" work on the stadium and an injection of an extra $16.5 million from the Parana government's development fund. World Cup holder Spain is due to play the first match at the stadium against Australia on June 26. A total of 12 venues scattered throughout Brazil are due to host World Cup games this summer but many of them have been beset with problems. Five workers have died on World Cup stadium construction sites, the latest the death of Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, who fell from the roof of a stadium in the Amazonian city of Manaus in December. Many of the stadiums are behind with their construction deadlines and there have been concerns that Brazil's transport network could create major logistical problems. Preparations for the World Cup have also been controversial in Brazil. Protesters are outraged at what they consider lavish spending on the World Cup as well as the 2016 Olympic Games. Brazil has not hosted the World Cup since 1950 -- when it lost 2-1 in the deciding match to Uruguay. The 2014 tournament is due to open on June 12 with Brazil taking on Croatia in Sao Paulo's Arena Corinthians -- a stadium which has had its own renovation issues.","FIFA warns of ""emergency situation"" in World Cup host city Curitiba as construction slows .

"(CNN) -- You're in a room with 10 other people who seem to agree on something, but you hold the opposite view. Do you say something? Or do you just go along with the others? Imaging techniques help scientists look at the basis for principles of social psychology in the brain. Decades of research show people tend to go along with the majority view, even if that view is objectively incorrect. Now, scientists are supporting those theories with brain images. A new study in the journal Neuron shows when people hold an opinion differing from others in a group, their brains produce an error signal. A zone of the brain popularly called the ""oops area"" becomes extra active, while the ""reward area"" slows down, making us think we are too different. ""We show that a deviation from the group opinion is regarded by the brain as a punishment,"" said Vasily Klucharev, postdoctoral fellow at the F.C. Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands and lead author of the study.  Watch to learn more about the study » . Participants, all female, had to rate 222 faces based on physical beauty on a scale from 1 to 8. Afterwards, researchers told each participant either that the average score was higher or that it was lower than her rating. Some participants were told the average rating was equal to her rating. The researchers then chatted with the participant before suddenly asking the participant to do the rating again. Most subjects changed their opinion toward the average. The two leading theories of conformity are that people look to the group because they're unsure of what to do, and that people go along with the norm because they are afraid of being different, said Dr. Gregory Berns, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia. Berns' research, which he describes in the book ""Iconoclast: A Neuroscientist Reveals How to Think Differently,"" found that brain mechanisms associated with fear and anxiety do play a part in situations where a person feels his or her opinion goes against the grain. Participants looked at projections of three-dimensional objects, and had to identify which shapes were similar. As with the new study in Neuron, participants tended to shift their opinion to the majority view, although in this case the problems had objectively correct answers. The effect was also more potent in this experiment because actors were in the room to simulate a group with a shared opinion, he said. But brain images revealed participants were not lying just to fit in. Changes in the activation of the visual part of the brain suggest the group opinion actually changed participants' perceptions of what they saw. One reason behind conformity is that, in terms of human evolution, going against the group is not beneficial to survival, Berns said. There is a tremendous survival advantage to being in a community, he said. ""Our brains are exquisitely tuned to what other people think about us, aligning our judgments to fit in with the group,"" Berns said. The most famous experiments in the field were conducted by Solomon Asch in the 1950s. He found that many people gave incorrect answers about matching  lines printed on cards, echoing the incorrect answers of the actors in the room. But unlike Berns' finding that fear and anxiety relate to this effect, Asch saw the results of conformity studies as reflections of people's reliance on one another for knowledge of the world, experts say. The darker side of conformity relates to Stanley Milgram's experiments of the 1960s and 1970s, in which most people obeyed orders to deliver electric shocks to an innocent person in the next room. As in these studies, subjects caved into social pressure, presumably going against their own previous moral convictions. Read more about the Milgram study . The research calls into question decision-making bodies that operate by consensus, Berns said. For example, in the U.S. legal system, many cases are decided by the unanimous judgment of the members of a jury. ""You can't separate those judgments from the fact that you have 12 people who have to come to a unanimous decision, and have to conform their opinion to each other, so of course it will distort how they view evidence,"" he said. ""Any type of group decision-making process that does not require unanimous decisions is likely to make a better one,"" Berns said. ""That applies to committees in particular."" What does it take to break the conformity effect? Asch talked about the power of the ""minority of one."" When a unanimous group pressures the individual, that group is weakened as soon as one person breaks off. ""Anyone inclined to draw too pessimistic conclusions from this report would do well to remind himself that the capacities for independence are not to be underestimated,"" Asch wrote in a 1955 ""Scientific American"" article describing his research. ""He may also draw some consolation from a further observation: Those who participated in this challenging experiment agreed nearly without exception that independence was preferable to conformity.""","New study looks at how people change opinions of the beauty of images .

"(CNN) -- Nakoula Basseley Nakoula -- who a year ago was, arguably, the most hated man in the Islamic world -- will soon be a free man. The 56-year-old Egyptian-American behind the inflammatory film ""The Innocence of Muslims"" is set to be released from a residential re-entry facility, or a halfway house, in Southern California on Thursday, according to Federal Bureau of Prisons spokesman Ed Ross. He's been there since being released from prison in May. His incarceration wasn't directly related to the movie he produced, though it did shine a strong spotlight on him in more ways than one. Yet his actions producing ""The Innocence of Muslims"" did violate the terms of his probation for a 2010 bank fraud violation, authorities found. Among other things, Nakoula was barred from using aliases -- yet court documents stated that he used at least 17 false names. He was also barred from accessing computers or any device that can access the Internet without approval from his probation officer. ""The Innocence of Muslims"" notably was posted on the video-sharing website YouTube. Film's producer ordered held without bail . The film got little attention when it was initially posted online, though things changed considerably when Egyptian media highlighted it in September 2012. Violent protests subsequently erupted in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories. Some of the demonstrations targeted U.S. diplomatic missions under the false presumption that the U.S. government was behind the production. The anger faded, however, particularly after Nakoula's arrest on September 27, 2012. In an interview last month with CNN's Jake Tapper, Nakoula said he was ""shocked"" by the uproar -- saying he never thought his movie could cause anyone trouble or get anyone killed.

"(CNN) -- No prominent world leaders at the Sochi Olympics in two months? No problem, according to Russia's Olympics chief. US President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande and German President Joachim Gauck -- among others -- are all staying away from the winter Games but Alexander Zhukov isn't concerned. ""The point is the competition and not that 20 or 30 leaders come to the opening ceremony,"" Zhukov, Russia's former deputy prime minister, was quoted as saying by Russian news agency RIA Novosti on Tuesday. It was announced last week that Obama wouldn't be attending because of his schedule. In August, however, he openly criticized Russia's anti-gay propaganda law. ""Nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you've been seeing in Russia,"" he said. ""I've spoken out against that, not just with respect to Russia, but a number of other countries where we continue to do work with them, but we have a strong disagreement on this issue."" And Obama last week named tennis great Billie Jean King, who is gay, to the U.S. delegation at the Olympics. Gauck reportedly is giving Sochi a miss to protest against human rights violations while French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said last week Hollande's attendance at the Games had ""not been planned.""","Alexander Zhukov says the absence of world leaders in Sochi won't diminish the Games .

"London (CNN) -- Violent extremist attacks, of the kind that claimed the life of Drummer Lee Rigby in May 2013, do not come out of thin air. Rather they are often the end product of a radicalization process in which extremist recruiters target impressionable young people with poisonous, pernicious and, more worryingly, appealing hate narratives. Central to understanding why some young British Muslims are susceptible to Islamist- inspired hate narratives in the first place is the issue of identity. Growing up in Britain during the 1980s and 90s, as the authors of this piece did, was fraught with challenges for many from ethnic minority backgrounds. One would experience an acute sense of dual-marginalisation from a very early age, and this feeling would be exacerbated by daily experiences. On one hand it was a struggle to connect with your parents, who were raised in a very different cultural context, and on the other hand it was challenging to connect with mainstream society, from which one felt alienated and discriminated. This created a sense of rootlessness and dislocation that resulted in an identity crisis. One did not know where he or she belonged, nor which aspect of one's multi-faceted identity to emphasise. The out of touch and decrepit nature of the local mosques only served to heighten this acute sense of alienation and confusion. British imams, having been brought in from the Asian sub-continent, rarely spoke English and had very little understanding of the challenges facing young Muslims growing up in Britain. Furthermore, most mosques were tightly controlled by a group of elderly men, who ruled with an iron fist and kept women and young people on the fringes. In this troubling and delicate context a number of Islamist organizations emerged and began to offer a radical alternative. Taking advantage of the identity crisis that many young Muslims were suffering from, they presented Islam as a revolutionary political doctrine and being Muslim as a political, as well as religious, identity. They also focused their efforts away from the mosques, preferring to target educational institutions, as well as other ungoverned spaces such as the internet. This was because the strand of theo-politics they sought to promote was alien to the traditional religious establishments in the UK. Their radical reformulation of Islam had certain implications. It meant one could now reject the culture of one's parents, since they did not understand the true Islam, as well as mainstream society, since it was perceived as being opposed to Muslim interests. Local and international grievances were weaved together and construed through a very specific narrative in which the monolithically conceived West was at war with Islam and Muslims. This new identity also recalibrated one's sense of loyalty. Since one was now a Muslim only, with other nationalist identities being rejected, one's loyalty lay with fellow Muslims. This exclusive loyalty was also accompanied by a sense of mission and purpose. Conflict zones around the world that involved Muslims were re-construed as front lines of a global war between Islam and Western capitalism. There was no sitting on the fence in this battle. Muslim men in particular were encouraged to see themselves as warriors who had a duty to protect the lives and dignity of Muslims around the world, who were suffering as a direct result of western aggression and policies. It is this narrative, which has taken root in the UK for reasons outlined above, that inspired the killers of Lee Rigby to do what they did. In fact, Michael Adebolago articulated it very effectively during the trial, which he used as an opportunity to spout standard extremist propaganda. He described himself as a soldier, as did the ringleader of 7/7, Muhammad Siddique Khan, and highlighted the actions of British troops in Afghanistan. However, Islamist extremists only ever present a very selective and sanitised version of their narrative to non-Muslims audiences with view to eliciting a degree of sympathy. They fail, for example, to express any outrage at attacks on Muslims by al Qaeda, nor do they dwell on their ambitions of waging a global war of conquest against non-Muslims. The fact that the killers of Lee Rigby were converts to Islam, who had adopted the narrative from charismatic street preachers, illustrates that vulnerable people from a variety of different backgrounds can be seduced by the global Islamist narrative. A sense of victimhood and alienation needs to be present, as well as a strong anti-establishment sentiment. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that those with previous gang connections who exist at the margins of society are often targets of recruiters. Perpetual political instability in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia also continues to provide recruiters with material to exploit and construe through a dogmatic political prism. In the meantime, the outreach potential of social media allows recruiters to target a much wider audience than ever before. Without an effective response that is cognisant of the psychology of the average recruit, and approach taken by the average recruiter, the efforts of extremists will continue unabated. This response needs to brave and prepared to venture into ungoverned spaces, such as the internet. We need to take the fight to extremists by challenging and deconstructing narratives of hate and division as well as offering new models which can be used to recalibrate political thought. For counter-extremism practitioners such as us, eight years after 7/7 it still feels like our work has only just begun. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maajid Nawaz and Ghaffar Hussain.","Extremist attacks often end product of radicalization process, write Maajid Nawaz and Ghaffar Hussain .

"(CNN) -- A torrent of leaked U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks has been published in the last few days, with at least 170 of them naming sources whose identity was meant to be protected, according to an analysis of the documents by CNN. Altogether nearly 143,000 of the cables obtained by WikiLeaks last year had been published by Tuesday, out of a total of 251,000 the group says it possesses. Academics in China, human rights activists in Syria, bankers in Turkey, a Coca-Cola executive in Nepal and British members of Parliament are among dozens of confidential sources named in the cables, which have appeared unredacted on websites such as cablesearch.org. On its website Tuesday, WikiLeaks said it had published 133,877 cables in the past week, but has denied any part in releasing unredacted cables, maintaining that it was ""totally false"" to suggest it had exposed any sources. On its Twitter feed WikiLeaks said: ""The issue relates to a mainstream media partner and a malicious individual."" WikiLeaks originally worked with a number of media outlets to redact the cables, but has recently fallen out with several of them, including The New York Times and The Guardian in the UK. WikiLeaks said a story on the latest releases that appeared in Tuesday's edition of The New York Times, was a ""sleazy hack job."" Just how the unredacted cables found their way onto websites remains a matter of dispute. Last week a German magazine, Der Freitag, said it had found a large encrypted file online and was able to obtain the password to unlock it. The WikiLeaks website was only intermittently available late Tuesday and Wednesday. The group said it had been a target of a cyber attack, saying on its Twitter feed Tuesday: ""WikiLeaks.org is presently under attack."" Responding to the latest releases, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Tuesday: ""We continue to carefully monitor what becomes public and to take steps to mitigate the damage to national security and to assist those who may be harmed by these illegal disclosures to the extent that we can."" The U.S. government has previously said that it reached out to sources whose names were in the cables. Some at risk from possible exposure in the cables are said to have been relocated. Some sources face at worst potential embarrassment by being identified as sources, and many of the cables are marked as ""confidential"" rather than ""secret."" But for others, especially in states with authoritarian regimes, their contacts with U.S. officials may be more hazardous. One cable sent from the U.S. embassy in Syria in 2009 requested that the identity of three sources be strictly protected. Two were human rights activists, one of whom was briefly detained this year as unrest spread across the country. It does not appear that the activist's detention in May was linked to the cable. A ""confidential"" cable sent from the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 2007 discussed Lebanese judges who might be nominated to the Special U.N. Tribunal investigating the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. The cable, from then U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman, notes: ""Strictly protect. These persons are at risk of being threatened or assassinated for agreeing to act as Tribunal judges."" The cable goes on to say that one possible nominee had confided to U.S. diplomats that ""as an unmarried bachelor with no children and no close relatives in Lebanon, he is more dispensable than judges with family obligations."" Another cable that quoted several representatives of Vietnam's Muslim community was marked ""Protect all."" A cable from the embassy in Beijing discussed alleged links between pollution and birth defects. Two expert informants -- both Chinese -- were marked ""strictly protect"", one of whom confided that ""the Chinese government, in her view, does ""not encourage"" information about the relationship between pollution and birth defects to be made available. Not all those identified are informants. One cable names 23 Australians alleged to have had contact with the radical Islamist cleric Anwar al Awlaki in Yemen. The cable, sent by the U.S. Embassy in Canberra in January 2010 recommends that all of them are placed on no-fly or terrorism watch lists. The Australian Attorney General Robert McClelland condemned the publication of the cable Tuesday -- saying that in the past ""WikiLeaks has decided to redact identifying features where security operations or safety could be put at risk. This has not occurred in this case."" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange responded that the Australian government had been caught ""ratting out 23 Australians to the US embassy without due process."" U.S. diplomats fear that the sudden release of so many cables, including the identities of many informants, will have a chilling effect on sources in the future, as well as posing problems for some of those now readily identifiable through the unredacted cables circulating online.

"(CNN) -- It was the middle of the day, and The Mall in Columbia was packed. Packed with parents pushing around strollers. With teenagers sharing some laughs. With shoppers dipping in to pick up something special. ""Just a regular day,"" said Colin Ready, a worker at one of the Maryland mall's stores. Then came a boom. Moments later, ""boom, boom, boom."" ""Then I saw everybody running,"" Ready told CNN. What they were running from was a multiple homicide. Police said that a gunman shot dead two employees at Zumiez -- a skate shop that also sells shoes and clothes for men, women and children -- before killing himself. Hours later, Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said officers who arrived at the store within minutes of the first 911 calls at 11:15 a.m. found three people dead. The shooter, who'd apparently killed himself, was found alongside his shotgun and ""a large amount of ammunition."" Police: 2 store employees, gunman dead . But no one inside the mall 20 miles southwest of Baltimore had any idea the bloodshed was over. ""No one knows what's going on,"" said one worker at the mall, identified only as K.T. ""In today's world, you hear gunshots and you run."" Ready recalled about eight or nine shots ringing out, as well as the chaos outside his store. ""Everybody was screaming,"" he said. ""There were kids running around. I saw an older couple, I guess they couldn't run or anything so they were just crouched (down) to try to get cover."" K.T. remembers ""a lot of kids ... crying, and mothers were holding onto them."" It was ""crazy,"" surreal, all those cliche words you use when terror visits a place where you'd never imagine it. As K.T. put it, ""It's one of those things you see on TV but never expect you'll go through."" Some got safely outside, a diverse array of Saturday mallgoers, young and old, with families and without, who boarded buses to take them away from what was now a crime scene. Many worriedly clutched hands with those they were walking with, some choking back tears as they talked on the phone. Others, though, didn't or couldn't leave. Judy Hoffman was among them. She locked herself inside the back room of a store she worked at, turned off the lights and waited. Ready said he and his store's assistant manager hunkered in a stockroom for about 45 minutes before a man who -- without a uniform or badge -- identified himself as a Howard County police officer knocked. ""We didn't know whether to believe him or not, so we were really scared before he decided to open the door,"" Ready said. ""But he did. It was him. He let us out, and then it was safe."" Another woman who worked at the mall, Shannon Washington, told CNN she he hid behind a counter for ""a couple of hours"" before being escorted out by law enforcement then combing the mall. Washington eventually got home, the impact of the shooting lingered. She couldn't think of going back to work, knowing she could find herself at any point in the middle of something this horrible, this frightening, this unexpected. ""This is the world,"" said Washington. ""It seems like every time I turn on the news, it seems like this kind of thing is happening."" CNN's Ray Sanchez and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.","Three are found dead inside a Maryland mall, including the gunman .

"Kongbai, Guizhou (CNN) -- Savoring a meal of vegetables and rice grown in nearby paddy fields washed down with some home-brewed rice wine served, it's clear Long Taiyang is delighted to be back. Once one of the 250 million Chinese farmers that left behind their families to forge a living in the coastal factory towns, the 37 year old lives back in his ancestral village of Kongbai, a jumble of 200 timber houses that cling to the side of a valley in southeast Guizhou, one of China's poorest province. ""I don't want to leave anymore,"" he says, tired of factory work and living in a cramped dormitory after four years spent making leather shoes in Wenzhou in eastern China. Long is not alone in abandoning what has been described as the one of the greatest human migrations of all time. While the overall number of migrant workers is still on the rise in China, those seeking work in their home provinces increased at a quicker pace that the number of long-distance workers, according to analysis by The China Labor Bulletin. Investment in China's inland provinces has meant that many migrant workers can now find decent paying jobs closer to home and many, like Long, have concluded that separation from their families and communities is too great a price to pay. Grand plans . Not just home to sample his wife's cooking, Long has a plan to give himself and his village a better future. He hopes to revive the traditional trade of silver and metal working that has all but died out as people left in search of better opportunities. ""When I was growing up, all you could hear was the noise of hammering,"" says Long, who learned the trade from his father. These days the village is eerily quiet, with only a cock's crow and the whinny of a pack pony, still used to navigate the steep valleys, puncturing the silence on a hot and sunny August afternoon. Long has set up a basic workshop lit up with naked lightbulbs in the basement of his three-storey wooden house, where he, his wife and eldest son make jewelry by manipulating fine silver thread into butterflies, flowers and animal shapes. Long history . Dan Wenhong of Guizhou Normal University, who has researched the village's silver-making tradition, says its history can be traced back to the 16th century, although it's unclear why the trade took root here. A bone-jarring three-hour drive on mountain roads from the nearest town, Kongbai, feels remote but in the Qing dynasty Dan says the village was a crossroads on major trade routes and, by the standards of the time, was prosperous. Its decline began in the 20th Century and according to her research, in 2012 only 17 out of 192 households were still producing silverware. Dan, who is helping Long and the other villagers revive their trade, is confident that silvermaking can become a viable business that will encourage villagers to return and pass on their craft to a new generation. She says that attitudes are shifting as China's slowing economy means job opportunities outside the village are not as alluring or lucrative as they once were. And the growth of tourism in the region's picturesque towns and villages means that demand for jewelry made in Kongbai is picking up. ""Some people think that children should study hard, rather than learn a trade, but people are also beginning to realize that now even graduates can't find jobs,"" she says. Passionate advocate . With his good looks and easy charm, Long is a passionate advocate of his craft and has founded a silversmith association to promote and authenticate Kongbai silverwork. It has 60 members. ""Wholesalers come to our village to buy our work but once it's in the shop it becomes someone else's brand. "" ""We don't get the retail price and the difference is very big. We'll sell them an item for 100 yuan (US$16) and they will sell it for 400 yuan (US$65)."" Long wants to sell to customers directly and use the village provenance as a marketing tool. He relies on word of mouth to sell his work but given the village has no paved road, there is little passing trade and the village remains off the tourist trail that is beginning to emerge in the valleys below. Long considered opening an online shop on Taobao, an online commerce site similar to eBay, but feared his work would be copied. ""No-one knows about us. We hope to develop our own Kongbai brand name,"" he says. New designs . To reach a wider market, Long has experimented with new designs. Traditionally, the silversmiths in the village, home to members of the Miao ethnic group, made the elaborate head-dresses and hair pieces that are worn by women on festivals, weddings and other special occasions. Using knowledge gleaned during his time outside the village, Long turns traditional Miao symbols like butterflies, fish and drums into modern pendants, charm bracelets and anklets. ""We have to follow the trends. It helps promote our skills as traditional craftsmen."" But it's not a get rich quick strategy. His family is reliant on their land for food and a dry spell this summer means that some crops have failed. Monthly profits from silver-smithing are less than a third of the 7,000 to 8,000 yuan (US$1,200) he earned at the shoe factory. He also worries that tourists buying Miao silverware can't tell the difference between machine and handmade work and won't be prepared to spend the extra money on the handcrafted pieces he produces. Nevertheless, he's hopeful his efforts to revive his village's time honored trade will pay off and allow his 15-year-old son to avoid the factory towns and become the thirteenth generation of his family to work as a silversmith. ""I don't want to be the last,"" Long says.","Chinese migrant workers like Long Taiyang are heading home .
They are attracted by better economic opportunities inland .
Long wants to revive village's ancient silversmith trade .
Doesn't want son to work in factories ."
"(CNN) -- North Korea stirred up fresh unease in Northeast Asia early Thursday, threatening attacks by a ""smaller, lighter and diversified"" nuclear force and warning, ""The moment of explosion is approaching fast."" The new threat came after the North Koreans locked South Korean workers out of a joint factory complex and announced plans to restart a nuclear reactor it shut down five years ago. Meanwhile, the United States announced it was sending ballistic missile defenses to Guam, a Pacific territory that's home to U.S. naval and air bases. ""The moment of explosion is approaching fast. No one can say a war will break out in Korea or not and whether it will break out today or tomorrow,"" North Korea's state news agency KCNA declared in its latest broadside. ""The responsibility for this grave situation entirely rests with the U.S. administration and military warmongers keen to encroach upon the DPRK's sovereignty and bring down its dignified social system with brigandish logic."" DPRK is short for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name for North Korea. Most observers say the North is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile. U.S. officials have said they see no unusual military movements across the Demilitarized Zone that splits the Korean Peninsula, despite weeks of bombastic rhetoric from Pyongyang, and many analysts say the increasingly belligerent talk is aimed at cementing the authority of the country's young leader, Kim Jong Un. But the North does have plenty of conventional military firepower, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles. And U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Wednesday that the North Korean threats to Guam, Hawaii and the U.S. mainland have to be taken seriously. ""It only takes being wrong once, and I don't want to be the secretary of defense who was wrong once,"" Hagel told an audience at Washington's National Defense University. But Hagel also said there was still a ""responsible"" path for the North to take. ""I hope the North will ratchet this very dangerous rhetoric down,"" Hagel said. ""There is a pathway that is responsible for the North to get on a path to peace working with their neighbors. There are many, many benefits to their people that could come. But they have got to be a responsible member of the world community, and you don't achieve that responsibility and peace and prosperity by making nuclear threats and taking very provocative actions."" Shows of force and flights of bombast . The United States has in turn made a show of its military strength in the annual drills, flying B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, Cold War-era B-52s and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over South Korea. KCNA blamed the U.S. and its South Korean allies for the situation, however. ""We formally inform the White House and Pentagon that the ever-escalating U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its reckless nuclear threat will be smashed by the strong will of all the united service personnel and people and cutting-edge smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear strike means of the DPRK and that the merciless operation of its revolutionary armed forces in this regard has been finally examined and ratified,"" it said. ""The U.S. had better ponder over the prevailing grave situation."" Caitlin Hayden, National Security Council spokeswoman, slammed North Korea's statement as ""unhelpful and unconstructive."" ""It is yet another offering in a long line of provocative statements that only serve to further isolate North Korea from the rest of the international community and undermine its goal of economic development. North Korea should stop its provocative threats and instead concentrate on abiding by its international obligations,"" she said. Robert Carlin, a North Korea expert at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University in California, told CNN that the rhetoric is still ""too hot. It needs to be cooled down."" But he added, ""If we say that we don't see any actions yet from them, I have to assume that the U.S. military still thinks the situation is under control."" OPINION: Why Kim Jong Un is not crazy . North Korea's Wednesday decision to prevent South Korean workers and managers from entering the Kaesong Industrial Complex, which sits on the North's side of the border but houses operations of scores of South Korean companies, is a tangible sign of the tensions between the two sides. North Korea has demanded the withdrawal of South Korean workers by April 10 from the complex, South Korean semi-official news agency Yonhap said Thursday. But South Korea's ministry of unification denied the report. It's a move that could end up hurting Pyongyang financially, since Kaesong is considered to be an important source of hard currency for Kim's government. More than 50,000 North Koreans work in the zone, producing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of goods each year. Those workers earn on average $134 a month, of which North Korean authorities take about 45% in various taxes. The North had threatened over the weekend to shut down the industrial complex. North Korea has yet to grant permission for South Koreans to enter the complex, South Korea's ministry of unification said Thursday. The nearly 800 South Koreans remaining inside the complex are still able to leave, the ministry said. North Korea's elaborate game of chicken with U.S. A 'cash cow' ""We are highly skeptical that they will close this cash cow, as some recent reports have suggested,"" Stephan Haggard, professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at the University of California, San Diego, wrote in an article published Monday. ""But if they did, the costs would be higher for the North than for the South,"" Haggard wrote in the article for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research organization. Seoul said it ""deeply regrets"" the North's decision to stop South Koreans from entering Kaesong. ""North Korea's action creates a barrier to the stable operation"" of the complex, the South Korean Unification Ministry said in a statement, urging its neighbor to ""immediately normalize"" the entry and exit process. And South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin said military action could be taken if the safety of the South Koreans in the zone were to come under threat. ""If there is a serious situation, we are fully ready, including military measures,"" he said at a meeting of lawmakers, the semiofficial South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. U.S. moves warship, sea-based radar to watch North Korea . The North has blocked the crossing into Kaesong before. In March 2009, also during joint U.S.-South Korean military drills that it said were a threat, Pyongyang shut the border, temporarily trapping hundreds of South Korean workers in the industrial complex. It allowed many of the stranded workers to return to South Korea the next day, and fully reopened the border about a week later without explaining its reversal. It was unclear whether the latest drama over Kaesong would play out in similar fashion. At the start of the day, when the North informed the South that it would prevent new entries to the complex, there were 861 South Korean workers in there, according to the Unification Ministry. The North said it would continue to let people leave the zone. Hundreds of workers rotate in and out of Kaesong each day in a series of scheduled entries and exits. Many of them stay there for several nights. During the late morning and early afternoon exit windows, only a trickle of workers was seen returning to South Korea from Kaesong, far fewer than the scores who were registered to leave at those times. South Korean authorities didn't immediately provide an explanation for the discrepancy, saying the individual companies decide when to send workers back. Kim Kyong-sin, the manager of a textile manufacturing company in Kaesong who came back into South Korea on Wednesday, said some people were staying in the complex because ""they are worried they might not be able to come back in."" During the March 2009 crisis, many South Korean companies with operations in the zone chose to keep more workers there to compensate for those not being allowed in. Kim said he was scheduled to go back into Kaesong on Thursday, but wasn't optimistic. ""I think if this continues there, business will be affected,"" Kim said. ""I think the damage will be serious."" Kerry calls North 'reckless' U.S. and South Korean officials have kept up their criticism of the North's actions in recent days. John Kerry, the U.S. secretary of state, warned Tuesday that the United States will not accept North Korea as a ""nuclear state."" ""The bottom line is simply that what Kim Jong Un is choosing to do is provocative. It is dangerous, reckless,"" Kerry said during a joint briefing in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se. ""And I reiterate again the United States will do what is necessary to defend ourselves and defend our allies, Korea and Japan,"" Kerry added. ""We are fully prepared and capable of doing so, and I think the DPRK understands that."" The North has conducted three nuclear bomb tests, the most recent in February. It has said that its nuclear weapons are a deterrent that are no longer up for negotiation. Carlin said North Korea's longer-range missiles may not be ready to be used for three to four years, and its nuclear program is a ""low-level threat"" at this point. He said Washington's most recent moves could be caused by it seeing some sort of movement around North Korean missile facilities, or it could be ""misreading and over-reading North Korean propaganda but fulfilling their obligation to be on guard and prepared."" ""We're going to get out of this particular crisis, it seems to me, without anything really blowing up,"" Carlin said. ""But down the road, things are going to get more serious."" ""What we should be looking at, really, is the decisions and the policies and the approach that we're going to have to take over the next four or five years to deal with these things,"" he added. ""Because for the last five years, we really didn't do a very good job of doing that."" CNN's Kyung Lah and Judy Kwon in Paju, South Korea; K.J. Kwon in Seoul; Jethro Mullen and Tim Schwarz in Hong Kong; Barbara Starr and Elise Labott in Washington; and Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- The English Premier League sack race has been as busy as ever this season, but Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has signaled his long-term commitment to the club in an industry that has been criticized for its short term outlook. Paolo Di Canio, Martin Jol, Steve Clarke and Andre Villas-Boas have all been given the push by top-flight clubs in England this term -- Sunderland, Fulham, West Brom and Tottenham respectively -- while Ian Holloway resigned before Crystal Palace had the chance to do the same. And with Malky Mackay's future at Cardiff seemingly ever more uncertain, the days of a manager enjoying 27 years at the helm of a club as Sir Alex Ferguson recently did with Manchester United seem consigned to the past. Mourinho first arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2004 and went on to guide Chelsea to the English Premier League title -- the club's first for 50 years -- as well as the FA Cup, the Community Shield, two League Cups and a further league title. But despite writing his name into Chelsea's history books, a well-publicised fall-out with the club's owner, Roman Abramovich, ultimately led to his exit in 2007. This time, however, Mourinho, who returned to west London in the summer, is hoping to stay around long enough to create a real legacy. ""Realistically I have a four-year contract and I hope at the end of the four years we sit down, analyze the situation and we are both happy for me either to carry on or happy to separate,"" Mourinho told reporters ahead of Chelsea's visit to Arsenal on Monday. ""My desire and my feeling is to work for these four years and after that analyze the situation."" After departing from Chelsea in 2007, Mourinho went on to manage Inter Milan where more success followed, including the Treble of the Champions League, Serie A and Coppa Italia in 2010. Real Madrid was the Portuguese's next destination, where he added the La Liga title, the Spanish Cup and the Spanish Supercup to his coaching CV. Despite the relative success, Mourinho left Spain's capital under a cloud at the end of last season -- reportedly falling out with the club's players and its president, Florentino Perez. The Chelsea boss, however, disputes this theory, saying: ""I've had teams where I needed to be successful immediately. I had Real Madrid, and I left there because I wanted to, not because the club wanted me to. ""There were clubs in other countries where it would have been easy for me to go to and find an easy job."" Having had opportunities to take up an ""easy job"" elsewhere, the former Porto boss feels his latest post is far more challenging. With the likes of Frank Lampard and John Terry, who were in their prime during Mourinho's first spell in charge at Chelsea, growing ever older, the Portuguese has been handed the task of forging a new side based around the talents of younger players like Oscar and Eden Hazard. And it was this project, along with his admiration for the English game, that persuaded Mourinho to return to Chelsea. ""I'm here because I love this club and I love the pressure. It's a different project for me and that's why I'm here,"" he said. ""I also love this country in terms of football, no doubt about that, but the main reason was the club explained what they want from me and I was open to that.""","Jose Mourinho hints is keen to stay at Chelsea beyond his current contract .

"(CNN) -- Opposition demonstrators smashed out windows and doors of a government building in Kiev and were using fireworks to smoke out police, according to a journalist at the scene Saturday in the Ukrainian capital. Opposition leaders said the demonstrators targeted the Ukrainian House because police were launching attacks against them from there, according to the journalist, Victoria Butenko. The increase in action comes after verbal clashes between Ukraine's president and opposition leader Vitaly Klitschko on Saturday. On Saturday, President Viktor Yanukovych offered government posts to Klitschko and another leader of an opposing party, the presidential website said. Klitschko then announced the rejection of those offers on a public stage, where he was joined by heads of other political parties. Klitschko leads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party (UDAR) and plans to run for president in 2015. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who heads the Fatherland Party, would have become the prime minister and, under the president's offer, would have been able to dismiss the current government, which has been one of the protesters' demands. The president also offered the post of deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues to Klitschko, a champion boxer known as ""Dr. Ironfist."" The president also said he would agree to a working group to look at changes to the constitution, according to the president's website. But Klitschko's announcement rejected all parts of the offer, which came after a day of tension between police and hundreds of protesters who continued their vigil in Kiev's Independence Square and surrounding streets. They have set up tent cities and put up barricades. Large plumes of black smoke billowed from the barricades as riot police watched and waited nearby. Protests against the government began in November when Yanukovych refused to sign a trade agreement with the European Union in favor of stronger economic ties with Russia. UDAR warned earlier Saturday that authorities are preparing to provoke peaceful protesters and may plant aggressors among the crowds in an effort to enact emergency rule. ""We call on all Ukrainian citizens not to succumb to provocations of authorities and continue the protest exclusively in a peaceful manner,"" a party statement said. A group of protesters blocked the entrance to the Energy Ministry on Saturday, a move Energy Minister Eduard Stavytsky called a direct threat to the entire energy system. Some protesters entered the building and argued with Stavytsky. ""Your action is illegal,"" Stavytsky told them. ""You have crossed the red line. You have entered a high security building."" The protesters left the building saying they did not intend to undermine the work of the ministry in any way. The European Union is getting involved in the crisis. Next week, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and a European Parliament delegation are scheduled to visit Ukraine. Ukraine's richest oligarch, Rinat Akhmetov, issued a statement Saturday saying business cannot keep silent when people are killed. ""A real danger of breakup of the country emerges when a political crisis can lead to a deep economic recession, and thus inevitably result in lower standards of living,"" he said. Police say one officer was killed and another one stabbed in clashes with protesters.

"(CNN) -- With Torino pushing for a Champions League spot in Italy's Serie A, the Derby della Mole promised to be interesting. Torino hadn't beaten Juventus for about 20 years but has been a surprise package this season and possesses two of the league's top strikers in Alessio Circi and Ciro Immobile. A striker did shine Sunday, although it was Juventus' Carlos Tevez. Tevez scored the only goal in the first half and Juventus restored its nine-point advantage over Roma atop the division with a 1-0 win. Juventus mostly stifled Torino as it extended its unbeaten spell in Serie A to 17 games, though the visitor felt it should have gotten a penalty late in the game. Tevez's effort in the 30th minute put the Argentine tied first in the league scoring charts with the injured Giuseppe Rossi and what a goal it was. He controlled a low, fiercely struck pass, turned and scored on a half volley from outside the box. ""It's one of the few times Torino were able to play against us with no pressure, thanks to the great campaign they are having,"" Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon said in comments posted on the Football Italia website. ""It was a real derby, quite an English style one with the referee letting the action run. ""Compliments to Torino, as their performance made it really difficult for us. In a complicated and balanced encounter like this, the difference is made by those moments of magic from a champion. We've got several and today Carlos was decisive."" Veteran Italian international Andrea Pirlo celebrated with Tevez and Pirlo was involved in the penalty claim in the 80th minute. Omar El Kaddouri went down and Torino thought he was tripped but the referee allowed play to continue. Roma beat Bologna 1-0 on Saturday. Bayern Munich 'relentless' 'Bayern relentless' was the headline used by the Bundesliga's website after it crushed Hannover 96 4-0 and that about sums it up. Bayern registered a 14th straight win in the Bundesliga, hasn't lost in the league in 47 matches and blanked Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday. Thomas Muller and Thiago Alcantara gave the reigning European champion a 2-0 lead at the break and Muller and Mario Mandzukic added strikes in the second half. With second-place Bayer Leverkusen losing on Saturday, Bayern's lead rose to 19 points. ""It took a while before we found our rhythm,"" Bayern manager Pep Guardiola told the club website. ""We played very well once we'd scored. It was a chance to extend our lead over our rivals -- and my lads have done just that."" In more good news for Bayern, inspirational midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger made his first start since sustaining an ankle injury in November and played more than 70 minutes. ""It felt good to be back in the starting lineup and not to have any problems,"" he said. ""I'm feeling much better and my fitness is improving too."" Atletico stutters . Not accustomed to competing in the knockout stages of the Champions League, maybe Atletico Madrid's 1-0 win at AC Milan last Wednesday took its toll. An unusually sluggish Atletico conceded three goals in the first half and lost 3-0 at relegation threatened Osasuna to miss a chance to join Real Madrid on 63 points atop Spain's La Liga. ""It was a good match for them in the first 25 minutes,"" Atletico manager Diego Simeone told his club's website. ""In the second half we lifted the team level and at least played the game. You can lose and would rather lose like we did in the second half."" It was a fine weekend for Real Madrid, given Barcelona also lost Saturday and remained on 60 points. Atletico hosts Real Madrid next week and current world player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to feature for Los Blancos after serving his three-game ban.","Juventus downs Turin rival Torino 1-0 to win Derby della Mole .

"(CNN) -- Local Spanish-language television for Hispanics who also speak English? Yes. As the nation grows, so has the number of Hispanics who speak English and Spanish and who feel comfortable receiving their news in both languages, according to Pew. Since 1997, CNN en Español has reached millions of Spanish-speaking households, but there is still a need to reach another demographic. Enter CNN Latino. ""This programming block is aimed at people who speak English and Spanish, families looking for something relevant,"" said Cynthia Hudson, senior vice president and general manager of CNN en Español, at the CNN Latino launch party in Los Angeles. CNN Latino celebrated its launch in Los Angeles in style at the Sunset Tower Hotel this week. Among CNN's journalists at the launch party were Mexican actresses Kate del Castillo and Angelica Vale, Mexican actor and singer Diego Boneta, Mexican actor Eduardo Verastegui and model and former participant of the show ""Mira Quien Baila"" Maripily. Luis Miguel's daughter, Michelle Salas, also made an appearance. CNN Latino's eight-hour custom-programming block is set to air on Thursday through a local channel in Los Angeles with special emphasis on the community of more than 4 million Hispanics. It will feature news, lifestyle, documentary, talk and debate, and it seeks to be an alternative to traditional Hispanic networks. ""This bloc is for the bicultural, bilingual Latino who goes back and forth between both worlds,"" said Elizabeth Espinosa, KTLA reporter who will be hosting ""Sin Limites"" (No Limits), a magazine lifestyle show that will air 8 to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday on KBEH Channel 63. She will keep her day job at KTLA, Channel 5, where she is a reporter for daytime and evening news shows. Espinosa is a native Angelino. Her mother emigrated from El Salvador, and her father is from Mexico. In addition to ""Sin Limites,"" CNN en Español's team will be a part of the programming as well: . -- Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui, will interview Mexico's newsmakers. -- CNNE's Juan Carlos Lopez will be hosting political debates on ""Choque de Opiniones."" -- CNN en Español's Fernando Del Rincon will host ""Conclusiones"", a nightly debate of the day's top story . -- Dr. Marisa Azaret discusses healthy living on ""CNN Vida."" -- CNN en Español's entertainment correspondent Juan Carlos Arciniegas will host ""Showbiz Latino."" -- Sports news will be hosted by Marcela Trucios on ""Deportes USA."" -- ""CNN Archivo"" will showcase documentaries on crime, adventures and controversy, hosted by Maria Regina Bustamante. -- And CNN's Ismael Cala will host ""Cala,"" a 60-minute audience-engaging show where he interviews provocative newsmakers. Hispanics are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population, with spending power of more than $1 trillion, and they have an increasing influence on social, economic and political trends. CNN Latino joins the likes of News Corp and Colombia's RCN Television, which are behind the Spanish-language network MundoFox, and ABC News/Univision in launching a 24-hour English-language network, all aimed at the U.S. Hispanic audience. The only difference is, CNN Latino will be accessible to those who don't have cable. ""For many Hispanics, this is going to be the first time they see CNN,"" said Hudson. ""What's going to represent CNN Latino in Los Angeles has not been seen before, about 50% of the public does not have cable,"" said Espinosa. CNN Latino will be CNN's first move outside cable television and, according to Hudson, the first step to bringing this syndicated programming block to local broadcast stations in key Hispanic media markets. ""We want to produce content for the Latino who was born in Latin America that lives here and the Hispanic who was born in the U.S.,"" said Hudson. Hudson said CNN en Español will be announcing at least five more new channel affiliates in other major cities within the U.S. that will broadcast CNN Latino.

"(CNN) -- When Barcelona trailed Getafe 2-0 on the road in La Liga on Sunday, things looked bleak for the defending champion. It was still without talisman Lionel Messi and there was no Neymar, either, because the Brazilian was suspended. Midfield playmaker Xavi was the latest player to join the injury list. But Barcelona still had Pedro, and the Spanish international forward netted a first half hat-trick to inspire a comeback 5-2 victory. Cesc Fabregas accounted for Barca's two other goals. As a result Barcelona returned to first place on goal difference ahead of Atletico Madrid heading into the Christmas break. Atletico had rallied itself on Saturday, beating Levante 3-2. ""We maintained our form despite being down two goals and we ended up playing a really good game,"" Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino was quoted as saying by the club website. Sergio Escudero and Lisandro Lopez gave Madrid-based Getafe the perfect start, scoring in the 10th and 14th minutes, respectively. Not long after, however, Pedro took over with his nine-minute treble. Fabregas set up his chip in the 34th minute, Pedro curled a shot into the top corner in the 41st and two minutes later he pounced from close range. Pedro has scored in his last four starts and boosted his league tally to 10 to pass Messi for the team lead. ""He has a great capacity to score,"" said Martino. ""Not only with Barca but with Spain as well. He never gives up. It doesn't matter if he's a starter or if he comes into the match as a sub, he doesn't give up."" Getafe -- which won four straight games in September and October but was thumped 7-0 by Atletico last month -- almost equalized early in the second half through Diego Castro. That was its last real opportunity. Pedro assisted on Fabregas' effort in the 68th minute and was subsequently fouled in the box. Fabregas made no mistake from the spot in the 72nd minute. Real Madrid later downed Valencia 3-2 away to once again pull within five points of the leaders. Some would say Madrid was fortunate, since Cristiano Ronaldo's goal in the 40th minute might have been offside and Jese's winner in the 82nd came when Vicente Guaita was beaten at the near post. A calf injury sidelined blockbuster summer signing Gareth Bale but his replacement, Angel di Maria, opened the scoring for Madrid. Easy for Juve . In Italy, Juventus has responded in the best possible fashion in Serie A after being knocked out of the Champions League. It thumped Sassuolo 4-0 thanks to a Carlos Tevez hat-trick and the striker scored again in Sunday's 4-1 win at Atalanta. Atalanta did have some reason to celebrate -- Maximiliano Moralez's goal in the 15th minute was the first the Old Lady conceded in the league in nine matches. Roma kept pace, staying five points behind the defending champion, with a 4-0 win over last-place Catania. Although still unbeaten in Serie A, Roma had drawn five of its six previous encounters. In the Milan derby, a backheel four minutes from time from Rodrigo Palacio saw Inter prevail over AC Milan 1-0. Inter rose to fifth but is 15 points behind Juventus, while Milan is only five points above the relegation zone. To add to Milan's misery, Sulley Muntari received a red card in injury time.","Barcelona beats Getafe 5-2 to replace Atletico Madrid atop Spain's La Liga .

"(CNN) -- Argentine authorities raided sites across the country Wednesday as part of what they called a nationwide slavery ring crackdown. Hundreds of agents swarmed more than 70 locations in 10 provinces, rescuing more than 200 Colombians who had been working in subhuman conditions, officials said. Authorities detained 23 people accused of recruiting victims into the human-trafficking scheme that investigators say brought Colombians to Argentina and then forced them to work to pay off their travel debts. ""We are looking at a case of slave labor, but in the modern concept of the term,"" said Carlos Sanchez, Argentina's director general of social security. ""They are not in chains,"" he said, according to a government statement. But Sanchez said the workers were subjugated and manipulated psychologically to participate in the criminal organization and work in subhuman conditions. In Cordoba province, the raids focused on furniture-making workshops in working-class neighborhoods, the state-run Telam news agency reported. The investigation, which lasted more than two years, started when a victim spoke with an Argentine customs agent about the trafficking ring, officials said. Authorities at Cordoba's international airport also followed leads when they observed the arrival of groups of young Colombians without luggage or money. A year ago, dozens of Catholic bishops from throughout South America said human trafficking had seen ""alarming growth"" in the region. Sixty bishops from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay called the practice ""a shameful and outrageous reality"" and pledged to do more to fight it. ""We warn of the existence of organized mafias,"" the bishops said, ""that use smaller networks that are present in nearly all of our cities and towns."" Those accused of human trafficking in Argentina face possible prison sentences of between four and 14 years, if convicted, federal officials said Wednesday. CNN's Jose Manuel Rodriguez contributed to this report from Buenos Aires.","NEW: 23 people have been arrested for alleged connections to a trafficking ring .

"(CNN) -- The NFL has fined Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman $7,875 for taunting tied to the recent NFC Championship Game, a league spokesperson said Friday. The NFL official did not specify whether the fine stemmed from an on-the-field or off-the-field infraction. Sherman was penalized during the game for putting his hands to his throat in a choking gesture directed at the San Francisco 49ers quarterback. Sherman had just deflected a pass that saved the victory for Seattle. Immediately after the game ended, Fox Sports sideline reporter Erin Andrews interviewed Sherman and he boasted to being ""the best"" and maligned one of his San Francisco opponents, receiver Michael Crabtree. Those remarks soon became national news as many fans and commentators derided what they characterized as Sherman's poor sportsmanship.","The All-Pro cornerback is fined $7,875 .

"(CNN) -- ""The Computer"" has done his calculations. The Formula One world championship will not be decided by speed in 2014 but by the team who can produce the most reliable car, according to F1 legend Niki Lauda. ""Who will have the least failures this year will be world champion,"" Lauda said in an interview with his former team Ferrari. The Austrian, who won two of his three world titles with the Prancing Horse, was speaking on the eve of the launch of the team's new car for the 2014 season. Ferrari, like all F1 teams have had to completely transform their cars for the forthcoming season to comply with a raft of new technical regulations. The biggest has been a change from 2.4-liter V8 engines to leaner 1.6-liter V6 turbo-powered engines. Read more: F1 rips up the rulebook . Lauda described the task as ""enormous,"" but said the biggest challenge was installing it in the car in a way that would ensure overall reliability. With a leaner engine comes a smaller fuel tank which can carry 100 kilos instead of 140, Lauda points out, with an added test of relying on five engines throughout a season instead of eight. The 64-year-old, now a non-executive president with Mercedes F1, was dubbed the ""The Computer"" on account of his cool, calculating approach to driving during the 1970s and 1980s.

""The next important day, the more important day is the test in Jerez. When you sit the first time in the car you get the first impression and this is the most important.""

"Honshu, Japan (CNN) -- I am attempting to journey from London to London via the world, using just a rowing boat, a bike and a kayak. I write from Japan -- where I am eight months and 11000 miles in to this 2.5 year expedition, having cycled and kayaked all the way here. The next phase is a solo row across the North Pacific Ocean. I set out from the east coast of Japan in the spring, bound for the North America and Canada, where I hope to arrive some five or six months later. From the coast I will pick up my bike once more and cycle across the continent to the edge of the Atlantic, ready for the final row home to the UK. I am doing it out of curiosity, for the challenge and for the perspective of traveling so slowly across landscapes and so close to nature. The idea came about during my solo row across the Indian Ocean in 2009 -- I loved tracing the line across a vast swathe of blue and feeling like I was a part of the ocean. I wanted to spend more time at sea and I wanted to experience the people and green parts of our globe too. One of my aims is to share the journey as I go -- via my website and live links with schools. It has been wonderful to link up live into school groups over the satellite phone and answer their questions on the project -- such an exciting thing for both of us, I think. Besides getting to the start of the project (logistically, financially, emotionally it was huge), the greatest challenge has been the five week journey from the edge of Russia to the top of Japan's main island, Honshu. I was tired and under pressure from various angles -- weather, visas expiring and kit failures. The sudden change from biking solo for months on end to kayaking with my camerawoman for the first time in months was exhausting for mind and body. Language has been a challenge on the way too -- it can often lead to some fun games trying to understand people! Then there is the management of everything off the bike or out of the boat too -- my team, inputting into the logistics, planning ahead or raising more funding. If only it was all as simple as riding a bike or paddling a boat. The best story from the journey so far has been that of Gao -- a young Chinese guy who joined me on my cycle across his country after meeting me in a petrol station. He had never cycled more than 10 km and didn't even own a bike. 35 days later we pedaled into Beijing together after the most extraordinary adventures- through desert, over mountains and meeting some interesting characters along the way. We both grew in those 4000 km -- it was wonderful. Another highlight for me was sitting just off the beach on Sakhalin, watching a brown bear feeding along the tide lines. It was one of the most profound moments watching wildlife I have ever had. The scariest moment, besides all the near misses on the road with trucks and traffic, was the day I nearly peed on a snake. I turned to walk out of the bushes and a snake jumped clear off the ground on the attack. I squealed and ran. There were so many snakes in Kazakhstan -- I love to see them when I know they are there but those surprising encounters made my pulse race! The most poignant and moving story so far is that of Japan's Tohoku coast -- much of it destroyed by the major earthquake and ensuing tsunami of March this year. I am heading up there to volunteer for a week shortly. The clean up operation there will take many years and there will be lingering scars forever. Logistically it is a massive project -- the complexity of getting kit and people all over the world to match up with my various stages, and often in remote countries has been challenging, to say the least. My team and I are learning all the time and I for one am looking forward to the ocean and the simplicity of it. If something breaks I have to deal with it, whereas on land life can get quite complicated at times, because of borders, needing to find food and shelter, people etc. Training before I came away was mostly focused on strength and conditioning so that my body was as prepared as possible for the trials of the journey. It worked to an extent but I am still undergoing recovery physio to fix some of the issues I racked up over the first phase of the journey. I also undertook some bike journeys and made my first big crossing by kayak. I am now focused on training for the ocean ahead and getting all the systems in place to make it as successful as possible. It has been an incredible journey so far, often defined by the people I have met and our reactions to each other. I am excited about the phases ahead, though keen to have some down time over the Christmas period too. It has been a huge effort to get this far and I am grateful for all those who have helped me do so.","Sarah Outen is attempting to travel around the world from London .

"(CNN) -- If you were to take one line of dialogue in a film of 2013 to represent the year's mood, it would be from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup in ""12 Years a Slave."" The abducted freeman shackled into bondage is plainspoken and eloquent: ""I don't want to survive, I want to live!"" ""American Hustle"" may be the title of David O. Russell's satire of con artists (Christian Bale and Amy Adams) aiding federal agents to carry out the Abscam sting, but it's also a dominant theme in American films of 2013. If you think hustle in its various meanings -- the swindler and the determined -- then just about every character-driven film did the hustle. Occupying the amoral lowlands, there is Leonardo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and the title figure in ""The Great Gatsby,"" living large - the mansions! the boats! the planes! -- by defrauding the little people. There is Alec Baldwin as the Bernard Madoff-like ex of husband-hunter Cate Blanchett in ""Blue Jasmine,"" both of them delusionary in the belief that they are entitled to other people's money. And there is Bale in ""American Hustle,"" who rationalizes, ""People believe what they want to believe,"" indicting the suckers for their faith in his cons. Up on the moral high ground, there is Ejiofor in ""12 Years a Slave,"" caught in a double bind. If, as an intellectual and a freeman, he defends himself against racism, he will be hung; if he does not, he suffers the humiliations of slavery. Chadwick Boseman as ballplayer Jackie Robinson in ""42,"" likewise is doubly-bound: advised to repress his righteous anger at racists or he will be brutalized and won't be able to play in the big leagues. In ""The Butler,"" Forest Whitaker, who wears one face as a White House domestic and another as a family man, ultimately reconciles his two faces. Then there is a clutch of films that collectively say forget about living, survival is enough. Filmmakers purveyed the human hustle in stories of those facing near death challenges and variously hanging onto life by a thread, a fraying rope, a stranded lifeboat, safety tether or not. Think of Robert Redford fighting for his life in ""All is Lost,"" Sandra Bullock clinging to tether in ""Gravity,"" Jaden Smith depending on intelligence from his wrist radio in ""After Earth"" and Tom Hanks facing death in a lifeboat in ""Captain Phillips."" Also tested in a life-and-death narrative was Jennifer Lawrence in the Survivor-tinged ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire."" Out of breath? Take a good, deep one. We haven't even begun to discuss the year's end-of-the-world movies. The apocalypse was nigh -- not only in action movies like ""Pacific Rim"" and ""Oblivion"" but in comedies like ""This is the End"" and ""The World's End."" On screen the U.S. and British capitals were under terrorist attack in what seemed like an infinite loop of destruction: ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" ""White House Down,"" ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation,"" ""Star Trek: Into Darkness,"" ""Thor: The Dark World."" Los Angeles and New York also endured attacks and were defended respectively by the mettle of Robert Downey in ""Iron Man 3"" and Henry Cavill in ""Man of Steel."" What does it all mean? We don't need a professional to detect the pervasive anxiety in these Darwinian narratives of survival. Might this reflect Hollywood's guilt about its role as con artist fleecing the easily duped? Or do these films in part show Hollywood's unease about its own future in a world where moviegoers are just as likely to download or stream a movie than buy a ticket for one? Perhaps this, as much as the real-life economy, explains why another theme of 2013 films is economic anxiety. It is symbolized in ""Elysium"" by an underclass living on a polluted and overpopulated Earth and the 1 percent living in the pristine atmosphere above, with controlled climate and top-flight health care. Job insecurity reverberated through a broad swath of the year's movies. Consider the Harlem inspirational ""Black Nativity"" and the '60s-era ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" where the protagonists have trouble making the rent. Consider the Brooklyn hipsters in ""Frances Ha"" to the Oakland underclass in ""Fruitvale Station"" where protagonists sought work. Even straight-out comedies like ""We're the Millers,"" in which a drug dealer hires underemployed individuals to pose as his family in order to make it easier to smuggle marijuana over the border, is peripherally about fewer legitimate jobs than those looking for them. It wasn't all about angst, though, even if the laughter at the multiplex was rueful. ""Before Midnight"" and ""The Best Man Holiday,"" two superb sequels, are comic looks at relationships and fidelity. One is sparked by the performances of Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke, the other by an ensemble including Morris Chestnut, Taye Diggs, Sanaa Lathan and Nia Long. The most moving relationship film of 2013 is ""Her,"" Spike Jonze's wistful story of a lovesick writer (Joaquin Phoenix) who falls in love with his operating system (voice of Scarlett Johansson), and finds the chasm between human and artificial intelligence is as wide as that between Mars and Venus. Another slice of dialogue representative of movie romances comes from Julie Delpy, exasperated with life partner Ethan Hawke in ""Before Midnight:"" ""Sometimes, I think I'm breathing oxygen and you're breathing helium."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carrie Rickey.","Carrie Rickey: Themes that 2013 movies tackled include survival, economic anxiety .

"(CNN) -- Libya's justice minister condemned the kidnapping of five Egyptian diplomats, and urged their captors to release them. Minister Salah al-Marghani said the envoys are guests of Libya and have nothing to do with the recent arrest in Egypt of the head of the Libyan state-funded militia group Libyan Revolutionary Operations Room, or LROR. Al-Marghani said the Libyan government is in touch with the Egyptian government about releasing the LROR chief. Al-Marghani's press conference in Tripoli came just hours after the Egyptian embassy in the capital was evacuated. Saturday's evacuation was in response to the Friday kidnapping of the five diplomats from the Egyptian embassy. The envoys, who were abducted by unknown gunmen, included the administrative and cultural attachÃ©s. A spokesman for the Libyan foreign ministry, Said Al-Aswad, told the Egyptian MENA news agency that the motive behind the kidnapping is still unknown and that Libyan authorities were investigating. Earlier on Saturday, the Libyan ambassador to Egypt said that the kidnappings could be in retaliation for the arrest of the LROR head, Shaaban Hadiya, also known as Abu Obedia El-Zawy, in Alexandria on Friday. According to news sources, Abu Obedia's group was responsible for the kidnapping of Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan last October. The Libyan General National Congress (GNC), which is drafting a new Libyan constitution, has demanded Egyptian authorities release Abu Obedia immediately. Earlier this week, a South Korean trade official as rescued after being taken from his car in the coastal capital last Sunday. His kidnappers were detained, authorities said. Libya's government and fragile state security forces are struggling to impose law and order in a country awash with weapons left over from the 2011 war that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

It stars French starlet Ludivine Sagnier as a young woman who rejects the amorous advances of a flashy, wealthy man her age, in favor of a sleazy affair with a fickle, 60 year-old father figure. Sagnier's desire to take on the role was also motivated by the allure of a much older man: Chabrol. ""The idea of working with Claude Chabrol was the main attraction at the beginning,"" she told CNN. ""He is a great French director, one of the pioneers of the French New Wave."" ""The guy has so much experience. I felt like I was a journalist, always asking things,"" continues Sagnier. ""He's very old ... he's been through many, many things. This was his 66th movie, or something like that."" Sagnier describes her character, Gabrielle de Neige, a charming, 20-something television weather girl, as ""very naive."" ""She falls in a trap like a poor little lamb and she gets eaten by wolves. ""The thing is, she doesn't have a dad, so she lacks affection, and sometimes that lack of affection can drive you to make mistakes. ""I'd say I'm stronger than that,"" says 29 year-old Sagnier, who is perhaps best-known for her provocative portrayal of a highly-sexualized teenager opposite Charlotte Rampling in Francois Ozon's 2003 drama, ""Swimming Pool."" Sagnier who is often compared with screen sirens like Brigitte Bardot and Catherine Deneuve, drew international acclaim for a series of films in 2002 and 2003, but has recently has been taking smaller roles. Many of the qualities that attracted Sagnier to Chabrol are similar to those that draw her on-screen alter-ego Gabrielle to writer Charles Saint-Denis (Francois Berleand) -- Charles' knowledge of life, literature and his ability to treat her like a little girl, not as an equal. Sagnier says of working with Chabrol: ""It was like opening a cinema book, because when you work with him he talks to you about Hitchcock, he talks to you about Kubrick. ""He met everyone, so he's full of anecdotes, so you want to know more."" Chabrol began his career in 1956, earning his stripes alongside fellow New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut. He became famous in the late 1960s for suspense thrillers such as ""La Femme Infidele"" (1969) and ""Le Boucher"" (1971). He has continued working prolifically in film and television ever since. Chabrol co-wrote the screenplay for the heartbreak drama, in which Sagnier character is consistently disappointed in love and let down by the men around her, with his step-daughter, Cecile Maistre, who also served as assistant director on the film. At the end of ""The Girl Cut In Two,"" Sagnier appears on stage as a magician's assistant, smiling in the spotlight as she hears applause rise from the audience, the attention perhaps curing her depression over lovers lost. She lies in a box, appearing to be cut in half, the trick functioning as an almost literal embodiment of the film's title -- but clearly there's more to it than meets the eye. ""She cuts into two men first of all, and she's also cut in two different sides of her personality,"" said Sagnier. ""She has a part of shade and a part of lightness."" Sagnier's fate since her collaboration with Chabrol has, thankfully, been a decidedly rosier affair: Since finishing ""The Girl Cut in Two,"" she has starred in Jean-Francois Richet's, ""Public Enemy No. 1,"" which received more nominations than any other film at the 2009 Cesar Awards, France's equivalent of the Oscars. The indefatigable Chabrol has recently wrapped up yet another film: ""Bellamy"" starring Gerard Depardieu.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic's reign as king of the Australian Open is over. The world No. 2, a winner at Melbourne Park in each of the last three years, was beaten in a grueling five-set contest by eighth seed Stanislas Wawrinka. At the end of a marathon four-hour encounter, it was Switzerland's Wawrinka who converted his first match point to seal a 2-6 6-4 6-2 3-6 9-7 win over the six-time grand slam champion. Wawrinka will play Tomas Berdych for a place in Sunday's final, after the Czech upset third seed David Ferrer in Tuesday's earlier quarterfinal. Energy-sapping duels between Wawrinka and Djokovic have become the norm over the past 12 months, with the Serb emerging on top until now. At the 2012 Australian Open, Djokovic edged a fourth round match 12-10 in the fifth while the two once again went the distance in their U.S. Open semifinal. Djokovic won that match and he was protecting an unbeaten run which stretched back to his defeat by Rafael Nadal in the final in New York. ""He's in a great form,"" Djokovic told reporters when asked about Wawrinka. ""In the last 15 months he's had the best results. He's established now in top 10. He's been winning against top players in big tournaments. ""So he knows how to play now on the big stage. You could feel that with his game. He's really taking to the opponent and stepping in. When you're playing like this, the only thing I can say is congratulations."" Berdych is into the semifinals of the season's first grand slam for the first time after falling at the quarterfinal stage in each of the past three tournaments. The seventh seed will play in the last four of a major for the first time since the 2012 U.S. Open. ""There were some special moments which went well together in this match, making it for the first time here in the Aussie Open to the semis, winning my first match on Rod Laver after all those years,"" said the Czech. ""That's been a very special match to me. I'm extremely happy to go through.""","Novak Djokovic beaten by Stanislas Wawrinka at the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- Richard Sherman made several things very evident last Sunday night: . He's confident. Brash. Competitive. A ""dogged mentality"" helps, too, when it comes to lining up against the other guy. That other guy in the NFC Championship Game was Michael Crabtree, the object of the cornerback's rant after the Seattle Seahawks earned their way to the Super Bowl by beating the San Francisco 49ers. ""Don't you open your mouth about the best,"" Sherman barked on national TV, ""or I'm going to shut it for you real quick."" In the days since the outburst stirred controversy, Sherman has become something akin to the upcoming Super Bowl's unofficial provocateur-in-chief. But in an in-depth interview with CNN's Rachel Nichols -- which aired Friday night -- Sherman expressed some regret about the rant while showing a far more gentler side when he's off the field. ""I've always been a square, a nerd. Kind of odd, kind of awkward,"" he said. ""I still am to this day. People just think I'm a lot cooler 'cause I play football."" Sherman said he likes the History Channel and ""Animal Planet"" on TV. The Stanford University grad lauded his parents, saying they set an example of going to work every day and not complaining. With his can-do attitude and philosophy ""you gotta be who you are,"" it's fitting that one of his heroes is one of sport's most outspoken athletes -- Muhammad Ali. Like Ali in his day, Sherman may now be the biggest newsmaker in sports following the Seahawks' playoff victory. When he was about 7 or 8 years old, Sherman saw Ali for the first time on the screen. Ali struck him as ""so much different than everybody else in the world,"" Sherman said. ""It was one of his interviews,"" Sherman said. ""And he was just so clever, so well-spoken, so articulate -- so off-the-cuff. ""He kind of went against the grain . ... and that takes a lot of courage to go against the grain, to say what you really want to say."" Cornerback stunned by rant reaction . As the Seahawks and Denver Broncos prepare for the Super Bowl on February 2, Sherman took a break from practice to speak with Nichols. He spoke of defying all odds by growing up in a Los Angeles neighborhood -- Compton -- where violence is documented in rap songs, and working in school so hard and successfully that he later attended and played football at Stanford. 5 things you should know about Richard Sherman . ""How almost oxymoronic does it sound that a kid from Compton is going to Stanford?"" Sherman said. ""I was just trying to show 'em anything's possible."" Sherman has been publicly excoriated, particularly on social media, for his postgame comments. He told Nichols he probably should not have attacked Crabtree. ""And that was immature and I probably shouldn't have done that. I regret doing that."" Still, he was shocked by some of the racists responses he received. ""It was really mind-boggling the way the world reacted,"" Sherman told Nichols. The NFL All-Pro defensive back told Nichols he still feels the sting of not going in the 2011 NFL draft until the fifth round -- the 24th cornerback chosen. ""You don't know what to expect. You don't know if your phone's supposed to ring or if somebody's supposed to text ..."" he said. ""When your phone just doesn't ring, doesn't have any activity, it's really disheartening. "" In the days since his rant, the phone is ringing for Sherman. His agent said the incident has ended up being more positive than negative for Sherman's image. ""I think that he's more likeable,"" said Jamie Fritz. Fritz told CNNMoney that interest in his client for endorsements has boomed since the remarks. ""We have some new (corporate) players who have come to the table who are starting the conversation,"" Fritz said. Sherman told CNN he is concentrating on moving forward, preparing for Denver superstar quarterback Peyton Manning. For now, he has one objective. ""On the football field, you're still going out to there to win. And if you're not going out there to win, what are you going out there for?"" CNN's Chris Isidore contributed to this report.","Richard Sherman talks with CNN about his NFL career, growing up .

"(CNN) -- A vaccine not licensed for use in the United States will be offered to thousands of Princeton University students beginning Monday, after a string of meningitis B cases at the college this year. The vaccine is called Bexsero and is made by Novartis. It has been approved in Europe and Australia. With the blessing of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Princeton will make the vaccine available to all undergraduate students, graduate students living in dorms or the Graduate College and annexes, and other university community members with particular medical conditions. Meningococcal disease at UCSB . That adds up to about 5,000 undergraduates and 550 graduate students in dorms, university spokesman Martin Mbugua had told CNN previously. Additionally, around half a dozen people with conditions that fall under the recommendation would also be affected, although there may be more who have not yet disclosed their conditions, he said. These include conditions where the spleen is compromised, or certain other immune system disorders. The vaccine will not be provided to anyone else or given out anywhere else, the school said. Young adults and individuals with certain medical conditions have an increased risk of meningitis, especially when living in close proximity to one another, such as in dormitories. The first dose of the vaccine will be available this week; a second dose in February. For maximum protection, individuals must receive two doses. Princeton will cover the cost of the vaccine. Meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. Infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation, according to the CDC. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States, according to the CDC. Of those, 160 were group B. Michigan, feds to share info in meningitis probe .

"(CNN) -- The baseball players posed for a team photo of sorts -- but the signs they held had nothing to do with home runs or striking out. Two of them toted a Venezuelan flag with ""SOS"" scrawled across the top. One knelt in front with a sign that said ""Pray for Venezuela."" Another held a banner that read, ""Lejos pero no ausentes"" (far away but not absent). The Detroit Tigers teammates snapped the photo last week in a locker room in Lakeland, Florida, their spring training base. A group of New York Mets posed for a similar shot this week, holding Venezuelan flags as they stood beside a baseball diamond in Port St. Lucie, Florida. They may be rivals on the field, but the players from both teams share something in common: concern about events unfolding in their homeland, more than 1,500 miles away. Weeks of massive street protests in Venezuela have left at least 13 people dead, more than 100 injured, and dozens detained after clashes between members of the opposition, backers of the government, law enforcement and armed groups. ""We are really worried about what's going on there,"" said Wilmer Flores, a 22-year-old infielder for the Mets. ""I have all my family there. All my friends are there."" He hails from Valencia, Venezuela, where the death of a beauty queen who was shot in the head during protests made international headlines. He said he's warned his family members not to go outside as protests rage. ""From here, supporting VENEZUELA,"" Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera -- who's from Maracay, Venezuela -- posted as he tweeted the photo with his teammates. ""From here all united for Venezuela,"" Tigers infield coach Omar Vizquel wrote when he shared the photo. Baseball is also a national pastime in the South American nation. And statistics show that Venezuelans represent the second largest group of foreign players in Major League Baseball. The Mets have three Venezuelan players and a coach. On the Tigers' 40-man roster this year, 10 players are from Venezuela. And when the players speak out, people listen. The Tigers photo has been re-tweeted nearly 10,000 times since Cabrera shared it, and more than 16,000 times from Vizquel's account. Some praised the players for their courage. But not all the responses were positive. Some described them as hypocrites, slammed them for seeming to take sides or criticized them for not taking a firm enough stance. In the polarized world of Venezuelan politics, there are no referees who step in to break up a fight. ""Now no one can have an opinion. If you support someone, others attack you, and vice versa. And if you are neutral, you are not Venezuelan,"" Cabrera wrote back in response. ""What a sad reality."" Some players' online posts have included the #SOSVenezuela tag used by members of the opposition to draw attention to Venezuela's crisis. Others have said they aren't taking a political stand -- just pushing for peace. The posts have drawn a response from Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro himself. In televised remarks, he implied that players weren't expressing their true feelings. ""Venezuelan Major League players are being pressured to appear in portraits that say SOS Venezuela,"" Maduro said. ""The owners of the Major League teams have pressured our men."" Vizquel didn't mince words when he fired back on Twitter. ""The only pressure we have is winning games, hitting and catching,"" he wrote. ""Sensibility and feelings are not pressured."" The face of one Mets coach, Edgardo Alfonzo, normally lights up when he talks about his home country. But now, weighing the situation, he says he's overcome with sadness and feeling tense. ""We never thought we were going to get where we are today. ... You feel so impotent not being able to do anything from here, just supporting our families and the Venezuelan people. And really, for all these people who have lost family members, it is so hard,"" he said. ""Everyone is worried. It's like a ticking time bomb. Really, you don't want it to continue. You want it to stop, once and for all."" It's not just baseball players and coaches speaking out about Venezuela. Miami Heat basketball player Chris Bosh tweeted a photo of his shoes during a game on Sunday, with ""SOS Venezuela"" written in white above the Nike swoosh. Bosh told Bleacher Report he'd been discussing the crisis with his wife, who's half Venezuelan. ""Kind of brushing up on it in the past week,"" he said. ""Crazy. Government kind of stopping everything. Inflation. Exports and imports have pretty much stopped. I know a couple of people that just came down from there, and work for me, and it's just bad. You go to the grocery store, and there's no groceries. No medicine."" Many Venezuelan baseball players say they hope to use their popularity and the popularity of their sport to send a message of peace that goes beyond politics. They believe baseball is a sport that can bring people together, and they hope that their message is heard by the international community, as well as back at home. ""We're trying to promote peace,"" Alfonzo said. ""Because, to be an athlete, I think a lot of young people look up to us. That's the way we can help."" There's only one thing Alfonzo says he wants for his country: peace. ""Just pray for Venezuela,"" he said. ""That's all we ask.""

"(CNN) -- One of the masterminds behind the euro says Europe would have suffered a far worse fate if the single currency had never been created. The euro has struggled to shake the financial crisis which exploded four years ago but Jim Cloos, deputy director general at the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union, said the problem lay in member states' adherence of rules. The continent, he told CNN, needs a ""stricter system to enforce discipline"" on the common currency's 17 members. Cloos' comments come as the Maastricht Treaty -- the accord responsible for the euro -- prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary on November 1. Read more: Lagarde warns against 'complacent' Europe . As one of the masterminds behind the treaty, Cloos staunchly defends its basic principles. ""I think now we all agree that we need more economic coordination,"" he said, ""but it's still very important. It has brought open borders. It has brought investment possibilities. It has brought a much bigger market."" Signed in the quaint Dutch city of Maastricht, the treaty came into force in 1993 and created the European Union as a single body. Read more: Spain turning back the clock on siestas . Since then the EU has more than doubled in size, including many countries in Eastern Europe -- formerly under the yoke of communism -- a fact that Cloos believes is ignored. ""I think the integration in the last few years of 12 new countries, some of them are former Soviet Union countries, is just fantastic. It creates a new boost,"" he said. ""Eastern Europe is one of the most dynamic economic regions in the world."" Watch more: A history of defaulting on debt . Now the world's largest trading bloc, the EU added its latest participant in July this year, when Croatia became the 28th member. But Michael Geary, assistant professor in modern Europe and the EU at Maastricht University, believes that although the treaty can be viewed as an overall success, the same can't be said for the single currency project and the debt crisis. Read more: Europe's economic winds of change . He said: ""Without Maastricht and the single currency, there wouldn't have been the sheer volume of crazy interbank lending from the late 1990s into the early 2000s."" Geary argued that the single currency project became ""too political"" and that Spain and Italy were never intended to be a part of the original eurozone intake. ""[The eurozone] element is hugely important; because you're creating a single currency without a single state,"" he said, ""a lot of it was based on trust between member states in terms of submitting proper budgets and financial information to gain entry."" What next for Europe? After a four-year long debt crisis and over 400 billion euros ($534 billion) in rescue packages paid out, the euro area returned to growth in the second quarter of this year. And now European leaders are now seeking to forge closer fiscal and banking ties, despite a wave of treaty changes since Maastricht's inception including Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon. Read more: Serbia eyes EU membership . Cloos refused to speculate on the prospect of further treaties, describing the European Union as a ""living body."" But he believes the debt crisis has brought member states closer together. Cloos added: ""I cannot say when we will have new treaties. It's never finished... we will actually emerge stronger out of the crisis because we've taken a certain number of reforms which are absolutely major.""

Meanwhile, however, the U.K. is seeking a renegotiation of its membership following Prime Minister David Cameron's pledge to offer the British electorate a referendum in 2017. Geary said further treaty signings can't be ruled out and any renegotiation might be the perfect opportunity for Cameron to ""claw back"" powers for the UK. But he added: ""I think there's a consensus there to let Lisbon bed down for a while and see how things play out because the rules are there, the governance is there. It's just a question of applying the rules rather than tinkering with things again. It should work in theory.""","The Maastricht Treaty is set to celebrate its 20th anniversary.

"(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula 1 history and one of the world's highest-profile athletes, remains in critical condition after suffering severe head trauma in a skiing accident in the French Alps, hospital officials said Monday. Doctors who have been treating Schumacher at the University Hospital Center of Grenoble said at a news conference that it was too early to say what the driver's prognosis might be. In a prepared statement, Schumacher's family thanked doctors for doing ""everything possible to help Michael."" They also thanked people around the world for the outpouring of support. The German, who retired from the elite motorsport for the second time in 2012, fell and hit his head on a rock Sunday, said the director of the Meribel resort where Schumacher was skiing. Schumacher was in a coma when he arrived at the hospital and required immediate brain surgery, officials said. So far, he has undergone one operation and is being kept in a coma, they said Monday. Schumacher, who turns 45 Friday, won a record seven world titles in his spectacular Formula 1 career and ""also holds nearly every scoring record in the book by a considerable margin,"" according to the motorsport's official website. He dominated the competition for the best part of a decade, winning five world championships in a row between 2000 and 2004. Schumacher suffered serious injury once during his career in the high-speed sport, breaking his leg in a crash at the British Grand Prix in 1999. Why induced comas help injured brains . Wearing a helmet . His skiing accident happened while he was off-piste (on unmarked slopes) Sunday morning in the mountains between Georges Bauduis Piste and La Biche Piste, resort director Christophe Gernignon-Lecomte said. Schumacher was wearing a helmet when he hit his head, Gernignon-Lecomte said. Rescuers reached him minutes later, and he was airlifted to a nearby hospital, the director said. Doctors at the Grenoble hospital said that without the helmet's protection, Schumacher wouldn't have made it to the operating table. The cause of the accident, which is being investigated by police, remains unclear, Gernignon-Lecomte said. Schumacher ""was not alone"" when he fell, his spokeswoman Sabine Kehm said in a prepared statement. But nobody else was involved, she said. 'A great champion' Former French Formula 1 driver Olivier Panis visited the hospital in Grenoble on Sunday but was not able to see Schumacher, CNN affiliate BFM TV reported. ""As I am here in Grenoble, I want to come to him and say hello, for old times' sake. He is a great champion and someone very loved in Formula 1,"" Panis told BFM. Schumacher has a wife, Corinna, and two children, Gina-Maria and Mick. His brother Ralf was also a Formula 1 driver. Schumacher made his Formula 1 debut in 1991 and won a record seven world titles -- five of them with Ferrari -- by the time he retired for the first time at the end of the 2006 championship. In that period of temporary retirement, he was involved in a motorcycle crash in Spain in 2009 that left him with a lingering neck injury, which delayed his racing comeback. He returned to the Formula 1 track with the revived Mercedes team in 2010 but struggled to repeat his earlier glories. His best finish was third place at last year's European Grand Prix in Valencia, his only podium position in three seasons with the German manufacturer. 'A very good skier' Sunday's accident occurred at a popular ski resort in an area known for its challenging slopes above the tree line. ""If you are anything less than a really experienced skier, it's very easy to lose your bearings, because you don't see much in the way of vegetation around you or anything else,"" said Paul Hochman, a former contributing editor at SKI Magazine. ""It's just literally all white, all snow."" British journalist Kevin Garside told CNN that Schumacher is ""a very good skier"" but acknowledged that he is ""fearless"" -- like most Formula 1 drivers. ""These people don't recognize fear like you and I do. There is no gene in their body that lets them go slow,"" Garside said. ""Schumacher wasn't a skier when he joined Ferrari (in 1996), but by the end he was excellent,"" he said. ""Each year Ferrari used to have a media week in the Alps in Italy and they would always have a race -- and it was always Schumacher who won. He was a genuinely quick skier. ""But he was always very mindful of the danger around him,"" Garside added. ""I approached him for an interview at the top of the slope, and he said it would have to be quick as he wanted to check the piste. That meant he wanted to make sure he understood the slopes, the cambers, even though it was only a fun race.""

"(CNN) -- ""The English media created an icon, an almost perfect human being."" - soccer agent Paulo Texeira. Above all else, Jose Mourinho just needs to feel loved again. It has been in short supply during the final, painful throes of his tempestuous tenure as coach of Real Madrid. Beaten to the La Liga title by Barcelona, blasted out of the Champions League by Borussia Dortmund and battered by the press in Madrid, this is a season he's decried as the worst of his career. The 50-year-old leaves looking visibly drained, with dissent dripping from the dressing room and insults ringing in his ears, rivals lamenting him as a ""scourge"" on Spanish football. Little wonder then that Mourinho has opted for a return to Chelsea, the English side that helped the Portuguese etch his name into the fabric of modern football folklore as ""The Special One."" For a man who seems determined to forge new frontiers and embrace different cultures around the continent his desire for a second stint at Stamford Bridge has come as a surprise to many. But according to Portuguese journalist Jose Carlos Freitas, Mourinho's latest move is down to the concept of pater familias; having reached a stage in his career where he wants to mold a club in his image for the long term. ""I think he is ready to come back to Chelsea in a different way, to try and build something from zero,"" Freitas, a reporter at the Record newspaper, told CNN. ""It will be a challenge to rebuild Chelsea's team. This might be the job that keeps him there for five or 10 years. He needs to be the number one guy in the club, not only winning but thinking about the club, changing it, preparing it. ""When Mourinho was starting his career he wanted to win things -- leagues, cups and the Champions League -- but now he has achieved this status in his career where he needs more. ""I see this might be a great chance for him to finally have a real connection with (Chelsea's billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich) in the way that they can build a Chelsea to look like Manchester United did under Alex Ferguson."" Freitas agrees that Mourinho's time at Real will have chastened the coach who famously anointed himself as ""special."" Three years in Spain have brought a hat-trick of domestic trophies, including a league title that broke Barcelona's dominance under Pep Guardiola, but, crucially, not the 10th European Champions League crown their fervent fans crave. Growls of disquiet had been audible for a while but as soon as Real's quest for ""La Decima"" ended, it became a crescendo. Mourinho spoke of the people in Spain who ""hated"" him and confirmation of his departure led Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi to declare him a ""scourge on Spanish football"" in a radio interview. Vilarrubi also predicted he'll be a ""disaster"" at Chelsea. Dressing room dissent . Unusually for a coach who has prided himself on forging unbreakable spirit amongst his squad, criticism has also seeped from his players. The coach's decision to drop goalkeeper Iker Casillas, Spain's World Cup-winning captain and a Real poster boy with 23 years' service to the club, in favor of new signing Diego Lopez caused much of the consternation. His own players, including fellow Portuguese Pepe, criticized his treatment of Casillas but Mourinho would not yield, dismissing the defender's remarks as jealousy. Despite this fractious finale to his Real career, one of Mourinho's former players has a different take on the culture of conflict that has dominated the final chapter of his Bernabeu reign. ""At Real Madrid some players were against him but you have to look at that in a different way: why, in a 12-year career, is it that only two or three people are complaining?"" asks Frederico Castro Roque dos Santos, known as Freddy, who played under Mourinho for Portuguese side Uniao de Leiria. ""For me this is success, this is huge. Everywhere he goes people like him; he passed through so many clubs, so many players, so many figures and only now some people complain."" Even as a young coach Mourinho was laying the founding principles upon which his success would be based. His first step is demonstrating, and demanding, ultimate loyalty from his charges. So what was it like to play for him? ""He protected us from everyone, from the president, from fans, from journalists. To protect his own people he doesn't care about the consequences outside,"" Freddy explained. ""Even when he left Inter Milan, one player that hardly played (Italian defender Marco Materazzi) hugged him and cried with him, so this revealed what he does inside a team. ""He makes you believe you are the best player. In my case, a player who was 20 years old, he told me I would be the best player in the league. Even though I wasn't, I believed him. This is like a father to a son, your son is always the best. This is his major weapon. ""He's also good with personal relationships -- he is like a psychologist. He has a lot of qualities that are not normal in coaches. ""I believe he is the same person but when you are coach of Chelsea or Real Madrid you have more enemies, let's say. It is a more difficult fight when you are in a big team, but he will protect everyone until the end."" Press relations . Mourinho's entrance at Chelsea back in 2004 was unforgettable. Suave and sophisticated, he strolled into his new post as a Champions League winner with Porto and instantly declared to the gathered media: ""I think I am a special one."" This one line came to symbolize his close relationship with the English press. They loved his perceived arrogance, the way he prowled the touchline, and he admired their principles of fair play. Though that relationship had soured by the time he left Chelsea in 2007, having secured five major trophies -- including the club's first league title in 55 year -- it still represented the high point in his dealings with the media. His time as coach of Internazionale in Italy, which yielded two Serie A titles, two domestic cup wins and another Champions League triumph, was punctuated by rows with journalists -- one even accused him of physical violence. Relations with the notorious Madrid press veered between difficult and impossible; Mourinho's desire to shape the club the way he wanted combined with his confrontational style jarred with many. ""He always understood something that is awfully important in modern football, to play a role, as if in the theater,"" Freitas explains. ""If you go to the theater you see an actor performing a role and he does that. I think he does that sometimes in a positive way, sometimes in a way people don't understand. The press in Madrid never understood this. ""The press are all supporters of the club. It's a personal thing in Spain, when they see someone who is trying to change the situation at the club. ""He tried to change the organization; he had problems with (former Real director) Jorge Valdano, trying to have full control of the professional team. This was not regarded as a positive thing by the press or the players. ""There was no way out for him, even if he had won the Champions League. If he had won 'La Decima' then he could have gone out using the main door leaving like a God, but he didn't."" Freddy's playing career is nearing an end but he already has his ""UEFA 'B"" coaching license as he looks to follow in Mourinho's footsteps. He says his old coach's methods will form the basis upon which he approaches his role. ""As Mourinho said, we always can improve the individual,"" he explained. ""We don't have to take the best players to have the best team, we can put a couple of guys together and make them the best together. I saw this with my eyes so I want to do it for the kids back in my home country Angola. ""I learnt from Mourinho that everyone should be treated differently. You wouldn't treat Frank Lampard the same like John Obi Mikel. A guy that is more explosive I try to extract his quality, a guy that is more technical too, we don't need to criticize. ""We were in one team that was simple and we were fighting to be champions with a low budget, inferior players, but as a unit it worked, I saw it with my eyes. We can inject psychology and knowledge into any individual. ""Mourinho is almost complete as a coach. In England he is known as 'The Special One' but when you know him, you see that it's not a joke. He is special.""","Jose Mourinho is returning to coach Chelsea six years after leaving London .

"(CNN) -- Imagine the following scenario. A woman and her husband underwent infertility treatment in the early 1990s. Now they learn their daughter, contrary to what they thought, is not the man's biological child. Instead, her biological father is a former medical technician responsible for preparing sperm samples. That's the situation facing a family that received treatment at the University of Utah Community Laboratory and Reproductive Medical Technologies Inc., known as RMTI. The university says it's investigating the case. It has put together a panel of physicians and retained an independent medical ethicist. The university is also offering paternity testing to families that may be affected, and set up a hot line for patients with questions. ""We sympathize with the anxiety this family has experienced. We do not know how this occurred and are carefully reviewing the concerns raised,"" the University of Utah Health Care said. A widow speaks . Tom Lippert is suspected of switching a patient's sperm with his own. His widow, Jean Lippert, spoke to CNN affiliate KUTV, describing her husband as troubled. He was employed by both the University of Utah Community Laboratory and RMTI, which became defunct in 1998. The laboratories were separate entities but shared oversight and staff. Lippert had a criminal record and a spotty record at work. Some documents discovered so far suggest he deserved a raise, while others said that more oversight was needed both of him and the laboratories, according to the university. Jean Lippert told KUTV that she and her husband never had children of their own, but that her husband told her he had them. Tom Lippert was ""proud of the fact he had these kids out there,"" she said. The couple was married for 20 years before Tom Lippert died from cirrhosis of the liver, KUTV reported. He was 49. ""It seemed like he (Tom) was trying to be a decent person,"" his widow told the affiliate, adding that ""good Tom"" didn't stick around for long. ""If I would have left he would have killed me. He threatened my life every day,"" Jean Lippert reportedly said. ""I didn't stay out of the goodness of my heart."" Sperm smuggling alleged at prison . 'What we can answer, we will' The university has been careful to stress that today's policies and protocols are different from those in place in those two labs, given industry standards in the 1980s and early 1990s. ""This is a shocking story to all of us,"" said Sean Mulvihill, chief executive officer of the University of Utah Medical Group, reported CNN affiliate KTVX. He reportedly estimated that Lippert may have interacted with 1,000 families; 15 have called the hot line to date. ""The events in question occurred more than 20 years ago and records from that time are incomplete. That challenge notwithstanding, we are committed to reaching a fuller understanding of what happened then and to providing our patients with relevant information in an expeditious and compassionate manner,"" the university said. It continued: ""While there are inherent challenges -- the passage of time, the fact that RMTI has been defunct since 1998, and the deaths of Mr. Lippert and RMTI's principal, Dr. Ron Urry -- what we can answer, we will.""

"(CNN) -- As airlines prepare for possible in-flight cell phone calls under a Federal Communications Commission proposal, travelers were immediately loud and vocal Friday on whether the plan is a good or bad idea. Even the FCC chairman was of a divided mind on the proposal, saying he personally opposed it, but that technology doesn't support a ban. At the same time, commercial air carriers remained largely noncommittal on whether they would even allow cell phone calls, an option that would be granted to airlines under the proposed rule change. Airlines would have to equip planes with a special antenna to allow the mid-flight phoning. Among the traveling public, critics say the change would open a Pandora's chatterbox, but supporters say the change would be as liberating as freedom of expression itself. ""Bad idea! Can u imagine being on a plane of 100 + people & everyone on their phone!! Maybe allow texting but not phone calls!!!!"" Joyce Goldman Newman wrote on CNN's Facebook page. She found many people in agreement. ""Allow text and browsing, with talking only allowed during an emergency!"" Judy McIntosh Arizpe also said on the social media page. ""Pilots could have a secret button to push allowing calls in that event."" One opponent, Beth Coomer of Healy, Alaska, said she was ready to take a train, instead. ""So first they want to add more seats to economy and now allow talking on cell phones...great,"" Coomer wrote. ""How affordable is taking a train? Even if the train is slightly more expensive and takes longer, it may be worth it . ..."" But another opponent said cell phone use on public trains is already bad enough. ""It's bad enough listening to people on Metro-North trains fighting over stupidity on a cell phone,"" said Edward Markle Jr. ""If the general public practiced better cell phone etiquette maybe, but the human condition prevents those."" But supporter Jim Baker was more realistic. ""We already have screaming children.... it can't get worse than that. The most obnoxious sound in the universe,"" Baker wrote. ""Cell phones are a drop in the bucket. Quit whining."" Another supporter offered a practical remedy for critics. ""Psssstt......ever hear of ear plugs, they work really well,"" David Brent wrote on the comments section underneath a CNN.com article about the proposed change. Alhaji Koroma of Sierra Leone liked a side benefit of having cellular service. ""Text message is OK for me,"" Koroma wrote on CNN's Facebook page. Supporters cited how other countries already allow cell phone calls on planes. In fact, a Federal Aviation Administration found that in 11 other countries, ""civil aviation authorities reported no confirmed occurrences of cell phones affecting flight safety on aircraft with on-board cellular telephone base stations,"" the FAA's 2012 study said. Speaking out against cell service on planes . Proponents of the FCC proposal cited how they would like access to cellular service in case of emergencies -- such as when the passengers aboard the hijacked planes in the September 11, 2001, attacks used their cell phones to call family. ""'Bout time because my girlfriend was always worried when I was flying to go to work and she stayed worried until I got back home,"" wrote Will Davis of Lexington, Kentucky. ""This is great especially when something bad happen(s) while in air."" Nicholas Tanner, a waiter who lives in Arlington, Texas, thought the proposal was ""a great idea."" ""Sometimes people do have important phone calls to make. For everyone that don't want to listen to the phone calls of others, you can watch a movie, listen to music, or simply buy ear plugs,"" Tanner wrote. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said that advances in technology ""likely no longer warrant -- on a technological basis -- the prohibition of in-flight phone use with the appropriate on-board equipment."" ""We understand that many passengers would prefer that voice calls not be made on airplanes. I feel that way myself,"" the chairman said in a statement Friday. ""Ultimately, if the FCC adopts the proposal in the coming months, it will be airlines' decisions, in consultation with their customers, as to whether to permit voice calls while airborne. The European Union has had a similar policy since 2008. That experience has demonstrated that it is possible to adjust the on-board communications equipment not to handle voice traffic, thus effectively shutting down any calls."" 20 most annoying things people do on planes . Several airlines said they were still considering their options under the FCC's proposal, which would cell phone call, texting and other mobile services while flying above 10,000 feet -- but not during takeoff and landing. ""Our customers have expressed concern about how the use of cellphones in-flight will impact their experience onboard. When the FCC makes a proposal available, we will study it along with feedback from customers and crews,"" United Airlines spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said. Matt Miller, spokesman for American Airlines, said the carrier is ""going to wait to review the FCC's full recommendation."" Delta was maintaining its ongoing position of not allowing phone calls during flights, which is based on customers' ""overwhelming"" feedback, a spokesman said Friday. The current proposal will be discussed at the FCC's December 12 meeting and could then be opened for public comments. The commission would have to vote on a final rule before it could take effect. If the FCC gives final approval, individual airlines could choose whether to provide mobile service to passengers. In-flight phone calls will cost you .","FCC chairman doesn't like calls on planes, but technology doesn't support ban .

"Melbourne, Australia (CNN) -- Even a new, high-profile coach couldn't help Roger Federer figure out Rafael Nadal. Federer hadn't beaten Nadal in seven years in a grand slam -- and on a chilly night in Melbourne the world No. 1 kept the streak alive, improving his record over the Swiss to 23-10 overall as he advanced to the Australian Open final. The Spaniard pulled out a tight first set and then cruised to a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 6-3 victory Friday to set up an encounter with Federer's compatriot, Stanislas Wawrinka. ""I played a lot of times against Roger, and a lot of times I played great against him,"" Nadal told reporters. ""So probably that's why I had this success against him."" If Nadal wins Sunday he would rise to 14 majors and tie American Pete Sampras -- in attendance at Rod Laver Arena during a rare foray to a grand slam in retirement -- for second on the men's all-time list behind Federer. The odds are heavily stacked in his favor given he is even more dominant against debutant grand slam finalist Wawrinka, not losing a set in their 12 encounters. Wawrinka progressed Thursday by downing Czech Tomas Berdych. Federer sought the services of Stefan Edberg in an effort to regain his old form and the 32-year-old, troubled by his back in 2013, duly produced big wins over former Australian Open finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray this fortnight. But Nadal's transition from defense to offense thwarted Federer, as he continued to enjoy success employing his heavily spun forehand to the Federer backhand and he served impeccably. Nadal, who won the French and U.S. Opens last year in a successful return from knee problems, was broken only once -- in the middle of the third set. Blog: Honor in defeat for Federer . ""Playing Murray or Rafa is day and night,"" Federer told reporters. ""It's just every point is played in a completely different fashion and I have to totally change my game."" Edberg was a serve-and-volleyer who triumphed at Wimbledon twice, and Federer wasn't afraid to approach the net. However, he has used the tactic in the past against Nadal and on Friday won only 55% of net points. Indeed Nadal didn't think Federer tried much new -- saying he perused YouTube and watched some of their 2012 Melbourne semifinal, which he also won before losing the title match to Novak Djokovic. ""I think he tried to play very aggressive, taking the ball very early,"" said Nadal. ""But if you go to YouTube and you see the video of the 2012 match, you will see that he was playing very, very aggressive, too, especially the beginning of the match. ""So nothing is completely new."" Nadal's passing shots left the crowd gasping, especially a forehand down the line in the final game. ""Coming into the match I thought we would have a chance today but the way the match came about, Rafa played very, very well and Roger didn't have that many chances,"" Edberg told a small group of reporters. ""Playing against Rafa at this level is very hard,"" he added. ""It wasn't enough today, but I think he's made a lot of progress over the last three months. ""It's looking good for the rest of the year. He still has a way to go before he is back to the level where he can be."" Edberg said the match might have turned out differently had Federer broken early in the first set. He likely was referring to the fourth game, when Nadal escaped a 0-30 hole. Nadal raced to a 5-1 lead in the tiebreak, closed out the set and broke on his eighth chance of the match to take a 4-2 stranglehold in the second. By that time Nadal took a medical timeout for a lingering blister on his left palm and Federer complained to the chair umpire -- not for the first time in his career -- about the left-hander's grunting. Despite the loss, Edberg remained upbeat about Federer's chances of achieving an 18th major. ""Roger had a tough year last year,"" said Edberg. ""At least now he feels healthy, which is No. 1. No. 2 he needs to put in a lot of work, which he is doing. ""He just needs to gain a bit more momentum, a bit more confidence. That will come with time. I think in a few months you should see him even better than what we've seen this week."" Nadal, who won the tournament in 2009 but was absent last year, is doing fine at the moment.","Rafael Nadal beats Roger Federer in straight sets to reach Australian Open final .

"(CNN) -- A student was shot dead Friday afternoon at South Carolina State University, prompting a manhunt for several suspects that extended beyond the school's Orangeburg campus. Orangeburg County Coroner Samuetta Marshall identified the slain student as Brandon Robinson, 20, of Orangeburg. ""He was a very nice young man,"" South Carolina State University President Thomas Elzey said, fighting back tears in a brief statement to reporters. ""And it hurts. It hurts us all."" Police were still looking for at least four individuals who they say might be responsible. Elzey said ""we are pulling together as a community,"" announcing that counselors would be made available to grieving students. ""Our first order of business is to make sure that our students are safe,"" the school president said. Campus police were called to the Andrew Hugine Suites Living and Learning community about 1:30 p.m. and found the injured student, the university said. Police said eyewitnesses identified four suspects who had left the campus, the university said. The school was initially put on lockdown; those restrictions were lifted a few hours later. Nonetheless, South Carolina State's Facebook page still urged people to ""remain cautious and report any suspicious activity to police."" South Carolina State is a historically black university with about 4,000 students, according to the school website. The campus is about 40 miles south of Columbia. CNN first learned about the incident via Twitter. This is the third campus shooting this week. On Tuesday, a gunman shot and killed another student inside Purdue University's electrical engineering building. Police said Cody Cousins, 23, an engineering student, killed Andrew Bolt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin. Cousins was charged with murder. On Monday, a student was shot and critically injured near a gym at Widener University near Philadelphia. Police were looking for a suspect. On Wednesday, the University of Oklahoma in Norman briefly shut down after a report of a possible shooting that apparently turned out to be a false alarm, the university's president said.","New: Victim identified as Brandon Robinson, 20, of Orangeburg, South Carolina .

""Katy and I have known each other a really long time, she's a friend of mine, and it seemed like there was this infusion of people wanting to create conflict and drama. I find that to be really fatiguing,"" she said. ""It's an old paradigm of pitting people against each other based on the idea that there's not enough—not enough fans, not enough music lovers, not enough space for both of you, so you have to hate each other.

"(CNN) -- Alastair Cook might just be the most optimistic man in Australia right now -- for there are few who would back his assertion that the England cricket team faces anything other than ""Mission Impossible"". Thrashed by Australia for the second consecutive time in the five-match contest, England must now overcome 77 years of history to win the series. Not since 1936-37 has a team come from 2-0 down to win the Ashes -- on that occasion it was Australia which triumphed. What appears more likely is that England's horrific 5-0 whitewash defeat of 2006-7 will be replicated -- especially given Monday's 218-run defeat in Adelaide. ""It's certainly not impossible,"" England captain Cook told a press conference following the day's play. ""A lot of people who will be sitting in this room, and outside, will probably give us no chance. ""But if we don't believe that in our dressing room, if we believe the urn has gone, then it might as well have gone. ""Obviously 2-0 is not a great situation to be in. But if you look at a football game, the next goal can change it very quickly."" England, which has won the past three Ashes series, has struggled from the outset against an Australia side which it defeated 3-0 only a few months ago. Only once before have England lost successive Tests by a margin of more than 200 runs, but following the 381-run loss in Brisbane, it now faces an almighty challenge to avoid humiliation. Many of England's problems have come in their batting line up which has failed to pass 400 in its past 20 Test matches. It now heads to Perth where it has only managed one win in 12 attempts and the scene of a 267-run defeat three years ago. One of the most frightening prospects for England is facing Australia's fast-bowler Mitchell Johnson, who has already taken 17 wickets in the first two matches. The extra pace and bounce in Perth will make Johnson even more dangerous -- an intimidating proposition considering the paceman took nine wickets at the WACA the last time these two met. Captain Cook has struggled for runs at the top of the order while the likes of Kevin Pietersen and Matt Prior have also failed to live up to their billing. Needing 284 more runs for a final day triumph, England never looked like pulling off a miraculous victory. Instead, it lost its final four wickets for just 65 runs. A win for Australia at Perth will seal its first Ashes triumph since 2007 -- not bad for a team which has only won two if its past 12 Test matches. ""It's going to take a monumental effort from us to do it,"" added Cook. ""But we're the only guys who can turn it round. ""It was a better display in this second innings. (It was) by no means perfect, at all, but it was better than it had been. ""That's a small step, only a small step, but it's heading in the right direction."" Australia captain Michael Clarke, who is expected to make his 100th Test appearance at Perth on Friday, is in confident mood following his side's strong start to the series. Clarke, who made 148 in the first innings at Adelaide, says the hard work his players put in during the English summer has finally come to fruition. ""It's not a fluke we have won the first two Test matches ... we believe, after the work we have been putting in for a long period of time, we're seeing some results. ""The other side to that is, the reality is we have won two Test matches now in the past 12 months - and that is not acceptable as an Australian test team. ""We have started this series very well, but there is a lot of work still to do."" One man who is entitled to enjoy Australia's current success more than any other is Johnson -- the man who was subjected to constant taunting from the England supporters during the 2010-11 series. Johnson did not feature in the last Ashes contest and England's batsmen must be wishing he was overlooked for this current series with the Australian striking fear into his opponents at every opportunity. ""I guess having that intimidation factor is definitely a bonus,"" Johnson told reporters. ""It wasn't probably quite there in the last couple of Ashes series for me - so to be able to come out, just back my ability, and know what I wanted to bowl, I will continue to do that throughout the series. ""I won't let myself get too excited ... it's all about not getting too far ahead of yourself.""","Australia won second Ashes Test by 218 runs in Adelaide .

"(CNN) -- The leader of a group representing 9/11 victims' families on Friday criticized the National September 11 Memorial Museum's decision to charge a $24 admission for visitors when it opens this spring. ""It was never intended to be a revenue-generating tourist attraction with a prohibitive budget and entrance fee,"" Sally Regenhard, assistant chairwoman of the group 9/11 Parents and Families of Firefighters and World Trade Center Victims, said in a prepared statement. She calls on government officials ""to stop this outrageous fee and bring costs under control."" ""The rich will visit the museum, but the poor and middle-class families won't be able to afford it,"" she said. But the ticket price, which was approved Thursday, will ""ensure the organization's financial health"" and ""help fund the necessary operational costs,"" said a statement from Joe Daniels, the 9/11 memorial president. And the fee will help balance a $63 million operating budget for 2014, said Anthony Guido, communications manager at the 9/11 memorial. ""The 9/11 Memorial does not yet receive government support for ongoing operations as many other important museums of our national history do,"" Daniels said. The memorial is seeking federal funding which would enable the expansion of education programming, Guido said. Relatives of 9/11 victims are exempt from all fees and charges. Discounts will be offered to students, seniors and other groups, and the museum will offer free general admission between 5 and 8 p.m. each Tuesday. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke out against charging an admission fee Wednesday. ""This is a nationally important site. It's something that people come to from all over the country, all over the world, and we need the federal government to join with us,"" he said. The underground museum at the World Trade Center is scheduled to open in mid-May. The above-ground memorial plaza, which has had 11.5 million visitors since opening two years ago, will continue to be free. The memorial preserves the history of September 11, 2001. ""The stories and the lives of the nearly 3,000 innocent people lost that day will be forever honored at the Museum through artifacts, exhibitions and first-person accounts,"" Daniels said. CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","National September 11 Memorial Museum will charge $24 for admission .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Iran will continue with its peaceful nuclear program and push to reengage with the world and build its economy, President Hassan Rouhani said Thursday in a speech at the World Economic Forum. Rouhani, who became President in August, said his country would ""under no conditions give up its right to pursue peaceful technology."" But, he said, the six-month nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, which limits the country's nuclear program in exchange for lighter sanctions, opens the door to greater Iranian engagement with the world. ""What we have achieved is not merely a temporary agreement but a prelude to future agreement and engagement,"" Rouhani said. In Thursday's speech, he said he would push for improved ties with the world as part of his drive to make the Iranian economy one of the top 10 within the next three decades. Iran's economy ranked 22nd in the world in 2012, based on gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. ""I view Iran's economy as the most congruent, capable and closest to that of successful emerging economies, and I see Iran's place alongside them in the future,"" Rouhani said. He said the country intended to reopen trade and industrial and economic relations with its neighbors -- but that doesn't appear to include Israel. Responding to a question from World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab on whether Iran's approach included all countries, Rouhani said: ""All countries that Iran has officially recognized are inside the circle."" ""East and West, North and South -- there are no exceptions,"" he said. Since the Iranian revolution of 1979, Iran has viewed Israel as an illegitimate state with no right to exist. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Rouhani's remarks were the latest in an ""Iranian show of deception."" He said the goal of the Iranian ayatollahs' regime was to ease sanctions without conceding on their program to produce nuclear weapons. ""They say they oppose nuclear weapons; why do they insist on maintaining the ballistic missiles and plutonium and the advanced centrifuges that are only used for the production of nuclear weapons?"" Netanyahu said. ""So it sounds good, I wish it was real, it isn't real. I think the world has a mission to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons."" Earlier, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in an exclusive interview with CNN, said the Obama administration has mischaracterized concessions by his side in the six-month nuclear deal with Iran, saying ""we did not agree to dismantle anything."" The accord requires Iran to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20% -- well above the 5% level needed for power generation but still below the level for developing a nuclear weapon. In addition, the deal requires Iran to limit new enrichment to 5% and dismantle equipment necessary for higher levels, according to the White House. Rouhani also said Syria, where a civil war has been raging for almost three years, has been ""engulfed in a major catastrophe, and the people have borne the brunt. It is a miserable situation and a very sad situation."" He said Iran ""believes that everyone, all of us, should try our best to put a stop to the bloodshed in Syria, and later push terrorists out of Syria."" Rouhani said the next step would be to ""pave the way for the opposition to sit around a table with the Syrian government"" and for free and fair elections to be held.

"(CNN) -- Three men accused of starting an illegal campfire that grew into a wildfire last week in California have been charged in federal court. The Colby Wildfire, as it is called, was 95% contained Tuesday. It's so far scorched close to 2,000 acres of foothills in Los Angeles County near Glendora. The three men were identified as Jonathan Carl Jerrell, 24; Clifford Eugene Henry Jr., 22; and Steven Robert Aguirre, 21, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. They were charged with unlawfully setting timber afire, a felony offense that carries a possible sentence of five years in prison. Embers from the campfire are believed to have set dry grass adjacent to the ring afire. Winds and drought conditions took it from there. They three men were taken into custody Thursday, the day the Colby Fire started. The fire has destroyed five residences, damaged 17 other structures, and resulted in injuries to one civilian and two firefighters, the statement said. On Friday, California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency for the state, saying it is facing ""perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago.""

"(CNN) -- He started the day clutching the Ballon d'Or trophy proudly in his hands and ended it, once again, with his footballing adversaries very much at the mercy of his multi-talented feet. Cristiano Ronaldo showed why he was voted the best player in the world earlier this month with another sprightly showing on Saturday as Real Madrid beat Granada 2-0 at the Bernabeu to assume top spot in La Liga. Inevitably, it was the Portuguese forward who broke the deadlock drilling a low shot home in the 56th-minute goal -- his 22nd goal of the campaign. The 28-year-old was intimately involved in Madrid's second, setting Marcelo free down left before the Brazilian cut in and unselfishly rolled the ball across to Karim Benzema who slotted home. Carlo Ancelotti's side have now dropped only two points and scored 40 goals in 11 league outings since losing to Barcelona at the end of October. All of which means that Los Blancos leap from fourth to first with 53 points, two more than both Barcelona and Atletico Madrid who play Sunday. The Catalans entertain Malaga at the Nou Camp in the late kick off while Atletico travel to second-from-bottom Rayo Vallecano. Fellow strugglers Valladolid picked up what might be a valuable three points come the end of the season beating fifth place Villarreal 1-0. Jesus Rueda's 40th minute strike lifts Valladolid to 17th, level on 19 points with Almeria who entertain Getafe on Sunday. Over in Italy, Napoli dropped points for the second consecutive game, drawing 1-1 with relegation-threatened Chievo Verona at the Stadio San Paolo. The visitors took the lead when Gennaro Sardo scored in the 18th minute. Things were looking bleak for Rafa Benitez's side until two minutes from the end when Spanish centerback Raul Albiol scored a last-gasp equalizer. The draw means Napoli now have 44 points and ensures they retain third spot in the table for another week even if fourth-placed Fiorentina beat Genoa on Sunday night. Chievo's point lifts them to 16th in Serie A with 18 points, but they remain winless in six and have a battle on their hands if they want to keep a seat at Italian football's top table.

"SRINAGAR, Indian-administered Kashmir (CNN) -- Six family members were buried alive after an avalanche crashed into their house in a remote village in Indian-administered Kashmir, officials said Friday. A total of 10 people were killed Friday following five days of continuous snowfall in the mountainous region. An avalanche in the mountainous Peth Hallan village rolled over the family's house Friday morning, engulfing it in snow, Kashmir Divisional Commissioner Mehboob Iqbal told CNN. Indian army and police rescue teams were able to rescue only one of the seven family members in the house, he said. Peth Hallan is about 68 miles (110 kilometers) south of Srinagar. Another avalanche in the village of Nayal, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) from Srinagar, killed three people, including a woman, a senior police official said. And in the village of Gulab Bagh, in north Kashmir, a third avalanche buried a house Friday morning, killing one person and injuring three, he said. ""We have so far removed to safety over 300 persons from avalanche-prone villages of Waltengo Nar and Gulab Bagh, and lodged them in makeshift rescue centers,"" the senior police official said. After nearly a week of snowfall, authorities have sounded a red alert in the area, asking residents not to move out of their homes, citing the high risk of avalanches. They are a common threat in Kashmir during winters, and scores of lives have been claimed by them this season in areas where people live along the Himalayan mountain ranges.

"(CNN) -- ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" has found its new leading man in Jamie Dornan, according to the author of the best-selling trilogy. ""Stow your twitchy palms ladies ... our man is here. Welcome to #TeamFifty @JamieDornan1,"" writer E.L. James said in a Twitter post on Thursday. The author's revelation comes after industry trades like The Hollywood Reporter and Variety cited sources saying the 31-year-old actor has been tapped to replace Charlie Hunnam, the ""Sons of Anarchy"" actor who was originally cast as Christian Grey and dropped out in mid-October. So far, Universal Studios and the actor's representatives haven't commented on the reports. Dornan's name may not be that familiar to American audiences, but his face might be. The star, who was born in Northern Ireland, got his start as a model for brands like Dior, Armani and Calvin Klein and posed alongside top names like Kate Moss. Jamie Dornan: Who is he? Before he landed acting roles on U.S. shows like ABC's ""Once Upon A Time,"" on which he played the Huntsman/Sheriff Graham, Dornan was known mainly to U.S. celebrity watchers as the guy dating fellow Brit Keira Knightley. In the UK, he stars in the BBC's psychological thriller ""The Fall."" While Dornan had been considered the front-runner after Hunnam's exit, his wasn't the only name said to be in consideration. The actor reportedly had competition from British actor Christian Cooke, ""The Borgias'"" Francois Arnaud and ""True Blood"" star Alexander Skarsgard. Hunnam, meanwhile, is looking forward to family time. Charlie Hunnam speaks on '50 Shades' exit . ""I am doing good (after dropping 'Fifty Shades'),"" the 33-year-old recently told E! News. ""Just trying to stay focused and stay positive and keep trying to do a good job at work and be with my family."" Hunnam was faced with an onslaught of attention, both positive and negative, after his casting announcement, sparking speculation that he exited the part because of the overwhelming amount of interest. However, studio Universal said Hunnam's TV schedule didn't give him time to adequately prepare to play Christian Grey. Production was expected to begin on the film, adapted from E.L. James' erotic best-seller and to be directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, in early November. The studio has already announced a scheduled release date of August 1, 2014. Although the project has weathered this casting challenge, its leading lady hasn't gone anywhere. Dakota Johnson, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson who has starred in the TV series ""Ben and Kate,"" is still on board to play protagonist Anastasia Steele. CNN's Carolyn Sung and Henry Hanks contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Fifty Shades"" author confirms: Jamie Dornan has been cast as Christian Grey .

"(CNN) -- Lindsey Vonn promising return to competitive skiing continued as she claimed fifth place in the women's World Cup Super-G at Lake Louise on Sunday. Vonn, who placed 11th in Saturday's downhill race and 40th in the same discipline on Friday, finished 0.85 seconds behind Sunday's winner Lara Gut. The 22-year-old Swiss star's fourth victory of the season was achieved in a time of one minute 22.86 seconds, 0.03 seconds ahead of Tina Weirather from Liechtenstein. Austria's Anna Fenniger finished 0.33 seconds back to claim third. Vonn suffered a serious knee injury at the world championships in Schladming last February and her return to competition was delayed following a training crash last month. But after a mishap-free racing weekend, the 29-year-old looks like having a realistic chance of defending her Olympic downhill title in Sochi next February. ""I'm really happy with my skiing. It's getting better every day,"" Vonn said. ""I know now that I can win and be on the podium. That gives me confidence and that was my goal this weekend. To be honest I don't know yet what races I am going to do in Europe. My focus is on the Olympics and with my knee the way it is, I am just not sure how many races I will do,"" she added. ""I want to put myself in the best position going into Sochi very confident and try to win. I will think about all this after this weekend and come up with a decision with my coaches."" Meanwhile in Beaver Creek, America's Ted Ligety's victory in the men's giant slalom on Sunday saw him become the first man since the great Italian skier Alberto Tomba in 1991 to win four consecutive giant slaloms. Following a 30-minute delay for wind and snow, Ligety won in a combined time of two minutes 35.77 seconds, comfortably quicker than compatriot Bode Miller (two minutes 37.09 seconds) who finished second. Austria's Marcel Hirscher finished third. ""I feel like I skied well the whole way done considering the conditions are tough out there; it's pretty bouncy, Ligety said. ""I was able to arch the places I needed to arch. I was a bit surprised by the time difference because with the snow conditions right now it's not a feel-good course.""

"(CNN) -- Zach Johnson denied Tiger Woods a sixth tournament victory in 2013 in a dramatic climax to the World Golf Challenge at the Sherwood Country Club in California on Sunday. The 2007 Masters champion secured the $1 million first prize at the first extra playoff hole, but it was his heroics moments earlier on the final regulation hole that left the crowds gasping. He and Woods were tied for the lead on 13-under par as they headed down the 72nd hole, but when Johnson dumped his approach into the water his hopes looked to have sunk with his ball. But incredibly the Georgia native holed his fourth shot from the drop zone 65 yards out to claim an unlikely par and complete a four-under round of 68. Woods, who had earlier led by four shots with eight to play, also made a meal of par at the 18th putting his second shot into greenside bunker before getting up and down to finish with a round of 70. When the players returned to the play the 18th again in the playoff, it was Woods who blinked first, finding sand again with his approach while Johnson found the left side of the green. Johnson two-putted for par but Woods, who played out to five feet saw his putt lip out, handing Johnson his second title of the year. America's Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar finished tied for third on nine under with Graeme McDowell the highest placed European player. The Northern Irishman finished in sixth place on five-under par while his compatriot Rory McIlroy, who won his first tournament of the year at the Australian Open last weekend, ended up down in 11th in the 18-man field. Brilliant Bjorn wins in Sun City . Thomas Bjorn produced a stunning final round of 65 to claim a two-shot win at the Nedbank Golf Challenge in Sun City on Sunday.

""This is right up there with the best days of my career,"" Bjorn said, EuropeanTour.com reported. ""You never forget your first victory, and then my win against Tiger in Dubai when I went toe-to-toe with him for four days and came out top was special, but winning here in the way that I did against a field of this quality is up there.

"(CNN) -- It's time to end the posturing and give the world's boxing fans the bout they desperately want: Manny Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather. That's Bob Arum's message to everyone involved in trying to navigate a way through the quagmire that is negotiations for a contest that has long been top of fight fans' wish list. Pacquiao's promoter has been in touch with Mayweather's camp to kick-start talks and finally attempt to get two of boxing's best ever fighters in the ring. Though both boxers are arguably past their prime any match up between Mayweather -- unbeaten in 45 fights across five different weights -- and Pacquiao -- an eight-division world champion with 55 wins from 62 fights -- is likely to ignite huge interest. ""We've put out the olive branch saying we would welcome the start of discussions for such a fight,"" Top Rank chief executive officer Arum told CNN World Sport. ""While Manny fights on HBO and HBO pay-per-view and Floyd fights on Showtime and Showtime pay-per-view, there is a precedent for both networks to come together and put on big event. ""They did it when heavyweight Mike Tyson, who was a Showtime fighter, fought Lennox Lewis, who was an HBO fighter, a number of years ago. That was a hugely successful event and set a record for pay-per-view sales in the US. ""We can't keep posturing,. If people want to make a deal and put aside egos and making statements to the press -- who was right, who was wrong -- and really sincerely want something to happen it generally gets done. ""And it is my hope that's what will happen; when and if both sides sit down to discuss seriously an event the sports world is crying out for."" With Mayweather approaching 37 and Pacquiao, 34, suffering two successive defeats before his most recent victory -- over Brandon Rios in Macau -- Arum acknowledges time is running out to make a deal. While the pair may not be as the pinnacle of their careers as they were when the fight was mooted three years ago, Arum still believes it would generate worldwide interest and reportedly might bring in $100 million. ""I think if an event like that was made people would really flock to watch it,"" he added. ""I think it's very fair to say the clamor is not as fervent as it was a few years ago when they were both at the height of their careers but it's still an event the public are clamoring for, perhaps not as much as three years ago but we can't roll back the clock."" Pacquiao's most immediate focus in the aftermath of his victory over Rios earlier this month has been to defend himself amid accusations that he owes $50 million in unpaid taxes in his home country the Philippines. The 34-year-old's assets have been frozen, meaning he had to borrow money to help victims of Super Typhoon Haiyan that tore through the country. But Arum says the allegations amount to a ""political vendetta"" against Pacquiao, who is a member of congress in the Philippines, and will be ironed out shortly. ""The assessment is based on fights he had in the United States and in every one of those fights -- four fights in the two years in question -- we withheld 30% of the amounts we paid him and paid those amounts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),"" Arum explained. ""We supplied the Philippine tax authorities with the schedule of our payments and receipts from the IRS. For some unknown reason they are insisting the IRS send certification of the payments. ""Manny applied for those certifications a while ago and of course the IRS was bogged down partly because when the government was shut down they weren't working. There's been a hold up but I'm sure once those certifications arrive, it will all go away. ""He doesn't owe anything. Under the Philippine-U.S. tax treaty, he was taxed in the U.S. for income earned in the U.S., and he gets a dollar per dollar credit against his Philippine taxes. ""Once that credit it given to him they'll find there is no further tax liability in the Philippines. ""I think it's great for his image because it shows the nature of politics in the Philippines. Manny Pacquiao is a member of a coalition in the Philippines that is in political opposition to the president and it seems to me as a foreigner, that this is nothing more than a political vendetta."" Arum hailed Pacquiao's showdown with Rios in Macau, a province of China, as a triumph and said he is planning another event with three former Olympic gold medalists in February. Along with the emergence of fighters from Latin America and Eastern Europe, as well as the traditional boxing heartlands of the U.S. and the United Kingdom, Arum pointed to Asia as having huge potential. ""Is Asia an up and coming market for everything? Of course it is,"" he said. ""There's 1.3 billion people in China, there's fans all over Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia. There's tremendous interest in boxing and we expect to do many events in the years to come in Asia. ""There will be a lot of talent in Asian fighters just as there are so many great fighters now coming out of Eastern Europe, from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. ""Boxing is a world wide sport and our best fighters and champions are coming from all over. I'm very, very excited as far as the future of boxing is concerned.""","Boxing promoter Bob Arum says it is time to make Manny Pacquiao v Floyd Mayweather happen .

"(CNN) -- Former NBA star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea on Thursday, the country's state-run media reported. Rodman was there for his latest round of controversial ""basketball diplomacy"" in a country ruled by one of the world's most repressive regimes. The former player and a documentary crew were scheduled to spend four days helping to train a team of North Korean basketball players for a January exhibition in Pyongyang. That January 8 exhibition -- said to be against a yet-unannounced team of former NBA players -- will celebrate the birthday of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom Rodman has called a friend and a ""very good guy"" despite international condemnation of the country's human rights records. Rodman's trip -- sponsored by the online betting company Paddy Power -- is the 52-year-old's third to North Korea. North Korea: Reality vs. the world according to Dennis Rodman . Rodman said he struck up a friendship with Kim, a basketball fan, during Rodman's first trip in February. After the two men sat next to each other watching a basketball exhibition in North Korea's capital, Rodman told Kim that ""you have a friend for life."" Rory Scott, a Paddy Power spokesman, said earlier this month that December's trip is nonpolitical, but is intended ""to prove once again that sport has the power to rise above all issues."" It's not clear whether Rodman will meet with Kim on the basketball training visit. The trip comes at a time of political turmoil in the secretive nuclear-armed nation, ongoing tensions between North Korea and the United States and outcries over North Korea's human rights record. Tensions in the region were ratcheted up as North Korea carried out a long-range rocket launch a year ago and an underground nuclear test, its third so far, in February. The U.N. sanctions that followed were met by a barrage of threatening rhetoric from Pyongyang. Rodman was criticized for his first trip in part because it came during this period, in which North Korea was threatening missile strikes on the United States, South Korea and Japan. The situation has calmed since. But in a sign of internal political upheaval, North Korea announced last week that the regime had executed Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who had been regarded as the country's second-most powerful figure. North Korea's official news agency accused him of trying to overthrow the state. Rodman is ""really important"" to the North Korean regime, said North Korea expert and Forbes.com columnist Gordon Chang. ""Got to remember that Kim Jong Un needs to show that his regime, his government, is united, which it isn't,"" said Chang, author of ""Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World."" ""With Dennis Rodman, we're going to see a lot of made-for-television events. Everybody's going to be smiling, everything will appear normal, and this will bolster the regime,"" Chang told ""CNN Newsroom"" on Wednesday. 'It is not my job to talk about' detained American . The United States has other points of contention with North Korea, including the detention of Korean-American Kenneth Bae. Bae, arrested in North Korea in November 2012, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after he was found guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government through religious activities. U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korean officials to release Bae, widely reported to be a Christian missionary, on humanitarian grounds. His family has said he suffers from chronic health conditions that require doctors' care. Earlier this year, Rodman made no secret about his desire to help Bae. He tweeted that he wanted Kim to ""do him a solid"" by freeing the American prisoner. But after his second trip to see Kim in September, Rodman told reporters that it was ""not my job to talk about Kenneth Bae."" ""Ask Obama about that, ask Hillary Clinton about that,"" Rodman said. ""Ask those ---holes."" Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told CNN on Wednesday that she wants Rodman to press for her brother's freedom. ""I would certainly hope and plead with Mr. Rodman to reconsider and ... make the case"" for Bae's freedom, she said. Rodman, the tattooed and pierced NBA retiree, has emphasized that he's not an official diplomat between the United States and North Korea. ""It's about trying to open Obama's and everyone's minds,"" he said in September while announcing the January exhibition, aiming some of his remarks at the U.S. President. ""You don't have to talk about politics. ... Meet him or even give him a call. That's all he wants."" Paddy Power has said Rodman's team of former NBA players would be announced sometime this month.

"SRINAGAR, Indian-Administered Kashmir (CNN)  -- Three top militant commanders were killed in two separate encounters with security forces in Indian-administered Kashmir, police said. Kashmiri villagers pray during the funeral of Mohammed Haneef, a Hizbul Mujahedeen commander, Sunday. The clashes, which culminated with their deaths on Sunday, followed five days of heavy snowfall across Kashmir that claimed 19 lives, 10 of them on Friday alone. Late Saturday Indian army and paramilitary forces engaged a group of militants hiding in south Kashmir, Noorpora village, 45 kilometers (28 miles) from the capital of Srinagar, a police spokesman said. He identified them as belonging to Hizbul Mujahedeen, comprising mostly local militants. ""As (they) refused to lay down their weapons, a sustained encounter resulted, which continued for several hours,"" the spokesman said. A militant commander and the financial chief of the group were among the dead, he said. A top commander of Pakistan-based Harkatul Mujahedeen was killed in a separate north-Kashmir encounter between militants and Indian security forces, the spokesman said. Indian security forces have recently intensified their operations against militants. In the past 15 days, nearly 20 militants have been killed across Indian-administered Kashmir in gunfights. Kashmir has long been an object of dispute between nuclear rivals and neighbors India and Pakistan, and militants fighting for Kashmir's separation from India have been carrying out attacks against the Indian security forces in Kashmir for 19 years. The separatist violence has left 42,000 people dead, officials said. However, rights groups and various non-governmental organizations put the number at twice that official figure.

"(CNN) -- A Somali man believed to have ties to terrorist groups was shot as he allegedly tried to enter the home of Danish political cartoonist Kurt Westergaard -- known for his controversial depictions of the Muslim prophet Mohammed -- on Friday, police said. The 27-year-old man, who was not identified, wielded an ax and a knife and cracked a window at Westergaard's home in Aarhus, said police spokesman Morten Jensen. A home alarm alerted police to the scene at 10 p.m., and they were attacked by the man, he said. The officers shot the man in the right leg and left hand. He was hospitalized, but was not seriously injured, police said. Danish intelligence officials said the suspect is connected to al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's ally in east Africa. The incident ""once again confirms the terrorist threat that is directed against Denmark and against cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, in particular,"" said Jakob Scharf, spokesman for the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, in a statement. Westergaard's caricature of Mohammed -- which depicted the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse -- sparked an uproar among Muslims in early 2006 after newspapers reprinted the images months later as a matter of free speech. The cartoon was first published by the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten in September 2005. At the time, Westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror. However, many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist. Over the years, Danish authorities have arrested other suspects who allegedly plotted against Westergaard's life. After three such arrests were made in February 2008, Westergaard issued a statement, saying, ""Of course I fear for my life after the Danish Security and Intelligence Service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me. However, I have turned fear into anger and indignation. It has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which I used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness."" Scharf said authorities have taken measures to ensure Westergaard's safety, and that the protection has ""proven effective.""","Assailant allegedly tried to enter the home of Danish political cartoonist Kurt Westergaard .

"(CNN) -- Smog is a common sight in Hong Kong, with the amount of polluted days increasing by 28 percent to 303 so far this year. Hong Kongers would be quick to point the finger at Chinese factories across the border. Yet, research is increasingly indicating that the problem is much more localized, coming from emissions produced by shipping. ""What we know in Hong Kong is that up to 50% of pollution [locally produced] sources come from marine vessels,"" said Gina McCarthy, administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Smog levels within the city of over 7 million reached hazardous levels earlier this week, with particles in one urban area, Sham Shui Po hitting a PM2.5, hitting 91.7 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Anything above 71 is classified as ""very dangerous"" according to the World Health Organization guidelines. Maritime pollution in Hong Kong is blamed for the most sulfur dioxide-related deaths within the region. According to a recent report jointly compiled by the Civic Exchange and The University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong saw 385 deaths caused by the hazardous chemical, for which shipping is to blame. The city lacks regulations in tackling maritime pollution, as there is no legislation or requirements for shipping companies to switch to cleaner fuel when entering Hong Kong waters. Wong Chit-ming, associate professor at the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health noted the Asian hub would continue to see a growth in the amount of pollution from container ships under current lack of regulations. He linked this to an ever-increasing flow of marine traffic coming through the city. However, the government is slowly starting to become more aware of the situation, said Simon Ng Ka-wing, head of transport and sustainability research at Civic Exchange, a Hong Kong thinktank that advises the government on policy. ""In the past we pointed fingers to Guangdong [the province neighboring Hong Kong] saying it is the only reason we suffer from air pollution without knowing that there is locally produced pollution. But now we are getting a clear picture that we can clean up quicker locally."" The city is lagging behind many other hubs in the world such as those within Europe and North America, which have regulations requiring vessels to switch to cleaner emitting fuel, an initiative known as the Emission Control Area (ECA). Marine vessels in Hong Kong can burn cheaper and more hazardous 3.5% sulfur oil, while in various ECA zones, vessels cannot exceed 0.5 percent. New regulations by the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency that is responsible for the safety of maritime vessels and works to prevent pollution from ships, is looking into forcing vessels to burn no more than 0.5 percent of sulfur by 2020. This applies to bigger container and cruise ships, whilst smaller local craft are dealt with under other regulation. Arthur Bowring, managing director of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association said that the shipping industry has been extremely proactive in switching to cleaner fuels. ""In 2010, after discussion and debate, 16 carriers and cruise lines came together in the world's only truly voluntary commitment to change to a cleaner fuel when at berth or at anchor in Hong Kong,"" he said. That agreement, called the Fair Winds Charter cuts port charges by as much as 50% for those sea vessels that switch to cleaner emitting fuels. ""The Fair Winds Charter was put in place for two years, 2011 and 2012, to show government that the industry could switch fuel and that incentive followed by regulation would be possible,"" Bowring said. It was extended until the end of 2013, but has an unclear future. A decision on whether to expand it into 2014 is expected later this month. The government is also due to pass legislation next year that will force all marine traffic to comply with more environmentally friendly fuels and introduce an emissions control zone in the territory's waters. Without urgent regulations, Hong Kong citizens are expected to suffer both short-term and longer-term health effects, such as numerous cancers, putting a burden on the local health system. ""Excess hospitalization, extra treatment, we can translate to money value,"" said Wong Chit-ming, associate professor at The University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health. ""It justifies the government to implement measures to improve the air."" The government is attempting to make the public aware of the adverse health affects that the pollution causes by replacing the 18-year-old air pollution index with an air quality health index from December 30. In a recent report, published by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, introducing an emissions control zone can cut sulfur dioxide emissions in the Pearl River Delta region by as much as 95%. ""What Hong Kong can probably benefit from is a renewed sense of urgency in addressing this issue,"" said Peter Levesque, American Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong Vice Chairman. ""I think in general, Hong Kong understands that it can take the lead by doing what it can to fix the problems here and work with South China to have a regional solution.""","Localized pollution from ships becoming a major contributor towards the city's smoggy skyline .

"(CNN) -- A Norwegian court sentenced three people Monday for their roles in a plot to attack a Danish newspaper that published cartoons depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammed. Mikael Davud, Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak Bujak and David Jakobsen were convicted in connection with a plot to carry out explosions at offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. Davud and Bujak were convicted of terror charges, while Jakobsen was convicted of a lesser explosives charge. Davud, a Norwegian citizen of Uyghur origin, was sentenced to seven years in prison. Bujak, an Iraqi-Kurdish man with Norwegian residency, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, and Jakobsen, originally from Uzbekistan, was sentenced to four months in prison. All three defendants have already served 606 days in custody, which will be deducted from their sentences, Oslo District Court spokesman Markus Iestra said. Authorities also accused Davud and Bujak of plotting to shoot cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who drew an image of the Muslim prophet Mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban that was published in Jyllands-Posten in 2005. The controversy grew in early 2006 when a Norwegian newspaper reprinted the drawings. Islamic law generally bans any depiction of Mohammed. Norwegian authorities have said Davud, Bujak and Jakobsen were suspected of having connections to al Qaeda. In July 2010, Norwegian officials said Davud, Bujak and Jakobsen were arrested in connection with an ongoing investigation into terrorist plots in New York and the United Kingdom.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds filed by a casket on Sunday to say goodbye to a small-town hero who died shortly after scoring the winning shot to clinch an undefeated season for his Michigan high school basketball team. Friends, family and even competitors braved a cold Michigan day for a pair of afternoon visitations for 16-year-old Wes Leonard of Fennville. Some piled off of school buses and hugged each other in the crisp winter air. ""He was just an all around great guy to play against,"" Craig Peterson, a player on the Bangor high school basketball team, told CNN affiliate WZZM. ""He was always respectful, he didn't run his mouth like most of the people would. He just liked to have fun, and was a great athlete."" Leonard's funeral is set for 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at Christ Memorial Church in nearby Holland. Leonard died moments after scoring the winning basket in overtime Thursday, securing a perfect season for the Fennville High School Blackhawks. Leonard scored his team's last four points in the 57-55 victory. An autopsy Friday revealed Leonard died of cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart, according to a statement from Dr. David A.

"Maroua, Cameroon (CNN) -- The governor of Cameroon's Far North Region on Thursday said threats posed by militant Islamist group Boko Haram were ""very critical."" Speaking in Mokolo, Gov. Joseph Beti Assomo told reporters that all senior state security officials, divisional heads and religious leaders have been put on the alert. Some 600 soldiers in the Far North region have been ordered out of their barracks and strategically deployed in localities close to the border with Nigeria, he added. Cameroon's regional governments have intensified rigorous checks after Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan ordered border closures with some neighboring countries, including Cameroon, due to threats from the Boko Haram. Residents in the Far North capital of Maroua have been reporting to police a growing number of strangers and unusual occurrences. The Far North Region is largely Muslim and shares a border with northern Nigeria, where the Boko Haram is based. Trade and custom officials in Maroua say nearly 80% of its regional economy has shrunk since the closure of the borders. Consumers of Nigerian sugar, flour, cement and other manufactured products are concerned about plummeting supplies, while smuggled Nigerian fuel, locally called ""zoua-zoua,"" is the object of sharp price hikes. The Far North Region is home to more than 2 million people, according to an official head count. Recent weeks have seen an escalation in clashes between Boko Haram and security forces in Nigeria's northeastern states of Borno and Yobe, as well as attacks on churches and assassinations. Boko Haram (which according to the group means ""Western civilization is forbidden"") is demanding the imposition of Islamic sharia law across Nigeria.

"(CNN) -- A Detroit-area man who claimed he accidentally shot and killed a 19-year-old woman he thought was breaking into his home will stand trial on a charge of second-degree murder, a judge ruled Thursday. District Court Judge David Turfe said there was enough probable cause for Theodore Paul Wafer, 54, to stand trial in connection with the November 2 shooting of Renisha McBride, who authorities say was intoxicated and possibly disoriented following a car crash before Wafer shot her on his Dearborn Heights porch. ""Defendant came to the door with the shotgun, Turfe said, according to CNN Michigan affiliate WXYZ. ""His first thought was to bring the gun, not call for help, or not answer the door. It suggests to this court, the defendant made a bad choice."" A friend of McBride told the court that she and the victim had been playing a drinking game with vodka and smoking marijuana the night of the shooting. Wafer's next court appearance is scheduled for January 15. Wafer, whose lawyer said he shot the victim in self-defense, was charged with second-degree murder last month after days of pressure from McBride's relatives seeking an arrest. He also was charged with manslaughter and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Wafer told investigators he thought McBride was breaking into his home, and that the shotgun accidentally discharged when he investigated, police said. McBride was unarmed and there was no evidence of a break-in, so Wafer -- who authorities say shot McBride from behind a closed, locked screen door -- cannot lawfully claim he needed to shoot her to stop an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy told reporters last month.

"(CNN) -- The tropical cruise was once the quintessential getaway of the elderly retiree -- a relaxing voyage through sun-soaked climes augmented by the soothing sounds of the open ocean. Not any more. Come Sunday evening, the vast expanse of the Caribbean Sea will echo to the altogether more riotous noise of ""Shiprocked,"" a heavy metal festival aboard the giant Norwegian Pearl cruise ship. Setting sail from the port of Miami, Florida, the floating concert will alight in Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas five days later. Pina coladas by the pool and tranquil ocean sunsets from the cabin balcony this raucous event is not. Instead, just under 3,000 paying guests will be treated to drums, guitars and foot-stomping moshpits as the likes of Papa Roach, Five Finger Death Punch and In This Moment perform across a series of stages set up both above and below deck. According to ""Shiprocked"" owner Alan Koenig the event will be ""the ultimate hard rock festival at sea."" ""We already sold out a few months in advance and are now super-excited about sailing,"" he added of an event that has almost tripled in size since it first set sail in 2009. On top of live performances from more than 23 bands, a range of comedians, dancers and entertainers will provide additional on-board attractions. Guests are free to mingle with bands and performers in the vessel's many bars, restaurants and during daytime activities -- quizzes, Q&As and talent shows -- put on by the event organizers. Sea of rock . This heady mix of sun, food, drink and metal is light-years away from the traditional music festival where fans sleep in campsites and catch truncated sets of their favorite bands as they perform to tens or even hundreds of thousands of people. Koenig believes the intimacy of concert cruises alongside the easy interaction they encourage between bands and audience are the main reasons the concept has proved popular. Big name acts such as Kid Rock, Weezer and Damian Marley have all taken part in similar voyages or set up their own cruises in recent years. Mega-festivals like Coachella have also gotten in on the act with an indie-rock cruise in late 2012 headlined by UK legends Pulp. Promoter and producer of the Monsters of Rock, Moody Blues and Celtic Thunder cruises, Larry Morland believes that artists and event organizers are beginning to realize there is a value to these maritime festivals beyond the novelty of performing at sea. No wonder given tickets for ""Shiprocked"" are priced between $899 and $3,599, showing the events can be a lucrative endeavor as well as great exposure for bands and festival brands. They arguably also help attract a younger audience to cruise vacations. ""It really has developed in the last five or so years,"" Morland said. ""They have gone from being simple productions to now having elaborate stages and video walls. It's kind of (become) a Vegas-type entertainment atmosphere on a ship. ""Fans are willing to pay a premium, and going on a cruise is a premium, for what it is basically a vacation with their favorite band."" he added. ""It's a very memorable experience for them."" Nostalgia sells . The expense, which generally equates to more than a land based festival given the extra cost of food, beverages and activities included in the ticket, ensures the majority of fans are aged 35 or upwards, inevitably influencing the type of bands booked for cruises. Rather than contemporary chart acts, groups will likely be more established and have built up a committed following over a number of years. Such loyalty reflects itself in the way fans and bands interact aboard the ship. Both Koenig and Morland recall witnessing big-name artists sit down for long chats with fans and in some cases perform impromptu collaborations or sing-a-longs. According to Morgan Rose, drummer in the band Sevendust, who have performed at previous ""Shiprocked"" events and will do so again this year, giving something back to those who make their success possible is important. ""It's so cool as usually the bands who come aboard think this is different from anything else and a really good way to meet the people who support the music,"" he said. ""You're out there for four or five days at a time and you get to become friends with these people."" Rose fondly recalls drinking the bar dry with fans at previous events and watching as other bands get up to unspeakable rock and roll mischief with their adoring public. As the concert cruise concept becomes more popular, however, both Koenig and Morland see the need to continually improve what they offering music fans. Morland speaks of rumors of a gigantic cruise ship being built with the sole purpose of hosting floating music festivals. More likely in the short term though will be ever bigger bands performing on cruises. ""The sky's the limit,"" Morland said of who could potentially be attracted to play. ""I can see us going after the (Rolling) Stones sooner or later. ""You could even fill up a couple of ships and have (warm up) events on board before sailing to a private island and having a full Stones show there. Some of the cruise companies already own a private Caribbean island or two. ""Can you imagine that,"" he asks excitedly before pausing briefly seemingly to consider the prospect of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and co. strutting their stuff on a far-off beach at sundown. ""That would be amazing."" See also: Cricketers play at sea . See also: Celebrity architects space age yacht .

"New York (CNN) -- The famous frisky felines who fouled up traffic on the New York City subway this summer have found a forever family. A married couple from Brooklyn Heights has adopted the four-month-old kittens, Arthur and August, who were previously being cared for at an animal foster home, according to Richard Gentles, spokesman for Animal Care & Control of NYC. Katherine and Keith Lubeley are the proud new parents, and they say the kittens are adapting to their new home pretty quickly. ""They're adjusting to the spaciousness,"" Keith Lubeley said. ""We've been introducing them room by room."" According to Gentles, the kitties were sheltered for about two months before they were eligible for adoption. ""One was a little underweight, and both kittens needed to be socialized,"" he explained. The fearless felines shut down about six miles of track on two subway lines in Brooklyn after they were spotted wandering in the subway system on August 29. The New York Police Department sent officers to the scene for crowd control as trains stopped running for about 90 minutes. According to the Animal Care & Control of NYC, Arthur, a tabby, and August, who has a solid black coat, are arguably the most famous kittens in New York City history, although not much is known about their origins. ""From what we can tell, they are brothers from the same litter,"" Keith Lubeley said. ""They seem to be good partners and they are definitely playful.""

"Gallman, Mississippi (CNN) -- Heartbroken and baffled. That's how friends and relatives of a Mississippi family described themselves the day authorities said they'd found the bodies of Atira Hill, Laterry Smith and Jaidon Hill, 7. The mother, stepfather and boy vanished last week. ""We went to bed last night still praying they would be brought home safely, but unfortunately, that did not happen,"" said Vinson Jenkins, Hill's cousin. ""To my knowledge, we don't know why anybody would want to do any harm to them."" Authorities don't know why yet either. When the family first disappeared, they hoped they had a simple missing persons case on their hands. The family was last seen Friday in a car. An investigation kicked into gear when that vehicle was later found flipped and on fire. Bloody clothes belonging to the victims were discovered next in a gas station Dumpster. And then the bodies were located. They were found overnight in a wooded area, Copiah County Sheriff Harold Jones said Tuesday. They had been shot to death. ""I don't know how anyone could be so callous and cruel to do this -- take a life, especially the life of a child who hurt no one and didn't deserve what he got,"" said Angela Ashford, another family member. Authorities have arrested 42-year-old Timothy Burns on suspicion of arson, Jones said. He is also being held for ""investigative purposes"" in connection to the killings, according to the sheriff. It was not immediately clear whether Burns had retained representation. He was being held at the jail in Copiah County, southwest of Jackson. The investigation is ongoing, but at this point, authorities believe Burns was driving the car, got into an accident and then set the vehicle on fire, Jones said. It's not known whether the victims were in the car at the time of the accident. Nor is it known whether Burns and the victims had ties, though the sheriff believes they did not. He said Burns led authorities to the bodies. ""We're investigating. This just happened,"" Jones said. According to CNN affiliate WAPT, Jaidon was a student at Stonebridge Elementary School in Brandon, Mississippi. A prayer vigil was held Tuesday night at the school, where a flag was lowered to half staff. Hill worked as a nurse's assistant at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, while Smith was a Sheetrock installer, WAPT said. According to Hill's mother, Judith Hughes, Hill called early Saturday to say she and Jaidon were on their way to meet Smith's relatives to ""take care of some business."" Hughes said she asked her daughter if everything was OK. She said it was. The phone signal was weak, and the call dropped. Hughes tried calling back, but the call went straight to voice mail. Hughes said Jaidon lived with her and that he was meant to spend the weekend with his mother. After the family's car was found flipped, Hughes said she went to the home where Hill and Smith are believed to have lived. It was empty, she said. Hughes' house was full Tuesday as family members gathered to mourn and to try to makes sense of what happened.

"London (CNN) -- The deaths of 16 children aged five and six together with their teacher in the Scottish town of Dunblane in 1996 was one of Britain's worst incidents of gun-related violence. The massacre stunned the country, but what did the UK do to try to prevent such a tragedy happening again? What happened at Dunblane? Shortly after 9 a.m. on March 13, 1996, Thomas Hamilton, a 43-year-old former Scout leader, burst into the gymnasium of a primary school in the tranquil Scottish town of Dunblane. Within minutes 15 children aged five and six had died in a hail of bullets. One died later in hospital. Their teacher, Gwen Mayor, a 44-year-old mother of two, died in the attack, reportedly while trying to shield her pupils. Two other teachers were also seriously injured while heroically trying to protect children. Hamilton turned one of his four handguns on himself and was found dead at the scene. Tennis star Andy Murray, who grew up in Dunblane, was present during the attack at his school, but normally refuses to speak about his experience. He posted this tribute during the weekend on his website: ""My heart goes out to all those poor children, their families and the community in Newtown in Connecticut, so so sad."" In his autobiography ""Hitting Back,"" Murray recalled how as an eight-year-old boy he was walking to the gymnasium when shooting broke out. A teacher led him and his classmates into the headteacher's study where they took refuge. ""Some of my friends' brothers and sisters were killed. I have only retained patch impressions of that day, such as being in a classroom singing songs. The weirdest thing was that we knew the guy [Hamilton]. He had been in my mum's car. It's obviously weird to think you had a murderer in your car, sitting next to your mum."" Who was Hamilton? Many local people said Hamilton was an oddball -- a loner obsessed with guns and young boys, someone who didn't fit into society. He was reported to have held a grudge against the Scouting movement and his local community after police questioned him about inappropriate behavior to boys in his care. Raymond Reid, secretary of a local shooting club that rejected Hamilton for membership, described him as ""sleazy."" ""He was just one of these people that you got a gut feeling about ... didn't like -- or at least I didn't particularly like him,"" Reid said. Nevertheless, Hamilton held a permit to own handguns, possibly including the ones he used at Dunblane. What was the reaction to the massacre? The massacre, one of the worst incidents of gun violence in Britain, had a massive impact in Scotland, the rest of the UK and around the world. ""This is a slaughter of the innocents, unlike anything we have ever seen in Scotland, and I think Scotland is going to have to come to terms with it,"" said Scottish MP Helen Liddell at the time. After the massacre, appalled residents of Dunblane and bereaved relatives demanded to know how a person like Hamilton could be allowed to own guns. A highly successful public campaign in the months after Dunblane against gun ownership culminated in a petition being handed to the government with almost 750,000 signatures, according to British media reports. In response, then Conservative Prime Minister John Major set up a public inquiry to look into gun laws and assess ways to better protect the public. What happened next? In the wake of the 1987 Hungerford massacre, in which one lone gunman killed 16 people, Britain introduced new legislation -- the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 -- making registration mandatory for owning shotguns and banning semi-automatic and pump-action weapons. Within a year and a half of the Dunblane massacre, UK lawmakers had passed a ban on the private ownership of all handguns in mainland Britain, giving the country some of the toughest anti-gun legislation in the world. After both shootings there were firearm amnesties across the UK, resulting in the surrender of thousands of firearms and rounds of ammunition. Britain has never had a ""gun culture"" like that of the United States, but there were about 200,000 legally-registered handguns in Britain before the ban, most owned by sports shooters. All small-bore pistols, including the .22 caliber, were included in the ban, along with rifles used by target shooters. Penalties for anyone found in possession of illegal firearms range from heavy fines to prison terms of up to 10 years. ""It was one of the most shocking things that has ever happened in this country and it united the country in a feeling that we had to do something,"" Gill Marshall Andrews, of the Gun Control Network, told CNN. ""And I don't think that it would have been possible to make the kind of progress that we have made without that tragedy."" The public generally supported the ban, with most saying they saw no need for guns. However, others complained bitterly that the ban deprived legitimate sports shooters of their hobby and demonized them. ""Just because we enjoy shooting doesn't mean that we think everybody should be free to go into any shop on any street corner and buy a gun without having some suitable checks,"" firearms expert Michael Yardley, spokesman for Britain's Sportsmans' Society, said at the time. ""There is obviously a balanced position. What we don't like is being scapegoated. ""Anyone who has any expert knowledge in this field realizes that a simplistic ban, bureaucratic ban on one category of firearm, was never going to solve a real world problem,"" Yardley said. ""But that's what's happened, and what we're going to see is handgun crime will continue as ever. It will probably grow."" What effect did the ban have? According to bare statistics, the ban initially appeared to have little impact, as the number of crimes involving guns in England and Wales rose heavily during the late 1990s to peak at 24,094 offenses in 2003/04. Since then the number has fallen in each year. In 2010/11 there were 11,227 offenses, 53% below the peak number, according to the official crime figures. Crimes involving handguns also fell 44% -- from 5,549 in 2002/03 to 3,105 -- in 2010/11. Despite this, the effectiveness of Britain's gun laws has been repeatedly questioned. The most high-profile mass shooting happened in 2010 when a lone gunman killed 12 people in a four-hour shooting spree in rural Cumbria, northern England. After a huge manhunt, the body of 52-year-old taxi driver Derrick Byrd was found alongside two powerful rifles, one equipped with a telescopic sight. Criminologist Peter Squires said the real picture shows a slight but significant decline in the use of firearms since Dunblane. The figures don't tell the whole story, he said, but ""the murder rate has fallen and all the indicators are moving in the right direction."" Squires, professor of criminology at Brighton University and a member of the Gun Control Network, said he believed the fall in crimes where guns were used was due to new legislation coupled with better policing against gangs. ""Any weapon can be misused in a crime. Gun control will never be a complete solution to events like the mass shooting we saw in Connecticut. The swamp of gun use has not been fully drained and while tighter gun control removes risk on an incremental basis, significant numbers of weapons remain in Britain."" He added it was important to note that a big problem remained in Britain and other countries with imitation guns, converted weapons such as starting pistols and air guns, ""which many people regard as only one step up from a toy.""","Tennis star Andy Murray present at Dunblane attack, pays tribute to Connecticut victims .

"(CNN) -- Two rights groups launched a stinging critique Wednesday on Russia's freedom of expression record, citing a heavy clampdown on critics and activists since Vladimir Putin returned to the presidency. The reports by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch highlight changes to the law that they say have helped authorities stifle dissent. Opinion: Pussy Riot and Russia's surreal 'justice' ""In the year since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency in May 2012, the Russian government has unleashed a crackdown on civil society unprecedented in the country's post-Soviet history,"" Human Rights Watch said in its report. ""The authorities have introduced a series of restrictive laws, harassed, intimidated, and in several cases imprisoned political activists, interfered in the work of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and sought to cast government critics as clandestine enemies, thereby threatening the viability of Russia's civil society."" Opinion: Why Pussy Riot matters . At least two new laws have been introduced and 11 amended in the past year, according to Amnesty International, including broad provisions that allow for ""arbitrary interference"" with the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. As a result, the space for political opposition and other forms of dissent is ""rapidly shrinking,"" it said. ""These recent legal initiatives have the declared aim of ensuring public order and the protection of the rights of citizens,"" it said. ""Their effect has been the opposite: prominent government critics, opposition voices, watchdogs and ordinary individual protesters (on a wide range of issues) have all seen their rights restricted over the course of the last year."" This is happening even though these rights are explicitly guaranteed by the nation's constitution and international human rights treaties to which Russia is party, Amnesty points out. Opinion: Russia's civil society crackdown continues . Two of the new laws ""clearly seek to limit, or even end, independent advocacy and other NGO work,"" Human Rights Watch said. One, the ""foreign agents"" law, requires any group receiving foreign funding and engaging in ""political activities"" to register as a ""foreign agent,"" the report said. Inspections conducted by authorities to enforce this law ""appeared aimed, at minimum, to intimidate civil society activists"" and could potentially be used to force some groups to either end certain types of work or close altogether, it said. Internet content has also been subjected to new legal restrictions, and another law on freedom of assembly imposes limits on public demonstrations and drastic fines on those who violate it, it added. Russia's government has not yet responded to the reports. Kremlin critic in court . Meanwhile, the trial of prominent Kremlin critic and opposition leader Aleksei Navalny resumed in a court in Kirov, a city about 500 miles northeast of Moscow. Navalny, a popular anti-corruption blogger, is accused of embezzling $510,000 worth of timber when he worked for the governor of the Kirov area. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 1 million rubles ($32,000) if convicted. Navalny says the charges are revenge for his criticism of senior Russian officials and allegations of corruption by managers of state-run firms, the official RIA Novosti news agency reported. The case was previously closed by prosecutors in spring 2012 for lack of evidence, the Human Rights Watch report said. Navalny has been detained several times by Russian authorities over his political protest activities. In one example, in October of last year he was detained and charged after staging a one-man protest over police torture in front of the headquarters of the Federal Security Service in Moscow, Human Rights Watch said. Permission is not needed to stage a one-man protest. Navalny told a court that after he finished his protest, a group of journalists followed him to ask questions, ""at which point he was detained and charged with organizing an unauthorized rally,"" the report said.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Police in China's capital are in a jam after publishing guidance for ""inadequate"" women drivers online. According to a post on the official Beijing Police department account on Weibo -- China's popular micro-blogging service -- female drivers ""usually have inadequate driving skills and often lack a sense of direction."" If that wasn't news enough for China's female roadsters, it added women drivers ""tend to get in a panic after an accident and usually draw a complete mental blank, giving opportunities for criminals."" Aside from questionable skills at the wheel, the police pointed out a few other potential perils to avoid, such as wearing high heels or driving without tying your hair back. Apparently excessive decorations in your car may also bring danger. Another official police post features a cartoon of a confrontation between a policeman and a woman driving a vehicle shaped like a large high heel. ""Women drivers, please change into flat shoes when you're driving,"" the caption warns. While Beijing police could not immediately be contacted for comment, another post on its account cited a China News article, which claimed almost 70% of road accidents in China are caused by women. Saudi cleric warns driving could damage women's ovaries . Unsurprisingly, the police post provoked a backlash on social media. ""Many male drivers are no different. They think they are good at driving, but most car crashes are caused by men,"" said one user on Weibo, called Shantianxinzai. ""This is the first time I saw pure gender discrimination from the authorities,"" said another, identified as Jifengliuyang. ""Obvious gender discrimination, if it's in the U.S., they will get sued,"" declared Miaoxingrendenvpu. Others, meanwhile, sided with police.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Podcasting saved Kevin Smith's career. So said the filmmaker (and you can throw a few slashes after that title these days) at the South by Southwest festival here on Monday during a panel called, appropriately, ""The Business of Kevin Smith."" ""I had no idea, but that would become the f---ing center of everything I'm doing now,"" said Smith, who broke into moves after making 1994's indie hit ""Clerks"" for roughly $25,000. ""The ultimate freedom that allowed me to walk away from the 'heroin' [money] of the movie business -- what gave me the strength to walk away -- was [expletive] podcasting."" Smith said he was working on ""Zach and Miri Make a Porno,"" which he wrote and directed, when he realized the passion that led him to make movies like ""Dogma"" and ""Chasing Amy"" was gone. ""For a while I became a filmmaker and for a while a professional director,"" he said. ""But I really felt like I'm an artist."" Smith said he decided to take advantage of his access to celebrities and gift of gab to launch a new project. And he deployed a technique he said has always served him well: do what you love and what you're good at, then figure out how to make money doing it. And that led to ""SModcast,"" a weekly podcast that he and friend/co-producer Scott Mosier launched in 2007 and do to this day. It was free. But as its online audience grew, the opportunities to make money arose. ""People would tweet left and right: 'You put out so many free podcasts; how can I pay it back?' "" said Smith, who has more than 2 million followers on Twitter. ""I was like, 'Go buy a T-shirt' and they were like, 'Cool.' "" Then came paid advertising. (The first sponsor notoriously being adult product Fleshlight). Then a paid version of the podcast, ""SModcost,"" which contains bonus features but no ads. Then he and Mosier took the show on the road, selling out venues and selling merchandise along the way. Smith now heads up a SModcast network of funny and sometimes raunchy Internet radio shows. In a way, the podcasting model is a logical extension for Smith, who took to the Internet early. In the mid-'90s, a friend told him he had to go see a website someone had created for ""Clerks."" Smith had to go to an Internet cafÃ© to view it. And as he admitted Monday, he wasn't exactly Web savvy. ""I was like Scotty in 'Star Trek,' "" he said. ""I was like, 'Computer! Take me to 'Clerks'!"" Ming Chen, who now appears on Smith's reality show ""Comic Book Men,"" had created the site. Smith quickly hired him to make an official one for his production company, View Askew. Before long, it had a message board with more than 200,000 registered users -- a huge number on the Internet of the '90s -- and it established Smith as one of the first filmmakers with a major online presence. ""In terms of filmmakers, it was me and (""Lord of the Rings"" director) Peter Jackson on the Web,"" he said. Then, one day, he said 'I'm going to get offline and go make classics' and I was like, 'I'll stay here.' ""","Kevin Smith: After I lost my passion for film, podcasting saved my career .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- ""How you doin' darlin'? Where you from? I know there's a storm that passed through, but we still gotta eat!"" And with a big smile that said ""thanks for the tip!"" the crowd-pleasing trumpet player continued to woo tourists in front of St. Louis Cathedral. It's just another day in the French Quarter -- but it's also just days since the first major hurricane hit New Orleans since Katrina. Have no doubt, as far as tourism is concerned, New Orleans is up and running and ready as ever to welcome visitors. Business owners and community leaders say the speedy recovery from Isaac is thanks to smart leadership, strong lines of communication and serious preparation. ""The really great news coming out of this is that everything's working so well: All the billions spent on the levees and the gates -- it all seems to be working,"" said Ti Adelaide Martin, co-proprietor of restaurant icon Commander's Palace, located in the city's Garden District. Martin isn't complaining too much about the power outage and the physical damage from Isaac. She's not happy about losing a week's business, but she says there's not even enough damage to bother her insurance agent this time around. How a New Orleans native rides out a storm . ""I'm gonna have to take the hit myself -- and I'm the happiest girl in town about that,"" she laughed. ""After Katrina we were closed for 13 months and it was 6Â½ million dollars to get back open again."" In addition to keeping more detailed records on employees, including cell phones and home addresses, Martin said Commander's also has an internal website for companywide communication in case of emergency and generators to keep the 10,000-plus bottle wine cellar functioning in case of a loss of power. That wasn't the case in 2005, when about 7,500 bottles were shipped out of town before the storm hit. Since Katrina, the company has also set up a way to process its payroll remotely. Post-Isaac diners at Commander's may see an abbreviated menu at first, because some items, such as turtle soup, involve preparation that can take a few days to perfect. But in fairly short order, ""you won't even know there's been a storm,"" said Martin. Storm evidence was easier to see at Mardi Gras World on the riverfront, where a plate glass window was blown out and parts of the roof were damaged or blown away. But President and CEO Barry Kern is confident that damages from Isaac will be repaired soon. Mardi Gras World produces the colorful floats that fill the streets of New Orleans during that revered holiday -- and those floats are pulled with the help of generators -- a fact that bodes well for the company during a hurricane. After Katrina those generators were being used ""anywhere and everywhere"" said Kern, including by police and fire stations. This time, the 130 generators were ready for double duty, but only a few had to be sent out to help other locations that lost power. ""We deal with these storms the way they deal with snowstorms and earthquakes in other parts of the country,"" said Kern, pointing out that none of downtown, the French Quarter or the museum and arts district suffered power outages from Isaac. The tourism business has been ""spectacular"" this year and Isaac is a ""blip on the screen,"" he said. ""New Orleans moves to the beat of its own drummer. There are more restaurants and more tourist attractions and more venues for parties and events than we've ever had in the city of New Orleans,"" Kern said. Open since 1932, Mardi Gras World and Kern Studios have seen plenty of hurricanes. Teamwork has always been key to recovery. ""I have guys here who are artists, who are up on the roof helping the roof get patched,"" said Kern, whose company also produces elaborate floats for parades around the world. ""The fact that we're already up and operating says a lot. The storm was on Wednesday and we're open for business on Friday. That's pretty darn good!"" Business as usual is also the mantra at another New Orleans dining institution, Galatoire's on Bourbon Street. ""It lasted a day longer than we thought it would,"" said President and CEO Melvin Rodrigue, but he said they're expecting a good crowd and there are ""considerable"" reservations for the Labor Day weekend. Friday lunchtime at Galatoire's generally means a packed house, but on the Friday after the storm, there was a rare sighting at Galatoire's: empty tables. One regular customer, Brobson Lutz, said that those empty tables were an indication that ""the word's obviously not gotten out yet! Normally the roar of the crowd here is louder than the roar of a hurricane,"" he said. Rodrigue, who is also chairman of the board of the city's convention center, said that Labor Day weekend isn't really a big deal in the big picture of New Orleans tourism. He called Labor Day a ""line in the sand"" that takes the city out of the slower summer season and into the more intense time of year for visitors. ""We're getting ready for a busy, bustling season come the middle to the end of September."" In terms of numbers, 2012 could break a key record for New Orleans: there's ""a distinct possibility"" that visitor numbers will reach pre-Katrina numbers for the first time, Rodrigue said. The city saw 10.1 million visitors in 2004, he said. ""We're going to get close to that 10 million mark again, if we don't exceed it."" Another positive indicator is a 57 percent occupancy rate at the convention center. By comparison, the rate was 44 percent in 2004, pre-Katrina, and 47 percent in 2011. ""We broke 50 percent occupancy three out of the last four years,"" which is a sign of excellent convention bookings, he said. A short walk away from Galatoire's, J.C. Joseph at the One Sun Art Gallery on Royal Street was busy preparing to re-hang paintings on the yellow and brick walls in his long entrance hallway. ""This is usually filled with paintings,"" he said. He took them all down in preparation for the storm, but then faced another challenge: the man who was supposed to come in and help him hang them back up was stranded on the other side of the Mississippi in a home with no power. But Joseph is optimistic about the future and has no doubt the tourists will keep coming, not only the usual visitors seeking New Orleans music and culture, but also the growing numbers of travelers who arrive via cruise ship, adding yet another set of faces to the NOLA tourism crowd. At Kako Gallery, also on Royal Street, Catherine Coe says she was happy to come to work because there's air conditioning -- unlike at her home, where power has yet to be restored. In Jackson Square, the tourists, the colorful characters and the music were out in full force. Derrick Richardson is stationed at the Air Force Base in Shreveport, Louisiana, but he's on leave this week and was touring New Orleans for the very first time. ""I've never been here. So the fun part is seeing all this (he motions toward the band playing nearby and a gold-painted mime ""frozen"" on the corner), but then also seeing all of the crazy clean-up going on too at the same time. We were watching the weather closely and I didn't think we were gonna be able to do this."" But Richardson's leave was approved Thursday and he made the trip down with no problems. His friend Brooke Garner says the ""normal New Orleans attitude"" is going strong and she's excited to show him all the hot spots in the Quarter. ""We've been walking down Bourbon Street and later I'm going to take him to get his first beignet,"" she said, right before they popped inside St. Louis Cathedral. Ti Adelaide Martin is expecting ""one heck of a great fall"" -- and winter, with the Super Bowl coming back to the Big Easy for the first time since 2002. ""And by the way, we only need one team to fly in for that,"" she said, ""because we've got the other one (the Saints) in town.""","Businesses hit hard by Katrina are breathing a sigh of relief .

"(CNN) -- A word to the wise. If you're going to go walking in snow, take big steps. I was knee deep in a Swiss forest pretending to be the adventurer Bear Grylls when I came a cropper and collapsed face first into a snowdrift. Before I could emerge from my embarrassing predicament, a photograph was helpfully plastered across social media. I held out a hand for help, but Beau, a giant of a cameraman, was too busy laughing. Welcome to the World Economic Forum. This place eats up Davos virgins and spits them out faster than you can say CEO. Veterans like Richard Quest, who is attending his 10th WEF, take great pleasure in warning new CNN producers that it'll cost a fortune, it's exhausting, but it's like no other event like it you've ever been to before. They're not wrong. Imagine taking a small Swiss city, laden with shops selling little more than overpriced cuckoo clocks, chocolate and snowboards, surrounding it in barriers of steel and snipers, and inviting the masters of the universe in business, politics and academia to visit. Europe's highest city is a very strange place. It's where $20 won't even get you a portion of pasta, where your pidgin German and French is quietly laughed at, and where any kind of shoes feel like a bad choice. Billy Connolly once said: ""there's no such thing as bad weather, only the wrong kind of clothing."" In Davos, everyone's changing clothes every time they move from ferocious air blowers indoors to the Baltic outdoors. I saw one CEO quickly dump his $400 brogues in favor of some slightly ridiculous moon boots. Hunters are stylish and do rather well. My $7 discount store rubber attachments have -- so far -- survived intact. Beyond the ring of steel, tourists were rapidly banished as journalists from round the world take over ski lodges and budget hotels. Small businesses clear off as corporate hospitality moves in. Over a weekend I watched a pet shop converted into a plush hospitality suite for Barclays. The RBS lounge looked like no other bank I've ever been to. If only my local branch in south London was kitted out with comfy sofas and a bar. It would be somewhere to drown your sorrows when you've smashed through your overdraft. Inside the barrier, once you've passed armed security, the x-ray machine and the ID card scanner, you're finally allowed entry to the Kongress Centre (clearly a typographical error) using the back entrance though a tunnel made from material not unlike a bouncy castle. It's brilliant white, and resembles a bio-hazard emergency tent which featured in E-T 30 years ago. Sweating in heavy winter gear under the power of hot air blowers, I soon discovered how my ID badge dictates your right to access, food and hospitality at WEF. Simply put it's a reinvention of the class system. Journalist purple badge holders are ranked just above pond life, but at least we can get inside the center. White badges are allowed better nibbles. Meanwhile, back in the forest, I struggled to tie a washing line between two trees. I then added some Davos related surveys with clothes pegs. This was a stunt for my show, Marketplace Europe, which showed the plethora of reports which come out to coincide with WEF. The phrase ""it seemed like a good idea at the time"" sprung to mind more than once in the freezing wind, followed by another whispered piece of advice from Richard which I had cheerfully ignored: ""Don't forget the long johns, Pepper."" Opinion: Will global elite listen to Pope of poor? Can Davos make a difference to global inequality?","Chris Pepper, a ""Davos virgin"" shares his experience of attending the WEF for the first time .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's foreign minister says he's summoning the U.S. Ambassador following fresh reports of spying. ""Shared security and responsibility between respectful neighbors cannot be constructed by violating the law and violating trust,"" Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said Tuesday. ""Mexico is convinced that the practice of espionage committed constitute a violation of norms, an abuse of the trust built between partnering countries and does not honor the historic friendship between our nations,"" he added. Speaking in Geneva, Meade said he would summon U.S. Ambassador Anthony Wayne upon his return to Mexico. His comments come days after Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine published allegations that the U.S. National Security Agency ""systematically"" eavesdropped on the Mexican government and hacked the public e-mail account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Der Spiegel named former NSA contractor Edward Snowden as the source of its information. On Sunday, Mexico's government said such spying would be unacceptable, illegitimate and against the law. Meade demanded a swift investigation, noting that U.S. President Barack Obama had vowed to investigate when earlier allegations of spying surfaced in September. ""Mexico finally reiterates its confidence in the conviction of President Obama that international law is not an empty promise,"" Meade said. ""We are sure that the promise of an investigation made with Mexico is not either."" Mexico will also conduct its own investigation, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told reporters. The new allegations drew a sharp response from Calderon in a series of Twitter posts on Monday. ""More than personal, it is an assault on the institutions of the country, given that it was done when I was the president,"" Calderon said. ""I will be following the steps the Foreign Ministry takes to demand explanations from the United States and the corresponding account of responsibility."" A senior U.S. State Department official told CNN the Mexican government reached out about the report and that the two governments will be discussing it via diplomatic channels. The NSA said it would not ""comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity, and as a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations. U.S. spy chief says reports of NSA logging French phone calls are false . ""As the President said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly, we've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share,"" the agency added. The statements were the latest sign of international fallout over apparent Snowden leaks. Mexico summoned Wayne in September after a report alleging the U.S. government had spied on Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto during last year's presidential campaign. Separately, the United States and Brazil agreed in September to postpone Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's state visit to Washington over reports the United States spied on her communications. That case of alleged NSA surveillance was also linked to apparent Snowden leaks. And on Monday, the U.S. ambassador to France met with French diplomats over allegations the NSA intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in the European nation over a 30-day period. Those allegations were reported by France's Le Monde newspaper, citing documents leaked by Snowden. Snowden has admitted to leaking documents about U.S. surveillance programs and faces charges of espionage and theft of government property in the United States. He is living in Russia after receiving asylum. CNN has not independently verified the reports citing leaked documents by Snowden. CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Mexico calls reported U.S. spying an abuse of trust .

"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama proclaimed the fight against income inequality is ""the defining challenge of our time,"" you might have dismissed his words as the effort of a struggling president to revive his political fortunes. But anyone looking at the relentlessly expanding income gap can see that the problem is real -- and it is serious. The economy is gradually recovering from the Great Recession, but inequality continues to grow. In the first two years of recovery, the net worth of the bottom 93% continued to shrink, while the top 7% grew wealthier. The richest Americans are taking the biggest share of national income of any time since 1928. Rather than dismissing Obama's call as a political ploy, Republicans in the United States and other conservatives across the developed world, should take up the cause and make it their own. Rising inequality is the proven enemy of stability. And nobody benefits more from stability than the wealthy. This is their fight, too. If trends continue, the well-tended sources of wealth of the rich could get trampled by the march of popular frustration. The signs are already here, in the United States and Europe. A sense that unfairness permeates the system is what fosters extreme views, erodes the middle ground, and makes it increasingly difficult for government to function. From Occupy Wall Street to the Tea Party, populist politics is creating gridlock and producing a government that cannot address the country's problems. In Europe, the perception of unfairness has fostered extremist parties, such as the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party in Greece, with alarming echoes of the 1930s. Traditionally, inequality is the kind of issue that receives attention from leftist politicians and is shoved aside by those on the right, who expect free markets to work their magic, improving the lives of those who work hard and, by the judgment of some moral gauge, deserve to be rewarded. But it turns out that the invisible hand of the market, as economist Adam Smith famously described it, may have developed arthritis in recent years. Obama is right when he says this is undermining the very definition of what America means. The U.S. was the land of opportunity; the place where you could succeed regardless of where you were born. In the old days, America was the place where you could be born poor and rise on your own merits. Today, incredibly, researchers say upward economic mobility is easier in Canada and Europe than in the United States. This contract, the ""American Dream,"" has meant that the U.S. was not, and still isn't, a land that is fertile for those seeking to sow class warfare. America was never a place where people hated the rich as much as they wanted -- and often succeeded -- in becoming the rich. But the stratospheric rise of incomes at the top is not just an American problem. And the search for solutions is a global pursuit. This is a time to debate and innovate; a time to find the causes of this stagnation of the majority and look for solutions. Unexpectedly, sedate Switzerland has started experimenting with some startling ideas. When Swiss voters heard that the Chairman of Novartis, a large pharmaceutical corporation, was going to receive some $78 million in severance, they mounted a campaign to ban ""golden handshakes."" They resoundingly approved strict limits on compensation in a referendum last March. It's worth noting that CEOs in Switzerland make an average of 148 times what the average workers make. In the U.S., they make 354 times more, according to the AFL-CIO. The most intriguing of all the ideas will come to the voters next year. Under a proposal spelled out in a referendum, every Swiss citizen regardless of income would receive a monthly check of $2,800 from the government. The notion of a guaranteed income is receiving enormous attention around the world. The idea defies traditional notions of government assistance and means-testing. Instead of a giant bureaucracy and complex programs breaking down assistance for food or housing, the government would make sure nobody lives in poverty, and presumably dismantle a host of welfare structures. In theory, minimum-income programs would reduce the incentive to work. But when a small town in Canada conducted a four-year experiment in minimum income, researchers say poverty disappeared, graduation rates went up, and hospitalization rates went down. This is just one proposal, and one that focuses more on poverty alleviation than on inequality. And inequality itself, not just poverty, is a key issue. An unequal society distorts democratic principles. Financial muscle amounts to political muscle. We have seen it in the United States, where campaign donations are reshaping the political landscape. You might think this is a great argument for the rich to keep the system exactly the way it is. Ironically, however, wealthy businesses use their money for political power, but populist politicians are able to tap into discontent and gum up the works. The business community hated the government shutdown, but the angry base, particularly on the Republican side, supported politicians who kept the government closed. The wealthy are more powerful than ever, but they risk losing control of the system if they allow it to continue along its present path. Self-interest may not be the most admirable reason to fight for justice and a better life for all, but it may just prove persuasive, even if it means heading the call of an embattled president. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis Don't dismiss Obama's speech on inequality as a ploy; it's serious .
Ghitis: The richest have the biggest share of national income of any time since 1928 .

"(CNN) -- The Arizona sheriff known nationwide for his tough stance on undocumented immigrants says he has a mission now that he's clinched another re-election victory: meeting with Latinos. ""I would hope to get together with the Latino community, if I could ever have them talk to me without screaming and threatening me,"" Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio told supporters as election results came in Tuesday night. ""So I hope to get together with the community and try to explain what we do, so that's going to be one of my missions coming up."" Both the American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S. Justice Department have filed lawsuits accusing Arpaio of civil rights violations and racial discrimination against Latinos. Last December, the Justice Department said it had found cause to believe the sheriff's office ""has engaged in a pattern of misconduct that violates the Constitution and federal law"" and, under the leadership of Arpaio, discriminated against Latinos through traffic stops, detentions and arrests and against Latino inmates with limited English proficiency by punishing them and denying them critical services. Arpaio has denied any discrimination or civil rights violations, and one of his attorneys called the Justice Department investigation a ""witch hunt."" Arpaio cleared of financial improprieties . On Tuesday night, the sheriff said he has no intention of changing his policies in his sixth term. ""I have a message for the president of the United States of America. He's gone after me from the White House, the Department of Justice, the FBI, I can go on and on. But I will continue to enforce all the laws, including illegal immigration,"" Arpaio told supporters. ""Nothing changes."" The 80-year-old sheriff, who has been in office for two decades, has fierce critics and staunch supporters. Latino voters mobilized in an attempt to defeat him at the polls this year. Meanwhile, Arpaio told supporters Tuesday night, financial support for his campaign poured in from across the country. Latinos a key part of new Democratic majority . Arpaio also gained international notoriety for making prison inmates wear pink underwear and pink handcuffs and housing them in tents. Another controversial program: Arpaio's ""chain gangs,"" including the world's first-ever female and juvenile work gangs. Rather than shy away from controversy, he has embraced it, touting his nickname of ""America's Toughest Sheriff"" on his website and boasting that his inmate meals are the cheapest in the nation, costing between 15 and 40 cents apiece. He garnered 53% of votes cast in this year's election, and his chief opponent, Democrat Paul Penzone, conceded as results showed Arpaio ahead by 88,000 votes. ""Arpaio won, you have to accept it,"" said Alberto Gutier, a Republican analyst. ""He said it very clearly that he was going to be the sheriff that enforces laws, and not who makes laws."" Five things we learned on Election Night . But some Latino activists -- who had hoped Penzone would unseat Arpaio -- weren't ready to give in yet. ""The pledge to each person whose door we knocked on, the people that we registered in front of stores and apartment buildings, is that every one of their votes will be counted,"" said Petra Falcon, director of Promise Arizona, an immigrant advocacy organization. Falcon said many people voted on provisional ballots in the election, or cast absentee ballots that had yet to be counted by elections officials. Her group estimates that more than 400,000 votes may have yet to be counted. The Arizona Secretary of State Office said Wednesday that there were 344,000 uncounted early votes in Maricopa County and 115,000 provisional ballots yet to be verified there. Other activists said that problems for immigrants go far beyond Maricopa County. ""Many people are happy that (President Barack) Obama won again and others are upset that Arpaio won, but we know that they both work together to deport members of our community,"" said Carlos Garcia, director of the Puente human rights organization. While authorities count provisional ballots, other opponents of the controversial sheriff are hoping that a federal judge will rule in the civil rights cases against the Arizona sheriff and stop the sheriff from cracking down on undocumented immigrants. Profile: 'America's toughest sheriff' But Arpaio said Tuesday night that he had no intention of leaving public life any time soon. ""And by the way, for my critics out there, I'm going to say right now, in January I'm signing up for 2016. So I'm not a lame duck,"" he said. A crowd of supporters cheered.

"(CNN) -- It was five days before Christmas, and luckily for Gem the puppy, the creature was stirring on the trash-sorting conveyor belt. Workers at a trash- and recyclables-sorting facility in San Francisco found the poodle mix in a trash bag among other discarded material Friday evening -- just in time, because it was about to drop into a pile bound for a landfill, CNN affiliate KTVU reported. The discovery likely saved the apricot pup's life. ""We could tell the puppy was still moving, and it was trying to crawl out of the bag itself,"" Gregory Foster, a material handler at the Recology facility, told KTVU. ""Luckily we stopped the line in time before it actually fell off the belt into the pit."" The dog, believed to be a few months old, apparently was put in a bin of trash that Recology collected and drove to the facility. It was then put on the conveyor belt, where workers separate recyclables from landfill-bound trash, KTVU reported. The puppy was suffering from what appeared to be animal bites, San Francisco Animal Care and Control said. It had wounds to the neck, head and ears, CNN affiliate KGO reported. The animal control department named the puppy, noting it was a ""precious little gem"" among the trash, department Capt. Le-Ellis Brown told KGO. The department said it is trying to determine who the puppy's owner was, how it was injured and how it got into the trash.

"(CNN) -- News that government agencies have been collecting phone data, and apparently tapping into popular Web services, has sparked a predictable amount of anger and apologists, political charges and counter-claims. But the Web being the Web, it's also gotten its share of snark. There's fairly delicious irony to people taking to the Internet to joke about the government monitoring the Internet. So as not to be alarmist, we don't have any reports of tweet-related drone strikes as of this report. Sure, there was plenty of outrage about the alleged snooping by the National Security Agency.

"(CNN) -- A man known for his grand 6 million-light Christmas display was found shot and killed in his home on Friday morning. A family member found John Chakalos, 87, in his home in Windsor, Connecticut, according a Windsor police department press release. The medical examiner's office ruled that Chakalos died of a gunshot wound to the head. The police are conducting an active homicide investigation, based on the condition of the body when it was found and because police did not recover a weapon at the scene, Windsor police Capt. Tom Lepore said. Windsor police were first to arrive on scene, and the department called in the Connecticut State Police major crimes squad to assist, Lepore said. Detectives are working to piece together events in the weeks leading up to Chakalos' death, Lepore said. Chakalos and his wife Rita, who died a week before Thanksgiving, were known in Chesterfield, New Hampshire, and the surrounding area for their elaborate Christmas display at the home they owned there. The Christmas exhibition takes up approximately half of the couple's 86-acre property and includes 6 million lights, said Joy Washburn, the property's caretaker. Washburn, who has known the Chakalos family for 30 years and worked for them for 25, said she begins working on the display in the second week of August. The display, which has lit up Chesterfield off and on for the past 10 years, is usually completed and ready by Thanksgiving. For the past five years, the family has invited the public to drive through the estate and requested visitors donate money or nonperishable food for Joan's Food Pantry. ""Not only do they warm the heart of thousands of people who come through, they warm the hearts of hundreds of people in the community who benefit from food and cash donations,"" said Val Starbuck, a Joan's Food Pantry volunteer. Visitors come from as far as an hour away to view the Christmas display, Starbuck said. The donations from the display have typically been enough to keep the small pantry filled from January through April, generally the hardest months for people to heat their homes and feed themselves. The extravagant display includes a lifesize Victorian-style village, complete with houses, a hotel and a general store; a 22-foot Santa to greet visitors when they enter the property; and a Nativity scene, among numerous other decorations. ""There isn't now in the woods a bush or a tree that doesn't get lights on it,"" Washburn said. The Christmas display will continue this season, Washburn said, but she did not know if the Chakalos family would continue to light up the neighborhood in the future. CNN's attempts to reach Chakalos' family were unsuccessful.","John Chakalos, 87, found shot to death in his Connecticut home .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry has moved into the same west London residence that his brother William set up home in with new wife Kate last year, CNN can reveal. Harry took a small apartment at Kensington Palace after moving out of the bedroom and study he occupies at nearby Clarence House - the home of his father, Prince Charles. The move, on the heels of this month's successful official tour of the Caribbean, is seen as a sign that the increasingly mature 27-year-old is putting his wild past behind him. It also appears to be evidence of the strong bonds between Harry and William, the brothers who will lead and define Britain's royal family over the next few decades. Watch Harry talk about ""emotional trip"" to Caribbean . Harry is understood to have been looking to move into his own place for some time, and is becoming William and Kate's neighbor because the brothers ""wanted to be together,"" a senior royal source told CNN. ""Prince Harry and Prince William are a double act for the rest of their lives,"" the source said. ""They are very loyal and trust each other. Loyalty is key. Harry is very respectful towards William."" William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, currently live in Nottingham Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace, but will move into a renovated apartment in the main building in 2013. Harry, third in line to the British throne, is then expected to take over the cottage. Kensington Palace was home to both the princes when they were being brought up by their mother Diana, the Princess of Wales, who lived there from 1981 until her death in 1997. While Harry's Caribbean tour saw him graduate as a representative of the British royal family, the prince's official duties are expected to take a back seat to his military career in the immediate future. According to the royal source, Harry relishes the ordinary treatment he receives as a captain and Apache helicopter pilot in Britain's Army Air Corps.

Kayon Mills, a Jamaican lieutenant who trained with Harry at Britain's Sandhurst military academy, told CNN the prince's nickname was ""Harry Potter."" Captain Wales, as he is officially known, is preparing for deployment later this year to Afghanistan, where he served briefly four years ago until a broken media embargo led to him being rushed home. There is not expected to be a news blackout this time. The royal source says but the prince won't require extra security despite being a potential priority Taliban target. ""The thinking is that being an Apache pilot is quite an anonymous job and the Apache is already a target,"" he said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- As Michael Jackson's three children stood onstage at the end of their father's memorial in July 2009, many wondered how Prince, Paris and Blanket would adapt to the world their father had always shielded them from. The late pop icon's oldest son turned 16 this month, and his birthday wish shed light on what his future may hold. Prince Michael Jackson has a driver's license, a girlfriend and ambition to start a career in the entertainment industry. ""I'm looking to become well-rounded as a producer, director, screenwriter and actor,"" Prince told Entertainment Tonight reporter Brooke Anderson last week. His interview was part of his first big job, as a special guest correspondent for the show. Prince's assignment was interviewing James Franco, Zach Braff and Sam Raimi about their movie ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" He begins his second job this week, a guest star role on the CW Television Network's teen drama ""90210."" While many parents encourage their 16-year-olds to get a job to supply their own pocket money, Prince gets an allowance from his father's estate, large by any teenager's standards. It will progressively grow as he gets older, eventually at least 20% of the fortune being managed by the executors his father's estate. But Prince has told family and friends that he wants to stand on his own, and not in the shadow of his superstar dad. Being a rising star in perhaps the world's most famous show biz family, he has plenty of relatives to call on for help and advice. Aunt La Toya Jackson agreed to help her nephew. Her company Ja-Tail Enterprises, based in a sprawling office in Beverly Hills, California, is representing him, booking his interviews and jobs, according to a source in the company who's close to him. It's what Prince Jackson asked for as a birthday present, the source said. Some journalists and fans reacted negatively to word that he was entering the work world, suggesting that his father would never have approved. Several sources close to the Jackson family agree that it would not be happening if Michael Jackson were still alive. Remaining sheltered behind the gates of his father's mansions and the masks he wore in public as a child was no longer an option after Jackson's death from a surgical anesthetic overdose nearly four years ago. The children are living with their grandmother, assisted by cousin T.J. Jackson, in a hilltop mansion in in the same gated Calabasas, California, development that is home to Justin Bieber. Prince and sister Paris, who turns 15 in April, attend a private school. They are both active on Twitter, sharing personal thoughts and photos with the world. People who know them describe them as normal, smart and strong. An acting role may be more likely for the son of a superstar than a job at a fast-food restaurant, a typical first job for many American teens.

"(CNN) -- Allegations of racial slurs and threats of violence against Dolphins lineman Jonathan Martin have left Pro Bowler Richie Incognito suspended from the Miami Dolphins and sparked widespread chatter about just what kind of behavior is tolerated in the NFL. Here are five key questions about what lies ahead: . Will the Dolphins cut Richie Incognito? He's been suspended ""for conduct detrimental to the team."" As for his future, the Dolphins don't seem poised to make a decision quickly. ""We reached out to the NFL to conduct an objective and thorough review,"" the team said in a statement. ""We will continue to work with the league on this matter."" But the Miami Herald reported that a club source told the newspaper that Incognito was done with the team and will never play another game as a Dolphin. And USA Today cited two sources in the personnel departments of other teams that said he would have a difficult time finding another team to take a chance on him. ""I think he can file his retirement papers,"" one told the newspaper. For right now, all eyes will be on the NFL probe. Incognito 'weathering the storm' Does Jonathan Martin have a future in the NFL? The 24-year-old Martin, who played at Stanford before going pro, left the team last week, during his second season. No matter what the investigation finds, it's unclear whether he would want to come back. Aside from the alleged threats and racial slurs from Incognito, Martin has rejected parts of the culture of the NFL, according to some reports. Some of Martin's teammates got up from a lunch table as a joke when Martin sat down last week, infuriating Martin, according to an analyst for FoxSports.com NFL.com called it a ""lunch-room prank"" that players pulled on whoever was last to arrive with his food. Former Dolphins running back Ricky Williams told CNN the NFL is ""like a closed fraternity. It's really not made for everyone."" Was there hazing, bullying, extortion? Given the allegations and the environment of the NFL, it's unclear whether Martin was threatened, bullied, hazed, and/or even shaken down for money. The central allegations involve voice mails in which Incognito allegedly used racial slurs and threatened physical violence against Martin. One transcript, published by NFL.com, includes an apparent reference to Martin's biracial background. In the call, Incognito allegedly referred to Martin as a ""half (expletive) piece of (expletive),"" and threatened, among other things, ""I'll kill you."" Incognito apparently denied the accusation, tweeting ESPN, which had reported the transcript, ""shame on you for attaching my name to false speculation."" The tweet and others were later deleted, according to bleacherreport.com. ESPN reported that Incognito allegedly got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Las Vegas by a group of Dolphins even though Martin preferred not to travel with them. Martin gave Incognito the money, fearing the consequences if he did not, the report said. How common is this behavior? Time magazine calls the NFL ""a naturally twisted workplace."" There is ""often a blurry line between hazing and outright abuse,"" it says. ""When your job is to be a maniac on the field, it shouldn't be surprising that a player like Incognito, who has a history of anger management and substance abuse issues, could take things too far."" The attention around the Martin-Incognito case shines a light on that blurry line. Former offensive lineman Kyle Turley described a hazing incident in 1998, when he and other Saints rookies ran through a hallway with pillowcases on their heads while teammates punched and kicked them, Time reports. Still, Incognito's alleged behavior shouldn't be seen as representative of many players, analysts say. ""If the evidence is factual, Dolphins guard Richie Incognito is a racist, a bully and one of the lower forms of life known to man,"" writes Sports Illustrated columnist Jim Trotter. And while some NFL players and personnel believe Martin should not have made the issue public, they're also not defending Incognito, Trotter says. What will the NFL do? This case could rattle the culture of the NFL. It will force the league to establish just what forms of behavior are acceptable, and what's done to make sure those standards are followed. Who, if anyone, will police players when they stray from what's allowed? Will coaches be held accountable? Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin ""has to bear his share of blame here,"" USA Today quotes Sports Illustrated's Peter King as saying. ""The buck stops with him concerning what happens in the locker room ... . (T)he coach is ultimately responsible for player behavior getting out of hand."" The NFL Players Association issued a statement saying it expects ""that the NFL and its clubs create a safe and professional workplace for all players, and that owners, executives, coaches and players should set the best standards and examples."" As the NFL launches its probe, it could find itself officially informed of numerous other incidents throughout the league. This one case between two men could prove the catalyst for the league to acknowledge and deal with disturbing behavior in its ranks.","Recent allegations have sparked chatter about just what kind of behavior is tolerated in the NFL .

"(EW.com) -- This just in: Ron Burgundy is no match for a fire-breathing dragon at the box office. ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues"" (CinemaScore: B) beat out ""The Hobbit"" sequel on Friday, but updated totals show the Will Ferrell-starrer trailing Peter Jackson's fantasy pic for the three-day weekend. In first place, ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" fell about 60 percent and brought in an estimated $31.5 million from 3,903 screens in its second weekend in theaters â€” spot on with Grady Smith's prediction. Its domestic take now stands at a healthy $127.5 million. But that total lags behind the first ""Hobbit"" film by a significant margin. In 2012, ""An Unexpected Journey"" dropped 56.4 percent in its second weekend, earning nearly $36.9 million and bumping its domestic total to $150 million. That film played in about 200 more theaters and had a stronger opening weekend. Meanwhile, Paramount's heavily marketed ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues"" opened in second place with a weekend estimate of $26.8 million. The PG-13 rated sequel opened in 3,507 locations Wednesday and is expected to net about $40 million for its first five days, much lower than EW's prediction. The first ""Anchorman"" opened in July 2004 to $28.4 million and went on to gross $85.3 million domestically. EW review: 'Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues' Coming in third is Disney's animated pic ""Frozen"" with $19.2 million, down only 15 percent from last weekend. The $150 million 3D musical has been in theaters for four weekends and boasts a $191.6 million domestic total. ""Frozen"" opened this weekend in Mexico, Italy, Lebanon, Greece, South Africa, Finland, Hong Kong, and Venezuela, and will continue its worldwide expansion in the coming weeks, including a release in China at a date still to be determined. Its current global total is $344.2 million. Director David O. Russell's star-studded epic ""American Hustle"" (CinemaScore: B+) took in an estimated $19.1 million (meeting expectations) from 2,507 theaters, landing it in fourth place. The '70s-set tale of con artists and strivers opened last weekend in limited release. Last year's Best Picture-winner ""Argo"" opened to a similar $19.5 million weekend. Russell's ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" which also starred Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, had a vastly different box office story last year, playing in fewer than 800 theaters for nine weeks before expanding wide closer to the Oscars. EW review: 'American Hustle' It would go on to gross $132 million domestically, making it the first Russell film to cross the $100 million mark. In addition to having the benefit of Russell's recent successes, Sony's ""American Hustle"" has the bonus selling points of stars Christian Bale and Amy Adams â€” both of whom are receiving raves for their performances. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" (CinemaScore: A), another Disney property, snagged the fifth place spot in its first weekend playing to a wide audience with a slightly sub-par $9.3 million, bringing its worldwide total to $15.4 million. Audiences skewed female (57 percent), and 39 percent of attendees were under age 35. Another awards contender (for Best Picture and Best Actress for Emma Thompson's portrayal of Mary Poppins creator P.L. Travers), the glossy PG-13 rated pic will likely enjoy a healthy holiday run. 1. ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" -- $31.5 million . 2. ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues"" -- $26.8 million . 3. ""Frozen"" -- $19.2 million . 4. ""American Hustle"" -- $19.1 million . 5. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" -- $9.3 million . Fox's ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" (CinemaScore: B) opened outside of the top five to an estimated $7.3 million from 3,231 theaters. With the combination of ""Frozen"" and ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,"" the family market was a bit too saturated to allow any box office leftovers for Fox's 3-D dinosaur pic. The action-thriller ""Dhoom 3"" broke the record for a Bollywood opening in the U.S. with $3.3 million from 236 theaters. The Coen brothers' awards contender ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" expanded into 148 theaters and took in about $1.1 million for an impressive $7,169 per theater average. In the specialty box office world, Spike Jonze's futuristic love story ""Her"" opened in six theaters Wednesday and brought in $258,000 across the weekend. Jonze's film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, will open wide on January 10. Feng Xiaogang's Chinese comedy ""Personal Tailor"" made its U.S. debut in nine theaters and earned an estimated $104,000.

"(CNN) -- Commercial air travel is already filled with annoyances like shrinking personal space, overpriced meals and frequent delays. For many people, there's one bright spot to flying: A forced break from making, receiving and hearing phone calls. That could change with the Federal Communication Commissions new proposal to drop the ban on cellular connections and allow phone calls once a plane reaches 10,000 feet. The FCC first pitched the idea in 2004, before the rise of the smartphone. The reaction from passengers and flight attendant unions at the time was loud and negative: phone calls on planes would be disruptive, annoying and a potential safety issue. The FCC decided against the proposal. Now people are more attached to their tablets and smartphones. So much so that they rebelled against the ban on using small electronic devices such as phones, tablets and e-readers during takeoff and landing. After reviewing safety issues, the FAA and airlines finally gave in this month and relaxed restrictions. An unpopular idea . Quietly playing games or reading e-books on a tablet or phone is one thing, but chatting away mid-flight doesn't seem to be as in demand. In a survey of 1,600 adults by an advisory group, the FAA found that 61% of people supported a ban on making calls while in the air. ""I'm definitely against it,"" said Spud Hilton, travel editor at the San Francisco Chronicle. ""People would be carrying on loud, full-voiced conversations right next to someone who doesn't want to hear it."" The Association of Flight Attendants, the world's largest union of flight attendants, came out against the idea on Thursday, citing safety and security concerns. ""In far too many operational scenarios, passengers making phone calls could extend beyond a mere nuisance, creating negative effects on aviation safety and security that are great and far too risky,"" the AFA said in a statement. Brett Snyder, who blogs about the airline industry on Crankyflier.com, agrees with lifting the restriction and thinks each airline should be allowed to set its own policy. ""The public in the U.S. seems to be strongly against cell phones on airplanes, but let the airlines make the decision on whether or not they want to move forward and allow it,"" said Snyder. Keeping the peace . Cell phones could cause friction between passengers who want to talk and passengers who would prefer peace and quiet. They would introduce yet another behavior flight attendants would have to police. ""We're trained to de-escalate. Why would you put something in the environment that can escalate?"" said Veda Shook, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants. Shook has worked as a flight attendant for the past 22 years. ""The idea potentially introduces yet another stress factor into an already stressful environment,"" said airline pilot Patrick Smith of AskThePilot.com. The stress is made worse by tight quarters. When taking a phone call in public, it's good etiquette to keep 10 feet away from other people, protocol expert Pamela Eyring told Reuters. It's not even possible to get 10 inches of space on an airplane, where economy class seats are typically 17 to 18 inches wide and each seat is butted up against the one next to it. One option is for the FCC and airlines to allow cell phone use and hope that passengers act responsibly and only make calls when necessary and speak in a quiet voice. Unfortunately, the firsthand experience of flight attendants, frequently fliers and people who take other forms of mass transit cast doubt on that dream scenario. ""The real problem with travel, especially air travel, is not baggage fees, it's not long lines... the real problem with travel is other travelers,"" said Hilton. The ""quiet car"" option . This is not the first time the issue has come up. Terrestrial mass transit systems, including subways, buses and trains, have already struggled with the invasion of cell phones and loud talkers. Some trains have addressed the problem of disruptive passengers on cellphones by adding quiet cars during certain hours. The Metro-North railroad has separate cars during rush hour where noise, loud chatting, and phone calls are prohibited. Some Amtrak trains also offer quiet cars, which forbid phone calls and any noise technology, and feature dimmed, soothing lighting. Greyhound bus lines doesn't have an official policy, but individual bus drivers have been known to crack down on loud talkers. Unfortunately, quiet sections aren't a practical solution for airplanes (though they would add yet another ""premium"" seating feature for which airlines could charge extra). ""On an airplane, there's no such thing as a quiet car,"" said Shook. ""In my opinion it's not that different from having a smoking section on a 747, it's absurd."" Smoking sections, which separated smokers and nonsmokers with a row of seats, were banned in the United States along with smoking on airplanes in 1988. Before 1973, smokers could light up in any seat they liked. ""Theoretically, you could have a talking section and a nontalking section, but you'd have to put up some serious plexiglass,"" said Hilton. Discount Malaysian airline AirAsia introduced a quiet zone in early 2013. Sandwiched between first class and economy, the zone is an adult-only section intended to give travelers a respite from screeching children. Like smoke from cigarettes and the sound of a crying baby, a loud phone conversation would likely ignore any invisible barriers and carry through an entire plane. Call waiting . The FCC will present its proposal in December, but even if it passes, it will be a while before in-flight cell phone calls are a reality. Cell phone towers are on the ground and airplanes will need special equipment before passengers can dial out. ""As it stands, cellular phones simply will not work at higher altitudes in an airplane cabin. Changing this will require investment in on-board technology,"" said Smith. Individual airlines will have to decide if allowing calls is something they want to allow. A more business-oriented airline might jump at the opportunity to lure working travelers. Others might side with the majority of passengers and flight attendants and stick with a policy of ""silence is golden."" ""There's so much hustle and bustle out there already,"" said Shook. ""Can people just have some peace and quiet for a few hours? It's not that retro of an idea.""","The FCC is proposing lifting the ban on cell phone calls on airplanes during flights .
Flight attendants and many passengers are against the idea for noise and safety reasons .
Creating a quiet area is one possible way to appease both sides, but sound will still carry ."
"(CNN) -- Three New Jersey judges surprised phone owners everywhere Tuesday with a new message: You don't have to be texting and driving to get in trouble. You might be legally liable for a crash if you're on the other end of the phone, too. Jersey's state Appeals Court sided with the argument made by a couple who were badly injured in a 2009 crash with an 18-year-old whose truck drifted across the center line and hit them riding on their motorcycle. They had already settled with the driver. But they'd also sued his 17-year-old girlfriend, who had texted him shortly before the crash. On appeal, the court didn't find the girlfriend liable in this particular case because she didn't appear to know her boyfriend was driving at the time. But the jurists accepted the general argument that a texter may bear some legal responsibility if they know the other party is behind the wheel. That ruling opened up a whole new front in the war on texting and driving, which has seen lawmakers across the country getting tough on phones in the hands of motorists. The ruling sparked a lot of questions. We'll try to address some of them here. Is it now illegal to text someone who is driving? No, not yet. The criminal laws on this issue haven't changed in New Jersey or elsewhere. But the New Jersey judges appear to be saying that texting someone who is driving could make you liable to a civil lawsuit, based on existing laws against distracting a driver. ""We conclude that a person sending text messages has a duty not to text someone who is driving if the texter knows, or has special reason to know, the recipient will view the text while driving,"" they said in their ruling. ""One of the great arguments my colleague made ... was that when you text -- you're the texter -- you are electronically in that car,"" New Jersey attorney Marc Saperstein told CNN affiliate WPIX. Could a new law result from this? It's possible. States everywhere are cracking down, but New Jersey lawmakers have been pretty aggressive in recent years about going after texting while driving. They've already beefed up penalties to the point where causing an injury while texting is treated like doing so while driving drunk. A distracted driver could be fined up to $150,000 and could go to jail for as many as 10 years if they hurt someone, according to a law they passed last year. And they're currently considering a bill that would let police officers look at a driver's phone after an accident to see if they were texting at the time. Gov. Chris Christie, though, seems to think blaming the sender might be going too far. The driver, he said, is ultimately the one responsible. ""You have the obligation to keep your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel and pay attention to what you're doing,"" he told radio station New Jersey 101.5. How am I supposed to know when someone is driving? That's question many folks have been asking. Michael Noonan, a lawyer in Red Bank, New Jersey, who handles many driving-related and personal injury cases, says that's probably going to be at the heart of any lawsuit that tries to leapfrog off of this ruling. ""That will be a hotly contested factual issue,"" he said. ""I could envision a situation where an exchange goes back and forth and the driver explicitly says 'I'm driving' and you have someone who says, 'This needs to be answered right now. This is an emergency. It can't wait.'"" Saperstein said the argument would hinge on ""if the texter knows, or has a special reason to know, that the driver will look at that text and respond to it."" Examples, he said, are employer and employee or parent and child. How can I stay in the clear? This one might be a no-brainer. But Noonan says there's an easy way to avoid potential liability if you have a message for someone you know is probably on the road. ""Don't,"" he said, when asked what he would tell a client. ""I think that's the advice to everyone. Simply don't do it.""","New Jersey court says texting a driver may make you responsible for a crash .
Judges suggest a text is similar to causing an in-car distraction .
Attorneys: It will hard to prove sender knew the recipient was driving .
N.J. Gov. Chris Christie: In the end, the driver is responsible ."
