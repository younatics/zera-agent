"By . Sara Malm . A pharmaceutical company has announced that they will cease production of a prescription cough syrup due to its association with drug sizzurp. Sizzurp, also known as ‘purple drank’, is made from prescription cough syrup, hard candy and sugary soft drinks, and is popular among rap stars and pop prince-turned-wannabe gangster Justin Bieber. Actavis say that it is the celebrity glorification of using their ‘Prometh with Codeine cough syrup’ to make sizzurp that has led to the company stopping all production and sales. Scroll down for video . Purple drought: Actavis has announced the discontinuation of their cough syrup, due to the celebrity glorification of its use in making sizzurp - as displayed here in an Instagram photo from rapper Soulja Boy . Actavis’ cough syrup is only available with a prescription but can allegedly fetch around $800 on the black market, and it is the codeine source of choice for sizzurp fans. These include rapper Soulja Boy, who frequently posts images of Actavis’ bottles on his Instagram, and according to sources, also teen idol Justin Bieber. ‘Given [recent media attention], Actavis has made the bold and unprecedented decision to cease all production and sales of its Promethazine Codeine product,’ a representative told Tmz. ‘This attention has glamorized the unlawful and dangerous use of the product, which is contrary to its approved indication.’ Sizzurp originated in Houston in the 1960s and has since spread via urban music communities in the southern states to mainstream teenagers via modern glorification of the drug on social media and in lyrics and music videos. Mysterious cup: Justin Bieber was seen drinking out of a type of Styrofoam cup associated with making sizzurp during his birthday celebrations in March . Purple drank: Pop star-cum-career car wreck Justin Bieber and rapper  Lil Wayne, who suffered seizures last year after a codeine overdose, are both said to be big fans of sizzurp . Clever boy: Soulja Boy often posts photos on Instagram which includes a bottle of the Actavis prescription cough syrup . It is made by mixing codeine cough . syrup, its colour gives the right hue to the drink, and soda, most often . Sprite or Mountain Dew, and Jolly Rancher candy for extra sweetness. The drinker experiences an immediate, euphoric high as well as drowsiness and lethargy, and sometimes also hallucinations. The . amount of cough syrup in each serving of sizzurp can see a drinker . consume 25 times the recommended dose of codeine and promethazine. In 2013, rapper Lil Wayne, a known . sizzurp fan who even wrote song Me and My Drank about the drug, . collapsed and suffered multiple seizures. The . four-time Grammy Award-winning rapper was rushed to Los Angeles’s . Cedars Sinai Hospital where doctors allegedly found high amounts of . codeine in his system. Sizzurp seize-up: Rapper 2 Chainz has been charged with codeine possession following his arrest last year at Los Angeles International Airport when authorities say he was found with 'sizzurp ingredients' in his baggage . Earlier this month, rapper 2 Chainz was charged with felony drug possession after his arrest last year at Los Angeles International Airport when airport officials reported finding ingredients for sizzurp in his checked baggage. The 36-year-old entertainer, whose real name is Tauheed Epps, is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday on a felony charge of codeine possession. In March, Justin Bieber was photographed drinking from the type of Styrofoam cup linked to the drug and insiders claim the pop star spends much of his time smoking marijuana or consuming sizzurp, which is referred to by the singer and his pals as 'lean'. Sizzurp has also been linked to the deaths of rappers Pimp C in 2008 and Big Moe in 2007, who both died of codeine overdoses. Danger: Prescription cough syrup from Actavis, now discontinued . Although it is prominent in rap culture in particular, sizzurp has long been popular among teenagers of all backgrounds as a cheap way to get high. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, one in ten American teenagers use cough syrup or cold medicine as a recreational drug. The high-sugar content and mouthfeel of the syrup, as well as the codeine, makes it a very addictive substance. The sweet taste also means that many do not realise the danger of sizzurp, nor how much they have had. Just one serving can contain 25 times the recommended daily dose of cough syrup. 'This is a very dangerous drug, it can lead to seizures and essentially lead you to stop breathing,’ Dr. Robert Glatter of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York told Today.com. ‘The sweetness of the soda and candy combined with the drug itself makes people want to have this all day long. ‘They just don’t know how much they’ve had throughout the day and by then, it’s almost too late.’","Actavis pulls production and sales of their promethazine codeine syrup .

"By . Associated Press . and James Rush . The mother of a 17-year-old honors student who was among 10 people killed in a bus crash in northern California is suing FedEx for $100m, alleging its trucks have a history of catching fire. The negligence suit is the first filed in connection with the freeway crash in Orland on April 10, according to A. King Aminpour, the attorney for the plaintiffs. The suit was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Rosa Rivera, mother of Jennifer Bonilla of Los Angeles. Scroll down for video . The mother of a 17-year-old honors student who was among 10 people killed in the Northern California bus crash is suing FedEx . The Dorsey High School student had earned a college scholarship. She and other teens were heading north for a free tour of Humboldt State University when the bus was struck head-on by a FedEx truck. Dozens escaped through windows before the bus exploded into flames, but five students, three adult chaperones and both drivers died. 'She had her whole future before her,' Aminpour said of Bonilla. 'She was the first in her family to ever go to college.' The California Highway Patrol has not determined the cause of the crash 100 miles north of Sacramento. Some witnesses reported that the FedEx truck was on fire before the crash, and the lawsuit alleges that FedEx trucks have a history of catching fire from mechanical problems, driver error or improper cargo loading. 'Our heartfelt condolences remain with everyone affected by this tragic accident,' FedEx Corp., based in Memphis, Tennessee, said in a statement. Police re-enact the crash using a charter bus and a FedEx big rig of the same make and model as those involved in this month's truck-bus collision as part of their investigation . National Traffic Safety Board and California Highway Patrol investigators take measurements on Interstate 5 during a re-enactment of the collision . 'We remain focused on providing support to those affected and cooperating with the authorities as they conduct their investigation. 'This is not the time for us to discuss potential litigation.' The suit also names the estate of the FedEx driver and the bus owner, Silverado Stages, as defendants. The lawsuit contends the bus lacked adequate exit doors that would have allowed passengers to escape after the crash. A message from Associated Press seeking comment from a Silverado Stages executive after hours Tuesday was not immediately returned.","Negligence suit is first filed in connection with crash in Orland on April 10 .

"By . Darren Boyle . Two young women accidentally killed themselves after they mistakenly swallowed a deadly batch of super-strength party drugs nicknamed 'Dr Death.' Oil rig worker Rachel Clayton, 34, and her partner Emma Speed, 30, from Macclesfield, Cheshire thought they were taking Ecstasy but instead took a tablet up to five times more powerful. They were later found dead inside the terraced house after police were called about concerns for their welfare. Rachel Clayton, right, and Emma Speed, left, died after mistaking a super-strength party drug dubbed 'Dr Death' for ecstasy . The couple were renovating this end-of-terrace house in Macclesfied in Cheshire when they died . At first it was feared the two women who had carrying out renovation work at their £110,000 house in Macclesfield, Cheshire may have been overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning. But police quickly ruled it out after tests showed there was no leak of gas inside or outside the house and Ms Clayton's pet Jack Russell dog Jacki was found alive inside the property. Toxicology results later revealed evidence of the Ecstasy type drug Paramethoxyamphetamine or PMA in their systems. A post mortem report also found high levels amounts of amphetamine and traces of the party drugs Benzylpiperazine (BZB) and Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) in the blood of both women. There have 16 deaths from PMA in the UK within the last three years. The inquest heard that friends of Rachel Clayton, left, and Emma Speed, right, became worried when they failed to answer text or phone messages . At an inquest in Macclesfield, coroner Nicholas Rheinberg recording a verdict of death by misadventure and said: 'It is highly likely they consumed PMA under the false belief it was MDMA or Ecstasy. 'One of the huge dangers of taking drugs is that you don't know what the contents are.'Ms Clayton had owned the house for several years and Ms Speed who had been in a relationship with her for a year had just moved in. Ms Clayton was on a short break from her job working on a North Sea oil rig and had just bought a new VW Scirocco car and was proudly showing it off to friends on Facebook. She had joked about the forthcoming Manchester derby in messages on the site, and in a message said of her imminent holiday: 'Home tomoz thank didily I'm becoming a recluse after 3 weeks in the North Sea'. Her last message was posted on April 5 last year - the last times they were seen alive - after spending the evening with friends. The couple are believed to have taken PMA, dubbed 'Dr Death' which is available from nightclubs for just £3 (file photo) Two days later when neither women returned calls or text messages throughout the weekend, friends Neil and Laura Blain, and Darren Oxley, who had a spare key, went to Miss Clayton's house and discovered their bodies on the living room floor. Police found pink tablets with the Mitsubishi logo on, as well as cocaine and cannabis at the house.Ms Clayton's mobile phone records revealed text conversations with a friend about drugs but the dealer could not be traced. Toxicologist Dr Simon Elliott told the inquest: 'PMA is a very similar drug to MDMA, but the effects are delayed. What we find is regular users of Ecstasy get a false sense of security, think its a dud and take another and another.' Dr Death, often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and has the chemical name PMA. It is often also referred to as 'Mitsubishi Turbos', 'Pink Ecstasy', 'Dr Death' or 'Pink McDonalds'. The pills are the same size and shape as an ecstasy tablet and can be white, but are often pink and usually have the letter 'M' on them, although the initials may vary.] . It is sold to clubbers for as little as £3 a pill and dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy (MDMA) but it is around five times as strong and causes a dangerous rise in body temperature.The effects also take longer to act than ecstasy causing some users to take pill after pill, leading to fatal doses. Last year PMA was linked to the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths in Ireland, Norway and Denmark. In a statement, Ms Clayton's parents Malcolm and Sue Clayton, of Poynton said: 'Rachel enjoyed life to the full. She was a special daughter and was very family orientated. We will miss her greatly.' Ms Speed's family added: 'She had a good heart and would do anything for anyone.. She has left a massive hole' in our hearts.'","Super-strength party drug available for just £3 a tablet in clubs and pubs .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . A group of bungling gang members who intended to kidnap a prosecutor actually nabbed her father after getting the wrong address, authorities have revealed. Frank Janssen, 63, vanished from his Wake County, North Carolina home last month but was found safe in an Atlanta apartment block several days later. Before an FBI team rescued him, his kidnappers sent his wife messages threatening to dismember him if their demands were not met. A federal indictment released on Tuesday . reveals the team's repeatedly botched efforts, including an earlier . trip to the wrong address and how they left a receipt at the scene . showing where they had stopped for a snack ahead of the alleged . kidnapping. The crew had been contracted to kidnap his daughter, Assistant District Attorney Colleen Janssen, on behalf of a high-ranking gang member - Kelvin Melton - that she had put in prison for life. Scroll down for video . Botched: A team of kidnappers nabbed Frank Janssen, 63, (left) after going to his home instead of his daughter's. They wanted to get revenge on DA Colleen Janssen (right) for locking up a fellow gang member . Melton, a 49-year-old Bloods member, was named in the indictment for allegedly calling the shots from his prison cell with a smuggled cell phone. Eight others are named in the indictment. Janssen's . daughter, Wake Forest assistant district attorney Colleen Janssen, . prosecuted Melton in 2012 for his role in the shooting of his . ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. Court . records show Melton has a long record of felony convictions in New . York, the first being a 1979 robbery committed when he was 14. He . pleaded guilty to manslaughter and robbery in 1998 and served more than . 13 years in New York prisons before being released in August 2011. 'Ring leader': Kelvin Melton allegedly called the shots from prison using a smuggled cell phone . His conviction in North Carolina sent him to prison for life. Authorities said he wanted revenge. In March, he hired the group to track down Colleen Janssen - but the first effort to kidnap her took them to Louisiana, miles from her North Carolina home. After using an internet search, the armed group allegedly rented a car and drove to Louisiana - but they aborted the plot for reasons not listed in the indictment. In late March or early April, Melton called again to kidnap Janssen. One . of the team members used the Internet to look up Colleen Janssen's . address but actually found her father's home in Wake Forest, about 15 . miles north of Raleigh. Early . on April 5, four of the kidnappers left the Atlanta area for North . Carolina. Melton called them several times while they were on the road, . at one point asking to be put on speaker phone to give them specific . instructions. He told them to wear khakis and collared shirts, so they stopped at a Wal-Mart to buy clothes. When . they got to Janssen's home, three of the kidnappers went to the door . while another waited in the car, according to the indictment. When Frank . Janssen cracked the door, the kidnappers forced their way in, hit him . with a stun gun several times and pistol-whipped him. According . to prosecutors, the group left behind a receipt from a meal stop they . made earlier that day, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Scene: The kidnappers nabbed Mr Janssen at this Wake County house, believing his daughter lived there . Authorities . have revealed text messages sent by the alleged gang members to the . kidnap victim's wife, as well as details of a call between the gang and . their mastermind, Kelvin Melton. Texts from the 'gang' to Christie Janssen . If you contact police, 'we will send (Mr. Janssen) back to you in 6 boxes and every chance we get we will take . someone in your family to Italy and torture them and kill them... we . will do drive by and gun down anybody.' At 12.19am Wednesday, she . received a text photograph of him tied up in a chair. 'Tomorrow we call you again an if you can not tell me where my . things are at tomorrow i will start torchering.' Call between 'gang' and 'mastermind' At . 8.20pm on Wednesday, Melton called the kidnappers and they apparently spoke about where to bury Janssen's body: . 'The first spot we are checking out is close to the house.' 'We want to make sure it's in a secluded area and the ground is soft so we can go 3 feet deep.' 'Get a bag, put it over his head, and stuff something in his mouth.' 'However you feel like doing it, just do it.' 'Make sure to clean the area up. Don't leave anything. Don't leave any DNA behind.' It led investigators to a McDonaldâ€™s restaurant in Lexington, South Carolina, where surveillance video helped identify two of the suspects, authorities said. After the kidnapping, the team drove back to Atlanta and handcuffed Janssen was forced to lie on the floorboard of the back seat of the car. They used the stun gun on him dozens of times. The indictment doesn't say what happened when Melton discovered they kidnapped Janssen's father instead of the prosecutor, but two days after he was taken, Janssen's wife started receiving the threatening text messages. Each one seemed to grow more urgent. On April 9, Janssen's wife received a photo of him tied up in a chair along with a message: 'Tomorrow we call you again an (sic) if you can not tell me where my things are at tomorrow i will start torchering.' The indictment said that while Janssen was in the Atlanta apartment, he was taped to a chair in a closet, and some of the kidnappers stood watch. Melton sent instructions to one member to assist in the killing and disposal of Janssen if Melton's demands weren't met or if the team lost contact with Melton for three days. The specific demands have not been released by authorities. Around 8 p.m. April 9, Melton received a text saying, 'We got car, spot, and shovel.' A few minutes later, Melton called the kidnappers and told them to kill Janssen and gave specific instructions not to leave any DNA behind, court documents said. By that night, authorities had . determined Melton had orchestrated the scheme and was still calling the . shots behind bars. When corrections officers tried entering his cell, he . smashed the phone. Raid: An image shows federal agents walking through an apartment complex in Atlanta after the agents rescued Janssen several days later. He was not harmed in the kidnapping or the rescue . Authorities pinpointed Janssen's location through the use of the team's cell phone signals and stormed the apartment just before midnight April 9. A short while later, three of the nine people charged were caught in a Chevy Tahoe that had two shovels, a pick and a gun inside. Melton was indicted along with Quantavious Thompson, Jakym Tibbs, Tianna Maynard, Clifton Roberts, Jenna Martin, Jevante Price, Michael Gooden and Patricia Kramer. All face a federal conspiracy charge related to the abduction, and all but Kramer are charged with kidnapping. Some of the defendants face additional charges. All but Kramer were in custody Tuesday.

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated Press Reporter . A sanctuary for exotic cats in east-central Minnesota has agreed to change its business practices after the head of the nonprofit acknowledged misusing thousands of dollars in donations to purchase personal items, including undergarments and bestselling bawdy books. As part of the agreement filed with the state attorney general’s office in Ramsey County, The Wildcat Sanctuary in Sandstone must hire an outside monitor for the next two years to improve the way it does business. Executive Director and sanctuary founder Tammy Thies is repaying all of the donations she misused for an array of personal items, services and $550 in taxes for her house, which is on the facility’s property, a sanctuary representative said. Tammy Thies, who founded The Wildcat Sanctuary in Sanstone, Minnesota, is repaying all of the donations she misused for an array of personal items, services and $550 in taxes for her house . The largest reimbursements cover $4,900 for four years of cellphone service and $3,200 in propane to heat her home. Among the items Thies acknowledged spending donated money on included women’s underwear, movies, hair removal products and two books by comedian Chelsea Handler, reports the Star Tribune. Thies also received ‘double reimbursements’ from the sanctuary for the same expense, had an oil change paid for on her personal vehicle and a dog run built on her property, the document said. She also had the sanctuary pay for her husband’s sky-diving lessons. As part of the settlement with the attorney general’s office, the sanctuary agreed to review and collect all expenditures due to be reimbursed, sanctuary spokesman Robb Leer said on Tuesday. Quist founded the fenced sanctuary in 1999 about 90 miles northeast of Minneapolis and it is now home to more than 100 lions, tigers, cougars and bobcats . Sanctuary employees first made the allegations against Thies to the organization’s board in March 2013. Later that year, the board placed Thies on paid administrative leave for a few months while an investigation continued. ‘Our donors have stayed with us even as we have stumbled and made mistakes,’ Thies, who was reinstated by the board as executive director, said in a statement. ‘They deserve a professional and transparent organization that unfailingly meets the needs of the animals they support.’ Founded in 1999, the fenced sanctuary about 90 miles northeast of Minneapolis is home to more than 100 lions, tigers, cougars and bobcats on 37 acres with natural habitats for all of the animals.

As part of the settlement with the attorney general's office, the sanctuary agreed to review and collect all expenditures due to be reimbursed . The sanctuary has an annual budget of about $850,000, which includes staff salaries and the care and feeding of wildcats. ‘We have been working for several months to grow our business infrastructure to catch up with our tremendous growth,’ sanctuary board chair Gail Plewacki said in a statement. ‘Some of these challenges are just the result of a fast-growing organization that used to be small and run by one person (Thies) who didn’t even get paid for years.’ Even before the agreement, the sanctuary said it already was outsourcing its bookkeeping to an accounting firm and had in place new policies clarifying how sanctuary funds are used for expenses.

"By . John Hall . New York's infamous East River - criticised for years for its high levels of pollution - could house the city's newest public attraction; a floating, cross-shaped public pool filled with filtered river water. Artist impressions have been released showing the stunning pool, which is attached to the Brooklyn shoreline via a floating wooden walkway, floating beneath the famed Manhattan skyline. The Brooklyn-based design team has said it intends to build the Olympic-sized pool in the East River, using special filters to transform the water into something locals would swim in. Developers of the so-called Plus Pool say they hope it will open by summer 2016, although the $15milion project must first win approval from New York city officials and the U.S. Coast Guard. Scroll down for video . Stunning: Plans have been revealed for an Olympic-sized swimming pool to be built in New York's East River. The pool would use special filters to transform the sickly green water into something locals can swim in . The Plus Pool would be anchored to the river bed and have a walkway to shore. Although plans show it being built in the much-maligned East River, the exact location of the development is still to be determined . Unappealing: New York's East River has long been in need of a makeover. Often smelly and dirty, the river has a place in New York folklore as a supposed dumping ground for the victims of mafia murders . Project co-founder Archie Coates pitched . the East River pool - which plans show sitting on the Brooklyn shore - as being clean, safe and good for the environment and public . perception. He said he hopes to 'change the way New Yorkers see the . river by giving them a chance to swim in it.' A city spokesman did not respond to questions on what permits may be required to build the pool, and did not say how the city feels towards privately built facilities that are intended for public use. Developers said it would be different from other floating pools in New York - there has been one at Barretto Point Park in the Bronx since 2007 - because it is designed to filter and use river water. The Plus Pool would be anchored to the river bed and have a walkway to shore, although the exact location of where it will be built is still to be determined, the developers added. Great views: If built the floating pool would be open to all members of the public and would feature areas designed for children, lanes for lap swimmers and pool-side loungers . Project spokeswoman Kanessa Tixe said there have been talks about several permanent locations for the Plus Pool, including Brooklyn Bridge Park. Ideally, she said, the pool would find a home in the East River, although the Hudson River and Governor's Island have been put forward as alternatives. Co-founder Dong-Ping Wong said the Plus Pool would be built from filtration material that can remove bacteria and contaminants from a 2,300 litres of polluted river water every day. That clean water would be then be recycled back into the river after being used in the pool, he said. More than 3,000 people have already contributed nearly $275,000 to a Kickstarter campaign to develop the pool. Location: Ideally the pool would find a home in the East River (pictured), although the Hudson River and Governor's Island have been put forward as alternatives by developers . Supporters can also sponsor one of the pool's 70,000 tiles for $25, $199 or $249. If each tile is sponsored, that alone would cover the $15million cost to build the pool. If realised the pool would be open to all members of the public and would feature areas designed for children, lanes for lap swimmers and pool-side loungers for those looking to take it easy. A small admission fee may be required to pay for the cost of maintenance, security and lifeguards, although the developers are also looking into the possibility of this being covered by sponsorship. Innovative: Developers said the Plus Pool would be different from others in New York because it is designed to use river water. There has been a floating pool at Barretto Point Park in the Bronx since 2007 (pictured) The pool's developers say they are currently testing and improving the proposed filtration system using a floating laboratory at Pier 40 in the Hudson River. They said they are also monitoring the river and intend to partner with Google to launch an app that broadcasts water quality data in real time. The East River has long been in need of an environmental and public relations makeover. Smelly, dirty and, whenever sewage and storm water back up, dangerous, the river has a place in New York folklore as a supposed dumping ground for the victims of mafia murders. The television series Seinfeld mocked the East River in a 1997 episode when the character Kramer tried swimming in it and was mistaken for a dead body.","Developers hope to build large floating pool in the much-maligned river .

"By . Associated Press . Two former college football players are being accused of brutally beating a 50-year-old homeless man within an inch of his life in an attack in Suffolk County, Massachusetts last January. Craig Parsons, a former Boston College tight-end, and Anthony Varrichione, an ex-quarterback at Marist College, were in court Wednesday to faces charges for the incident that happened around 2am on January 26 in the Allston neighborhood . The high school friends stood next to each other, hands clasped, as they were charged with assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon â€” their shoes. Parsons also was charged with intimidating a witness. The two men pleaded not guilty and left the court without speaking to reporters. Battery: Former football players Anthony Varrichione (center) and CJ Parsons (right) appeared in court Wednesday to face charges for beating up a homeless man in Suffolk County, Massachusetts last January . Parsons' attorney, Michael Doolin, said his client was wrongfully identified. 'C.J. is a good kid from a good family. We are hopeful that he will be exonerated,' he said. Varrichione's lawyer, Tim Flaherty, said the same of his client. Neither attorney would comment further on the allegations. The charges stem from a grand jury investigation in which several witnesses identified the two men, said Jake Wark, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney's office. The victim, Michael Hudson, was panhandling for money outside a property in Allston when he got in an argument with the two, prosecutors wrote in court documents. When Hudson refused to leave, the men violently attacked him, prosecutors said. Witnesses called police and the two men only stopped when a woman jumped between them, shielding Hudson with her own body. Tesitmony: Witnesses saw Verrichione (left) and Parsons (right) get into a verbal altercation with 50-year-old homeless man Michael Hudson before beating him unconscious. Verrichione is a former quarterback for Marist College while Parsons played tight end for Boston College . Hudson was transported to a local hospital for a subarachnoid hemorrage and was hospitalized for three days, according to Wark. He lost all memory of the attack. While Verrichione graduated from Marist in the fall, Parsons (pictured above at a BC game in November 2012) was set to graduate this spring but has been barred from campus . While Hudson was homeless most of his life, he had recently secured housing in the Allston neighborhood. Parsons, 22, of Newton, Massachusetts, is a Boston College senior. He was suspended and barred from campus less than a month before graduation, according to university spokesman Jack Dunn, who referred to the allegations as 'disturbing' in a statement Wednesday. 'In light of these disturbing allegations, Craig Parsons has been issued a summary suspension from Boston College,â€™' Dunn said in an email. 'He will have no access to the campus until the matter is resolved. â€˜' Varrichione, 23, of Medway, Massachusetts, was a quarterback at Marist and graduated from the New York school in the fall. According to bios on their colleges' websites, each man is over 6 feet tall and weighs more than 200 pounds. They previously were teammates at Xaverian Brothers, a Catholic high school in Westwood, Mass. They are due back in Suffolk Superior Court on June 4.","Craig Parsons and Anthony Varrichione are facing charges of causing serious bodily injury, assault and battery with a serious weapon .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A Los Angeles-based filmmaker who made a short film last September, entitled Meet My Rapist, in an attempt to work through her latent trauma and improve her love life, says it has done exactly the opposite. Jessie Kahnweiler, 28, made the satirical film, which quickly went viral, in response to her rape, which occurred eight years ago while she was studying in abroad in Vietnam. 'The whole point of making this film was to reclaim my inner goddess, but instead I felt further away from her than ever,' Miss Kahnweiler writes for The Huffington Post. Haunted: Jessie Kahnweiler, 28, (left) made a dark comedy film last year in which she explores the effects of her rape, in hopes of exercising her demons and getting her love life back on track . The film, in which she plays herself, starts with Miss Kahnweiler bumping into her rapist at the farmer's market and unfolds as the mostly silent and highly shifty man follows her throughout the rest of her day. 'Dude it's so crazy running into you, after our unforgettable night on the air mattress,' she greets him with, in faux surprise. As the seven-minute film progresses, Miss Kahnweiler touches on a number of insensitive, but presumably common, responses she receives from people in her life in regards to the dark presence she lugs around with her. Fancy seeing you here: The satirical film sees Miss Kahnweiler bump into her rapist at a farmer's market, and is then followed by the creepy man for the rest of the day . During a job interview - in which her rapist aggravates her as he eerily stands by her shoulder - her potential boss barks: 'Hey, no one here wants an angry woman. When you come to work, you hang up your coat and leave your problems on the coat hook.' When she confesses the rape to her best friend, she is met with an equally snide reaction: 'But were you, like, really raped? Like, were you drunk?' the ditzy blonde questions, before breaking down and sniffing, 'It just hurts because as your best friend, it really affects me.' Miss Kahnweiler then introduces her rapist to her parents over lunch. Not the desired effect: The comedian and filmmaker says that men now avoid her, forcing her to question whether her 'chronic openness' had officially become 'too much' for potential mates . 'We've never heard Jess talk so much about a boy. You must have made quite an impression,' gushes her mother, adding, 'Welcome to the family!' Her last stop is an appointment with her therapist, in which she confides: 'Well, [my rapist] made me hate my body... But now I'm just thin enough to wear leggings as pants.' 'Fantastic!' her syrupy therapist responds, before adopting a patronizing tone and saying: 'I think it's time to move on. So I'm going to give you a prescription... to get the f*** over your s*** - because honey, no one wants to marry a rape victim.' Welcome to the family! In one scene, Miss Kahnweiler introduces her rapist to her parents, who enthusiastically attest that he seems to have made 'quite an impression' on their daughter . Inspired by her own frustrations with not being able to get over her ordeal, Miss Kahnweiler says making the film initially helped her. 'The movie helped me confront the effect my rape had on my identity, relationships and sexuality,' she writes, adding that she was 'overwhelmed' with its reception and the support that came flooding in, particularly from other rape victims. Her response from men, however, was another story. Patronizing: Mirroring some of her real-life experiences, one scene portrays her fictional therapist saying 'Honey, no one wants to marry a rape victim' Heading to the film screening's after party, excited to 'flirt with some dudes with ironic mustaches', she was surprised to find herself overwhelmingly avoided by the men who had seen the film, and was eventually forced to ask herself the question: 'Had my chronic openness officially become too much for potential mates?' Following the party, she describes a wash of polite but awkward interactions with men; from bad dates - 'Is he apologizing on behalf of the male species that I got raped?'- to confounded hopefuls - 'My faithful booty call lost my number and my new crush claimed he was moving to Canada.' Ultimately, she says, despite the catharsis she has gained from making the film, she realized she was still looking to men to validate her sexuality - an issue she is still dutifully working on. All smiles: Miss Kahnweiler has since admitted that while the film was cathartic for her, it didn't change the underlying fact that she was still feeling 'unsexy' in herself - a problem she continues to explore . Miss Kahnweiler has since spoken to ELLE.com about why she thinks she was scaring men away. 'I was feeling unsexy in myself and I was projecting it onto all of these guys,' she says, adding that for a lot of men 'It's just too much.' 'I donâ€™t know if I can blame this all on my rape,' she remarks. It comes out as comical, but there is nothing more shocking than the truth . The sparky truth-teller, who identifies herself as a true feminist, says the next hot topic she will be tackling is her eating disorder. She admits she was 'in denial' about her bulimia for a long time, and that she coped with her rape by taking laxatives for a month immediately after her attack. Miss Kahnweiler, who says she is currently seeing two therapists, promises to inject the same dark humor into her next project as she did with her Meet My Rapist film. 'It comes out as comical, but there is nothing more shocking than the truth,' she says.","The film, a satirical dark comedy, quickly went viral on YouTube - scoring over 80,000 views .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A grandmother was barred from boarding a flight to Florida so she could see her family at Easter because of her oxygen tank. When Jane Graham-Bailey arrived at Asheville airport in North Carolina airline staff told her because she didn't have a doctor's note for her tank she would be unable to fly. The 78-year-old, who has asthma, says she was not asked for paperwork for the tank when she flew to Asheville earlier in the year, but on her return Allegiant Air said she was unable to fly. Trapped: Jane Graham-Bailey has been forced to stay in North Carolina for another week after an airline refused to let her take an oxygen tank on a plane . The grandmother had been trying to return home from extended visit with her daughter-in-law over the holiday weekend. Doctor's note: Jane Graham-Bailey has asthma but didn't know she needed a medical pass for her tank . Instead, she has been forced to stay in North Carolina while the paperwork arrives. Ms Graham-Bailey told the Ashville Citizen-Times: 'I didn’t deserve this. I deserved to sit down with my family and enjoy Easter dinner. 'I’m 78. I don’t have that many Easters left. I feel like [the airline] took something away from me and my family.' Jessica Wheeler, a spokeswoman for the airline, said Ms Graham-Bailey was not allowed to board the flight because she needed a physician consent form for the oxygen tank. She added that the airline's regulations were based on those set by the FAA. 'Oxygen tanks are highly flammable. We need to ensure, for everyone’s safety, that an oxygen tank has been recently inspected and that it is medically safe for the passenger to fly,' she said. Ms Graham-Bailey had offered to leave the tank behind but the airline rejected that offer over concerns that she may need the oxygen on the flight. She said she didn't fly often and was not aware that she needed paperwork to take an oxygen tank on a flight. The airline agreed to refund the cost of her ticket but, because Ms Graham-Bailey's son can only collect her from the airport on Sundays, she has had to wait a week before flying home. He explained that his mother's health had deteriorated in the . past two years and she was recently hospitalized with COPD (chronic . obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma. Doctors . told her she would need to be on increasing amounts of medication, and . the bill for her care had caused Ms Graham-Bailey to fall into debt. Rules: Allegiant Air says it was following FAA guidelines when it refused to allow Ms Graham-Bailey to board with her oxygen tank . Stuck: Jane Graham-Bailey was trying to fly from Asheville airport in North Carolina to her home in Florida . In October last year, Ms Graham-Bailey's . family set up a Go Fund Me page to help her repay some of the debt . caused by her medical expenses. She is 'one of the most intelligent, fun, caring people I have ever known,' her son, Jay McCampbell, said, adding that she had been suffering with the worry at the cost of her medical bills. With the economy faltering, and two adult children in college, he was unable to fully pay her bills himself so reached out to the wider community. As her health improved a little, the grandmother had traveled to North Carolina to visit relatives but, after the confrontation at the airport, Ms Graham-Bailey says she will catch a flight from Tennessee when she finally goes home.","Jane Graham-Bailey was stranded because she didn't have a doctor's note for her medical equipment .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Charges: Robert Dellinger is facing two counts of murder over the deaths of a Vermont couple . A former Fortune 500 executive has been charged with murder after his failed attempt to kill himself in a New Hampshire car crash killed a couple expecting a baby. Robert Dellinger was indicted by a grand jury yesterday over the deaths of Amanda Murphy, who was eight months pregnant, and her fiancé Jason Timmons. Attorney-General Joseph Foster and state police announced on Tuesday that charges against Dellinger had been upgraded. After the crash in December, the former vice-president at PPG Industries told police he had been trying to kill himself when he drove his pick up truck across the median of a highway. His truck became airborne and sheared the top off of the victims' SUV, causing injuries so severe that the medical examiner said the couple looked like they had been in a plane crash. The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly. Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter. Miss Murphy, 24, was excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their unborn baby girl Reagan Elizabeth. A week before the crash, which happened on December 7, the residential center the pair worked at had hosted a baby shower for the couple. Catherine Amarante, executive director at the facility, described the couple as 'very loving'. Mr Timmons, 29, was also a father to three children from a previous relationship. At his arraignment in December, Susan Morrell, senior assistant attorney . general for New Hampshire, said Dellinger had argued with his wife over his . medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported. Loss: Jason Timmons and Amanda Murphy, who were killed instantly in the crash, were expecting their first child together . Shocking: The top of the couple's SUV was sheared off in the collision in December last year . Horrific: A medical examiner said the couple's injuries were consistent with those sustained in plane crashes . He left the house and began to drive . around, growing increasingly despondent, she said. A trooper said . Dellinger told him he intended to kill himself. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' Ms Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, . however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a . 'productive and exemplary life.' The married father had served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc. He . took a severance package worth more than $1 million in cash plus stocks . when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents . filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. After . his earlier arraignment, Dellinger had been freed on $250,000 cash bond . and ordered to wear an electronic tag and undergo a psychiatric . evaluation. Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, a few days after the crash . Excited: Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons, pictured with one of his three children from a previous relationship, were looking forward to the arrival of their baby girl . On Friday, he was arrested at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. Neither the prosecution nor the hospital said why he was there. His lawyer didn't immediately return messages seeking comment. Dellinger has not been arraigned on the original charges. His arraignment on the new charges was set for Tuesday. A second-degree murder conviction carries a sentence of up to life in prison. The new indictment shows Dellinger has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder over the deaths of Mr Timmons and Miss Murphy, and a second-degree assault charge over the death of the couple's unborn baby.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Adding a handful of rose petals to food could help fight off heart disease and diabetes, Chinese researchers have suggested. A list of ten edible flowers, said to improve a range of illnesses from cancer to nervous disorders, has been compiled. Many of the flowers covered in the study have been used in Chinese medicine for years, but now the study's authors are promoting their benefits to the West. Garden medicine: Chinese researchers claim edible flowers have cancer-fighting properties . The researchers, whose findings were published in the Journal of Food Science, said the flowers contained phenolics, which are believed to have anti-inflammatory properties. Paeonia suffruticosa - tree peonyLilium brownii var. viridulum - type of lilyFlos lonicerae - Japanese honeysuckleRosa chinensis - China roseLavandula pedunculata - French lavenderPrunus persica - peachHibiscus sabdariffa - a type of hibiscusFlos carthami - safflowerChrysanthemum morifolium -type of chrysanthemumFlos rosae rugosae - type of rose . 'We think these may help reduce the risk of heart disease, certain cancers and also have anti-inflammatory powers,' lead author Lina Xiong told the Daily Star. Her team at Zhejiang University found that adding petals from commonly found flowers such as roses, violets and nasturtiums to meals could prevent chronic diseases and promote health. Rose petals could help with diabetes and heart disease; violets appeared to strengthen the walls of capilliares; and nasturtiums had properties that could help fight cancer and improve eyesight. Dr Joseph Mercola told the Star: 'Flowers are natural plant foods and . like many plant foods in nature often contain valuable nutrients for . your health. 'Theyâ€™re also a rich source of vitamins, including folic acid, riboflavin, pyroxidine, niacin, and vitamins E and C.' The study looked at the level of antioxidants found in the plants, but the results have not been tested or measured on humans. Health boost: Lavender and the China Rose were among the flowers found to have high levels of phenolics . Researchers said increasing the amount of phenolics in a person's diet has been associated with reducing heart disease and some cancers. But although the compounds were found in the flowers, there is no evidence that it can have a positive impact on health, NHS Choices highlighted. 'The current study has not assessed whether eating these flowers could have effects on human health, or at what levels they would need to be consumed to have any effects,' it added. While the researchers hope their findings will lead to an increase in the use of edible flowers, more analysis is needed to fully determine the anti-tumor, anti-inflammation and anti-aging abilities of the plants.","Plants used in Chinese medicine tested for compounds associated with fighting cancer and heart disease .

"By . Ashley Collman . Actress Salma Hayek's younger brother Sami may face manslaughter charges after being involved in a fatal car crash in Los Angeles last February. The 40-year-old furniture designer was driving his sister's 2006 Ford GT sports car when he fishtailed on a curvy stretch of Sunset Boulevard and hit a pickup truck head on. While the driver of the truck incurred only minor injuries, Sami's passenger Ian Cuttler Sala, a Grammy Award-winning art director, died. Since the crash, cops have obtained a search warrant, focusing on the sports car's restraint control module, which is like a black box. They believe the RCM will confirm what they heard from witnesses - that Sami stamped on the gas pedal just before losing control of the car and crossing the center lane. Serious charges: Salma Hayek's brother Sami (pictured together at the 77th Annual Academy Awards) may face manslaughter charges for his actions behind the wheel in a fatal February car crash . Gas pedal: Authorities believe Sami sped up just before losing control and hitting a pick-up truck head on . If so, authorities think they may be able to hit Sami with charges of felony vehicular manslaughter. Sami's sister is also involved in the case since she and her husband legally own the car. Fatality: Sami's passenger Ian Cuttler Sala, a Grammy Award-winning art director, died at the scene . Under California law, if the victim's family sues, the registered owners are also liable to pay damages. The deadly crash happened around 4:50pm on February 23 as Sami and Sala were traveling eastbound on Sunset Boulevard and crossed into the westbound side, hitting a 2011 Toyota pickip truck. Sala died at the scene while Hayek was taken to UCLA Medical Center for several broken ribs and facial lacerations. The driver of the truck, 20-year-old Alvin Javier Gomez was also hospitalized for a broken foot and body pains. Investigators initially believed Sami may have been unfamiliar with the vehicle and said he was not drinking or on drugs. 'Too . much speed on a curved roadway, tried to over-correct and unfortunately . crossed into opposing lanes,' Sgt Stephanie Krajchir told KTLA. The . sports car Hayek was driving is worth approximately $165,000 according . to Kelley Blue Book, and can reach speeds of up to 205 mph. Witness Syed Abrar says accidents are normal on this particular curve of Sunset Boulevard. Two . hours after a KTLA news crew arrived on the scene, two more accidents . happened - though no one seemed to be seriously hurt in either. According to Sala's website, he worked at Sony Music NY for nine years before becoming a photographer. At Sony he created visual campaigns for musicians like Beyonce, Billy Joel and Mariah Carey. As . a photographer he has shot advertisements for Converse, Gillette and . Lincoln Center as well as editorials for several magazines. Injured: 20-year-old Alvin Javier Gomez was driving the pick-up truck that collided with Hayek's sports car. He was also hospitalized for a broken foot . He earned his Grammy Award designing the packaging for 'Johnny Cash: The Legend' box set. Sami . and older sister Salma were born to parents Diana Jimenez Medina, an . opera singer and talent scout, and Sami Hayek Dominguez, a businessman . who once ran for mayor of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico. Hayek currently runs his own . design studio in Los Angeles, but originally started off studying . business administration at Pepperdine. While studying abroad at the University's Florence campus one year, he had a sudden change of heart. All together: Sami is pictured center above with wife Daniela Villegas, sister Salma, and Salma's daughter at a movie premiere in October 2011 . Family: Salma and Sami are the children of Diana Jimenez Medina, an opera singer and talent scout, and Sami Hayek Dominguez (left), a businessman who once ran for mayor of Coatzacoalcos . 'I stood up, turned my test in, walked to a phone booth woke my dad up and said, I'm out,' Hayek told People. He told his father he was going to be a painter, sculptor or architect, to which is father responded: 'Your head is not right.' But his jump into the creative field paid off, and he has since designed furniture for the likes of Brad Pitt. He is married to jewelry-designer Daniela Villegas and the two live in a home in the Hollywood Hills.","Sami Hayek was behind the wheel of his sister's 2006 Ford GT when he got into a car accident in February .

"By . Lydia Warren . Astonishing footage has revealed the dramatic moment that a snorkeler was saved by a passing surfer just moments before a strong Hawaii current would have claimed his life. The rescue was captured on the swimmer's water-proof video camera, which appears to be attached to his head as he snorkels just off Paniau Beach in Puako. The film, which was found along the shore two weeks after the rescue, reveals him struggling against a strong tide as he moans quietly for help and bobs up and down in the water. Scroll down for video . Approach: A snorkeler off the Big Island of Hawaii found himself in trouble in strong currents and his head camera filmed a surfer swimming to help him just at the right moment . Rescuer: The surfer, Zach Sato, and his friend pass a surfboard for the struggling swimmer to hold on to . Suddenly, through the foggy lens, an approaching surfer can be seen. The surfer, Zach Sato, told KITV4 that he had swam nearby to check on the man when he saw him raise his hand all the way up. 'Hold on to the board, lay on the board!' Sato and his friend urge as the man moans. 'Thirty seconds more, 90 per cent chance he would have died,' Sato said. He looked 'like pure blue kind of swollen and his eyes were barely there - almost rolled back.' Safety: The camera shows the man being pulled to the shore after he was overwhelmed by the current . Relief: As he sees the rocks, he knocks off the camera - and it was found 2 weeks later by a passerby . The two men pulled the man safely to shore using the surfboard and the video captures the rocks as they get closer to the beach. At this point, the man knocks off the camera and it falls into the water. 'The guy was pretty much heaving,' Sato said. 'He couldn't even hold himself up.' It is not known if the man received medical care, but Sato did not get his name and does not know his identity. KITV4, which published the video exclusively, also did not know who he was. Questions: Zach Sato, left, rescued the man on his surfboard two weeks ago and passerby Aaron Smith, right, found his camera along the shore - but the identity of the snorkeler is still not known . Two weeks later, passerby Aaron Smith was at the beach when he found the camera and watched in horror as he played the scenes back.

"By . Jill Reilly . William Rousan, 57, was executed for  killing a farming couple in 1993 . A death row inmate in Missouri who was convicted of killing a farming couple in 1993 has been executed despite pleas for clemency over the secrecy used to obtain the lethal injection drug. William Rousan, 57, was declared dead at 12:10 a.m at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, which is just a few miles from the farm where the killings took place. Prosecutors say Rousan, his teenage son Brent Rousan and William's brother Robert Rousan murdered Charlie and Grace Lewis on Sept. 21, 1993 as part of a plot to steal two of the couple's cows. Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court turned down Rousan's request to delay his execution. Efforts . to spare Rousan's life hinged an argument that has held little sway . over the courts - concerns about the secrecy used to obtain the . execution drug, and the possibility that a substandard drug could cause . pain and suffering in the execution process. Several . states, including Missouri, now use compounded execution drugs . purchased from unnamed pharmacies. Courts so far have allowed most . executions to move forward. However, . on Monday, the Oklahoma Supreme Court stayed the executions of two . death row inmates, Clayton Lockett, 38, and Charles Warner, 46, who challenged the secrecy surrounding the process of . procuring execution drugs. Gov. Jay Nixon declined Rousan's clemency request Tuesday evening, clearing the way for the execution to proceed. In a statement explaining his decision, Nixon said he thought Rousan's sentence was appropriate for his alleged role as the mastermind behind the 'cold-blooded plot' that led to the couple's slayings. On Tuesday, he met with relatives, spoke with attorneys and had his last meal: a bacon cheeseburger, onion rings, soft drink, and pecan pie. On September 21, 1993, William Rousan, his son, Brent Rousan, and his brother, Robert Rousan, met and discussed stealing cattle from Charles ""Chuck"" and Grace Lewis, pictured . Rousan had known the Lewises since 1975. He set out for the Lewis farm with the intention of stealing cows.  Chuck was shot six times while he was mowing his lawn . Missouri has executed one death row inmate each month since November. William, pictured in his original mugshot, was convicted as the ringleader of the plot . Another Missouri inmate, Russell Bucklew, is scheduled for execution on May 21. Only Texas, with seven executions, has executed more inmates than Missouri's four so far in 2014. Rousan was sentenced to death for the killing of 62-year-old Grace Lewis, of rural St. Francois County, in 1993. He was sentenced to life in prison in the death of her 67-year-old husband, Charles. The killings were part of a plot to steal cattle from the Lewis farm near Bonne Terre. Rousan also lived in the same area of St. Francois County, about 70 miles southwest of St. Louis. On Sept. 21, 1993, Rousan, his 16-year-old son and his brother concocted a plan to kill the couple and steal their cattle. Authorities said at trial that William Rousan was the ringleader. The men drove by the farm, and William Rousan pointed out the cattle to steal. They parked about two miles away and hiked through the woods to the farm. They watched as the couple returned home. Charles Lewis began cutting the lawn with a riding mower while his wife spoke to the couple's daughter on the phone. Brent Rousan ambushed Charles Lewis, shooting him six times. Efforts to spare Rousan's life hinged an argument that has held little sway over the courts - concerns about the secrecy used to obtain the execution drug, and the possibility that a substandard drug could cause pain and suffering in the execution process . Grace Lewis told her daughter on the phone she heard gunfire and stepped outside to check on the commotion. Brent Rousan shot her several times. She managed to go back into the home, but William Rousan followed her, placed a garment bag over her head and carried her outside. He turned to his son and said, 'Finish her off.' Brent Rousan fired a single shot into the side of her head. Brent Rousan is serving life in prison without parole. Robert Rousan served seven years after pleading guilty to second-degree murder.","William Rousan, 57, was declared dead at 12:10 a.m in Bonne Terre .

"By . Ashley Collman . Used to be friends: Kimberly Hayes (pictured) was found dead on a dirt road last month and more than a month later police have arrested her four roommates in connection to the murder . Investigators believe a 35-year-old mother was murdered and set on fire last month in a custody battle over her roommates' newborn baby. A water district employee on his way to work when he found Kimberly Hayes' body still smoldering on a dirt road the morning of March 9. Now, more than a month later, authorities have arrested four suspects they believe carried out and kept her murder a secret. On April 18, police arrested 29-year-old Jessi Mendoza at a hotel in El Cajon on charges of murder and arson and he is currently being held on $2million bail at the San Diego County Jail. Mendoza's girlfriend and two other roommates were also arrested. Couple Matthew Williams, 30, and Lauren Huett, 33 were arrested at the same hotel while girlfriend Jennifer Stein, 31, was arrested the next day at the Santee Sheriff's Station. 'They were aware of the plan to kill her beforehand, and then the three of them did attempt to conceal the murder crime afterward,' said Lt. Glenn Giannantonio with the sheriffâ€™s department. Williams was arrested on suspicion of murder and held on $1million while his girlfriend Huett was charged with conspiracy and accessory. Stein was released on bail Monday afternoon after being booked Saturday. Fighting over the child: Authorities believe Hayes was killed for trying to take custody of her two roommates' newborn baby. Roommate Jessi Mendoza pictured above with the child he had with girlfriend Jennifer Stein . Authorities believe Hayes was killed because she was trying to gain custody of Mendoza and Stein's newborn baby. Why she believed she was entitled to parenting rights remains uncertain, but it is believed that the victim and four suspects 'informally' lived together in the same apartment. 'I canâ€™t go into any details about that except to say Ms Hayes was attempting to gain custody of Stein and Mendozaâ€™s child,' Lt Giannantonio said. 'From what I know, it was by legal means.' Conspirators? Mendoza's other roommates, couple Matthew Williams (left) and Lauren Huett (right), were also arrested on charges related to Hayes' March 8 murder . Hayes seemed to be on good terms with Mendoza and his girlfriend Stein as recently as February 3 when she shared pictures of her recently inked hand tattoo which reads 'Trust no man' between the left fingers. 'Thank you Jessi Mendoza lovin my new tats!!!' Hayes wrote. 'Thank you to you and Jennifer Stein u guys always seem to be there when I need a shoulder to cry on !! I may need to lean on u guys for a hot min as im so close to the edge [sic].' Shoulders to cry on: Hayes seemed friendly with Mendoza and his girlfriend as recently as February when she posted this thankful status on her Facebook .

Mendoza went on to distance himself from his social networking sites following Hayes' death. On April 14, just four days before his arrest, Mendoza wrote on Facebook: 'Well I'm tired of the fb drama n unecessarry bs that comes with it so Ima deactivate for a Lil bit if u know me well enug u got my # or kno how to reach me [sic].' Going off the grid: Just four days before his arrest, Mendoza posted this ominous status on his Facebook .

The victim's father Harvey Hayes, 77, from Clovis, told U-T San Diego that his daughter lived a troubled life. He says she had been released from jail just six days before she was killed. Hayes had a 14-year-old daughter of her own who she sent to live with her father several years ago due to her long hours working as an EMT at Scripps Hospital Emergency Room. Lately she had been out of work however, because of a wrist injury and subsequent surgeries.","Kimberly Hayes' body was found smoldering on a dirt road on March 9 .

She then added with a wink: 'It seems as if Aram wants me to be a woman, but I can say this to you Aram my dear, I am a working woman and an incredibly lazy young man in my free time and that is not going to change.

"By . Colette Fahy . Ryan Lewis has revealed his mother Julie Lewis is HIV positive. The 26-year-old producer, musician and DJ – who is best known for his collaboration with Macklemore – opened up about Julie contracted HIV from a blood transfusion during a complicated pregnancy with his older sister Teresa in 1984. He made the revelation as he and Macklemore announced their foundation of the 30/30 Project, a nonprofit to raise money for affordable healthcare worldwide, and launched an indiegogo page for it. Scroll down for video . Brave: Ryan Lewis is celebrating his mother Julie Lewis beating the odds and surviving 30 years on from her HIV positive diagnosis by creating the 30/30 Project to raise money for affordable healthcare worldwide . Tight-knit: Ryan Lewis pictured as a child with his mother Julie . Julie Lewis found out she was HIV positive in 1990, six years after she contracted it via a blood transfusion following the birth of her eldest child, Teresa (pictured) Remarkable: Julie Lewis has lived with AIDS for 30 years. No one else in her family have contracted it . Writing on the foundation’s website, Ryan said: 'In 1984, Juile Lewis gave birth to her first daughter, Teresa. Due to a complicated pregnancy, she needed a blood transfusion and at that moment, was infected with HIV.' Macklemore also spoke out in a YouTube video for their foundation, saying: 'What a lot of people don't know is that Ryan Lewis' mom has lived with HIV for 30 years. 'Today we celebrate her life as a survivor with an initiative to bring healthcare to the areas of the world that need it most.' Ryan also revealed that his mother did not know she had HIV when she was pregnant with him or his sister and they were fortunate to be born healthy despite a 25 per cent risk of contracting it. Collaborators: Ryan has teamed up with his musical collaborator Macklemore to create the nonprofit foundation . He added: 'When she was finally diagnosed, she was given only a few years to live. By that time, she had already given birth to two other children, Laura and Ryan. They each had a 25% chance of being born HIV+, but we were both extremely fortunate (today, the risk of a mother passing HIV to her baby is 2% or less if she is being treated). 'And thanks to advanced medicine and healthcare available here in the U.S., Julie has survived despite her odds. This year marks the 30th anniversary of Julie’s survival, but many are not so lucky.' Now to celebrate his mother defeating the odds and surviving 30 years on from from her diagnosis, Ryan has teamed up with Macklemore to create the charity which will work to build health centres around the world. In honor of his mother, Ryan has the international AIDS symbol - a red ribbon - tattooed on his arm . They are aiming to raise at least $100,000. He added: 'To honour the thirty years my mom has been a survivor, our family is raising funds to build health centres worldwide that will stand strong for at least thirty years. We're calling it the 30/30 Project. 'We are partnering with Construction for Change, a Seattle-based nonprofit, to carry out construction. And we have local partners on the ground, such as Partners in Health, to run and operate the health facilities long-term. We want to give hope to women and families in other parts of the world who lack access to quality, affordable healthcare. 'With this amazing past year I've had, I am honored to be the first donor for the 30/30 Project, jumpstarting the construction of the first health center in Malawi. I am asking you to join my family and see how far we can take this...' Lewis has previously spoken about how close he is to his parents and his two older sisters. He was born into a middle-class, conservative Christian family who moved from Puyallup to Spokane, Washington, when he was two. It wasn't until 1994, at the age of six, did his parents - who both worked for nonprofits - explain to him about AIDS and that his mother had it. Julie Lewis contracted HIV following the birth of her eldest daughter Teresa (left) in 1984. It wasn't until six years later - after having another daughter, Laura (right) and son Ryan - that she was diagnosed . 'This was an era when people were really shunned for having HIV,' Julie Lewis told Inlander in February last year. 'So when we moved to Spokane, we didn’t actually go public telling people for four more years.' Julie then took the brave step of becoming part of the Spokane HIV/AIDS Speakers Bureau. 'It was a really interesting upbringing for my kids because literally most of the people who were on that speakers bureau, who were really good friends of our family, have died,' she said. Ryan said it had a profound effect on him . 'I think it really just opened up the door, as a kid, to life experiences that most of my friends didn’t know anything about,' he said. 'On one hand, you could look at it as a really hard, sh---y life thing; on the other hand, she’s been healthy for years. 'I didn’t get it, my sisters didn’t get it, my dad didn’t get it. 'It could’ve been a totally different thing. 'I could not be here. 'And she could not be here. 'But she is.' In honor of his mother, Ryan has a tattoo on his right arm of an intertwined red ribbon - a variation of the international AIDS symbol.","Julie Lewis contracted HIV via blood transfusion after giving birth to her first child Teresa in 1984 .

"By . Bianca London . With a little help from her affair with newly-appointed Manchester United manager, Ryan Giggs, a stint on Big Brother and a LOT of lingerie shoots, Imogen Thomas became one of the most sought-after glamour girls of the decade. But the Welsh beauty queen and former reality TV star says she has 'hung up' her lingerie to focus on motherhood. Speaking to MailOnline, the mother-of-one said: 'I used to be desperate for magazine shoots, I was really enjoying it and while I've always got offers coming in, now I'm 31, it's time to hang up the lingerie.' Scroll down for video . New figure: Imogen Thomas, who found fame as a glamour model and star of Big Brother, has dropped a dress size and is keen to show off the results of her efforts . Drop a dress size: Imogen, 31, who had a baby last February, says she put on weight by snacking (right) but has since slimmed down to a size 10 (left) thanks to exercising and natural supplements . Imogen, who had her first child with Australian boyfriend Adam Horsley last February, says that while she had a 'good run', she is enjoying motherhood so much that she's 'letting the young girls' take care of the lingerie modelling now. One part of having baby Ariana that Imogen didn't enjoy was putting on weight - and she's found it incredibly hard to shift. 'I was snacking on Ariana's food when we ate out. She would have two chips and I'd eat the rest. As all new mothers will know, it's so hard to lose weight, especially that stubborn part of your stomach.' she said. Imogen - who went up to a size 12 after having her daughter - has been on a health kick and is now back at a size 10. 'I was really unhappy with that little pouch on my stomach so I have been eating healthily, exercising a lot and taking Nature's Way African Mango seed extract, which claims to target fat cell growth and help increase the breakdown of fats. 'It stops me snacking and just gives me that oomph in the morning. I also love trampolining, it's amazing for weight loss. I go to spin class and some days I dread it but always feel great after,' she said. Imogen reveals that she's lucky enough not to have any stretch marks - probably thanks to her 'obsession' with skincare, which sees her scrubbing her skin for twenty minutes every single day. Healthy and happy: Imogen says that after she had Ariana, she would snack on her leftover food (right) but thanks to her new health kick, she finally feels beach ready (left) Family: Imogen, who had her first child Ariana with Australian boyfriend Adam Horsley last February, says that while she had a 'good run' at lingerie modelling, she is enjoying motherhood too much to go back to it now .

I can't wait to show off the results on my next holiday,' she said. As for her diet, Imogen says she never deprives herself and instead swaps her favourite treats for healthy alternatives. 'I love sweet potatoes, but I also have the occasional helping of strawberries dipped in dark chocolate - I don't know how people can cut out treats completely.' As well as focussing on her new health regime, Imogen says she's put work projects on hold to have some 'me time', hang out with her family and focus on redecorating their house.

"By . Jennifer Newton . Polish police received panicked phone calls after a London double-decker bus appeared to drive off a bridge in the capital Warsaw and plunge into the river below. But what onlookers didn't know was that it was all part of stunt for a Bollywood film that was being shot in the city. Producers of the film, called Kick, staged the incident as part of a car chase and closed off the Gdanski Bridge over the Vistula River. Scroll down for video . Polish residents were panicked to see the No 10 London double-decker bus crash into railings off the bridge and plunge into the Vistula River... unaware it was all part of a stunt for a Bollywood film . Making a splash: Onlookers said they saw the bus on top of the bridge and wondered what a London Bus was doing in the middle of Warsaw in the first place, unaware it was part of a film . Onlooker Kasia Miechowicz, 22, said: 'I saw the bus on top of the bridge and wondered what a London Bus was doing in the middle of Warsaw. It didn't move at first but then it started up, and then just drove off and fell into the river. 'I was completely shocked and had no idea it was part of a film.' But even though police were able to explain to most callers that it was part of a film, some complained about the hassle and cost of closing the bridge. Local man Ireneusz Wysocki, 45, told local TV: 'They only paid £15,000 to close the bridge off, but how much was lost by people being late for work because of the diversion.' Angry locals also set up a Facebook group to try and raise an equal amount of money to hold a mass barbecue on the bridge. The film Kick is directed by Sajid Nadiadwala and stars Salman Kahan. It is a remake of a 2009 movie of the same name about a young Indian boy who turns to crime. Production company spokesman Krzysztof Solek from Film Polska Productions said the price of closing the bridge had helped them beat off competition from London and Dublin to stage the scenes in Warsaw.

"By . Dan Bloom . For twin boys who were separated in a life-threatening operation, it's no surprise their favourite film star was an amputee. Now Hussein and Hassan Benhaffaf, once conjoined from chest to pelvis, have met their hero - a dolphin who lost her tail when she was just a calf. The four-year-olds from County Cork, Ireland, were on holiday at Florida's Clearwater Marine Aquarium where they met Winter the bottlenose dolphin, star of the 2011 family film Dolphin Tale. Heartwarming: Hussein (left) and Hassan Benhaffaf meet their screen hero - a dolphin who lost her tail . We're not too different: While the twins (pictured left with their two sisters) were separated in a life-threatening operation at just five months, Winter the dolphin was three months old when her tail had to be amputated . The twins were separated in a rare operation at Great Ormond Street Hospital in February 2010 when they were just five months old. They had their liver, bladder, gut and intestine divided in a highly complex procedure which was described at the time as a near-miraculous success. They have been under the knife several times since and Hussein returned to the London hospital last summer to undergo surgery for an incisional hernia, believed to have been caused by wounds from the first operation not fully healing. His mother Angie Benhaffaf said last year: ‘It’s the first time since they were separated that I’ve absolutely feared I’d lose one of them. 'I worried that Hussein wasn’t going to live through that night. I was terrified.’ Rare condition: The twins were born with their liver, bladder, gut and intestine all joined . Fragile: The plight of the boys captured the hearts of the nation after they were split at a London hospital . Bouncing toddlers: The twins pictured three years on from the operation in Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland . Angie and her husband Azzedine work as full-time carers to the twins. She said: ‘Some days I wake up and feel that it’s all too much, too tough. Then I remind myself that I have to be positive for my children.' But the family have had a rare break as they decamped to Florida for a holiday together with the twins' sisters Malika, 10 and Iman, six. They were taken to meet Winter with the help of the aquarium's trainer Cammie Zodrow and two prosthetics experts who helped fit Winter with a fake tail. Since starring in the film, the dolphin has become a prime attraction at the aquarium. Inspiring: 2011's Dolphin Tale starred Morgan Freeman and followed Winter as she was given a prosthetic tail . Proud parents: Hassan (left) and Hussein with their mother Angie and father Azzedine in their Irish home . At just three months old, she became trapped in a crab trap line off the Florida coast and was unable to escape. When she washed up at a lagoon, rescuers had no choice but to amputate her tail and two vertebrae due to the seriousness of her injuries. The film about her life grossed almost $100million at the box office, most of it in the U.S., and a sequel is due out later this year.","Hussein and Hassan Benhaffaf were split at Great Ormond Street in 2010 .

"By . Jason Groves . Two million over-40s will face ‘chronic loneliness’ in their old age because of the breakdown of traditional families, a report warns today. Despite ‘significant falls’ in the number of pensioners living in poverty, many face a bleak retirement, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). The situation is so stark that the report suggests copying a German scheme where older people with no children, or whose families live far away, are encouraged to ‘adopt’ grandchildren raised in single parent families to help them in old age. As divorce among the middle-aged soars, the Institute of Public Policy Research warned of chronic loneliness . The study predicts that the number of over-60s will soar from five million to 20 million by the year 2033. Of these, around one in ten will be leading chronically lonely lives. ‘Longer life expectancy, the breakdown of extended families and the growing number of older people living alone is making it harder for older people to sustain strong relationships and connections to community life,’ the report says. ‘On current projections it can be expected that nearly two million people will be experiencing chronic loneliness by 2033. ‘This includes over 800,000 people in their 80s and 90s who typically have mobility problems that make it hard for them to stay active. ‘We are not doing enough in Britain to ensure that this rapidly growing group of people has the necessary opportunities to sustain their relationships and take part in activities that give meaning to their lives.’ The IPPR says the development will have major consequences for Britain’s social care bill unless action is taken. The study warned the number of over-60s will soar to 20 million by 2033 - and one in ten will live alone . It warns that ever more older people will . become dependent on the state for care as they lose touch with family . members who might once have helped them lead more independent lives. The study predicts the number of older . people in need of care will outstrip the number of family members able . to provide unpaid help for the first time in 2017. By 2030, an estimated 230,000 older people in England who need more than 20 hours a week of care will be left without relatives to help. The report stresses that older people are not just recipients of care – they are also among the main providers. The number of people providing significant care for an ageing spouse is forecast to rise by 90 per cent by 2030. It suggests that Britain should follow the lead of countries such as Germany and Australia in building greater alternative care provision for the future. Authorities in Berlin are encouraging the childless to ‘adopt’ grandchildren from single parent families in the hope they may look after them in old age. Elderly people are being advised to 'adopt' grandchildren following schemes set up in Germany . The state-backed scheme helps people find suitable families who have children under ten. In many cases, children have lost contact with their own grandparents who may live far away. Their new ‘grandparents’ socialise with the family and may help with things such as babysitting. Some 480 matches have been made to date, with many of the youngsters keeping in touch with their adoptive grandparents into adulthood. In Western Australia, each community has a dedicated ‘neighbourhood care co-ordinator’ who looks out for those living alone. Clare McNeil, of the IPPR, urged the Government to take action to prevent  a care crisis, saying: ‘The supply of unpaid care to older people with support needs by their adult children will not keep pace with future demand.’","Study predicts one in ten over-60s will live solitary lives by 2033 .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A cheese factory in eastern France may seem a world away from the bleak, oppressive regime of North Korea. But Kim Jong-un thinks he may have sniffed an opportunity to bring a touch of Gallic culture to his homeland. Tired of his country's bland attempts to produce a quality cheese, the despot ruler is sending a team of food experts to the French city of Besancon for a crash course in dairy production. Foodie: North Korea leader Kim Jong-un (pictured inspecting food on a visit to the command of Korean People's Army) is sending experts to France to learn how to make his favourite cheese . The three specialists are preparing to spend several months at the National Dairy Industry College (ENIL). Ironically much of that will be dedicated to making one type of cheese - the dictator's favourite Emmental, which is originally Swiss. This is reportedly Kim's snack of choice, which he is thought to have taken a liking to while studying in Switzerland, it was reported by the BBC which cited La Lettre A.fr website. The other main aim of the so-called . 'cheese diplomacy' visit is to improve standards at the Pynongyang dairy . in the North Korean capital which has failed to deliver a sufficient . quality of cheese. The team have primarily gone to France to learn how to make Kim's snack of choice - Emmental (right) - which he is thought to have taken a liking to while studying in Switzerland . Meanwhile, arch-rival South Korea is a huge cheese importer, so much so that it is driving American milk prices record levels. Yesterday, pictures emerged of Kim touring a renovated children's camp. The plush 'international' children's centre boasts its own aquarium, a swimming pool and football pitch - with places at the camp offered as a reward to the country's highest achieving students. He also hit the headlines last week when North Korean agents demanded the Foreign Office intervene in a row with a London hairdresser who used a picture of Kim Jong-un to advertise its 15 per cent 'bad hair' discount. M&M Hair Academy in South Ealing sparked a diplomatic incident after it lampooned the dictator's unique hairstyle in a poster hung in its shop window. A undated picture released from North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on April 22 shows Kim Jong-un inspecting a fishery station of the Korean People's Army .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Momentum: The Bank of England hailed the rate of recovery as GDP grew by 1 per cent this year . The British economy is ‘building momentum’ and growing at the fastest rate for seven years, the Bank of England declared yesterday. Gross domestic product - the total size of the economy - grew by 1 per cent in the first three months of 2014, according to the central bank. And it expects growth ‘to be only a little weaker’ between April and June as the economic bounce turns into a full-blown recovery. The last time the economy grew by around 1 per cent for two quarters in a row was in mid-2007 before the meltdown at Northern Rock. In a further boost to George Osborne, official figures showed that Government borrowing has fallen to its lowest level since the financial crisis and recession struck. There were also fresh signs that the economy is becoming more balanced, easing fears the recovery is too reliant on consumer spending and the housing market. A survey by the CBI business lobby group showed confidence among British manufacturers is at its highest level since April 1973 and factory orders are growing at the fastest rate since 1995. The motor industry is faring particularly well with car production up 12 per cent in March to 142,158, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Nearly 80 per cent of cars made in Britain are sold abroad making the industry a key driver of UK exports overseas. Katja Hall, chief policy director at the CBI, said: ‘Confidence is rapidly rising among British manufacturers, with a real sense of business optimism. Our industrial base is seizing a bigger role in the UK’s economic recovery, with output, orders and hiring all on the up. ‘There are still bumps in the road ahead. However, expectations for growth in the coming three months are positive and manufacturers plan to significantly ramp up investment in the year ahead.’ Investment by business is seen as crucial to a sustainable recovery because it can lead to higher profits, increased productivity, more jobs and better wages. The Bank of England welcomed signs that investment is starting to pick up. ‘The domestic recovery was building momentum, with some signs of a modest rebalancing towards investment,’ said the minutes of this month’s meeting of the monetary policy committee. The news came as George Osborne learned Government borrowing is at its lowest level since the crisis . The Bank said ‘it was likely that productivity had started to rise after several years of stagnation’ and that wages are picking up - bringing an end to the squeeze on family finances. ‘It was possible that a sustainable rise in real wages and incomes, consistent with a durable recovery in demand and output, was in prospect,’ it said. But the Bank warned that there was ‘considerable uncertainty’ about the outlook for the UK - suggesting it is in no hurry to raise interest rates from the current level of 0.5 per cent. Speculation is mounting that rates will rise early next year - possibly before the General Election in May 2015. But the Bank said that ‘even when the economy had returned to normal... the appropriate level of Bank Rate was likely to be materially below the 5 per cent level set on average prior to the financial crisis’. The Bank, headed by Mark Carney, suggested there is no hurry to raise interest rates from 0.5 per cent . Figures from the Office for National Statistics suggested the economic recovery is feeding through into the public finances. The Government borrowed £107.7billion last year - down from £115.1billion in 2012-13 and well below the record £157.3billion deficit racked up by Labour in 2009-10. The annual deficit was worth 6.6 per cent of GDP last year - down from a peak of 11 per cent under Labour and the lowest level since 2007-08 before the crisis struck. A Treasury spokesman said it provided ‘further evidence that the Government’s long term economic plan is working’ but added ‘the job is not yet done’. Martin Beck senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ‘The public finances continue to show improvement. But there is still a long way to go in fixing the public finances. Austerity won’t be going away anytime soon.’","GDP grew by 1% in first three months of 2014, first time since 2007 .

"By . Michael Seamark . West Country girl? A photo of Lizzy Vaid taken from her Twitter page, on which she describes her role as 'assistant to Nigel Farage' The advert suggests she is simply an ordinary worker from Devon, who  will be casting a vote for Ukip at the European elections. And while Lizzy Vaid’s claim to back Nigel Farage’s party can’t be questioned, it is not just at the ballot box that she will be putting that support into action. It is even doubtful whether she will be voting in the West Country. For the attractive brunette actually . lives and works in London as Mr Farage’s personal assistant, and last . night she was alongside him in Gateshead on the latest leg of his tour . of Britain ahead of next month’s elections. Miss . Vaid appears in a full-page photograph in the party’s manifesto, with . her quoted as saying: ‘I’ll be voting Ukip because they’re the only . party listening to what people want.’ But . on her Twitter account the 27-year-old describes herself as ‘Ukip .

Farage, her arm draped behind him in a Ukip group picture taken in a . pub; to her right is blonde Alexandra Phillips, head of media for Ukip, . and the party’s leader, who sits alongside Patrick O’Flynn, its director . of communications. Her . Devon connection remains a mystery. According to Miss Vaid’s LinkedIn . professional profile, she was educated in Brighton and Lewes, East . Sussex. It has also emerged that she appeared on another leaflet earlier this year aimed at voters in the Wythenshawe and Sale East by-election. Miss Vaid also appears in the party’s television election broadcast. Embarrassingly, only days ago she tweeted a link to a story about Labour being ‘caught distributing false leaflets about Ukip’, telling followers it was a ‘must read article!’. Promotional material: Miss Vaid in the recently published Ukip leaflet where she poses as a worker from Devon . When Miss Vaid’s true identity was exposed and her role in the advert questioned, Mr Farage, 50, said: ‘I don’t think you’d ask this question of the Labour party, the Lib Dems or the Conservatives who often have group pictures. ‘You know, the leader with 25  people standing behind them. And you never ask to see the CV of any of those,’ he told Sky News. He added: ‘The fact that Lizzy Vaid is half-Indian and works for us is as far as we are concerned  a non-issue. ‘She is somebody in our promotional material who is going to  vote Ukip. ‘She joined Ukip, she got a job with Ukip because she believes in what we stand for. What on earth is wrong with that?’ Asked why Miss Vaid is not described . as a Ukip staff member in the manifesto, Mr Farage replied: ‘I don’t see . the need. You’re going down this media route, do you want us to say the . religion of all  our candidates?’ Right-hand girl: Miss Vaid with Mr Farage in another picture taken from her Twitter profile . Group shot: Miss Vaid with Mr Farage and Alexandra Philips, head of media for Ukip . This is not the first time that the Ukip leader had found himself facing problems over women. Last month ex-Ukip Euro MEP Godfrey Bloom, who had the party whip withdrawn after calling women ‘sluts’, said: ‘We all have our weaknesses. Mine is real ale. ‘I’ve never been partial to crumpet. Nigel’s is women. It’s not something he’s denied.’ Days later Nikki Sinclaire, a former Ukip MEP, used parliamentary privilege in Strasbourg to claim Mr Farage had used public money to employ both his wife, German national Kirsten, and his ‘former mistress’. He was alleged to have had an affair with his former spin doctor Annabelle Fuller, 32. Both the Ukip leader and Miss Fuller strongly deny having had an affair.","Lizzy Vaid presented as a simple worker from the West Country in Ukip ad .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . A Miami boy who as electrocuted to death just days after his seventh birthday lives on as celebrities pose with a self portrait he drew month before his death. Though Calder Sloan was killed April 13 due to a faulty underwater light in his family's pool, he's since posed--at least in spirit--with celebrities like Miami Heat center Chris Bosh, Senator Bill Nelson and the national ABC News team. He's also traveling the world thanks to the social media campaign started by a family friend that's urged strangers to snap Mr. Awesome in places from the Hollywood Sign to a plane en route to Panama. Paying tribute to Mr Awesome: Calder Sloan, 7, was killed when faulty wiring in his family's swimming pool electrocuted him in early April. Now a self-portrait he drew months before his death has become a viral sensation bearing his family nickname . High praise: Calder's colorfully scribbled face has touched so many so deeply that it adorned the facade of American Airlines Arena in his hometown of Miami . The heartwarming tribute to a vibrant, constantly smiling little boy was hatched when Jim Cahill, a friend of Calder's father Chris Sloan, printed a copy of Calder's drawing and posted it to Facebook. Cahill urged his friends on the social network to do the same. Before anyone realized, Calder's drawing, along with its new Mr. Awesome title, which comes from the boy's family nickname, had become a viral sensation. Now the little boy is traveling the world and inspiring some seriously famous folks to pay tribute to him, much to the surprise and joy of his still devastated family. The sentiment is huge and almost enough to match the sheer horror of the freak accident that took his Calder's life. Calder . was racing his nanny's adult son across the backyard pool in Miami, . Florida when the man felt a shock in the water, leaped out and yelled . for the boy to get out too. But Calder, who was underwater and couldn't hear him, suddenly received a massive jolt that threw him out of the water. Seeing America: A Sloan family friend posted the drawing on Facebook and urged his friends to print it off, take a picture and do the same. Mr Awesome has seen the desert of the Southwest and the characters of the Walk of Fame . Famous faces: Well-known folks like U.S. Senator from Florida Bill Nelson and Miami Heat superstar Chris Bosh are just a couple of the people who've honored the tragically killed boy . Widespread: Celebrities honoring Calder have spread beyond South Florida, like Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez (seen here with his daughters) Neighbors rushed to the home and performed CPR on the boy before paramedics arrived. Neighbor Fabian Pesantes, who was giving him CPR, told News10: . 'As I was touching the water, to wipe off my mouth, I was getting . zapped. As I was performing CPR on the boy I was getting zapped.' The . boy's parents, who were visiting friends, received a call and Calder's . father, Christopher Sloan, said he heard his wife scream, 'Is Calder . dead?' as she ran outside. The couple raced to Jackson North . Medical Center, but their son had already passed. Heartbroken: Chris Sloan spoke to reporters about his son as he stood in front of the family pool that killed him . Scene: It appears that he was shocked through a light fixture at the back of the pool that was improperly installed . Beautiful family: Calder smiles alongside his parents Chris and Carla and younger brother Caleb . Remembered: Calder, a sports lover and energetic young boy, was called 'Mr Awesome' by his family . Sloan said . that about nine months ago, he noticed that the pool light was broken so . they hired a contractor to fix it. Among the family's grief and the . chaos of organizing the funeral, they have not yet tracked down the name . of the contractor. Calder's dip into the pool on Sunday was the first time anyone had been in in months. North Miami requires permits and . inspections on pool electrical work, city spokeswoman Pam Solomon said, but city building . department records don't indicate any permits at the Sloan home. Electricians told family members earlier this week that the light switch to the . pool wasn't grounded properly, so power that should have . been diverted from the pool was instead going directly into it. 'Somebody did not do their job,' Chris Sloan said.","Calder Sloan died April 13 when a faulty underwater light in his family's Miami pool electrocuted him and thrust him from the water .

"By . Daniel Martin . A £600million 'health tourism gap' sees the UK paying out  £20 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill on the  continent for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors . NHS hospitals are getting even worse at clawing back money for foreigners’ healthcare, despite ministers’ pledges to stamp out health tourism. A £600million ‘health tourism gap’ sees the UK paying out  £20 for the healthcare costs of Britons who fall ill on the  continent for every £1 it gets back for the NHS treatment of European visitors. The disparity is even worse than it was two years ago, when Britain paid out £16 for every £1 it got back. It means that, despite promises from David Cameron and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to get to grips with the issue, the gulf is widening year on year. The figures, released following a Freedom of Information request, show that in 2012/13, British taxpayers handed £649.3million to European governments to pay for the care of UK citizens who fall ill abroad. But the NHS managed to collect only £32million from the same European countries to pay for the care of their citizens who needed treatment here. Ministers claim ‘health tourism’ costs British taxpayers billions a year, as many NHS trusts do not even keep records of debts. Last year cancer specialist Professor J Meirion Thomas warned of a ‘massive and escalating problem’ of foreigners travelling to Britain for cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment then leaving without paying. He said the NHS was also becoming the ‘world’s maternity wing’. Some of the gap is due to more British pensioners retiring to the continent than those from the EU here. There may also be more tourists from Britain going to Europe than the other way. But there are more than a  million migrant workers from the EU here, against far fewer Britons employed in other  European countries. In 2012/13, the UK paid Ireland £211million for treating Britons who fell ill there. Only £17.5million came back the other way. Dia Chakravarty of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Anyone in need of emergency NHS care should be given the necessary treatment, but taxpayers should not be underwriting an international health service' Some £230million was paid to Spain but only £5.5million came back. France received £128million but returned just £1million. Italy got £8.9million and sent back £830,000, while Greece collected £5.9million and returned £480,000. The UK received less than £1million from Poland and token payments of £4,100 from Lithuania, £44,936 from Slovakia and £4,920 from Romania. Under UK immigration laws, the bill for EU citizens’ hospital care should be sent to their own country to settle up, unless they become UK residents. They cannot apply for residency unless they have lived in this country for five years without a break. Dia Chakravarty of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Anyone in need of emergency NHS care should be given the necessary treatment, but taxpayers should not be underwriting an international health service. The NHS needs to start charging market rates for foreign patients rather than charging them amounts which barely cover costs, leaving the taxpayer to pick up the bill.’ Tim Aker, UKIP’s head of policy, said: ‘We must make sure visitors and migrants to the UK have proper, credible health insurance as a condition of entry.’ Last year ministers announced plans to charge foreigners for emergency treatment on the NHS for the first time. Migrants who go to A&E will be billed between £20 and £100 for a consultation, on top of the cost of their treatment. The scheme will be implemented later this year.","UK pays out £20 for care costs of Britons abroad for every £1 it gets back .

"By . Dan Bloom . A group of male carpenters, plumbers and cleaners have won a landmark equal pay case after complaining they were paid less than female secretaries. The 18 workmen sued saying they were given around £4,000 less a year than women on the same pay scale when their employer merged with another university last year. Now in what is thought to be the first decision involving such a large group of men, bosses have agreed - and the workers along with eight others are in line for £30,000 each in back pay. Landmark case: Workmen Nicholas Thomas, Rob Cooze and Mike Betson are among 26 due £30,000 each from the University of Wales Trinity St David after saying they were paid less than female colleagues . The University of Wales, Trinity St David - which merged with the men's former employer Swansea Metropolitan University - had insisted the difference was not due to gender. But in a surprise U-turn, the university said today it would no longer contest the case. A spokesman said chiefs had re-thought their position after a former Swansea vice chancellor, Professor David Warner, gave evidence to their employment tribunal. 'We came to the view the original claim presented by staff to the former Swansea Metropolitan University had due merit and, as a result, an appropriate remedy should be agreed and actioned,' the spokesman added. But the spokesman insisted the situation was not the university's fault and was down to 'historical decisions' by Swansea before the Metropolitan University ceased to exist. Changing hands: The men were all employed at Swansea Metropolitan University (pictured) which has since become a campus of University of Wales Trinity St David. The university blamed 'historical decisions' It is believed to be the first time that such a large group of men have launched legal action in Britain claiming sexual discrimination. Although tribunals brought by men are not unheard of, the case involving the Welsh university workers has been described as 'very unusual'. All the men were originally employed by Swansea Metropolitan University which merged with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in August last year. They were on grade three of the university's pay scale and the dispute arose when their contracts changed. Previously, the men had been on a minimum 45 hour week until new regulations sought to standardise all workers to a 37 hour week instead. Fearing the drop in hours would cause problems, university bosses said they would guarantee the men the extra eight hours but class it as overtime pay. Victory: Tradesman Rob Cooze, 50, plumber Mike Betson, 65, and carpenter Nicholas Thomas, 47, address the media outside the employment tribunal in Cardiff where the group may have won £750,000 . Yet when the new system was put in place, the men said they realised their hourly rate was less than women including secretaries and office employees who were on the same pay grade. Both parties are yet to agree a payout but it is thought it will amount to £30,000 in back pay for each of the 18 workers, along with eight more who said they would lodge the same claim. Women may have first earned the vote in 1918, but it would take more than 50 years before they were given the right to demand the same wages as men. The Equal Pay Act was only passed in 1970 and did not become law until 1976, finally giving women the right to the same salaries and terms as men doing the same job. Yet many employers, who had lobbied against the Act saying it would bankrupt them, simply re-graded women's jobs so that on paper they were technically serving a different role to men. The Equality Act 2010 tightened up many of the laws enacted in 1970 and people can sue if they are doing broadly the same job, even if it is not given the same title. Yet many women still feel they have a raw deal. The pay gap widened for the first time in five years in December with women earning an average of £5,000 a year less - often because men still take many of the top jobs. The workers' lawyers will also apply for costs, though the men are not seeking money for 'injury to feelings'. Speaking outside the employment tribunal in Cardiff, Robert Cooze, 50, from Swansea, said he and his colleagues were over the moon. 'We didn't want it to come to this really but we're glad common sense has prevailed,' said Mr Cooze. 'It's been admitted that we have been discriminated against. 'With all due respect to our new employers, Trinity St David, this is completely new to them and is a historical issue. 'I would like to think that they have had some input into this. We are just so relieved and can get on with our ordinary working days now. 'At certain times it did get us down because in the past ... we felt like we weren't being listened to. I just hope it hasn't soured any relations between us and our new employers.' The Trinity St David spokesman added: 'The employment tribunal related to events that occurred more than seven years ago at the now dissolved higher education corporation Swansea Metropolitan University, and several years before its merger with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David which took place in 2013. 'The University of Wales Trinity Saint David had no involvement in the decisions that were made by Swansea Metropolitan University in 2007. 'This was a complex case and we are very disappointed the new university now has to deal with, in an appropriate manner and with due care, the consequences of historical decisions.' Rob Cooze said: 'We are just so relieved and can get on with our ordinary working days now'","26 workers in Swansea could receive around £750,000 in back pay .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tragic Freddie Perry was knocked down and killed while talking on his mobile phone near his home in Didcot, Oxfordshire . A boy aged ten was fatally injured . outside a school as he chatted on his mobile phone and did not see a . car  being driven by a teacher. A coroner heard that Freddie Perry was knocked down by the car, although the driver was exonerated of any blame. The . schoolboy was playing with a friend just yards from his home when he . was hit by Joanne Napper’s Nissan Micra, the inquest was told yesterday. The friend told police that Freddie received a call on his phone and . answered it as he ran out between parked cars, oblivious of Miss . Napper’s car. The teacher . was travelling at 20mph and said there was nothing she could have done . to prevent the accident, with parked vehicles blocking her view. Freddie, . a keen Harry Potter and boxing fan, was taken to John Radcliffe . Hospital in Oxford on September 10 last year, but died the next day. Speaking after the inquest, Freddie’s father, coach driver Lea Perry, . said the family did not blame Miss Napper for the tragedy. ‘We don’t . feel angry towards the lady,’ he said. ‘She has got to live with it. We . have got to live with it. It is hell.’ Mr . Perry said pupils at Stephen Freeman Community Primary School in . Didcot, Oxfordshire, where Freddie had been in Year 6, had dressed a . teddy bear in a uniform and put it in his seat. ‘They can’t bear for him . not to be there,’ he said. Tributes to Freddie Perry left at the side of the road where he was knocked down in September last year . The inquest in Oxford heard that Freddie was playing with a friend at 5.30pm on a green near the family home in Didcot. In . evidence, PC Naomi Hames said the friend saw Freddie holding the phone . to his ear when he disappeared around the side of a parked vehicle . seconds before the collision. She said: ‘He was running a bit faster . than jogging.’ At the same . time Miss Napper was travelling down the road, having just left Didcot . Girls’ School where Freddie’s sister, Eloise, 12, had joined just a week . earlier. She said  there were a lot of cars parked on the side of the road. Freddie's family have since launched a road safety campaign to get a crossing built on the road and have raised thousands of pounds for charity . She . described seeing a young boy running into the road out of the corner of . her eye. ‘I slammed on my brakes as soon as I saw him,’ Miss Napper . said. ‘It was the only thing I could do to try and avoid him. I didn’t . see him prior to that due to the parked vehicles.’ Freddie . was hit by the front left wing of the car and thrown into the air. Forensic collision investigator Andrew Evans said Miss Napper would not . have been able to prevent the accident. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said it was an ‘extremely tragic incident’.","Freddie Perry was playing outside last year when the accident happened .

"By . Jason Groves . Traditional county names like Middlesex and Cumberland could become a familiar sight again on England’s roads after ministers yesterday lifted a ban on displaying them on street signs. In a move to mark St George’s Day, the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said planning laws were being changed to allow councils to display traditional county names alongside more modern creations. Ministers are also consulting on a further change that would allow councils to erect stand-alone road signs telling motorists they have crossed an ancient boundary of counties like Huntingdonshire and Westmorland. Signs such as this one, formerly of Middlesex, could have their old counties on them to celebrate heritage . Mr Pickles said the change in the rules would make it easier for England to celebrate its own rich heritage. He said: ‘The tapestry of England’s counties binds our nation together, and is interwoven with our cultural fabric - from our cricket to our ales. Previous governments have tried to wipe the counties off the map, imposing bland administrative structures or alien euro-regions. ‘But I believe we are stronger as a nation when we cherish and champion our local and traditional ties. 'This government is proud to wave the flag of St George alongside both our county flags. 'Whatever one’s class, colour or creed, we should have pride in our English identities within the United Kingdom’s Union that binds us together.’ The boundaries of England’s 39 traditional counties have remain largely unchanged since the Domesday Book. But successive waves of local government reorganisation, most notably Edward heath’s 1972 shaek-up, have threatened to blur their boundaries and wipe some off the map altogether. Under existing laws the use of anything other than modern local authority names is classed as an advertisement. Stand-alone road signs may also be erected to highlight ancient boundaries such as Huntingdonshire . Blackpool cannot declare its Lancashire . heritage on signs because it is now a unitary authority. Similar rules . prevent Poole saying it is in Dorset or Torquay declaring it is in . Devon. TV astrologer Russell Grant, founder of the Association of British Counties, welcomed the announcement. The former Strictly Come Dancing Star said: ‘This is great news for counties like my own, Middlesex. We lost our county council in 1965, but our county continues to exist. 'Some London boroughs like Hounslow have actively supported Middlesex signs on their boundaries, and Brentford Chamber of Commerce are keen to proclaim the town as the historic county town of Middlesex. Flashback: Eric Pickles announced the plan to put old counties' names on street signs to mark St George's Day . 'These common sense changes will give local councils and communities the confidence to promote historic local heritage and identity.’ Ministers believe reviving the use of Britain’s traditional county names could foster a sense of national pride and boost tourism. A source said: ‘They provide an instant means of reference to different parts of the country, to a set of cities, towns and villages, to distinctive scenery, architecture and wildlife, to particular industries and pastimes, accents and dialect, tourist attractions and so on. ‘A large literature focuses on each of the counties - they give their names to clubs and societies, to teams people play for, to regiments they serve in. 'And they often provide a family link with past generations.’ Under the new planning guidance on advertising, councils will be deemed to have the power to use traditional county names on signs provided they do not create dangerous roadside clutter. The guidance states: ‘Local authorities may install signs indicating the boundary of a historic or traditional county on their land. Depending on circumstances, such signs may benefit from deemed consent. ‘Authorities need to bear in mind how such sign-posting can benefit the local economy and reflect this through the decision-taking process, where such signs are appropriate and locally-supported.’ However, the move comes just days after Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin warned councils to cut down on the excessive number of signs cluttering Britain’s roads. Regulations are set to be tightened up after research by the Department for Transport found the total number of road signs has more than doubled in the last 20 years to 4.5 million.","Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced plan for St George's Day .

"By . James Chapman . Tony Blair speaking at Bloomberg in London yesterday: The former PM's role in the delay of the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War has been questioned . A long-delayed report on the Iraq war is unlikely to see the light of day until after the next general  election, according to well-placed sources. Despite growing anger over the wait for publication of Sir John Chilcot’s investigation into the 2003 conflict, it is now not expected to be ready until early next year. Whitehall sources suggest that with an election due in May 2015, it will be deemed too politically difficult to publish it until after voters have gone to the polls. Labour strategists are said to be alarmed at the prospect of voters being reminded of the Iraq war in the months before the election, since the conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters to the Liberal Democrats in 2005 and 2010. Lord Morris, a former Labour Attorney General, yesterday called for ‘clarification’ on whether Tony Blair, Gordon Brown or the Cabinet Office were involved in the delay. He insisted Mr Blair must not be allowed to stymie the release of the report – a charge the former prime minister firmly denied. Sir John, who was asked to investigate the Iraq war by Mr Brown in 2009, last took evidence from a witness three years ago. He warned David Cameron in November that it was ‘regrettable’ that a deal could not be agreed on the disclosure of communications between Mr Blair and George W Bush, the US President at the time of the Iraq war. The Prime Minister said he hoped the issues would be ‘concluded as soon as possible’. But there is speculation in Whitehall that the process of declassifying documents, including Mr Blair’s correspondence with President Bush before the war, remains stalled. It is thought that no one involved has so far received a letter from the inquiry as part of the so-called  ‘Maxwellisation’ process – the legal requirement to notify individuals who are criticised in a government-commissioned report. One source said: ‘It’s certainly not going to be ready before the end of the year and it would be a highly political act to publish in the months before an election. The can is going to be kicked further down the road.’ Blair meets with troops in the port of Umm Qasr, Iraq, in May 2003: Labour strategists are said to be alarmed at the prospect of voters being reminded of the Iraq war in the months before the election . Lord Morris asked: ‘Who is responsible for the delay? Not Chilcot and his colleagues, who must be anxious to publish. Two past prime ministers – Gordon Brown and Tony Blair? Political dynamite: The investigation by Sir John Chilcot, pictured, into the 2003 conflict is now not expected to be ready until early next year . ‘A Cabinet Office fighting to maintain a precedent that Cabinet minutes and discussions between the two previous prime ministers should be permanently kept private? ‘Parliament deserves a clear statement from Mr Cameron as to the reasons for the delays. What urgently needs clarification now is where the main hold-up is.’ Mr Blair has insisted that ‘going back over Chilcot’ is not going to get Britain and its allies out of difficult decisions over intervening in other troubled Middle East states. Labour MP Paul Flynn, who rebelled over Iraq, claimed Mr Blair ‘dreads the publication of Chilcot’. ‘The vote on the Iraq war was the foulest episode of the Blair government,’ he said. ‘The 139 Labour MPs who voted on a severe three-line whip against British involvement were not enough. There were 80 other Labour MPs who had indicated their worries by their support for amendments and early day motions. ‘They were bribed, bullied and bamboozled into voting for war, or abstaining. I wonder if Tony and the whips ever dwell on the thought that 179 British lives would not have been lost if they had told the truth and desisted from bellicose bullying.’","Labour said to be alarmed at reminding voters of the Tony Blair's Iraq War .

"By . Sarah Harris . Rising numbers of British pupils are attending boarding schools despite inflation-busting rises in fees (posed by models) Rising numbers of British pupils are attending boarding schools despite inflation-busting rises in fees as parents demand wraparound childcare, it has been revealed. The majority of boarders are full-time but around one in 13 are ‘flexi’ which means their families pay for overnight stays whenever they need them as they juggle busy working lives. This short-term measure is most common among younger boarders, with around four in ten having ad hoc sleepovers at school. The growing popularity in boarding comes even though full fees have reached £9,596 a term or £28,788-a-year - up 4.3 per cent on last year. This rises to as much as £11,168 a term or £33,504 a year in some London boarding schools. The Independent Schools Council surveyed 1,209 member schools and found a 4.6 per cent increase in UK-based boarders, from 43,919 last year to 45,958. Overall, the proportion of boarders rose by one per cent from 66,585 last year to 67,221. This brought the total number of ISC boarders across the country to 68,453, taking into account pupils in those independent schools that did not take part in the study last year. There was a 0.2 per cent fall in day pupils among the schools surveyed in both years, leading to no percentage change in numbers in ISC schools (504,362) compared to last year. However, the total headcount figure currently stands at 511,928 due to the number of new schools joining the ISC since the survey was carried out last year. The ISC report reveals that 83.7 per cent of boarding pupils are full boarders; 8.4 per cent are weekly and 7.9 per cent are ‘flexi’. Among seven and 11-year-olds boarders, over 40 per cent are ‘flexi’ boarding. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council and former headmaster of Harrow School, said: ‘Although flexi boarding is still the minority of boarders, quite a lot of families find that they don’t want to commit to full-time or even weekly boarding. ‘They prefer their children to board when it suits the family. There’s all sorts of reasons why it could be very attractive to some parents - if one of them has to suddenly go and work abroad for a few days or if there’s a mismatch between different children’s holidays. ‘These flexi boarders tend to be from parents who live near the school, can see the benefits of boarding, they want to continue seeing their children and they prefer a flexible arrangement. They’re basically paying for it daily.’ Referring to the seven to 11-year-old flexi boarders he added: ‘What it reflects is the fact that the older the child becomes, the more confident the parents are about full-time boarding.’ Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council and former headmaster of Harrow School, said 'quite a lot of families don't want to commit to full-time boarding' Mr Lenon said that the impact of high boarding fees is ‘significantly ameliorated by the fact that all boarding schools offer quite large numbers of bursaries’. A night’s occasional boarding typically costs between £25 and £60, according to The Good Schools Guide. It says that Prior Park College in Bath charges its flexi boarders £45 but levies an £85 fee on any weekly boarder who wishes to spend Sunday evening in school. Some schools, such as King’s College, Taunton, Somerset, offer day pupils’ one free-night of boarding a week. The guide adds: ‘Before you rub your hands at the thought of a cheap baby-sitting service we should caution that it excludes weekends, unless the child is involved in a school or house event. ‘ . Hilary Moriarty, national director of the Boarding Schools’ Association, added: ‘Yes, it’s an expensive option, and there will be parents who will work very long hours in demanding jobs to be able to make such an education available to their child. ‘But there will also be hard-working parents who find that boarding is an excellent answer to the problems of childcare out of school hours. ‘Older children in particular may find short school days leave them with time on their hands that they cannot use productively. The structured evenings and weekends in boarding schools provide a wealth of opportunity, with facilities and staff on site, to do more than the normal school curriculum and have fun at the same time.’ Meanwhile the report said that over the last two decades there has been a ‘shift towards co-education at ISC schools and a reduction in the number of schools that cater exclusively for either boys or girls’. The number of single-sex girls schools ‘has not fallen as fast as the number of single sex boys’ schools over this period’, it adds.","Increasing number of pupils attending boarding school despite rising fees .

Their mother Einas Abulsayen said that the two boys left without warning, after the younger boy tricked her into thinking he needed his passport for ID at school. They were following in the footsteps, she said, of their older brother Amer, 20, who went to Syria in October with an aid convoy. British jihadist Jaffar Deghayes, 16, asked his mother for a cuddle before running away to Syria to fight alongside his brother, who later died fighting alongside Islamic rebels . Abdullah Deghayes, 18, from Brighton, is believed to have died in Kassab, in Latakia province, earlier this month after leaving the UK in January . Speaking to the Times from the family home in Brighton, the mother-of-six said the last time she saw Jaffar was when he was looking for his glasses. 'He said: ""Mummy, give me a cuddle."" This cuddle: he wants to say goodbye. I didn't know that's the last cuddle until now. Hopefully not the last one.' She revealed she had left the house while Abdullah was showering, and so had not seen her older son on the day he left to take up arms alongside Syrian rebels. Later that day, when she realised her sons would not return home, she began to frantically call them - but their phones were switched off. She was contacted on April 14 by Amer, via an instant messaging service, who told her that Abdullah had been killed. It is claimed that he was shot while trying to help against an attack by government forces. Abdullah's mother Einas Abulsayen said that the two boys left without warning, after the younger boy tricked her into thinking he needed his passport for ID at school . Abubaker . Deghayes, who learned of his son’s death via Facebook, pleaded for his other two sons to return. He . told the Guardian: ‘Amer, Jaffar, if you see me or this interview . please, please come back home. Enough. This war has taken Abdullah . already... I’d like to see you live longer.’ Mr Deghayes insisted his three sons were not ‘terrorists’ but had travelled to Syria to defend ‘those who are weak’. Abdullah, . who was due to go to university in Brighton, is the nephew of Omar . Deghayes, who was held by the United States as an enemy combatant at . Guantanamo Bay detention camp between 2002 and 2007 after he was . arrested in Pakistan. Police will launch national campaign to stop would-be terrorists travelling to Syria today, following a dramatic rise in the number of people being arrested after going to the war-torn state. UK authorities have long expressed fears about aspiring jihadis travelling to Syria for terrorist training, and it is thought that hundreds of Britons have already been there. Today, Scotland Yard said that 40 Syria-related arrests were made in the first three months of this year, up from 25 in the whole of last year. Rebel fighters and civilians stand looking at a burning building following a reported barrel bomb attack. Police will launch national campaign to stop would-be terrorists travelling to Syria today . Senior National Co-ordinator Counter-Terrorism Helen Ball said: ‘We are increasingly concerned about the numbers of young people who have or are intending to travel to Syria to join the conflict. 'We want to ensure that people, particularly women, who are concerned about their loved ones are given enough information about what they can do to prevent this from happening. ‘We want to increase their confidence in the police and partners to encourage them to come forward so that we can intervene and help. This is not about criminalising people it is about preventing tragedies. We want to inform those who wish to genuinely help the Syrian cause how they can do so safely and legally.’ Workers from the Prevent counter-terrorism scheme, the Charity Commission and other groups will meet at Scotland Yard today for the launch of the campaign, particularly aimed at women who are concerned about young people planning to travel to Syria. Other events are also being held across the country, and leaflets highlighting the risks of going to the Middle Eastern state will be handed out at ports. Police have advised those who want to support humanitarian efforts in Syria to donate to charities instead of going there. Michelle Russell, from the Charity Commission, said: ‘There is a genuine and desperate need for humanitarian assistance to help people affected by the conflict in Syria. UK charities and their partners are playing an important role in the delivery of humanitarian aid to Syria and its neighbouring countries. In part, they have only been able to do this by the generous donations of the public. ‘We want everyone to make informed choices about which charities to support and how to support them so that they can feel confident that their contribution really will make a difference to the humanitarian effort.’ The campaign is being launched after the father of a British teenager killed in Syria said he is ‘scared’ for his two other sons and urged them to leave the war-torn country where they have gone to fight. Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the last two years, authorities believe, with an estimated 20 having died. Those who have died include one man suspected of carrying out a suicide attack. Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February.

"By . Becky Barrow . It started out as a small drapers shop on London’s Oxford Street in 1864. But 150 years’ later, John Lewis has become Britain’s favourite retailer inspiring ‘exceptionally high loyalty’ among its army of devoted shoppers. Yesterday the retail analysts Verdict said John Lewis, which has annual sales of around £4billion a year, won first prize in its annual competition to find ‘the nation’s best retailer'. Retail analysts Verdict said John Lewis, which has annual sales of around £4billion a year, won first prize in its annual competition to find 'the nation's best retailer' The announcement was not entirely surprising. Verdict has held the competition for the last 15 years - and John Lewis has come top ten times. And when it does not come top, it comes second (except for one shaming occasion in 2012 when it came third). Sarah Peters, an analyst at Verdict, said: ‘As Britain’s favourite retailer, John Lewis continues to deliver the product ranges, inspiration and trust that customers appreciate.’ There are just 41 John Lewis department stores in the UK. When the most recent one opened in York two weeks ago, there were 150 people queuing outside at 8.30am, 30 minutes before it opened its doors. John Lewis, part of the John Lewis Partnership, which also includes Waitrose, is best-known for its ‘never knowingly undersold’ policy, which pledges to offer the best price on the high-street. John Lewis opened its first shop on Oxford Street, London in 1864, pictured . It sells everything from bed linen and mattresses to children’s clothes and cots to plates, saucepans and knives, and typically stocks around 350,000 different products in its department stores. Last year, iPads, chocolate coins, vacuum cleaner bags, cereal bowls, Egyptian cotton bedding, Lego mini figures and mascara were among its top ten best-selling products. The company’s performance is helped by its unusual structure, which means its partners - that is, its workforce - own the business. 1. John Lewis . 2. Dunelm . 3. IKEA . 4. Brantano . 5. Matalan . Each year, they are paid a bonus, which is a percentage of their basic salary. All partners receive the same percentage of their salary. This year, for example, John Lewis Partnership’s 91,000 partners, including 29,000 who work for John Lewis, shared £202.5million. Each got 15 per cent of their salary, equal to nearly eight weeks’ pay. Such is the appeal of the John Lewis Partnership brand that a recent report found homes are more valuable if they have a branch of Waitrose nearby. On average, the report, from the estate agency Savills, found the average home with a nearby Waitrose is 25.3 per cent more expensive than the average price in the whole of the county. Verdict’s second prize was taken by Dunelm, which has 143 stores in the UK, mostly out of town, which sell everything that you need for your house. Last year, it came third. It was set up in 1979 as a market . stall in Leicester by a couple called Bill and Jean Adderley, and . remains a family business. Their son Will was chief executive until . three years ago. Third prize in the competition, run by retail analysts Verdict,   was won by IKEA, the Swedish retailing giant . The third prize was won by Ikea, the Swedish retailing giant. The fourth prize was won by Brantano, the footwear shop founded in 1998 and based mostly in out of town retail parks. It sells its own range but also brands such as Clarks and Hush Puppies. Unlike most shoe shops, its shoes are arranged in pairs and can be immediately tried on, which takes the hassle and waiting out of shopping for shoes.","Retail analysts Verdict named John Lewis as 'the nation's best retailer'

"He is a convicted murderer and rapist, but Barry Whiteoak has won damages after a tribunal found he was racially discriminated in an Australian jail - for being British.. The 66-year-old UK-born killer and repeat sex offender won the payout based on claims he suffered racial discrimination when classified as a British lawful non-citizen. Whiteoak's taxpayer-funded legal battle lasted six years and cost up to $100,000 (£55,362) in legal aid, the Daily Telegraph reported. Victim: Irish nurse Noreen Hannon, pictured, was murdered by Barry Whiteoak in her flat in Parramatta, Sydney, in 1983 . In jail since 1983 for the murder of Noreen Hannon, the Yorkshire-native based his racial discrimination claim on his British nationality - which meant he was not entitled to perks including day release. Despite the marathon compensation battle, Whiteoak won $500 (£276) compensation, all of which goes to the Victims Support Fund for victims of crime. Whiteoak forced his way into 25-year-old nurse Noreen Hannon's Parramatta flat, in western Sydney, in September 1983, after she rejected his sexual advances. He then stabbed and strangled her to death, leaving her naked body in the lift of the building. Ms Hannon arrived in Australia from Ireland on working holiday before she was killed. Despite pleading innocent, the killer was convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. At the time he committed Ms Hannon's murder, Whiteoak was on parole for a rape he committed in 1980, while already on parole for indecently assaulting a woman a knifepoint in 1978. Arriving in Australia as a 20-year-old, by 27, Whiteoak had been jailed for the indecent assault, in which he told the victim: 'It would be easy to carve you up'. Crazy: Ms Hannon's boyfriend at the time of her murder, Michael Maher, has slammed Whiteoak's racial damages claim . For the rape of his next victim, Whiteoak received an 18-month jail sentence and was described by the judge as an inadequate, lonely socially inept man. Ms Hannon's boyfriend at the time of her death, Michael Maher, has called the convicted murderer's claim 'crazy'. 'It's an absolute disgrace when people who have genuine cases can't get Legal Aid but these guys can,' he said. 'He is a serial rapist and murderer who should have no rights in prison, never mind the right to bring this case and we have had to pay for it.' Under new laws that saw all life sentences redetermined, Whiteoak's prison term for the murder was cut to a minimum of 15 years in 1994, with the rest of his life to be served on parole. He was to be released in 2003, but public outcry and political pressure kept him in jail. The rapist was refused bail multiple times until August 2008, when the Department of Immigration cancelled his permanent residency visa, thus ensuring the killer's deportation to the UK. In December 2008, Whiteoak launched his racial discrimination case, following Corrective Services implementing a blanket ban on lawful non-citizens like himself being classified a C3, which allows them to apply for prison perks including day release. The murderer told the Administrative Decisions Tribunal: 'It is discrimination because the policy decisions are treating me differently to what an Australian citizen is treated'. Whiteoak said the decision to cancel his permanent residency was based purely on his British nationality and not his offensive behaviour. He asked the tribunal to use all powers available to persuade and or force the Corrective Services to change his classification back to what it was originally. This month, after multiple hearings, the Civil and Administrative Tribunal ruled that Corrective Services had racially discriminated against Whiteoak under the Anit-Discrimination Act. The lengthy case has resulted in a NSW Legal Aid review of foreign-born cases that are pending. NSW Legal Aid CEO Bill Grant said the review will determine if there is appropriate ways of spending limited Legal Aid resources. It is believed the case was funded by Legal Aid because it involved a 'fundamental legal principle'. However, the loophole had been closed before the case went to the tribunal.","In 1983, a UK-born man stabbed and strangled a nurse to death in Sydney .

"By . Damien Gayle . Cheeky police have been caught on camera blaring KRS-One's Sound Of Da Police from the loudspeaker on their patrol car. Bank Holiday ravers in Chelmsford, Essex, were left speechless when they saw the marked police car cruising the town centre belting out the early-Nineties rap classic. Their mobile phone video of the unlikely situation includes the song's iconic chorus, in which KRS-One whoops to evoke the sound of a police siren. Scroll down for video . The Sound Of Da Police: Grainy smartphone footage taken in the early hours of Bank Holiday Monday shows a marked police patrol car blaring the Nineties rap classic from its loudspeaker as it cruises through Chelmsford . Despite it's obvious law enforcement connotations, the song is an ironic choice for a patrol car given its evocation of police brutality, institutionalised racism and oppression. A 15-second video uploaded to YouTube shows the Essex Police patrol car pull away in Chelmsford town centre with its speakers blasting out the rap anthem. The white car, with distinctive yellow and blue checks, can clearly be heard playing the iconic line: 'Woop, woop, it's the sound of the police.' Released in 1993, Sound Of Da Police was the second and final single from KRS-One's first solo album, Return Of The Boom Bap. It . has become an anti-authoritarian anthem, covered by bands such as Rage . Against The Machine and notably featured in La Haine, the 1995 French . cult cinema classic about youths from the Paris ghettoes clashing with . the law. The lyrics are . explicitly critical of police, comparing them to slave overseers and . accusing them of being complicit in the continuing oppression of Black . people in the U.S. Rebel music: Despite it's obvious law enforcement connotations, the song by conscious rapper KRS-One, right, is an ironic choice for a patrol car given its evocation of police brutality, institutionalised racism and oppression . An Essex Police spokesman confirmed they are investigating the video, which was apparently shot on Monday . One line focusing on the overuse of guns in American policing says: 'The officer has the right to arrest, and if you fight back they put a hole in your chest.' Another jab at the police states: 'The real criminals are the C-O-P.' 'The police them have a little gun,' it states. 'So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one.' An Essex Police spokesman confirmed they are investigating the video. 'We have viewed the footage and are looking into the matter,' he said.","The KRS-One track is an unambiguous condemnation of police oppression .

"By . Damien Gayle . Heathrow Airport's new Terminal 2 is set to open in months, giving the capital a spacious new air transit point able to handle 20million passengers a year. Replacing the old, overcrowded Terminal 2 which had stood since the Fifties, the new facility was today hailed as a cornerstone of Heathrow's revitalisation ahead of its opening on June 4. Shafts of natural light and high quality acoustics should make the building a calm space for travellers accustomed to high anxiety at dark, noisy airports, said lead architect Luis Vidal. Spacious: British artist Richard Wilson's sculpture Slipstream dominates this view of the new Terminal 2 at Heathrow Airport on April 23, 2014 in London, England. The rebuilding of the transit point has taken five years at a cost of £2.5billion, but it is finally slated to open on June 4 . Gateway to the world: The departure area of the new 'Queen's Terminal', which is expected to manage up to 20million passengers every year . Breath of fresh air: Visitors walk past a doorway at the new building, which replaces the old, overcrowded Terminal 2 which had stood since the Fifties . 'If you make it intuitive, pleasant, joyful, you can take away a completely different memory of the terminal,' Mr Vidal told The Associated Press. 'You can never completely erase your memory of the former Terminal 2, because it was a dreadful experience. This will be completely the opposite. This will be a destination. People will want to come here.' In an effort to dispense with those past bad associations, the new Terminal 2 will be rebranded as 'The Queen's Terminal'. Queen Elizabeth will open the building herself - just as she did the original Terminal 2 in 1955. The completion of the £2.5billion project, in conjunction with the relatively new Terminal 5 that opened in 2008, gives Heathrow two modern terminals. It is part of an £11billion refurbishment designed to keep London's biggest airport competitive with other major European hubs including Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris. The Slipstream sculpture is the centrepiece of the development, hanging 18m above the ground with a design intended to evoke the path of a plane in flight . Luxurious: With London increasingly becoming a destination of choice for the world's super-rich, Terminal 2 will have no shortage of pricey shops . World of possibility: A construction worker puts the finishing touches to a sign at Terminal 2, which is to be rebranded 'The Queen's Terminal' when it opens this summer . The Queen's Terminal will host 26 airlines, including United, Air Canada, Singapore Airlines and others that are part of the global Star Alliance, and offer flights to 51 destinations. Of course, with London increasingly becoming a destination of choice for the world's super-rich, Terminal 2 will have no shortage of pricey shops. Officials say Terminal 2 will be the first in the world to offer a 'complimentary personal shopping lounge where trained stylists will present a curated range of products for each client.' The interior of the new terminal is dominated by a huge aluminium sculpture hanging 18m above the ground that is inspired by the flight path of a stunt place. British artist Richard Wilson's 'Slipstream' weighs 77 tonnes and is 78m in length, its vast bulk looming above the terminal's main lobby and escalators, evoking the journeys that those who see it are set to embark on.

Airport officials chastened by the chaos that plagued the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008 are planning a 'soft' opening of the new terminal . Only one flight is planned the first day so, even if things go awry, the number of people affected will be small . The new terminal will gradually be brought to full capacity over six months . Chastened by the problems that plagued the opening of Terminal 5, which included chaos when the luggage handling system broke down, airport officials are planning a 'soft' opening of the new terminal. Only one flight is planned the first day so, even if things go awry, the number of people affected will be small. The new terminal will gradually be brought to full capacity over six months. Queues at the old Terminal 2: The old, overcrowded terminal building had stood since the Fifties . Old fashioned: The building suffered from poor design and a lack of natural light, problems exacerbated by its handling far more passengers than it was ever intended to . Passengers try to sleep on uncomfortable seats at Terminal 2 after the UK's then newly privatised air traffic control system crashed . Heathrow officials say they are still pushing to build a controversial third runway, which is opposed by London Mayor Boris Johnson and influential environmental groups. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's development director, said the completion of the new terminal shows Heathrow has complied with the last Labour government's directive that Heathrow should improve without growing. 'Our challenge now is to make the case to expand,' he said, admitting that getting permission would be 'politically complex.' Mr Holland-Kaye said private money is available to pay for a third runway, which would greatly add to Heathrow's capacity. He also claimed the new Terminal 2 would reduce the 'stacking' problem over Heathrow that often causes delays as planes await permission to land.","The new Terminal 2 is to be rebranded to become 'The Queen's Terminal' when it opens on June 4 .

"By . Steph Cockroft . The stopped watch, pipe and other last possessions of a First World War hero have gone on display 99 years after his death. The belongings of 36-year-old Harold Llewellyn Twite include his mud-encrusted watch which was stopped at 8pm on 1 December 1915 - the exact moment he was killed by a German mine in the Somme region, northern France. But the objects, covered in the mud from the tunnels in which Lieutenant Twite died, were only discovered 99 years later because his heartbroken widow Lucy Muriel Twite was too distressed to look at them. The watch worn by Lieutenant Twite was frozen at 8pm on 1 December 1915, the exact moment he was killed by a German mine. The watch lay untouched for 99 years after his widow was too heartbroken to look at it . His grandson David Chilcott found the sacred items just this year and has donated them to the St Agnes Museum in Cornwall, in Lieutenant Twite's home village. After his death, Lieutenant Twite's surviving comrades scoured the French frontline where he fought to gather his kit bag, letters, binoculars and other belongings. Harold Llewellyn Twite, who was killed on 1 December 1915, aged 36, by a German mine . They then posted them back to Sutton, Surrey, where Lieutenant Twite's family was living at the time. But his widow could not bear to open the parcel and his daughter had just a brief look before it was packed away. The mementos then lay untouched, covered in the mud from the Somme tunnels in which he had battled, for nearly a century. It was then only this year that Lieutenant Twite's grandson David Chilcott, also from Cornwall, stumbled across them. Lieutenant Twite was working overseas as a mining engineer when war was declared. He returned home to sign up and was seconded to the 183rd (Tunnelling) Company of the Royal Engineers. An expert in digging tunnels and sinking shafts, Lieutenant Twite was put in charge of a team of Cornish miners. The team's job was to tunnel under the German trenches in northern France to lay explosives. His team had just retreated in December 1915, after setting a series of charges, when the enemy detonated a huge mine. The blast killed him and four of his fellow countrymen. After Lieutenant Twite's death fighting in the Somme region of northern France, his pipe and binoculars were sent back to his widow, who was living in Sutton, Surrey at the time, by his comrades . They are buried in Citadel New Military Cemetery at Fricourt, a village on the Somme, near Albert. Lieutenant Twite's widow commissioned a memorial plaque in her local church to honour her husband and his dead comrades. She also wrote to their families to pay her respects. When the items were found, Mr Chilcott donated them . to the St Agnes Museum where they will feature as part of a memorial . exhibition, marking the Great War's centenary. Museum spokeswoman Liz Thompson said the personal nature of the items offered a tangible reminder of the terrible loss suffered by soldiers' families. A page from the sketch book of another unnamed First World War hero, which is also on display at the exhibition . These sketches from the First World War, taken from an unknown person's sketchbook, will also be on display at the exhibition . She said: 'His widow never opened it, . his daughter looked at it once, and his grandson, David Chilcott, . generously offered it to us. We were amazed when David brought it in. 'Among the possessions are his shirt, pipe and mud-encrusted watch, stopped at precisely 8pm, the time of his death. 'There is a letter to his widow, written by a fellow officer from the battlefield, and a great deal of correspondence.' The exhibition will also include a sketch pad containing drawings from an unknown artist. In late 1914, it became clear that new tactics were needed for both sides to break through the enemy's entrenched positions. So the British Army employed companies of engineers to start digging attacking tunnels under the enemy lines. Tunnelling would involve digging under the enemy lines, placing explosives in the tunnels and blowing them up. Once a tunnel was discovered, it would be destroyed by the enemy. For the infantry above ground, the wait . for underground explosions was nerve-wracking. For the men underground, the explosions often meant sudden death. It became a good way of moving into an enemy territory. But there was a constant struggle to . find the areas where the conditions were most favourable - and to rebuild in areas which had been targetted by the enemy. As the two sides created tunnels and counter tunnels, there were many underground encounters. Sometimes . a tunnelling team would break into an enemy position and meet the . enemy underground. This would lead to fighting in the tunnels.","The mud-encrusted timepiece stopped at 8pm on December 1915, the exact moment Harold Llewellyn Twite was killed in action in northern France .

"By . Mark Duell . Outside court: Pc Lee Birch, 31, is charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and misconduct in a public office, which he denies . A police officer unlawfully Tasered a naked man who threw a pair of underpants at him during a strip search, a court heard today. Pc Lee Birch, 31, shot Daniel Dove in his bare chest in a cell at Melksham Police Station in Wiltshire - having earlier arrested him outside Moo Moo nightclub in Trowbridge. Mr Dove was charged with being drunk and disorderly and assaulting Pc Birch and a second officer, though the case against him was later dropped. Birch was then charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and misconduct in a public office, which he denies. Prosecuting, Robin Shellard told a jury at Bristol Crown Court that Birch had used the ‘prohibited weapon’ on December 23, 2012, in a way that was not ‘necessary, lawful or proportionate’. ‘Mr Dove had been taken to a police station in Melksham, where he was placed in a cell and subjected to a strip search,’ Mr Shellard said. ‘During the course of the strip search, when he was naked, a Taser was used against him by Pc Birch. It affected his bodily functions, made him collapse to the ground and curl up in a ball.’ The court was told Mr Dove had been ejected from Moo Moo nightclub by doormen, who asked Birch and Pc David Read to attend at 2am. Mr Dove allegedly punched Birch during his arrest and repeatedly kneed Pc Read in the groin - claims he strenuously denies. The officers, of Wiltshire Police, then took Mr Dove to Melksham Police Station, where he was booked into the custody suite. A strip search was authorised and began in a police cell, with Birch - who had taken the Taser from his holster and placed it behind his back - and two other officers attending. ‘Mr Dove, then having taken his trousers off, takes his socks off and so it is that Mr Dove is in the cell with three officers, wearing nothing but a pair of boxers,’ Mr Shellard said. Location: Pc Birch shot Daniel Dove in his bare chest in a cell at Melksham Police Station (pictured) in Wiltshire . ‘Mr Dove kneels down to take his boxers off, therefore being compliant. As he does so, Pc Birch moves forward to take the boxer shorts. ‘As he does so, and as Mr Dove rises, Mr Dove flicks the boxer shorts at the police officers. They strike Pc Birch to the side of the face. ‘Pc Birch produces the Taser and without any warning at all, he fires the Taser into the chest of the naked Mr Dove.’ CCTV footage of the incident shows Birch ripping the boxers from Mr Dove and throwing them against the wall of the police cell. The officer is then heard to shout: ‘You have assaulted me for the second time.’ Mr Dove was left ‘prostrate on the ground’ while Birch removed the prongs of the Taser from his chest. Mr Shellard said the use of the Taser did not amount to ‘reasonable force’, as Birch was accompanied by two officers, with others yards away in the custody suite. ‘You ought to consider very carefully whether or not Mr Dove was acting in such a way that Pc Birch felt necessary to do what he did, and whether Pc Birch was, in fact, acting in lawful self defence,’ Mr Shellard told the jury. Mr Dove, who was the first witness in the trial, told the jury he had been assaulted by Birch and Pc Read during his arrest and pushed down into a puddle on the street. Inside: Officers took Mr Dove to the police station, where he was booked into the custody suite (file picture) He also insisted Birch had overly tightened his handcuffs, causing him pain in his wrists. But Mr Dove said he had co-operated fully with bouncers and police officers during his arrest and at the police station until the strip search. ‘I was compliant the whole time I was in . that cell, I wasn't violent at all,’ Mr Dove said. ‘He [Birch] asked me . to get naked, which I did. I did feel I had shown enough so they knew I . had nothing on me. 'He asked me to get naked, which I did. I did feel I had shown enough so they knew I had nothing on me' Daniel Dove on Pc Birch . ‘When he asked me to do it, I did feel quite embarrassed. I took my pants off and flicked them at him, towards his face. I was annoyed at him.’ Mr Dove said he received no warning that Birch was armed with a Taser and that he was prepared to use it. ‘As soon as I flicked my pants at him, he pulled his arm up from behind his back and shot me with a Taser,’ Mr Dove said. ‘By the time I had seen it, I had no time to react or move. I couldn't hide anywhere, I was in a police station so couldn't run off. There was a lot of pain.’ Colleagues of Birch told the jury Mr Dove had posed a threat to officers and been ‘aggressive’ while in the custody suite. Hearing: Bristol Crown Court (pictured) was told that Mr Dove had been ejected from a nightclub by doormen, who asked Birch and Pc David Read to attend at 2am . The court heard a full strip search was necessary as Mr Dove had previously been found with cannabis in his jeans in 2009. Pc James Rossiter said he stood behind Birch at the custody desk and in the police cell due to Mr Dove's behaviour. Police procedure is for a suspect to remove the upper half of their clothing for inspection, then replacing it before the bottom half is removed to protect their dignity, the court was told. 'He appeared very calm and not het up at all. I heard him say ""you shouldn't have hit me in the face with your boxers""' Pc Paul Brewster on Pc Birch . ‘His reaction was rather than taking off the top half he just took everything off,’ Pc Rossiter said. ‘He pulled his boxer shorts down, he assaulted Pc Birch by flicking him in the eye with his boxer shorts. It was a flick in the eye with the boxer shorts, then immediately Pc Birch pulled out his Taser and Tasered him.’ In cross-examination, Stephen Mooney, representing Birch, asked: ‘He was demonstrating an obvious risk to those around him?’ Pc Rossiter replied: ‘Definitely, yes.’ Another colleague, Pc Paul Brewster said Pc Birch had been ‘dead-pan and calm’ after discharging the Taser. ‘He appeared very calm and not het up at all,’ Pc Brewster said. ‘I heard him say “you shouldn't have hit me in the face with your boxers”.’ The trial continues.

"By . Steph Cockroft . Customers claim a JD Wetherspoon pub hung Union Jacks on England's national day in case non-English people found the St George's flag offensive. Drinkers at The Saxon Shore in Herne Bay, Kent, blasted the move as 'political correctness gone mad' after staff decided not use England's red and white flag in favour of the United Kingdom's. When angry customers asked why the pub was decorated in Union Jacks, they claim staff told them that the St George's flag 'might offend'. Outrage: Customers were furious after the Saxon Shore pub, in Herne Bay, Kent, hung Union Jack flags - representing the United Kingdom - instead of the St George's flag, to celebrate England's national day . Dental nurse Sam Gurney, 29, said she was 'gobsmacked' after she saw the St George's Day promotion while drinking with friends at the JD Wetherspoon pub. She said: 'Being quite a patriotic person, I thought ""Oh my God, why have they got the Union Jack instead of the St George?"" 'I asked the manager and she said, ""don’t go there"". Apparently it was the Union Jack or nothing - I was completely gobsmacked. 'She said the policy was there because of fears the St George’s flag might offend people, which is just political correctness gone mad. 'It annoys me because when it was St Patrick’s Day, they made a big deal out of it flying Irish flags, hats and shamrocks but yet we can’t celebrate our national day. 'The Union Jack doesn’t make sense as Scotland are voting to break away. I’m pretty sure they won’t be flying it on St Andrew’s Day or St David’s Day.' The Saxon Shore pub has now replaced the Union Jack flags with St George's flags. A spokesman for JD Wetherspoon said hanging Union Jacks was a tradition and was not done to stop offence being caused . After posting her disgust on Facebook, Miss Gurney received support from other drinkers. Shirley Turner posted: 'Wetherspoons ought to be ashamed of themselves. 'St George is the patron saint of England, so for St George's Day fly the cross of St George which is the English flag. Simple!' Katherine KJ Baxter added: 'Yet they’ll still fly the cross to show support to the English football team. How does that work then?' Pub manager Hayley Bates said she understands why drinkers have questioned the decision to use the Union Jack, but said the pub had always used those flags. She said: 'I can see her point, but we have always used the Union Jack to celebrate St George’s Day and it has never been an issue before. 'She started questioning it and she also said we should make a bigger deal out of St George’s Day than St Patrick’s, which I agree with. 'But I’ve been at Wetherspoons for eight years and nothing has changed in that time.' A JD Wetherspoon spokeswoman denied the Union Jack flags were put up through fear of offending customers with the English national flag. She said: 'They have got St George's flags up now, they were put up today. 'It was something which was done every year, it was the decorations they always had. 'Nobody had ever pointed it out before, so now they have changed the decorations. We like to please our customers.' But some people DO know how to celebrate St George's Day!

"By . Tara Brady . Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez left behind an unpublished manuscript that he chose not to print while he was alive . Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez left behind an unpublished manuscript that he chose not to print while he was alive. Cristobal Pera, editorial director of Penguin Random House Mexico, said that Garcia Marquez's family has not yet decided whether to allow the book to come out posthumously, or which publishing house would get the rights. Colombian-born Garcia Marquez died at his Mexico City home on April 17. The manuscript has a working title of 'We'll See Each Other in August' (En Agosto Nos Vemos). An excerpt of the manuscript published in Spain's La Vanguardia newspaper contains what appears to be an opening chapter, describing a trip taken by a married woman in her 50s who visits her mother's grave on a tropical island every year. In the chapter, she has an affair with a man of about the same age at the hotel where she stays. The erotic tone of the work is heightened by the island's tropical charm, with deftly drawn touches of the heat, the landscape, music, and local inhabitants. The manuscript apparently dates to about the time Garcia Marquez was writing his last novel, Memories of my Melancholy Whores, which was published in 2004, and deals with similar themes of forms of love; Garcia Marquez, beset by a failing memory, apparently did not write much in recent years. '""I'm not going to write anymore,"" Garcia Marquez told Mexican writer Homero Aridjis in 2005. Garcia Marquez biographer Gerald Martin said the manuscript apparently started as a short story. 'This has come as a surprise to me. 'The last time I talked to Gabo about this story it was a stand-alone which he was going to include in a book with three similar but independent stories,' Martin said. The Bogota Symphony Orchestra performed Mozart's 'Requiem' in the capital's colonial-era cathedral to remember Gabriel Garcia Marquez . 'Now they're talking about a series of episodes in which the woman turns up and has a different adventure each year,' he wrote in an email. 'Obviously it makes sense and presumably Gabo really did play with it, presumably some years ago.' In Bogota, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos presided over a musical tribute held in Garcia Marquez's honor. A guest leaving a memorial service for Gabriel Garcia Marquez plays in yellow paper butterflies outside the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico City . The Bogota Symphony Orchestra performed Mozart's 'Requiem' in the capital's colonial-era cathedral yesterday, which was decorated with thousands of roses in yellow, the author's favorite color. The ceremony also included a performance of the accordion-heavy vallenato music Garcia Marquez loved and which accompanied him in 1982 when he was awarded in Stockholm the Nobel prize for literature. Around Colombia, a marathon public reading of Garcia Marquez's No one writes to the Colonel is planned today at 1,400 public libraries. The Culture Ministry has distributed 12,000 copies of the book for the occasion. Colombia's government will also unveil at a book fair next week details of a $100,000 literary prize bearing the author's name that will annually honour the best short story written in Spanish. In Cuba, the state news agency Prensa Latina announced that this year's Havana Film Festival will be dedicated to the author. Garcia Marquez was a longtime friend of former leader Fidel Castro and also a major backer of Cuba's marquee international cinema bash, held every December. Festival official Ivan Giroud says Garcia Marquez's family was told of the decision to honor him. Fidel Castro, now retired, sent a floral offering to Mexico City's Palacio de Bellas Artes, where a ceremony was held on Monday night in the writer's honor. Cuban state television broadcast images on Tuesday of the white-and-yellow-flowered arrangement. 'To a dear friend,' read a silk sash.

"By . Alan Roden . Alex Salmond marks St George's Day today by 'lovebombing' England in a desperate bid to boost support for the break-up of Britain. The First Minister will venture over the Border as far as Carlisle to make a speech claiming that a 'strong and enduring friendship' will still endure across the British Isles if Scotland votes to leave the UK in September. In a speech at Carlisle Cathedral, Mr . Salmond will insist that people could still live in England and work in . Scotland if there is a Yes vote - ignoring warnings of passport controls . and separate currencies. First Minister Alex Salmond is using a speech in Carlisle to claim that a 'strong and enduring friendship' will still endure across the British Isles if Scotland votes to leave the UK in September . At the same time David Cameron uses . the English patron saint's day to urge his countrymen to embrace both . Scots and the Union. The Prime Minister issued his own St George's Day message, stressing England's role in creating the enduring 'family of nations' that is the UK. Both politicians are desperate to win the battle of 'hearts' in a referendum debate that has so far been dominated by economic claims and counter- claims. Mr Salmond will also unveil plans for 'economic co-operation' with the North of England. Support for the Union is strong in the Borders and many living in and around Carlisle have friends and family who can vote in the referendum. He will tell them: 'The ties that bind the nations of these islands will continue and flourish after Scotland becomes independent. You will remain Scotland's closest friends, as well as our closest neighbours. Following independence, the social union between the peoples of these islands will remain. 'People would still live in Annan and work in Carlisle, or live in Penrith and work in Lockerbie. Friends and family would continue to visit each other. We would still watch many of the same television programmes. Scots should not presume that 'free and unfettered' access to all BBC services would continue if there is a Yes vote in the referendum, a former member of the corporation's governing body has warned. Jeremy Peat, who has served as a member of the BBC Trust, claimed that if Scotland left the UK a deal would have to be done. Otherwise, he said, digital television services might be 'cut off' just over the Border, 'so essentially there could be a removal of access for the great majority to that television'. The Scottish Government's White Paper on independence claims 'Scottish viewers and listeners should continue to have access to all their current channels' with 'no additional cost to viewers and listeners as a consequence of independence'. But others say that Scots might have to pay more. Mr Peat said that while Scotland, like Ireland, might continue to have access to most BBC services: 'I think the phrase that is used is that it is on a commercial basis.' 'People from Scotland and England would still celebrate personal unions - by getting married in Carlisle Cathedral or perhaps by going to Gretna instead. 'On Monday, there were gun salutes in Stirling, Edinburgh and London to mark the Queen's birthday. 'That would continue, since we would still share a monarchy with the rest of the United Kingdom - just as we did for a century before the parliamentary union of 1707, and just as 16 other Commonwealth countries do now.' The First Minister recently ridiculed the Prime Minister for using a speech in London to focus on Scottish independence, even though he, too, has now decided he wants to address an English audience. The flag of St George is flying at 10 Downing Street today, and Mr Cameron has issued his own message to mark England's national day. He said: 'I want us to reflect on one of England's greatest achievements: its role in the world's greatest family of nations - the United Kingdom. In just five months, the people of Scotland will go to the polls and decide whether they want to remain a part of this global success story. 'So let's prove that we can be proud of our individual nations and be committed to our union of nations because, no matter how great we are alone, we will always be better together.' In a key speech at London's Olympic velodrome earlier this year, Mr Cameron said losing Scotland would allow the light of this country - which has shone throughout the 'darkest times in human history' - to 'go out forever'. But Mr Salmond is desperate to claim that a 'social union' would still exist across the British Isles. Last year, he insisted: 'We will not become a foreign country, that's simply ridiculous. Does anyone think Ireland is a foreign country?' The First Minister has also claimed that a separate Scotland would abandon just one of its 'six unions' - the 'political union' between Scotland and the rest of the UK. He has argued that five other unions would remain intact: the 'currency union'; membership of the European Union, a defence union through NATO, the Union of the Crowns and a 'social union between the people of these isles'. David Cameron used his St George's Day message to issue a plea to keep the Union together . But last night Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: 'People in England will certainly recognise a dragon when they see it, particularly a toothless one. 'Meanwhile, the people of Scotland look forward to slaying the independence dragon on September 18.' A tirade of vile 'cybernat' abuse was unleashed yesterday at Margaret Thatcher after a 24-year-old quote by her was used as an argument for Scottish independence. Nationalist MSP Sandra White retweeted a picture of the former Prime Minister, who died last year, accompanied by her 1990 statement: 'We English, who are a marvellous people, are really very generous to Scotland.' The image, which went viral on the social networking site after being posted online by pro-independence supporter Iain MacPherson, was accompanied by a 'Yes' logo. Twitter user Charles Auchterlonie, whose profile picture includes a Yes logo, wrote: 'Pity we never got the chance to hang her from a lamp-post.' Other users followed suit, with Iain Cameron accusing Lady Thatcher of 'raping and pillaging this country'.","First Minister uses major speech in Carlisle to woo the English .

"By . Jennifer Newton . The worst drought in history to hit California has forced wildlife officials to give millions of young Chinook salmon a ride to the Pacific Ocean. With low water levels on the state's rivers, the fish are unable to complete their usual migration upstream. Over the next two months, officials are now planning to gather up an estimated 30 million salmon and transport them in tankers towards the ocean in a bid to help them with migration. After being transported some of the Chinnok salmon are dumped in a holding pen at the Mare Island Strait, California . The salmon are unable to complete their usual migration due to a severe drought in California . Workers from the California Department of Fish and Game move a pipe in place ready to release the fish . The young fish are often helped out with migration by state officials due to California's arid climate . The Department of Fish and Game often help out Chinook salmon migrate due to California's dry climate. But this is the first time they have been moved in such numbers with the Fishery Foundation of California also drafted in to help out. The fish will be taken from river hatcheries in Northern California to a spot on the lower Sacramento River near Rio Vista. A worker with the Fishery Foundation of California monitors the salmon that are being pumped into a holding pen . It is hoped that more than 30million Chinook salmon will be transported to the coast . A California Department of Fish and Game worker stands next to a tanker filled with fish . They will be transported in tanker trucks filled with river water and then released into holdings pens before being let out into the wild. It has been reported that it will take 275 truckloads to transport all of the fish and will cost around $800,000 (Â£475,426). The Chinook salmon are important to California's billion dollar commercial and recreational fishing industry. Andrew Hughan, spokesman for the stateâ€™s Department of Fish and Wildlife told the Los Angeles Times: 'It is a Herculean effort to avoid disaster in three years. It is reported that it will take 275 truckloads to transport all of the salmon . A barge filled with Chinook salmon prepares to release the fish into the Mare Island Strait in California . 'By disaster, I mean a collapse of the fishery industry; no commercial fishing and no recreational fishing.' The recent drought in California has been so severe that in January Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency due to increasing arid conditions, asking for a 20 per cent reduction in water use. So far the drought has caused reservoirs and rivers to dry up, putting household water usage at risk. Last year was the state's driest on record and it is said California has had the least amount of rainfall in its 163-year history.","Low water levels mean the Chinook salmon are unable to migrate upstream .

"By . Sam Webb . A junior doctor was 'out of his depth' when he operated on a pregnant woman who died after her ovary was removed by mistake, a tribunal heard today. Yahya Al-Abed said he felt 'confident' and 'capable' enough to perform the complicated procedure on Maria De Jesus, 32, at Queen's Hospital, Romford, Essex, after she was admitted with appendicitis. The fifth-year trainee surgeon, who had worked at the hospital for less than three weeks, has admitted making a series of errors and now acknowledges he did not have enough experience when he performed surgery on October 23, 2011. Yahya Al-Abed (left) said he felt 'confident' and 'capable' enough to perform the complicated procedure on Maria De Jesus (right), 32, at Queen's Hospital, Romford, Essex . The mother-of-three died on the operating table 19 days later after suffering a miscarriage and undergoing a second procedure to remove her appendix. Senior surgical consultant, Dr Babatunde Julian Coker, has admitted failing in his role by not attending theatre to carry out the surgery himself or supervising the registrar. But his defence barrister, Neil Sheldon, has accused junior surgeons of keeping Mr Coker 'in the dark' in order to conduct the 'interesting and rare' operation themselves. Both doctors are facing fitness to practise proceedings at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, where they could face being struck off the medical register if the panel decide their actions amounted to misconduct. In his written statement to the General Medical Council, Mr Al-Abed said he 'felt confident' but now 'readily acknowledges he was out of his depth'. Loss: The family of Maria De Jesus. Husband Adelino, sons Pedro (right), Andre (left) and daughter Catarina with Maria's sister Ana Caldeira . Giving evidence, the medic added: 'At that time I felt I was capable to do this operation having done so many appendectomies, both supervised and unsupervised - that it's within my capabilities. 'Clearly this is not the case because I didn't have enough experience to operate on a pregnant woman.' The panel has heard that Mr Coker, the on-duty consultant, was in the coffee room while the surgery took place, but did not know the operation had occurred until he returned to work the next morning. Dr Yahya Al-Abed, a fifth-year trainee, had only been at the hospital for three weeks . Junior medics Osman Chaudhary and Christopher Liao, who are not facing charges, along with Mr Al-Abed, have been accused of deliberately withholding information from their boss. Mr Sheldon suggested to Mr Al-Abed: 'The truth of the matter is not that you didn't need supervision. It was really that you didn't want supervision for this operation. 'You didn't want him to be there did you? You wanted to do this interesting and rare surgery while unsupervised didn't you? 'And there was a deliberate decision from the very outset, including you, that Mr Coker wouldn't be told what his junior team were doing in this case.' Mr Al-Abed denied the allegation and explained he thought it was his 'duty' to conduct the operation as he was responsible for conducting emergency surgeries over that weekend. He even allowed second-year trainee Mr Chaudhary to begin the surgery after he asked to help, despite not being on duty and never having operated on a pregnant woman before. 'It was hard for me to refuse that. That help is always required, particularly on weekends because we are thin on weekends, Mr Al-Abed added. The tribunal has heard how Mrs De Jesus was admitted to hospital with severe abdominal pain on October 21, 2011, and was diagnosed with appendicitis two days later. Mrs De Jesus, who was 21-weeks pregnant, was told she needed an appendectomy and was added to Mr Al-Abed's list. During the procedure she began to bleed heavily and 'in the midst' of the bleeding the medic removed what he thought to be her appendix. Mrs De Jesus' condition failed to improve after the mistake was noticed and she died on the operating table at Queens Hospital, Romford, during a second operation 19 days later . Mrs De Jesus was discharged ten days after the Sunday October 23 operation, but returned to the Romford hospital on November 7, still in serious pain. Another doctor discovered that it was in fact her right ovary that had been removed instead of her appendix. She gave birth to a still-born boy and died on the operating table on November 11 following a second operation to remove the organ, the tribunal heard. The post-mortem concluded she had died of multiple organ failure brought on by septicaemia, the panel heard. Mr Coker, represented by Neil Sheldon, admits to failing to appropriately undertake his role in not attending or supervising the operation, but denies several other similar charges on the basis that his admission 'renders them redundant'. Mr Al-Abed, represented by David Morris, has admitted failing to inform the consultant, involving a junior doctor in the operation without having the experience to supervise him and removing the patient's ovary in error, leaving two outstanding factual matters for the panel to decide. The GMC do not allege that any of the doctors' failings led to their patient's death. If the panel, chaired by Carrie Ryan-Palmer, find any of the facts admitted or found proved amount to misconduct the medics could face sanctions ranging from conditions to erasure from the medical register. Recording a narrative verdict, an inquest in Walthamstow, east London, coroner Chinyere Inyama said a lost window of opportunity could have saved Mrs De Jesus. Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospitals Trust admitted liability for her death apologised to her family. The hearing continues.","Yahya Al-Abed admits he didn't have experience for complicated procedure .

David Cameron looked bronzed at an event today compared to his Chancellor George Osborne . The two men have not appeared together as a double-act since the general election, but took part in a question and answer session at the construction company Skanska in Rickmansworth . The two men appeared at the construction company Skanska in Rickmansworth, England. They claimed that more than 200 rail, road, local transport, broadband, airport and waste management projects are due to start construction over the next year. Flood defences are also on the list after a winter of devastating weather left several areas under water. However, Labour dismissed the announcement, claiming it amounted to just 10 per cent of the £375 billion of infrastructure investment announced in December. Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne announced £36billion worth of major building projects which will start this year . The dramatic return to economic growth and tumbling unemployment numbers has given the Conservative duo confidence to share a platform in front of the cameras . Mr Cameron jetted off to Lanzarote last week with his family, where he was seen relaxing in shorts and taking a dip in the sea. But in a moment of drama, the Prime Minister was stung by a jellyfish as he swum on the Spanish island's popular Arrieta beach. Tourists told how he came running out of the water in his blue swimming trunks rubbing his arm. Mr Cameron stayed with his wife Samantha and their three children at a £200-a-night yoga retreat at the resort.  They returned to the UK at the weekend. The Prime Minister has ordered a major push on projects to get Britain building. ‘Ensuring Britain has first class infrastructure is a crucial part of our long-term economic plan: supporting business, creating jobs and providing a better future for hardworking people,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘As a crucial part of our long-term economic plan, this Government is backing business with better infrastructure so that more jobs and opportunities are created for hardworking people, meaning more financial security and peace of mind for families.’ Mr Cameron spent last week sunning himself on the Spanish island of Lanzarote, where he was stung by a jellyfish while swimming . Mr Osborne added: ‘Because of the tough decisions we have taken in day-to-day spending, we can prioritise public investment where it is most needed and create the right conditions for private investment in infrastructure where it brings value for the taxpayer. ‘So this year over 200 new projects worth an estimated £36 billion are due to start, creating thousands of jobs, securing future growth and delivering the world class infrastructure Britain deserves.’ The £36 billion estimate is made up of £5 billion in public investment, £21 billion private and £10 billion in joint funding. But Labour’s shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie said: ‘We need action not words on infrastructure if we're to get a recovery built to last. ‘Under David Cameron and George Osborne, despite multiple infrastructure plans and reheated announcements like today's, infrastructure output in the economy is down more than 10%. ‘The Government's overall infrastructure pipeline in December showed fewer than a quarter of projects 'in construction'. ‘We are seeing the lowest peacetime level of house-building since the 1920s and more cuts are planned to capital spending next year. ‘Investors need certainty and delivery, not just another load of warm words.’","Prime Minister and Chancellor side-by-side for the first time since election .

Mr Farage launched Ukip’s campaign for the European Parliament elections on May 22 in Sheffield today. It includes a controversial £1.5million poster campaign which urges voters: ‘Take back control of our country.’ The 2014 Ukip manifesto – titled ‘Create an earthquake’ – declares: ‘We want our country back. Don’t you?’ It features a full-page picture of Miss Vaid, with a large quote stating: ‘I’ll be voting Ukip because they’re the only party listening to what people want.’ However, she works in London and on her Twitter account she describes herself as ‘UKIP Events Manager and Assistant to Nigel Farage, as well as a lover of social occasions’. It also emerged that Miss Vaid appeared on another leaflet earlier this year aimed at voters in the Wythenshawe and Sale East by-election. Embarrassingly, only last week she tweeted a link to a story about Labour ‘distributing false leaflets about Ukip’. Controversial: . Ukip's new posters are being funded by £1.5m of funding from . millionaire ex-Tory donor Paul Skyes to launch its biggest ever . publicity drive ahead of the European Parliament elections in May . Adverts: Under the slogan 'take back control of . our country', the party complain that 75 per cent of British laws are made . in Brussels and that UK taxpayers fund the 'celebrity lifestyle' of EU . bureaucrats . Mr Farage faced difficult questions about the apparent attempt to use a member of Ukip staff to pose as a voter. ‘I . don’t think you’d ask this question of the Labour party, the Lib Dems . or the Conservatives who often have group pictures,’ he told Sky News. ‘You know, the leader with 25 people standing behind them. And you never ask to see the CV of any of those.’ He went on: ‘The fact that Lizzie Laid is half-Indian and works for us is as far as we are concerned a non-issue. ‘She . is somebody in our promotional material who is going to vote Ukip. She . joined Ukip, she got a job with Ukip because she believes in what we . stand for. What on earth is wrong with that?’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage was put on the spot today about whether his German wife had taken a job which could have gone to a Brit. BBC political editor Nick Robinson challenged him to explain why he employed Kirsten as a secretary on a taxpayer-funded salary from Brussels. Mr Farage insisted that 'nobody else could do that job', which included checking emails for him at midnight. ‘She came here as a highly skilled person earning a high salary paying a very large amount of tax,’ the UKIP leader insisted. ‘I don’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going through emails and getting me briefed for the next day. It’s a very different situation to a mass of hundreds of thousands of people coming in and flooding the lower end of the labour market.’ Asked whether a British person could take the position as his secretary, Mr Farage insisted: ‘Nobody else could do that job, not unless they were married to me.’ Mr Farage said his wife earned a ‘very modest’ wage and worked ‘extremely unsociable hours’ for ‘up to’ seven days a week. Ukip leader Nigel Farage contrasted the dinner at Chequers with his own trip to Sheffield today to launch his controversial posters . Mr Farage told MailOnline voters on May 22 could deliver a 'severe shock and maybe even a political earthquake' David Cameron is hosting arch-Eurocrat . Herman Van Rompuy for dinner at Chequers tonight, just weeks before . crucial European elections. The . Tory leader will dine with the President of the European Council, who . is also due to stay the night at the Prime Minister’s official rural . retreat. Nigel Farage said . the timing of Mr Cameron’s intimate meal with the Brussels bureaucrat . ‘could not be better’ as Ukip prepared to unveil a £1.5million poster . campaign attacking immigration from the EU. The Prime Minister's official . spokesman said: 'This is one of a number of meetings that President Van . Rompuy is having with heads of government around Europe. 'It is an opporunity to talk around the future direction of the next European Commission and EU reform priorities. 'Also I am sure they will discuss the latest on the situation in Ukraine. It is a working dinner.' The . spokesman confirmed Mr Van Rompuy would also be staying the night: 'If . someone is coming for dinner in the evening, it is polite to ask them to . stay the night.' However, he refused to be drawn on whether he would be served a continental breakfast tomorrow morning. Asked why Miss Vaid is not described . as a Ukip staff member in the manifesto, Mr Farage replied: ‘I don’t see . the need. You’re going down this media route, do you want us to say the . religion of all our candidates? ‘Or . do you want us to say we are living in the United Kingdom, wherever we . come from, whatever religion we are, we are part of this country and we . are all in this together. You seem to be wanting to segment people out. ‘I . can't really win with you, can I? On the one hand you're saying that we . are talking about a white working class in Britain, and secondly, when I . tell you that working directly for me is a girl who is half-Indian, . you've got a problem with that too? Just make your mind up. I don't mind . being criticised, but do make your mind up what the criticism is...’ The interview with Sky News presenter . Kay Burley divided opinion, with many viewers complain that it had been . unfair on Mr Farage. Mr . Farage also denied the new poster campaign is racist. The party has paid . for billboards across the country to be emblazoned with messages such . as: ‘26million people in Europe are looking for work. And whose jobs are . they after?’ Another has a . picture of a construction worker begging on the street, with the . slogan: ‘EU policy at work. British workers are hit hard by unlimited . cheap labour.’ ‘It is the . job of the British government firstly to defend the realm, and secondly . to put the interests of the people that live in this country first. ‘That's . what we should be doing, and I'm afraid we've turned our backs on that . over the course of the last few years which has led to much, much . unhappiness among millions of families.’ He . told ITV News: ‘The Westminster political elite have opened up our . borders to levels of immigration Britain's never seen and they decry . anybody that wants to talk about it as racist. ‘They've . done it for years. They've tried to sweep this whole issue under the . carpet and we're talking about it openly and honestly.’ All the posters call on voters to ‘Take Back Control of Our Country’ by backing Ukip in the European elections. Tory MP Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, wrote on Twitter: ‘At a time when our country really needs to come together, the Ukip advertising campaign is deeply divisive, offensive and ignorant.’ Labour frontbencher Jon Ashworth said: ‘UKIP would have us believe they stand for working people but the truth is very different - they're even more right wing than the Tories. ‘A vote for UKIP is a vote for higher taxes for working families, charges to see your GP, huge tax giveaways for the rich and even deeper cuts to public services. Only Labour can make Britain better off.’ Senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott said the posters were ‘extreme even by the standards of the Front Nationale’, the French far right party Mr Farage has tried to distance Ukip from.","Lizzy Vaid poses as a voter from Devon but works for Ukip in London .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A Jamaican-born lollipop man has been sacked after calling a black council colleague 'King Kong' and 'monkey' during a row. Jon Seymour, 46, started arguing with the unnamed official after he asked him to lower his voice as he spoke on the phone at Camden Town Hall in London. He claimed he had been trying to arrange a refund because a parking meter had swallowed £4 of his change when the man 'interrupted his conversation'. Dismissed: Jon Seymour has been sacked after calling a black council colleague 'King Kong' and 'monkey' Scene: Mr Seymour, 46, started arguing with the unnamed official after he asked him to lower his voice as he spoke on the phone at Camden Town Hall (pictured) in London. He claimed the man had 'interrupted' him . This led to a heated argument, during which Mr Seymour used 'aggressive' language, including the words 'King Kong' and 'monkey', before being escorted from the building by two security officers. Mr Seymour, who had worked as a lollipop man for 20 years, was instantly dismissed by Camden Council after a disciplinary hearing ruled he had committed gross misconduct. But despite handing in his pole and uniform, he has insisted he was not being racist and has vowed to appeal against the dismissal. Mr Seymour, from Kentish Town, North London, said today: 'It was not racial. He was getting all angry so it was like he was acting like he . was a big strong gorilla, so that's why I called him King Kong. Job: During his career, Mr Seymour had helped children cross the road outside Carlton Primary School (above) in Kentish Town. But he was instantly dismissed by Camden Council after committing 'gross misconduct' 'My mum is black, I'm black. It is not being racist. It was nothing to do with his colour. No one looks like King Kong. 'I apologised to him and we shook hands after, but Camden wanted to take it further for some reason.' Following the incident in King's Cross last July, the council arranged an internal disciplinary hearing. Vow: Despite handing in his pole and uniform, he has insisted he was not being racist and has vowed to appeal against the dismissal . It ruled that that Mr . Seymour, who had helped children cross the road outside Carlton Primary School in Kentish Town, was in . breach of the town hall's code of conduct for staff. An internal report seen by the Evening Standard, said: 'All witnesses confirmed Mr Seymour used the words ""King Kong"" and ""Monkey"".' Louise . McBride, who chaired the hearing, said: 'I am satisfied, on the basis . of the information obtained during the investigation, that this . complaint is upheld on the basis that your behaviour was both physically . and verbally aggressive and threatening and that you used insulting . language.' But Mr Seymour has claimed he will launch an appeal against the decision, saying: 'I'm not going to leave it lying. I want people to know what Camden is about.' He added: 'I think what they did to me was wrong. I've been there almost 20 years and never had a warning. I haven't had any problems with anyone else.' If successful, the appeal would see a group of . councillors set up a panel to look into the case. Camden . Council spokesman Steve Shawcross said the row had been a 'potentially . physical altercation' which had been 'aggressive in nature'. Mr Seymour's conduct had been filmed on CCTV and this evidence formed part of the disciplinary process, he said. The . council said in a statement: 'Camden has a code of conduct which sets . out how staff are expected to behave towards the public and other . members of staff. 'We can confirm that a member of staff was dismissed from the council for gross misconduct. 'We are unable to comment further at this stage as the dismissal may be subject to an appeal to elected members.'","Jon Seymour, 46, started arguing with black official at Camden Town Hall .

Right, Sir Albert Bore, council leader, said Ofsted would likely not publish its final inspection reports until May . They also feature Adderley Primary School, Highfield Junior and Infant School, Nansen . Primary, Alston Primary School and Saltley School and Specialist Science . College, all in Saltley, Birmingham. They are among 25 schools under investigation by Ofsted over claims that Muslim hard-liners are seizing control of governing bodies, segregating male and female pupils and banning sex education. Birmingham . City Council published today a list of 18 schools which are under . investigation by Ofsted over the alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot. The institutions are: . Adderley Primary School, Saltley . Alston Primary School, Saltley . Golden Hillock School, Sparkhill . Gracelands Nursery School, Sparkbrook . Highfield Junior and Infant School, Saltley . Ladypool Primary School, Sparkbrook . Marlborough Junior School, Small Heath . Montgomery Primary Academy, Sparkbrook . Nansen Primary, Saltley . Ninestiles School, Acocks Green . Oldknow Academy, Small Heath . Park View School, Alum Rock . Regents Park Community Primary School, Small Heath . Saltley School and Specialist Science College, Saltley . Small Heath School, Small Heath . Washwood Heath Academy, Stechford . Waverley School, Bordesley Green . Welford Primary School, Handsworth . One school is even being investigated over allegations that the al Qaeda-linked Muslim preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who died in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, was praised in assembly. Sir Albert . Bore, council leader, said Ofsted was not intending to publish its . final inspection reports until 'the first or second week of May'. He added that he has not yet seen the draft version of the inspection reports, which have been carried out at the request of Education Secretary Michael Gove. In an investigation progress briefing today, Sir Albert also criticised the apparent leaking of an Education Funding Agency (EFA) report into three city academies to a national newspaper. He said the Government Cabinet Office is currently investigating how the document was obtained by the media. The 'Trojan Horse' allegations first came to light earlier this year, contained in an anonymous and unsigned letter. They have prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted. On Saturday, The Daily Telegraph reported that six of the schools at the centre of the iinquiry faced being placed in special measures. Sir Albert described the leaking of the EFA report as 'wholly reprehensible' - adding that one school had been inaccurately included in press articles when it was unconnected with the current inquiries. Although 25 schools are involved in three separate investigations into the plot, the city council's chief executive, Mark Rogers, said he was in 'no position' to identify the remaining seven schools because inquiries were still 'in the early stages'. The council’s investigation is being headed by former headteacher Ian Kershaw, who is sifting through about 200 concerns raised since the alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot emerged. Meanwhile,while the DfE has appointed its own education commissioner, the former head of the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit Peter Clarke.

Above, one of the schools, Gracelands Nursery School in Sparkbrook . Claims: The 'Trojan Horse' allegations came to light earlier this year. Above, Adderley Primary School in Saltley . Officials: The city council's chief executive, Mark Rogers (left), said today he was in 'no position' to identify the remaining seven schools. Right, Peter Clarke has been appointed as the DfE's education commissioner . The DfE announced Mr Clarke’s . appointment on April 15 - prompting dismay from teachers’ leaders, . Muslim community members and the chief constable of West Midlands Police . Chris Sims. They described it as 'desperately unfortunate', and a decision which would be misinterpreted by some people, given his anti-terror background. But the DfE said his experience of high-level investigations meant he was the right man to carry out his role effectively, while acting in a 'professional and dispassionate manner' Request: The inspections are being carried out at the direct request of Education Secretary Michael Gove . Mr Rogers said it was the council understanding that Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, had been over-seeing its inquiry for some time. He added that Sir Michael would likely publish an 'overview report' at the same time as the individual school reports were released. Both Mr Clarke and Sir Michael have separately spoken with the council in recent weeks - and Mr Rogers said he was still working 'to persuade' the latter to give the local authority 'early sight' of the Ofsted reports. It comes as the council has announced the make-up of its Trojan Horse review group, which Mr Kershaw will report to. It includes Kamal Hanif, the headteacher of Waverley Primary School - one of the schools which has been inspected by Ofsted - Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Hodge Hill, and David Urquhar, the Bishop of Birmingham, as well as an unnamed senior Muslim community member. Sir Albert said he had asked for a single joint investigation by the council, DfE and Ofsted - but 'for whatever reason, the Secretary of State (Michael Gove) decided he wanted to go it alone and appoint Peter Clarke'. He said: Ofsted and the Secretary of State will operate in whatever manner they so wish.' Mr Rogers added: 'We don’t condone the Secretary of State’s appointment, but one small part of explanation is we do expect Peter Clarke to have a wider brief than just Birmingham. so in one sense we can understand he might want separation. 'But the value of collaborating is clear. Nobody wants to have to go through the evidence three times or have multiple reports.'","Schools are at centre of alleged Islamist plot to take over state institutions .

A 21-year-old marketing executive has spoken of her horror after discovering photos from her Facebook page had been used to create fake dating profiles.

'I just felt shocked and, when I realised he had sent nude photos of other women from the neck down pretending to be me, I felt scared my reputation was on the line. 'Stuart Grant could have spoken to someone who thought it was genuinely me. It's quite scary to think someone can easily pretend to be me.' She said the unnamed IT worker had been chatting to a girl called Chelly on Facebook when he became suspicious and demanded proof that she was who she claimed to be. He asked for a photo of her holding up three fingers - and what he received was an image of Ms Livesey lying on her bed that had been clearly digitally altered .

"By . Kit Holden . Toni Kroos has today continued to rule out a move away from Bayern Munich, despite being urged by his former mentor Jupp Heynckes to stay at the club. Kroos, who has recent months been heavily linked with Manchester United in both England and Germany, is still yet to put pen to paper for a new deal with the reigning European Champions. Former Bayern coach Heynckes publicly advised Kroos to stay at the club this week. Not only was Heynckes the brains behind Bayern’s treble winning side last season, he was also the man who established Kroos as a star during his loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen several years ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Toni Kroos's best goals and see him appear in advert . Hands off: Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos has refused to rule out leaving the German giants . Contract talks: The German's deal runs out next summer and he has been linked with Man Utd and Arsenal . In an interview in today’s Bild, Kroos was full of praise for his former coach, saying that 'he is the most important coach I have ever worked with. His is one of a few opinions who I value very highly. It was great to hear what he thinks.' Nonetheless, the midfielder refused to rule out a move, insisting that 'it is my future, and my decision.' With Kroos’ contract expiring at the end of next season, Bayern are desperate to extend the deal, as they currently risk losing him on a free. The negotiations reportedly continue to stall over wages, however, and Bayern’s insistence on playing hard ball over details has evoked a great deal of interest from a number of clubs. Not only United, but also Arsenal and the top clubs in Spain have now been linked to the player. Most in Germany are still confident that Kroos will stay at Bayern, with TZ writing today that 'he would have no reason to leave'. But as Bayern move no closer to extending the deal, and both Arsenal and United likely to be raiding the transfer market in the coming months, the prospect seems increasingly realistic. Respected: Former Bayern boss Jupp Heynckes has urged the midfielder to sign a new deal at Bayern Munich . Kroos’ relationship with Guardiola has also been called into question this season, with public disagreements filling the sports pages. The player, though, praised his current coach’s preparation for tonight’s crunch Champions League tie with Real Madrid. 'He knows Madrid perfectly, and has advised us well. No one should have any doubts that we will be on our game'. Tension: Despite Kroos' praise of coach Pep Guardiola, rumours are rife the two don't get on very well .

Brendan Rodgers wants Liverpool to smash through the 100-goal barrier after they moved within touching distance of their first title since 1990. Liverpool opened a five-point lead on second-placed Chelsea with three games to go by beating Norwich 3-2 at Carrow Road thanks, in part, to an outstanding display from Raheem Sterling. Rodgers described the England forward as ‘arguably the best young player in Europe’ after he scored twice and set up the other for Luis Suarez, who became the first Liverpool striker since Ian Rush in 1986 to score 30 league goals in a season.

That means we can’t finish lower than third, which guarantees Champions League football. I don’t think anybody would have expected that and it shows the effort we’ve put in and the quality we’ve shown. We still have other goals. We’ve scored 96 now.

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . Former Manchester United chief executive David Gill is to play a bigger part than expected in the hunt for a manager to replace the axed David Moyes. Gill, whose decision to step down as United CEO around the time that Sir Alex Ferguson retired did the club no favours, has purposely given his successor Ed Woodward space and played no role in the last two transfer windows, despite remaining on the football club board. But Gill, who still represents United at Premier League meetings with Woodward, will be one of those closely consulted in the selection process. VIDEO Scroll down for End of an Era at United? Fans have their say about Moyes . Helping: David Gill will have a say in the next Manchester United manager . Leading the search: Man Utd Chief Executive Ed Woodward will head up the hunt for Moyes' successor . The search is being led by  Woodward, rather than the owning Glazer family, and the executive vice-chairman recognises that Gill’s extensive football knowledge has to be utilised, despite previous perceived tensions between them. United have mentioned carrying out due diligence on all candidates for the post. But that will be done internally rather than by bringing in headhunters. There may be rioting in Rio and warnings from Brazil midfielder Fernandinho of team buses being pelted with stones but England are confident enough about FIFA arrangements for the World Cup to include only four security personnel in their party. The prestigious Footballer of the Year award decided by football writers looks like going to prolific Liverpool scorer Luis Suarez or his talismanic captain Steven Gerrard. But unfortunately neither might be in the country to collect the trophy at the gala dinner on May 15, when Suarez is likely to be back in his native Uruguay and Gerrard will  be on a much-needed holiday before the  World Cup. The only previous occasions when the . footballer of the year , the most important individual award in the . game, hasn’t been feted in person were when Arsenal’s Robert Pires was . having knee surgery and Liverpool’s Terry McDermott was at a racecourse. Prize winner? Luis Suarez could miss the Footballer of the year awards if he wins . Not on our telly, Moyes . Axed Manchester United manager David Moyes was loosely sounded out by both BBC and ITV about being a World Cup pundit earlier in the season. But Moyes was concerned at the reaction of fans, with United having such a torrid time, about being seen working on TV when the transfer window had opened. Turn off: Moyes is unlikely to be as desirable as a World Cup TV pundit now he has been sacked . Talking a good game: Rio Ferdinand will be one of the pundits for the BBC . However, now Moyes no longer has the cachet of being Old Trafford boss, the TV offers might not be so forthcoming. BBC, who have Moyes’s arch critic Rio Ferdinand in their line-up as well as his former assistant coach Phil Neville, have no plans to add the ex-United boss to their team and ITV say it is unlikely they will. FA chairman Greg Dyke seems unperturbed about upsetting the Premier League by unveiling his England Commission findings during the last week of their season. The proposals will be outlined to an FA board meeting on May 7, four days before the final fixtures. Not afraid: FA chairman Greg Dyke will release the findings of his . Meanwhile, UEFA have started to contact clubs who have breached their financial fair play regulations, so Manchester City can expect a call any time soon. The latest FA financial figures don’t augur well for their huge task of persuading their 17,000 corporate seat-holders, who bankroll the Wembley business plan, to renew long-term deals, most of which expire in 2017. There has been a £2million fall in Club Wembley revenue from a decline in available  box sales. Wembley chief executive Roger Maslin blames the recession and is confident that sales will pick up. They have done so on the boxing front, with all seats and boxes sold for the George Groves v Carl Froch rematch on May 31, which will be watched by an 80,000 capacity crowd. Sky Sports are understood to have agreed with a surprisingly conciliatory BT Sport that neither of the networks should put out a press release announcing the pick selection for the European Rugby Champions Cup. That non-disclosure pact suited Sky a lot more as it prevented BT from trumpeting that they have picks 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 of English clubs in the group stages, leaving Sky with 4 and 6.","Gill to help United chief Woodward appoint next manager .

She hobnobbed with royalty, befriended the men of the Household Division and is responsible for some of the most iconic portraits of the Suffragette movement in existence. And yet, despite her many achievements, the incredible life and works of Christina Broom, the UK's first female press photographer remain relatively unknown. But all that could be about to change courtesy of the Museum of London, which recently acquired more than 2,500 Broom photographs and is to put a selection on display from next month.

The free exhibition, which concentrates on her images of the Great War, includes a rare shot of Rudyard Kipling's only son John who was killed at Loos aged 18, as well as many others. So who was Christina Broom? Born in 1862 in London's Chelsea, the future photographer lived a conventional life until a cricketing accident in 1903 left her husband Albert an invalid. Forced to become the main breadwinner for her family, Broom borrowed a box camera and started photographing street scenes with plans to turn her work into postcards. 'Her story is largely untold,' explains Anna Sparham, curator of photographs at the Museum of London. 'She became the breadwinner for her family after her husband was injured in a cricket accident and she had to earn a living for her daughter Winifred. 'She started by taking photographs of street views with a view to selling them but actually, the majority of her work took her in a different direction.'

On their way: Soldiers from the Household Battalion leaving for the Front bid farewell to their families on the platform at Waterloo Station in 1916 . Portrait of photographer: Christina Broom became a photographer in 1903 at the age of 40 . That direction proved to be an unusual one. Living close to the Chelsea Barracks, Broom soon found her way inside and began taking photos - both formally and informally - of the soldiers of the Household Cavalry who were based there. Just a year after beginning her career, Broom was appointed official photographer to the Household Division - a step that would lead to some of the most important images ever taken. By 1914, as war with Germany drew nearer, Broom had become firmly established, selling photographs to newspapers and magazines alike - many of which featured her soldier friends. 'Christina's wartime photographs actually cover a huge range of subject matter so within the war period, you do see her focus changing,' adds Sparham. 'At the beginning, you get people mobilising and then the activities going on through to the injured soldiers returning. 'She attends a tea party at Buckingham Palace that the King and Queen hold for wounded soldiers in 1916 and you really do get the sense from many of her images that she's an insider, she's part of the war and that this is her contribution.' Her meetings with King George V, both before, during and after the war, would prove a fateful one and the increasingly close relationship she enjoyed with the royal family led to some of her most impressive scoops. 'Because Christina is working within the . barracks, she becomes well known to the King and this leads to a . relationship where she's allowed great privileges and access to major . royal events and special occasions and also to the royal family quite . directly,' explains Sparham. 'She's given an exclusive commission with the Prince of Wales . and produces a lovely portrait of a very young prince. 'And she was the . only person allowed in to see King Edward VII when he died and was lying . in state. She was allowed into Westminster Abbey to photograph him at . 4am in the morning.' But her work wasn't all war and royalty. Some of her most famous images feature the Suffragette movement, then at its height, as well as society events such as the Oxford/Cambridge boat race.

'She seizes their attention and you always get a sense of . her relationship with her subjects, whether that's the suffragettes or . powerful soldiers going off to war.' Broom, adds Sparham, would have needed to be quite the character herself, as well as determined, as she pursued a career that was a far cry from the trajectory expected of a woman at the beginning of the 20th Century. 'Christina would have had to have been quite a determined lady,' says Sparham. 'She's described as quite formidable and I think to embrace the world of photography, which within her world was fairly unique, it would have been quite a brave thing to do.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Cancer costs Britain's economy more than £11billion a year in healthcare, including visits to doctors and medication . Cancer costs Britain’s economy more than £11billion a year in healthcare and time off work while sufferers fight the disease. Researchers say the economic cost of cancer reaches almost £100billion every year in Europe, with lung cancer battering the economy most overall. Although the shocking costs can be attributed to healthcare systems used to treat the deadly disease, cancer also affects other areas of the economy including productivity lost through early death and time off work. Britain spends £3.9billion on healthcare costs - visits to doctors, inpatient stays and medication - and £5.5billion due to productivity losses. A further £1.9billion is due to informal care costs - the monetary value of leisure or work time friends and relatives give up to care for cancer patients. Breast cancer had the highest healthcare costs - £4.8billion each year - accounting for 13 per cent of the total cancer healthcare costs in the EU. However, the highest total economic burden was attributable to lung cancer - a total of £15billion - with £8billion due to premature mortality. Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, of Oxford University said: ‘One of the purposes of studies such as this one is to enable comparisons to be made between the burden of different diseases, aiding decision makers to prioritise scarce research funds. ‘In order to be in a better position to inform policy decisions there is a great need for improved information on epidemiology, healthcare resource use and unit costs across the EU.’ Highest cost: Breast cancer had the highest healthcare costs - £4.8 billion each year - accounting for 13 per cent of the total cancer healthcare costs in the EU . Professor Peter Boyle, President of the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon, France, said: ‘It is essential that the economic impact of cancer on a community is known, understood and placed in its perspective. ‘The greatest single economic cost was £4.8billion for breast cancer. This should be placed in the perspective that the economic cost of pneumonia in the EU is £8billion each year. ‘The cost of cancer is not just the cost of drugs and hospital stays and this has been taken into account by Dr Luengo-Fernandez.’ The lowest healthcare cost for cancer was £25 per year spent on healthcare for every person in Lithuania, while the highest was Germany at £131. Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez said the study enables better informed policy decisions . Dr Luengo-Fernandez said: ‘The countries . with the highest per-capita costs in terms of cancer healthcare tend to . be Northern and Central European countries. ‘Those . with the lowest per-capita costs tend to be member states who joined . the EU in 2004 and have lower national income levels.’ Researchers from pharmaceutical company . Bristol-Myers Squibb in the US, collected data from the 2010 and 2011 EU . National Health and Wellness Surveys on 105,581 adults. They found relatives who cared for . cancer patients experienced worse physical and mental health, were more . likely to be absent from work, were more impaired in their activities . and had twice as many hospitalisations in six months than . non-caregivers. The report also found they were 50 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with depression and had double the odds of anxiety and insomnia, as well as higher odds of suffering from migraines, headaches or gastrointestinal problems. Dr Isabelle Gilloteau - presenting . the findings alongside Dr Luengo-Fernandez at the ESMO 2012 Congress of . the European Society for Medical Oncology in Vienna - said: ‘This study . underscores the importance of recognising caregiver burden, not just . because of the direct implications for the well-being and quality of . care of the patient with cancer, but also due to the extra burden it . brings to society overall.’ Prof . Boyle said: ‘The remarkable study of Dr Gilloteau and colleagues . provides unique information on the impact of cancer on care-givers. This . again is key information and is almost unique. ‘These studies provide a background on which logical funding decisions can be made.’","The economic burden of cancer costs almost £100billion every year in Europe .

"By . Bianca London . Sitting at your desk feeling stuffed following an indulgent Easter weekend? Join the club. A staggering 70 per cent of us chose to forgo any diets or attempts at healthy eating across the four-day Easter period, a new survey has revealed. Despite the summer months fast approaching, the survey highlighted that this Easter weekend, Brits made indulgent food and drink the priority. Remorse: A staggering 70 per cent of us let our diets slip this Easter weekend and are now embarking on our beach body countdown . The survey found that almost half of respondents (48 per cent) admitted that calorie-laden sweet treats like chocolate, hot cross buns and cakes were the thing they looked forward to the most at Easter - and 75 per cent of us confessed to bingeing on up to four chocolate eggs over the weekend. Tellingly, only 10 per cent of people said that they looked forward to celebrating Easter for the religious aspects. This highlights the seismic shift in attitudes: a move away from a religious celebration to one more focused on indulgence - but without observing Lent beforehand. A nation of chocoholics: Almost half of respondents admitted that calorie-laden sweet treats are the thing they look forward to the most at Easter - and 75 per cent of us confessed to bingeing on up to four chocolate eggs . The survey also found that over half (55 per cent) said that they stayed at home all weekend to indulge in food and drink and 23 per cent spent the weekend drinking alcohol. An indulgent 35 per cent of us admitted to sinking 10 or more alcoholic drinks this weekend, and in stark contrast, only 9 per cent of people spent their weekend doing outdoor activities, revealed the survey by LighterLife. In light of our overindulgence, today has been identified as the official date when many of us will start our beach body countdown. Insecurities: Only 4 per cent of British women think that they have a good beach body with one in ten admitting they lack confidence in their body . With only three months until the majority of the UK begin their holiday season, the fear of fitting into swimwear sets in and women embark upon a mission to get ready to reveal (almost) all on the beach. The research, by the Dukan Diet, revealed that only 4 per cent of British women think that they have a good beach body with one in ten admitting they lack confidence in their body. Furthermore, 20 per cent of women will not go swimming or havenâ€™t in the past due to feeling embarrassed about what they look like in swimwear.","Half of Brits most looked forward to sweet treats this weekend .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . The first word their child speaks is a moment all parents remember. But for Steph Ward, it was a particularly emotional - because it meant her son had survived gruelling surgery. Four-year-old Lyall woke up from the operation and uttered his word ever word - ""mummy”. Scroll down for video . Brave: Lyall Cookward, 4, couldn't speak before surgery to reconstruct his windpipe. When he came round from the operation, his first word was 'mummy' Lyall, who has Down’s Syndrome, suffered heart failure soon after birth and needed a risky operation - but was then diagnosed with a rare lung condition and spent six months in intensive care. He was expected to be on a ventilator long-term for life. But the youngster instead came off the machine, although he still relied on a tracheostomy opening his windpipe to help him breathe. This is a surgical procedure to create an opening in the neck at the front of the windpipe (trachea) - but it made it virtually impossible for Lyall to to speak. Although his airway had collapsed, Lyall’s surgeon suggested out he could carry out a full reconstruction. This involved grafting a piece of cartilage from Lyall’s rib onto his airway to strengthen it. Ms Ward and her partner Sharron Cook, of Leeds, West Yorkshire, agonised about whether he should have the risky surgery. Struggle: Before the surgery, it was expected that Lyall would be on a ventilator for life. But the youngster instead came off the machine, although he still relied on a tracheostomy opening his windpipe to help him breathe. Following surgery, he no longer needs this either . Ms Ward, a full-time mother, said: 'It was such a hard decision to make. Lyall was happy with his tracheostomy. He didn't seem to mind it at all. 'All the other operations he's had have been life-or-death, this one had to be our choice. 'Then we had to take into consideration the risks - the fact that the operation was taking place just milimetres away from his vocal chords, so we could lose what chance we had of hearing him speak. 'Also the operation could cause damage and affected his chance of eating properly. 'But we really wanted him to be free of the tubes and give him the chance to speak properly, to be able to communicate with his friends and play with them. 'Before, he wasn't able to get mucky like any other little boy because the tubes had to be kept clean.' The pair eventually decided to go ahead and he underwent the operation at Leeds General Infirmary last month. Thankfully, the surgery was successful. Ms Ward, 46, said: 'It’s amazing. When they told us he was now breathing, we just didn’t know what to say.' Happy: Lyall with his parents, Steph Ward and Sharron Cook. Ms Ward said: 'Hearing his first word was such an emotional moment. It was the perfect first word for him to say - and hearing it was amazing' Throughout his short life, Lyall has defied expert opinion as he has battled various serious health conditions. After the operation he had to be sedated in intensive care for several days to allow the graft to heal. She added: 'Lyall had the operation on March 13 and was sedated for three days to stop him from pulling on the tubes and allow the wound to heal. Then he got a chest infection and they had to keep him sedated for up to a week in total. 'Waiting three or four days for him to wake up was long enough, but it was hell waiting for a week to see how he was and if we'd made the right decision. When surgeons were eventually were able to bring him round, he began breathing for himself. 'The first thing he said when he woke up was ""mummy"", really clearly, said Ms Cook. 'There were a lot of tears. Enjoyment: Now Lyall can form many words and sounds he couldn't before, is giggling and shouting, and enjoying the freedom he has never had . 'It was such an emotional moment. It was the perfect first word for him to say really, hearing it was just amazing.' While in hospital, medical staff from throughout his life saw him and many became very emotional by his progress - which his mothers said was very touching. One told us: 'It's more than was ever imaginable,' said Ms Ward. 'It took about three weeks for him to get back to himself - now he's running around, shouting, back to his boisterous self.' Now Lyall can form many words and sounds he couldn’t before, is giggling and shouting, and enjoying the freedom he has never had. Ms Ward said: 'He can be more free. He can be upstairs playing with his friends or brothers while we are downstairs. We’ve never been able to do that before - and that’s massive. 'He started school full-time in September so we definitely made the right decision and did it at the right time.' His family said they were 'indebted' to surgeons for all they have done for Lyall - and have now set up a fundraising drive to help other children like him. They want to buy resources for the wards which use Makaton, a simple sign language which Lyall uses, so they can better communicate with young patients. And they hope to enable frontline staff to learn a few basic signs which could make hospital less stressful for youngsters. 'We want to make a difference for kids like him who are coming through - it would be great,' said Ms Cook. Lyall will take part in the Jane Tomlinson Appeal Mini Run on May 11, while his fifth birthday will be celebrated by a fundraising party on June 6 with an appearance from signing group singing hands.

"By . Sophie Borland Health Reporter . Cancer patients could be given a tailor-made series of drugs to hugely boost their survival chances, experts say . Cancer patients could be given a tailor-made series of drugs to hugely boost their survival chances within the next two years, experts claim. Patients with the deadliest types of the disease would be given individual ‘lists’ of drugs depending on the type of tumour. Scientists from Cancer Research UK claim it will revolutionise the way the disease is treated and extend average survival rates for some types of cancer from four months to many years. An initial trial will involve patients with lung cancer – the commonest but one of the most deadliest forms, claiming 35,000 lives in Britain a year. If it is a success, patients with breast, prostate and bowel cancer could also be given the treatment within the next two years. Over the next few months 300 patients with advanced lung cancer will be recruited to take part in the trial, which is being carried out at 18 hospitals in the UK. Researchers will first carry out tests to determine the genetic make-up of each tumour in order to work out the types of drugs to be given. Scientists hope it will give patients who are only expected to survive for four months the chance to live for many years. Despite recent advancements in cancer treatment, the survival chances for certain types such as lung remain tragically low. Around 43,500 Britons are diagnosed with lung cancer annually – just ten per cent of which live beyond five years. Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said if the trial was successful, patients with breast, prostate and bowel cancer could be given the bespoke series of drugs within two years. ‘We are giving a number of options to patients who would otherwise have exhausted all their treatment,’ he said. ‘We are talking about the potential for thousands of patients to get another option. ‘I really believe that what we are doing is going to rewrite the rule book on how we do clinical trials. Scientists from Cancer Research UK say the new treatment plans could be available within two years . ‘It shifts the emphasis on designing a trial around a specific drug to designing a trial around a range of drugs for a specific patient. ‘So it’s much more patient- centric in its approach. ‘If it’s as successful as we expect it will be, we will fully then expect to roll it out to other types of  cancer thereafter.’ The trial will be jointly run with the drug firms AstraZeneca and Pfizer, which are providing the treatments. Recent figures from Cancer Research UK show the number of Britons diagnosed with cancer annually has soared by almost 50,000 in a decade. Some 330,000 cases were diagnosed in 2011, up from 283,000 in 2001. The number included 50,000 with breast cancer, 40,695 with bowel cancer, 40,975 with prostate cancer, 42,026 with lung cancer and 12,818 with skin cancer. Experts have blamed the rise on an ageing population, as well as obesity and alcohol consumption, which can trigger the disease. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘By investing £11.5million a day into research and development for the life sciences we have made this country one of the best places in the world to carry out and invest in clinical trials, which has made ground-breaking programmes like this possible.’","Patients to be given individual 'lists' of drugs depending on their tumour .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A woman given a vagina grown in a laboratory has spoken of her hope to have a family one day. She is one of four women born without a vagina who have been given the new treatment, revealed last week. Scientists at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's Institute for Regenerative Medicine engineered the organs using the women's own cells. The unnamed woman, from Mexico, is one of four women born without a vagina who have been given the new treatment, revealed last week.The organ is engineered using a woman's own cells . The new organs have been given to women born with MRKH - Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare genetic condition in which the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent . One of the women, interviewed by New Scientist, credits the procedure with giving her a normal life. She said: 'At the beginning it wasn't easy, thinking that a part of your body was going to be made in a laboratory. It was difficult to understand. 'But as the years pass and with the good results, you find a way of life which is different but not too far from normality. 'You start from a point where you are scared of everything, of trying anything – you feel you aren't normal. The new organs have been given to women born with MRKH - Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare genetic condition in which the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent . Eight years on, the woman says the organ works 'as if it weren't made in the lab' and her body has accepted it incredibly well . The lab-grown vagina developed from a woman's own cells . 'But with time, the support of friends and my partner, and the unconditional support of my mother who gave her all to understand me, I feel I am a very lucky person, fully satisfied.' The unnamed woman, who lives in Mexico, was 18 when she was diagnosed with MRKH. She said she had experienced 'moments of desperation' - especially when she was told she wouldn't have children -  and the process had been difficult and painful. But it was worth it - eight years on she says the organ works 'as if it weren't made in the lab' and her body has accepted it incredibly well. The . organ structures were engineered using muscle and epithelial cells (the . cells that line the body’s cavities) from a small biopsy of each . patient’s external genitals. The cells were extracted from the tissues, expanded and then placed on a . biodegradable material that was hand-sewn into a vagina-like shape. These scaffolds (pictued below) were tailor-made to fit each patient. About five to six weeks after . the biopsy, surgeons created a canal in the patient’s pelvis and . attached the scaffold to reproductive structures. At . the same time the scaffolding material is being absorbed by the body, . the cells lay down materials to form a permanent support structure – . gradually replacing the engineered scaffold with a new organ. She now hopes to have children, despite her options being limited - and dreams of the day she is interviewed surrounded by a large family, . The researchers also hope the treatment could be used to help women with vaginal cancer or injuries. Writing in The Lancet, programme leader Dr Anthony Atala, said: 'This pilot study is the first to demonstrate . that vaginal organs can be constructed in the lab and used successfully . in humans. 'This may represent a new option for patients who require vaginal reconstructive surgeries. In addition, this study is one more example of how regenerative medicine strategies can be applied to a variety of tissues and organs.' The girls were between 13 and 18 years old at the time of the surgeries, which were performed between June 2005 and October 2008. Data from annual follow-up visits show that even up to eight years after the surgeries, the organs had normal function. The vaginas were engineered using muscle and epithelial . cells (the cells that line the body's cavities) from a small biopsy of . each patient's external genitals. The cells were then extracted from the tissues, expanded and then . placed on a biodegradable material that was hand-sewn into a vagina-like . shape. These scaffolds were tailor-made to fit each patient. Yuanyuan Zhang demonstrates the process where four young women born with abnormal or missing vaginas were implanted with lab-grown versions made from their own cells . About . five to six weeks after the biopsy, surgeons created a canal in the . patient's pelvis and sutured the scaffold to reproductive structures. MRKH (Mayer Rokitansky Küster Hauser) is a congenital abnormality which affects one in 5,000 women in the UK. It is characterised by the absence of the vagina, womb  and cervix. Women . suffering from the condition will have normally functioning ovaries and . so will experience the normal signs of puberty but will not have . periods or be able to conceive. The external genatalia are completely normal which is why MRKH isn’t usually discovered until women are in their teenage years. It’s usually discovered when the woman tries to has sex or fails to get her period. Many . women are able to create a vaginal canal using dilation treatment, . which uses cylinder shaped dilators of different sizes to stretch the . muscles. However, if this is unsuccessful then surgery will be used to stretch the vaginal canal. Following treatment women are able to have intercourse and can have their eggs removed and fertilised to be used in surrogacy. Previous research in Dr Atala's lab has shown that . once cell-seeded scaffolds are implanted in the body, nerves and blood . vessels form and the cells expand and form tissue. At the same time the . scaffolding material is being absorbed by the body, the cells lay down . materials to form a permanent support structure – gradually replacing . the engineered scaffold with a new organ. Follow-up testing on the . lab-engineered vaginas showed the margin between native tissue and the . engineered segments was indistinguishable. In addition, the patients' responses to a Female Sexual Function . Index questionnaire showed they had normal sexual function after the . treatment, including desire and pain-free intercourse. ""Tissue biopsies, MRI scans and internal exams using magnification all showed that the engineered vaginas were similar in makeup and function to native tissue, said Atlantida-Raya Rivera, lead author and director of the HIMFG Tissue Engineering Laboratory in Mexico City, where the surgeries were performed. Current treatments for MRHK syndrome include dilation of existing tissue or reconstructive surgery to create new vaginal tissue. A variety of materials can be used to surgically construct a new vagina – from skin grafts to tissue that lines the abdominal cavity. However, these substitutes often lack a normal muscle layer and some patients can develop a narrowing or contracting of the vagina. The researchers say that with conventional treatments, the overall complication rate is as high as 75 percent in paediatric patients, with the need for vaginal dilation due to narrowing being the most common complication.","Unnamed Mexican woman has condition called MRKH .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . In a blow to ‘green’ fuel campaigners, a recent study has shown that biofuels made from the leftovers of corn plants are worse than petrol in releasing harmful emissions. The find directly challenges both European and U.S. policymakers who claim biofuels are a much cleaner oil alternative and could help combat climate change. But a $500,000 (£297,000) by the U.S. government claims that biofuels made with corn residue release 7 per cent more greenhouse gases in the early years compared with conventional petrol. In a blow to 'green' fuel campaigners, a recent study has shown that biofuels made from the leftovers of corn plants are worse than petrol for global warming . While biofuels are better in the long run, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln study claims they won't meet a standard set in a 2007 U.S. energy law to qualify as renewable fuel. However, the biofuel industry and U.S. administration immediately criticised the research as flawed. They said it was too simplistic in its analysis of carbon loss from soil, which can vary over a single field, and vastly overestimated how much residue farmers actually would remove once the market gets underway. 'The core analysis depicts an extreme scenario that no responsible farmer or business would ever employ because it would ruin both the land and the long-term supply of feedstock.  It makes no agronomic or business sense,’ said Jan Koninckx, global business director for biorefineries at DuPont. While biofuels are better in the long run, the study claims they won't meet a standard set in a 2007 to qualify as renewable fuel. Pictured is equipment inside a pilot plant in Scotland which turns corn cob into cellulosic ethanol, a precursor to a commercial-scale biorefinery planned for Emmetsburg, Iowa . Later this year the company is scheduled to finish a $200 million (£119 million) facility in Nevada, Iowa, that will produce 30 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol using corn residue from nearby farms. An assessment paid for by DuPont said that the ethanol it will produce there could be more than 100 per cent better than gasoline in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. The research is among the first to attempt to quantify, over 12 Corn Belt states, how much carbon is lost to the atmosphere when the stalks, leaves and cobs that make up residue are removed and used to make biofuel, instead of left to naturally replenish the soil with carbon. The study found that regardless of how much corn residue is taken off the field, the process contributes to global warming. ‘I knew this research would be contentious,’ said Adam Liska, the lead author and an assistant professor of biological systems engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. ‘I'm amazed it has not come out more solidly until now.' Motorists could pay almost £200 ($336) a year more for petrol when a new green fuel is introduced in line with EU rules, experts have warned. Their tests show the new blend of unleaded petrol can make cars up to 11.3 per cent less efficient, increase CO2 exhaust emissions and even ruin the engines of some older vehicles. It is set to be introduced because of an EU directive saying that major suppliers must add environmentally friendly alternatives to petrol. Many oil companies have decided to use bio-ethanol, made from corn, sugar cane and rapeseed. The new eco-fuel, E10, contains 10 per cent bio-ethanol, compared with up to 5 per cent in the E5 unleaded blend currently on sale. The Renewable Energy Directive requires 5 per cent of road transport energy to be from renewable sources this year, and 10 per cent by 2020, in an attempt to cut greenhouse gas emissions linked to global warming. But while ethanol burns more cleanly than petrol, it supplies around 30 per cent less energy. This means cars will use more of the new fuel, costing drivers more. What Car? said ethanol acts as a solvent and can cause fuel pump, hose filter and injector blockages. It is also corrosive to some seals, plastics and metals ‘and can lead to fuel leaks and even engine failure’. The fuel leads to increased CO2 emissions from car exhaust pipes. However, green groups such as the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership say this would be offset since crops used to make it absorb CO2 as they grow. What Car? said ethanol acts as a solvent and can cause fuel pump, hose filter and injector blockages. It is also corrosive to some seals, plastics and metals 'and can lead to fuel leaks and even engine failure' The Environmental Protection Agency's own analysis, which assumed about half of corn residue would be removed from fields, found that fuel made from corn residue, also known as stover, would meet the standard in the energy law. That standard requires cellulosic biofuels to release 60 per cent less carbon pollution than gasoline. Cellulosic biofuels that don't meet that threshold could be almost impossible to make and sell. Refiners would shun the fuels because they wouldn't meet their legal obligation to use minimum amounts of next-generation biofuels. The study claims biofuels made with corn residue (right) release 7 per cent more greenhouse gases when burned compared to petrol (left) EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia said in a statement that the study ‘does not provide useful information relevant to the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from corn stover ethanol.’ But an AP investigation last year found that the EPA's analysis of corn-based ethanol failed to predict the environmental consequences accurately. The departments of Agriculture and Energy in the U.S. have initiated programmes with farmers to make sure residue is harvested sustainably. For instance, farmers will not receive any federal assistance for conservation programs if too much corn residue is removed. A peer-reviewed study performed at the Energy Department's Argonne National Laboratory in 2012 found that biofuels made with corn residue were 95 per cent better than gasoline in greenhouse gas emissions. That study assumed some of the residue harvested would replace power produced from coal, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it's unclear whether future biorefineries would do that. Professor Liska agrees that using some of the residue to make electricity, or planting cover crops, would reduce carbon emissions. But he did not include those in his computer simulation. Still, corn residue is likely to be a big source early on for cellulosic biofuels, which have struggled to reach commercial scale. Last year, for the fifth time, the EPA proposed reducing the amount required by law. It set a target of 17 million gallons for 2014. The law envisioned 1.75 billion gallons being produced this year. ‘The study says it will be very hard to make a biofuel that has a better greenhouse gas impact than gasoline using corn residue,’ which puts it in the same boat as corn-based ethanol, said David Tilman, a professor at the University of Minnesota who has done research on biofuels' emissions from the farm to the tailpipe. Professor Tilman said it was the best study on the issue he has seen so far.","Biofuel release 7% more emissions compared to petrol in its early years .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Photographer Sergey Anashkevych was travelling across Crimea by train when he spotted a remarkable sight. Alongside the train in one location were vast expanses of coloured salt flats stretching into the distance in a place known as Sivash, or the Rotten Sea. With camera in hand the Crimean returned to the location after his journey and managed to capture the remarkable photos you can see here. Sparkling red water contrasts with the clear blue sky at a derelict salt field in Crimea, where the wooden structures of an old mine remain. Photographer Sergey Anashkevych, 36, decided to explore the multi-coloured landscape after seeing it from a train . Salt is one of the biggest export products from Crimea, while chemical industry accounts for 20.6% of industrial output in the region. When the island was part of the Soviet Union, this particular region was mined for brine, which forms when ground water reacts with rock salt. Now the salt flats are abandoned, but what is left are an incredible series of lakes brimming with the remnants of a once-extensive industry. The Rotten Sea is so-called because of the smell produced there. The lake of Sivash is very shallow, with an average depth of 1.6 to 3.2 feet (0.5 to one metres). At the base of the lake, though, is a layering of silt up to 16.4 feet (five metres) thick, giving the waters a salinity of up to 87 per cent. In the summer the waters heat up and evaporate, producing the smell. It is estimated that there are 200 million tonnes of salts at the location. The entire area is 990 square miles (2,560 square kilometres), although this particular mine makes up only a small section of that. In the absence of humans the water continues to produce salt mushrooms and flowers around old wooden pillars as it evaporates in the heat . Lake Sivash is found in Crimea and is also known as the Rotten Sea due to the foul smell produced by the layers of silt under the water . The wooden structures were once used as walkways to traverse the various salt flats but now they lie derelict and unused . The unique natural phenomenon of the red water is thanks to Dunaliella algae which multiplies rapidly when it has access to extremely salty water . In the images sparking red water at the derelict salt ponds contrasts with the clear blue sky. The phenomenon is thanks to the rose-tinted Halobacteria algae, which multiples rapidly when it has access to extremely salty water. The salt field was mined for brine when it was part of the USSR for use in industry, but now huge salt crystals have formed on the abandoned lake. It is well known to locals but hardly ever frequented by tourists. ‘It’s just a stunning place,’ says 36-year-old Anashkevych from Sevastopol. It is hard to explain the feelings and to describe and to describe the emotions. ‘The air is very humid there and very salty, and because of the salt in the air you get the feeling that the air is sticky. And everything gets covered by this sticky thin film – skin, clothes, equipment – everything. ‘The only other problem is the smell – you can’t call it pleasant.’ The slat flats were divided into geometric squares when the old mine was still operational . The region is thought to still have about 200 million tons of salt, although in areas such as this it is lying unused . Sergey Anashkevych travelled to the location at dawn so he could catch the sun's light reflecting off the water . To capture these stunning photos Aneshkevych used a variety of cameras and equipment. These include a Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Mark II and a Canon EF 15/2.8 FishEye. The salt fields are all geometric squares, built this way for ease of access. Around the squares are wooden structures that were used by workers to walk around them. The water is about ankle deep and on the wood can be seen the effects of evaporation where salt has been left behind. A special flow chute can be seen which was used to channel water to and from certain areas. The salt appears to bloom like flowers and mushrooms around the wooden pillars as the evaporation process continues unabated . The water is mostly about ankle deep, but some sections are drained due to the channels that were built in the days of the old mine . Although the area is popular with locals it is not so well known with tourists, making Anashkevych's accidental discovery all the more impressive . To create the salt, water was fed into different areas and, when it naturally evaporated, salt would be left on the ground for collection. The gateways no longer work, though, due to corrosion.Now, water moves the fields as it pleases, being replenished by rain. Not all of the flats are red, however. Some are a blue-white-black mud where the water has disappeared completely. Where the water has pooled, some of the old walkways have disappeared from view almost completely. By photographing the flats at dawn, Sergey was also able to chronicle the impressive spectacle of sunlight gleaming off them. The end product is one of the best collections of colourful photography you're ever going to see.","Crimean photographer Sergey Anashkevych has captured some amazing images of salt flats in Crimea .

"By . Emma Innes . A young boy had to spend two days with a gaping hole in his chest after open-heart surgery. Lucas Reynolds, two, was born with a catalogue of heart and bowel problems and has already undergone a series of life-saving operations. After the most recent operation, surgeons had to leave his chest open for two days while he recovered. Lucas Reynolds, two, was born with a catalogue of heart and bowel problems. He is pictured with his parents, Jason, 40, and Fiona, 37 . The meant his shocked parents were able to watch his heart beating inside his body. But now, after two years in and out of hospital, Lucas has finally been able to go home to Derby with his parents, Jason and Fiona. His mother said: ‘His chest was open and when we went up to visit him we could actually see his little heart beating. ‘It was such an unnerving experience.’ Lucas’s long journey to full health started after he was diagnosed with heart and bowel problems when he was born on October 12, 2011. He had necrotizing enterocolitis which is inflammation of the bowel which can lead to bowel damage and even tissue death. When he was 12 days old Lucas had surgery but doctors only gave him a 50 per cent chance of survival . Last month, Lucas had more surgery and following the operation his heart stopped. Surgeons had to reopen his chest and managed to restart his  heart. They then had to leave his chest open for two days while the swelling around his heart went down . He also had truncus arteriosus which is a condition which occurs when there is just one large blood vessel, instead of two, leaving the heart's ventricles. This means oxygen rich and oxygen poor blood can mix and flow from the heart to the body and lungs. Most children with the condition, including Lucas, also have a hole between their two ventricles which also allows oxygen rich and oxygen poor blood to mix. Finally, Lucas also had interrupted aortic arch which is where the large blood vessel that takes blood away from the heart to the rest of the body is not fully developed. He was operated on at 12 days old and his doctors gave him just a 50/50 chance of survival. They were so worried he would not survive that they gave his parents the option of just taking him home and letting him fade away. Lucas's parents were terrified that he would not survive the operation but they believe he is a 'little fighter'. He is pictured after his operation, once his chest had been closed again . Lucas's parents did not know until after his birth that he would have so many health problems . However, they were determined to give him a chance so decided to go ahead with surgery. As a result, he had open-heart surgery after a process where his body was cooled to allow surgeons to work on him without him suffering brain damage. After 35 days in intensive care he was finally able to go home at eight weeks old. But that wasn’t the end of the Reynolds family’s ordeal. Just before Lucas’s second birthday, they found out he would have to undergo open-heart surgery for the second time. Just last month he went into hospital and, after seven hours of surgery, his parents thought he was finally in the clear. Lucas (pictured with his parents as a baby) is now in good health and has been able to go home . Mr Reynolds said: 'He has fought every step of the way and we're so proud that he's never given up' In fact, a nurse came out to tell them that he had suddenly deteriorated and that a doctor was ‘working on him’. Lucas had gone into cardiac arrest and medics had to re-open his chest to keep him alive. The 10cm incision was open for two days to create space while the swelling around his heart went down. Since returning from his second stay in hospital, Lucas is now thriving and is looking forward to starting nursery. His mother, 37, who works for Rolls-Royce, said: ‘We didn’t know when I was pregnant that anything was wrong so the hours after he was born were incredibly scary. ‘We were always worrying even though we believed he was a fighter. ‘It just goes around in the back of your head, what if? ‘And . when it came to his second heart operation, we were aware that two . children we had got to know with similar problems had died when they . went in for their second round of surgery. Mrs Reynolds says that despite Lucas's brush with death, he has quickly returned to being a 'cheeky monkey' ‘Then when we found out he’d gone into cardiac arrest we were obviously in absolute pieces thinking: why did we put him through it? ‘But he never gave up and soon he was back to being a little monkey. ‘Even when his heart was still exposed he tried to get up and out of bed and we had to hold him down so he didn’t injure himself. ‘Once he was ready to get up he was trying run, not walk. ‘We’re just trying to get back to normal now.’ His father, also an engineer at Rolls-Royce, said he was immeasurably proud of his son’s fighting spirit. The 40-year-old said: ‘He has fought every step of the way and we’re so proud that he’s never given up.’","Lucas Reynolds was born with a series of heart and bowel problems .

"By . Mark Prigg . After six years on the red planet, Nasa's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has collected its fair share of dust. In fact, the red planet has thrown up so much that the solar panels on the rover were not working as well as they should. However, Nasa has revealed the rover has has a spring clean - courtesy of the martian wind. Before: This image of Opportunity in January 2014 shows its solar panels coated in a think layer of dust, obscuring its panels . Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. Instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years. During its time on Mars, the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals. Their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water. Nasa today revealed these amazing pictures showing the rover's cleanup. 'It now has cleaner solar arrays than in any Martian winter since its first on the Red Planet, in 2005,' Nasa said. 'Cleaning effects of wind events in March boosted the amount of electricity available for the rover's work.' TRhe two images show the rover in its 'dirty' state in January 2014 (above), where the panels have a thick layer of dust. The 'clean' picture below, taken in March, reveals a sparking set of panels with their full capability restored. The mission is using the rover's added energy to inspect 'Murray Ridge,' on the western rim of Endeavour Crater, to learn about wet environments on ancient Mars, Nasa said. During Opportunity's first decade on Mars and the 2004-2010 career of its twin, Spirit, NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project yielded a range of findings proving wet environmental conditions on ancient Mars -- some very acidic, others milder and more conducive to supporting life.

"By . Damien Gayle . They were once believed to be impervious to fire, but it appears that increasing temperatures are having a shrinking effect on salamanders. Wild salamanders in North America are getting smaller as their surroundings get warmer and drier, forcing them to burn more energy in a hotter climate. Researchers from the University of Maryland found that salamanders in the Appalachians today were nearly a tenth smaller than their ancestors in the Fifties. Shrinking species: This Northern gray-cheeked salamander, Plethodon montanus, is one of the Appalachian salamander species that has gotten significantly smaller in recent decades as the habitat around it warms . The changes were most marked in the Southern Appalachians and at low elevations â€“ settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most. Scientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change and, the researchers sasy, this is strong confirmation of that prediction. Senior author Karen Lips, associate professor of biology at Maryland, said: 'This is one of the largest and fastest rates of change ever recorded in any animal. 'We don't know exactly how or why it's happening, but our data show it is clearly correlated with climate change.' And, she added, it's happening at a time when salamanders and other amphibians are in distress, with some species going extinct and others dwindling in number. Prof Lips when on: 'We don't know if this is a genetic change or a sign that the animals are flexible enough to adjust to new conditions. 'If these animals are adjusting, it gives us hope that some species are going to be able to keep up with climate change.' Research assistant Edward Kabay measures a salamander while associate professor Karen Lips takes notes during field work for the study of Appalachian salamanders. The animals are shrinking 1 percent per generation . The study was prompted by the work of University of Maryland Professor Emeritus Richard Highton, who began collecting salamanders in the Appalachian Mountains in 1957. The ancient mountain range's moist forests and long evolutionary history make it a global hot spot for a variety of salamander species. Prof Highton collected hundreds of thousands of salamanders, now preserved in jars at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum Service Centre in Suitland, Maryland. But his records show a mysterious decline in the region's salamander populations beginning in the Eighties. Prof Lips, an amphibian expert, saw a similar decline in the frogs she studied in Central America, and tracked it to a lethal fungal disease. She decided to see whether disease might explain the salamander declines in the Appalachians. Prof Lips and her students measured and took DNA samples from salamanders at 78 of Prof Highton's collecting sites in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina, between summer 2011 and spring 2012. They found virtually no fungal disease in the museum specimens or the living animals. But when they compared size measurements of the older specimens with today's wild salamanders, the differences were striking. Between 1957 and 2012, six salamander species got significantly smaller, while only one got slightly larger. On average, each generation was 1 per cent smaller than its parents' generation, the researchers found. The researchers compared changes in body size to the animals' location and their sites' elevation, temperature and rainfall. They found the salamanders shrank the most at southerly sites, where temperatures rose and rainfall decreased over the 55-year study. A researcher bags a red backed salamander, Plethodon cenereus, prior to swabbing it, measuring it, and releasing it. Next, researchers will study whether smaller size is a useful adaptation to climate change . To find out how climate change affected the animals, Clemson University biologist Michael Sears used a computer program to create an artificial salamander, which allowed him to estimate a typical salamander's daily activity and the number of calories it burned. Using detailed weather records for the study sites, Dr Sears was able to simulate the minute-by-minute behavior of individual salamanders, based on weather conditions at their home sites during their lifetimes. The simulation showed the modern salamanders were just as active as their forbears had been. But to maintain that activity, they had to burn 7 to 8 per cent more energy. Cold-blooded animals' metabolisms speed up as temperatures rise, Dr Sears explained. To get that extra energy, salamanders must make trade-offs, said Prof Lips. They may spend more time foraging for food or resting in cool ponds, and less time hunting for mates. The smaller animals may have fewer young, and may be more easily picked off by predators. 'Right now we don't know what this means for the animals,' said Prof Lips. 'If they can start breeding smaller, at a younger age, that might be the best way to adapt to this warmer, drier world. 'Or it may be tied in with the losses of some of these species.'","Appalachian salamanders are nearly a tenth smaller than 50 years ago .

"By . Mark Prigg . Our brains start to slow down once we hit 24, researchers have discovered. They analysed thousands of played of the hugely popular Starcraft 2 computer game, and saw a universal slowdown far earlier than they expected. They claim that as soon as players hit the ripe old age of 25, they have already reached their peak in terms of cognitive motor performance. Researchers analysed thousands of players of the popular Starcraft game - and found they peaked at 24. StarCraft 2 is a ruthless competitive intergalactic computer war game that players often undertake to win serious money. The game is a military science fiction real-time strategy video game developed and released by Blizzard Entertainment, and is hugely popular, with players often meeting up to compete in vast weekend tournaments against each other. The team from Simon Fraser University analysed the digital performance records of 3,305 StarCraft 2 players, aged 16 to 44. StarCraft 2 is a ruthless competitive intergalactic computer war game that players often undertake to win serious money. Their performance records, which can be readily replayed, constitute big data because they represent thousands of hours worth of strategic real-time cognitive-based moves performed at varied skill levels. Using complex statistical modeling, the researchers looked at how players responded to their opponents and more importantly, how long they took to react. 'After around 24 years of age, players show slowing in a measure of cognitive speed that is known to be important for performance,' said Joe Thompson, a psychology doctoral student who led the study. Researchers studied games players and found their cognitive abilities began to diminish as soon as they reached 24 . 'This cognitive performance decline is present even at higher levels of skill.'However, they say there is a silver lining for older players . 'Our research tells a new story about human development,' says Thompson. StarCraft 2 is a ruthless competitive intergalactic computer war game that players often undertake to win serious money. Researchers say the performance records, which can be readily replayed, represent thousands of hours worth of strategic real-time cognitive-based moves performed at varied skill levels. 'Older players, though slower, seem to compensate by employing simpler strategies and using the gameâ€™s interface more efficiently than younger players, enabling them to retain their skill, despite cognitive motor-speed loss.' For example, older players more readily use short cut and sophisticated command keys to compensate for declining speed in executing real time decisions. The findings, says Thompson, suggest 'that our cognitive-motor capacities are not stable across our adulthood, but are constantly in flux, and that our day-to-day performance is a result of the constant interplay between change and adaptation.' The research was published in the journal PLOS One.","Researchers analysed players of Starcraft 2 video game .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Geologists have come out in defence of carbon capture and storage (CCS) following concerns raised by leading climate scientists over its safety. The IPCC report yesterday highlighted a number of barriers to using CCS, including fatal CO2 leaks, transport issues and operational risks, such as seismic tremors. CCS refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in porous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Pictured is Ramon Pichs Madruga, Co-Chairman of the IPCC Working Group III, Ottmar Edenhofer, Co-Chairman of the IPCC Working Group III, and Rejendra K. Pachauri, Chairman of the IPCC, from left, pose prior to a press conference as part of a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Berlin . While the technology has the potential to reduce the emissions of a typical coal-power plant by up to 90 per cent, there remain concerns over storing such huge amounts of carbon underground. For instance, a report released in 2012 by the National Research Council said that carbon storage may pose a greater seismic threat than oil and gas extraction. A further study by Stanford University argued that tiny quakes could damage the seal of CO2 repositories, releasing the gas back into the atmosphere. But the case for CCS to reduce emissions is compelling. According to the International Energy Agency, CCS could provide one-fifth of the global emissions reductions required by 2050. The case for CCS to reduce emissions is compelling. According to the International Energy Agency, CCS could provide one-fifth of the global emissions reductions required by 2050 . One of the main concerns over CCS is the pressure that it can exert on the porous rock deep underground. ‘It’s . like putting more air into your car tyre,’ explained Professor . Haszeldine. ‘Because you’ve got a volume of air in there already, when . you increase pressure you can crack rock.’ ‘The . other type of risk is there are geological faults underground, and if . you increase the pressure, then that can lubricate that fault and create . a small tremor on it,’ said Professor Haszeldine. ‘That hasn’t happened with carbon dioxide disposal, but it has happened with dams on a tiny scale.’ If a tremor is large enough, it could cause CO2 to leak back to the surface and into the atmosphere. This would be a hazard because CO2 at high concentrations is an asphyxiant and could be fatal to humans. In . 2010, a study by Duke University found that leaks from carbon dioxide . injected deep underground could bubble up into drinking water aquifers . near the surface, driving up levels of contaminants in the water . tenfold. Earlier this year, the UK government said it will fund a multi-million pound project to design a carbon capture and storage plant at the Peterhead power station in Scotland. Meanwhile the U.S. has 19 large-scale CCS projects in operation or in various stages of development – the greatest amount for any country. The IPCC report, however, said: ‘Barriers to large‐scale deployment of CCS technologies include concerns about the operational safety and long‐term integrity of CO2 storage as well as transport risks.’ It added that: ‘For the large‐scale future deployment of CCS, well‐defined regulations concerning short‐ and long‐term responsibilities for storage are needed as well as economic incentives.’ The ‘negative tone’ from 235 eminent United Nations scientists and economists came as a surprise to a 100-strong group of geologists meeting in London today. Stuart Haszeldine, a professor of CCS at Edinburgh University, told MailOnline that with regard to carbon capture, the IPCC report was 'inherently conservative' and 'outdated.' ‘The reason the IPCC write this sort of language is because they work by a set of academic publications and so have to put forward the opposing view,’ he said. ‘The IPCC report also doesn’t really cover the last three or four years of research, and with a new field such as CCS, that is crucial.’ Although there are concerns about burying billions of tonnes of CO2 underground, engineers have been doing something similar for decades. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has not yet been applied to scale and many barriers remain. Pictured is a Vattenfall employee at the carbon dioxide capture and storage facility in Schwarze Pumpe, Brandenburg, Germany . Since the 1930s, the oil and gas industry has been injecting various fluids underground, and since then, researchers have been attempting to understand the risks this poses to human safety. One of the main concerns over CCS is the pressure that it can exert on the porous rock deep underground. ‘It’s like putting more air into your car tyre,’ explained Professor Haszeldine. ‘Because you’ve got a volume of air in there already, when you increase pressure you can crack rock.’ But he added that the oil and gas industry has the technologies to monitor this pressure and prevent subsurface cracks from appearing. ‘The other type of risk is there are geological faults underground, and if you increase the pressure, then that can lubricate that fault and create a small tremor on it,’ said Professor Haszeldine. ‘That hasn’t happened with carbon dioxide disposal, but it has happened with dams on a tiny scale.’ If a tremor is large enough, it could cause CO2 to leak back to the surface and into the atmosphere. This would be a hazard because CO2 at high concentrations is an asphyxiant and fatal to humans. In 2010, a study by Duke University found that leaks from carbon dioxide injected deep underground could bubble up into drinking water aquifers near the surface, driving up levels of contaminants in the water ten-fold. Professor Haszeldine, however, said their more recent studies have placed the risk level to humans dying from a CCS leak at one in 30 million. 'Storing carbon dioxide underground is new and leaks are certainly possible – we will need to put careful monitoring in place to make sure they aren’t happening,' said Jane Burston, Head of the Centre for Carbon Measurement. 'Most of the UK’s potential storage is under the sea though, so leaks are less a safety issue and more about ensuring our captured carbon isn’t lost. 'If it is, not only will it contribute to climate change but it will need to be accounted for in the UK’s carbon footprint as well as the carbon footprint of the companies that produced it.' A number of CO2 storage sites are currently operating, including a Norwegian project beneath the North Sea, showing that the concept can work on a small scale. Scaling up, however, would require huge amounts of CCS fluid to be transported to storage sites, comparable to the volumes of oil and gas transported today. 'One potential issue is how pure the carbon dioxide going . into the pipelines and storage,' said Ms Burston. 'If there are impurities, this could cause . corrosion in the pipeline or make the pressures under which carbon dioxide . turns from a gas to a liquid unpredictable. 'These could turn into legal issues . if different companies put their carbon dioxide into the same pipeline or . store, as you would need to know whose supply was impure in order to know who . should pay for the consequences.' CCS refers to the process of capturing carbon released by burning fossil fuels and storing it in porous rock layers in areas such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs . The IPCC reports form a trilogy of documents on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. The first part, published last September, found that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The second part, published a fortnight ago, warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring on all continents and across the oceans’. The final part, published on Sunday, on the options for mitigating global warming, warns that we must drastically reduce our use of fossil fuels. The IPCC report, published yesterday in Berlin, said shale gas may provide electricity and heat for our homes long beyond current targets if scientists can safely develop an emerging technology that traps carbon dioxide and stores it underground. The scientists added that wind, solar and hydroelectric power need to triple or even quadruple in scale over the next 35 years if global warming is to be safely controlled. The IPCC document is the first major assessment in seven years of the options for dealing with climate change. It will inform the policy decisions of governments around the world and will also be used as a bargaining tool before next year’s UN climate conference in Paris, which aims to set legally-binding targets on every nation to reduce carbon emissions. It is the third of three it has prepared on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change. The first concluded that humans are almost certainly the ‘dominant cause’ of global warming. The report added that shale gas may provide electricity and heat for decades to come if scientists can safely develop a technology that traps CO2. A young protestor holds a placard at the entrance gate belonging to a site run by Cuadrilla Resources . The second warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘already occurring’ across the world. Yesterday’s report said that by the end of the century global temperatures will rise to a level that will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet if no action is taken. It calls for massive investment in low-carbon alternatives worldwide of around £90 billion a year and says governments will need to pour subsidies in to get systems off the ground. Nuclear power could make an ‘increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply’, the report finds, but says ‘operation risks’ such as disposing of radioactive waste mean there are a ‘variety of barriers’. Last year in Britain, coal provided 36 per cent of electricity, gas provided 27 per cent, nuclear 20 per cent, oil one per cent and renewable sources 15 per cent. Yesterday's report said that by the end of the century global temperatures will rise to a level that will cause irreversible and dramatic damage to the planet if no action is take .","Report said risks include CO2 leaks, transport issues and seismic tremors .

"By . Mark Prigg . The secret to happiness is helping others - and setting yourself concrete goals to do so, say researchers. They claims that achieving goals give us a far greater sense of satisfaction that abstract concepts of helping others. The team even admit that chasing happiness without clearly defined goals could make us unhappy, resulting in 'helper burnout'. Researchers say the key to being happy is you set goals you can achieve, rather than rely on abstract concepts . One experiment the team carried out involved bone marrow transplants focused on the whether giving those who need bone marrow transplants 'greater hope' – the abstract goal – or giving those who need bone marrow transplants a 'better chance of finding a donor' – the concrete goal – made a giver more happy. The answer was that helping someone find a donor resulted in more happiness for the giver. This, the researchers wrote, was driven by givers' perceptions that their actual acts better met their expectations of accomplishing their goal of helping another person. Givers are likely to experience greater happiness if they frame acts of benevolence in concrete rather than abstract terms, according to the new study. 'Although the desire for personal happiness may be clear, the path to achieving it is indefinite,' said Jennifer Aaker at Stanford University, who led the research. 'One reason for this hazy route to happiness is that although people often think they know what leads to happiness, their predictions about what will make them happy are often inaccurate.' The team say one path to happiness is through concrete, specific goals of benevolence – like making someone smile or increasing recycling – instead of following similar but more abstract goals – like making someone happy or saving the environment. The reason is that when you pursue concretely framed goals, your expectations of success are more likely to be met in reality. On the other hand, broad and abstract goals may bring about happiness' dark side – unrealistic expectations. 'Discrepancies between aspirations and reality can be critical factors that, in extreme cases, may even lead the act of helping to eventually becoming a source of unhappiness,' said Melanie Rudd, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Houston, who also worked on the research. For example, when people pursue abstract prosocial goals and expect their relentless giving to result in tremendous and rapid change for the better and it fails to materialize they can suffer from 'helper burnout,' which can negatively impact happiness. Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS Shoes The firm promises that if a customer buys a pair of shoes, they will deliver another pair to a child in need. The results also have implications for the world of business, the team say. For instance, marketing or products that claim to help consumers achieve abstractly framed goals – like making someone else happy – might not be the best business decision. Instead, it might be wiser to reframe these promised goals in more specific, concrete terms - such as Tom's Shoes, which promises that if a customer buys a pair of shoes, they will deliver another pair to a child in need. 'Concrete initiatives such as this may be a more realistic way to accurately set consumers' expectations from the outset and leave them happier in the end,' Aaker said. Ultimately, people seek to be happy, and one clear path toward happiness is through prosocial behaviors. Aaker explained, 'A prosocial act can not only boost the happiness of the recipient, but it can boost the happiness of the giver as well.' One experiment the team carried out involved bone marrow transplants focused on the whether giving those who need bone marrow transplants 'greater hope' – the abstract goal – or giving those who need bone marrow transplants a 'better chance of finding a donor' – the concrete goal – made a giver more happy. The answer was that helping someone find a donor resulted in more happiness for the giver. This, the researchers wrote, was driven by givers' perceptions that their actual acts better met their expectations of accomplishing their goal of helping another person.","Researchers say having abstract goals can actually make people less happy .

One Austrian company is hoping to tackle range anxiety with the introduction of the Johammer J1 - an electric bike that can travel 125 miles on a single charge . Created by Bad Leonfelden-based group Johammer, the electric bike has an almost silent motor integrated into the rear wheel. The 11 kilowatt hub-mounted motor provides 14 horsepower and a top speed of 74mph (119kph). The stiff middle-frame of the electric bike is made from aluminium and has been designed to contain the battery pack . Electric hub-mounted motors contain the electric motor within the wheel hub, or central part of the wheel. To drive the wheel, the motor contains a coil which generates an electromagnetic field as power flows through it. The field attracts the outer part of the motor, which attempts to follow its direction, and in doing so turns the connected wheel. The hub motors eliminates the need for a heavy transmission, gear train, and axles which reduces the weight, making the electric bike far more efficient.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . How do you make sure people pick up their dog’s mess? That’s something researchers have been trying to figure out. But, in tackling this problem, they reveal some startling figures for the state of dog mess in the UK. Toilet trained: New research suggests that a small minority of dog walkers are not pulling their weight when it comes to cleaning up their dog's poo, leading to a problem with no clear solution . The study, led by Professor Christopher Lowe at the University of Central Lancashire, ‘sought to investigate the behaviour and attitudes of dog walkers to picking up and disposing of dog foul.' ‘Dog waste audits were conducted on popular dog walking paths in Lancashire,’ they wrote. In the research they surveyed 933 people. They found that most dog walkers do actually claim to clean up after their dogs. In fact, only three per cent were adamant they would not pick up their dog’s poo, while just eight per cent said they would only pick it up if it was on a path. Recent research suggests what dog owners knew all along – that they do in fact experience feelings of love and affection. Scientists . at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, discovered that a part of the . brain associated with positive emotions, is similar in dogs and humans. They too used fMRI scanners to examine canine brain activity. Using . hand signals to indicate the dogs were about to receive a food treat, . the researchers showed that the caudate nucleus, a part of the brain . associated with positive emotions, was similar in dogs and humans. 'If, . as many scientists have argued in the past, it is all simply about [getting] food for dogs then the reaction in their brains would be the . same no matter who or what is offering them the food,’ said . neuroscientist Gregory Berns. ‘We . hope to show that they love us for things far beyond food, basically . the same things that humans love us for, like social comfort and social . bonds.’ While a minority, however, it is this small group that ultimately causes the problem. In the UK 1,000 tonnes of dog poo is created each day by about eight million dogs. Even just a small percentage of this can be significant. Abandoned dog excrement can be both harmful to humans and the environment. Dog waste carries a large number of parasites - including hookworms, ringworms, tapeworms and Salmonella. These parasites can cause digestive upsets, and in some cases, even blindness. Dog waste is also full of E. Coli and other harmful bacteria including fecal coliform bacteria, which causes serious kidney disorders, intestinal illness, cramps and diarrhea in humans. The waste can also strain local resources when it needs to be picked up. According to the study, £22 million ($37million) is spent per year on ‘dog waste collection’ by local agencies in England and Wales. But the threat of fines or public campaigns doesn’t seem to have had an effect on this destabilising minority. The researchers suggest that it may be necessary to ‘guilt’ the minority into picking up their dog’s waste in order to tackle the problem. Ultimately, however they say a solution is still a way off. ‘It is suggested that significantly more research is required to assist in addressing this emotive yet complex problem,’ they conclude. Are you responsible? Keeping dogs on a leash could be one solution to the problem, say the researchers, but ultimately they're not quite certain how to tackle the issue of growing canine waste in the UK .","New research looked into how likely people were to pick up their dog's poo .

'I just didn't see the cars parked on the left,' he said. 'It was just an accident, accidents happen.' Scroll down for video . Sydney Swans AFL star Lance Buddy Franklin said he wasn't texting or speeding when he crashed his girlfriend's SUV into four parked cars last night . Sydney Swans AFL player Lance Franklin takes part in team a training session in Sydney today, a day after crashing his girlfriends Jeep . Busted: Sydney Swans AFL star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin was fined $405 after smashing into four parked cars last night . On Wednesday night, the Sydney Swans released a statement in relation to their $10 million star recruit's crash. 'Franklin was the only person involved in the accident. He was not carrying any passengers and there were no passengers in any of the other vehicles involved. No one was injured in the accident,' the statement read. The 27-year-old said after training at the SCG this morning he was upset about the crash. 'I'm devastated but so thankful that no one else was in the car,' he said. 'I was in shock at first. Anyone in a car accident has that reaction, so yeah a bit shocked and a bit shaky too. 'Obviously I'm frustrated, at myself...I don't want to see myself in the spotlight, I just want to move forward as quickly as possible and focus on our game this weekend.' He was also 'deeply sorry' about the inconvenience caused to the owners of the parked cars. 'I haven't had a chance to speak with them but...I am truly sorry,' he said. Car crash: The AFL player was driving the Jeep SUV he shares with girlfriend Jesinta Campbell when he collided with four parked cars in Rose Bay, Sydney, on Wednesday night . Serious damage: The impact of the crash caused airbags on the vehicle to deploy . The forward told Sunrise on Thursday morning he was 'a little bit upset' about what happened - but wasn't able to shed any light on why he collided with the parked vehicles. 'Obviously I'm a little bit upset about what happened last night...I'm just lucky no one was injured, and myself wasn't injured, so to come out of it unscathed, I'm happy with that,' he said. The boyfriend of Jesinta Campbell was allegedly driving along New South Head Road in Rose Bay, Sydney, when the incident occurred around 7.30pm. Franklin admitted that he was driving too close to the parked cars when the accident occurred. 'I got a little bit too close to the car parked in lane one and that was pretty much it,' he said. 'Then the airbags went off and that's all I can say about it.' Police have confirmed the footballer has since been issued a $405 traffic infringement notice for negligent driving and docked three demerit points. He will not be charged over the matter. The 27-year-old was driving a black Jeep SUV that belongs to his model and TV presenter partner, the same vehicle they were caught parking in a disabled spot in back in January. A New South Wales police spokesman said that people were alerted to the incident after 'residents reported hearing a car crash'. 'Inquires are continuing after a car hit a number of parked vehicles in Rose Bay tonight,' he told AFL.com.au. 'A Jeep that was travelling west on New South Head road hit four parked vehicles, all four vehicles were damaged as a result of the crash. 'The driver of the Jeep was a 27-year-old Bondi man and he was not injured in the crash. 'He underwent a roadside breath test that was negative.

Rose Bay resident Craig McDonald was on the scene and tweeted photos of accident, including images of the damaged Jeep and other vehicles involved. 'Buddy Franklin has just totalled three cars on New South Head road outside my place,' he posted on the social media site. Police attended the scene and were seen speaking to Franklin shortly before his vehicle was towed away. Franklin was last seen leaving the crash site in a black Audi sedan with two females inside, and is expected at a team training session in the morning. Karla Leach, director of corporate affairs for Fiat Chrysler Australia, told the MailOnline her company was in 'constant' discussions with Jesinta Campbell's management about arranging the TV star a new vehicle. 'At this stage we are obviously assessing the car and understanding the extent of the damage,' she said. 'We have been talking with Jesinta's management all day and a decision about a replacement vehicle will be made in the next week.' She said the company needed to determine if the car was a write-off before Jesinta can be given a new Jeep. 'We're just relieved nobody was seriously injured,' she said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An army of police and a SWAT team stormed a Long Island home yesterday under the belief a teen had shot dead his mother and brother and was ready to kill again. But within minutes of arriving, they discovered the  hostage call was an act of revenge by a disgruntled 'Call of Duty' gamer who'd just been defeated. The prank caller told police over Skype that he was 17-year-old Rafael Castillo, and 'I just killed my mother and I might shoot more people', New York Post reported. However Rafael was merely using virtual firearms, his mother Maria was in the kitchen making coffee and his brother Jose had just returned home from lunch. Cops are now hunting the prankster who gave police the teen’s home address in a dangerous game called swatting - an increasingly common hoax which is putting law enforcement on high alert. Scroll down for video . Huge reaction: More than 70 emergency responders, including a SWAT team, swarmed a Long Beach home yesterday after receiving a call from someone saying he had killed his mother and brother inside a Laurelton Boulevard house . Rapid response: Police arrived with a SWAT team to a Long Beach house find out the call was a prank by a sore loser involved in the online video game 'Call of Duty' Hoax: Emergency crews, girded for a multiple shooting and barricade crisis, swarmed the Long Beach home (pictured) only to discover that the hostage call was a hoax . Swatting pranks: Police said sending out crews to follow up the the hoax hostage call used up a lot of resources in what is becoming a major problem . In the two hour standoff, authorities flew helicopters over the Laurelton Boulevard home and rushed in more than 60 officers, including elite members of Nassau County’s special . operations unit. Police in full emergency mode surrounded the home, called for the teen to come out and even called him on his cellphone, but he continued to play video games. He had headphones on and apparently couldn't hear his phone or the drama unfolding outside, Huffington Post reported. Rafael's mother, 54-year-old Maria Castillo, was in the kitchen when she saw police swarm her home. 'He told me, ‘Go out! Go out!'' she said. 'I [said], ‘What happened?’ They said, ‘Somebody killed somebody in your house.’ I told the police my kid’s home, my kid’s on the computer. He don’t know what happened.' Rafael's brother Jose Castillo, 21, told The New York Post the prank was likely an act of revenge. 'Some guy threatened to swat him,' he said. 'He was p****d that he had lost.' Alleged victim: Maria Castillo (pictured) was one of the reported victims of the attack . Scene: Police scrambled helicopters, emergency vehicles and an army of cops to this Long Beach home (right) where someone called in a bloody rampage on Tuesday . He added: 'I thought there was a fire at my house. I ran up and saw my mom running out, I didn’t know what was going on. 'Then one of the police officers said somebody called and said that the mother and brother of somebody in this house was killed. I said ‘how is that possible if she’s right there and I’m right here?'' Police are now hunting the hoaxster by tracing his electronic footprints, with sources saying the emergency response cost about $100,000. Prank: A 'Call of Duty' gamer called cops after he was beaten by a fellow gamer . Game: 'Call of Duty' is a first-person shooter online game . Law enforcers say the game of swatting is becoming increasingly common, and it involves making a hoax call to 911 to draw a response from law enforcement, usually a SWAT team. Long Beach police commissioner Michael Tangney said yesterday's incident was just the latest example of the 'swatting' game. 'In this … bizarre world of swatting, you get points for the helicopter, for the police cars, for the SWAT team, for the type of entry,' he told CBS. 'It’s very sophisticated. Unfortunately, it’s very dangerous.' He said the prankster will be arrested when found. 'If we determine who made this call, there will be an arrest,' Tangney told the Herald. 'He did something so, so foolish, and so dangerous. I’m very angry - it’s a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources, it’s a tremendous danger to law enforcement.'","More than 60 emergency responders, including a SWAT team, swarmed a Laurelton Boulevard, Long Island home yesterday afternoon .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Swooping over a landscape of unspeakable sadness and death, President Barack Obama today took an aerial tour of the place where more than three dozen people perished in a mud slide last month. He then pledged a nation's solidarity with those who are enduring 'unimaginable pain and difficulty' in the aftermath of the destruction. 'We're going to be strong right alongside you,' Obama promised the people whose lives were upended when a wall of mud and water swept away the hillside on March 22 and took with it at least 41 lives and dozens of homes. Scroll down for video . Consoler: President Barack Obama  today met the people of Oso, Washington whose lives were upended by a March 22 mud slide. He hugged first responders and flew over the affected area in a helicopter . Leadership: US President Barack Obama shakes hands with first responders after addressing them at the firehouse in Oso, Washington today . Before making his pledge, Obama boarded a helicopter to survey the awful scene. Evidence of the mudslide's power was everywhere: trees ripped from the ground, a highway paved with mud and debris, a river's course altered. And in the midst of the awful tableau, an American flag flying at half-staff. Even as the president flew overhead, the search for bodies continued below. Two people were still listed as missing. Back on the ground, the president gathered at a community chapel in the small town of Oso, about an hour northeast of Seattle, to mourn with families of the victims. He met separately with emergency responders before speaking in a small brick firehouse about all he had seen and heard on a clear, sunny afternoon. 'The families that I met with showed incredible strength and grace through unimaginable pain and difficulty,' Obama said. Then he offered them a promise. 'The whole country's thinking about you, and we're going to make sure that we're there every step of the way as we go through the grieving, the mourning, the recovery,' he said.

The impact: This picture shows the damage caused by the March 22 mud slide in Oso, Washington . Powerful: Amid the destruction caused by the deadly mudslide stands  an American flag flying at half-staff . Obama said few Americans had heard of the tightknit community of Oso before the tragedy but in the past month 'we've all been inspired by the incredible way that the community has come together'. Firefighter coats hung on the firehouse walls as Obama spoke, with homemade signs above them reading: 'We (Heart) Oso', 'Thank you Oso' and 'Oso Proud'. Brande Taylor, whose boyfriend volunteered to work on the mudslide debris field, was glad the president made the effort to visit this rural outpost. 'It is a small community. It's little. It's not huge on the map. But there's still people here who need help, that need the support,' said Taylor, who stood near the firehouse. 'And they need to know the president is here to support and to help them rebuild their lives.'

Kellie Perkins, who lives in Oso, said Obama's visit would help families who have lost so much begin to heal. 'They don't now have houses any more, they don't have anything they own, their friends or relatives are dead,' she said. 'I think they need this.' At the request of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Obama earlier this month declared that a major disaster had occurred in the state, making it and affected residents eligible for various forms of financial aid, including help covering the costs of temporary housing, home repairs and the loss of uninsured property. The Homeland Security Department, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers also are helping.

Just two weeks ago, he met with families and comrades of those killed in a shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas. Three soldiers died and 16 others were wounded in the rampage by another soldier, who killed himself. Obama also has mourned with the grieving after carnage in Tucson, Ariz., Aurora, Colo., Newtown, Conn., Boston, the Washington Navy Yard - and once before at Fort Hood. Tuesday's stop in Washington came as Obama headed for Tokyo, the first stop on a four-country visit to the Asia-Pacific region. The president is scheduled to spend the rest of this week and part of next week conferring with the leaders of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Amazingly, the process is not as simple as pressing two bits of egg shaped chocolate together and injecting the creamy goodness inside. Cadbury executive Tony Bilsborough explained: 'The process of making the creme egg was a Eureka moment and is not done in the way that most Easter eggs are formed.' Instead the entire egg and the creamy interior are fused together while they are still in liquid form. Mr Bilsborough said: 'A blob of liquid milk chocolate goes into a half egg shape mould where it is levelled.

Cool down: Once the fusing process is complete, cool air is blown onto the eggs for 40 minutes to set them . 'Straight away a blob of white fondant goes on top of the still-melted chocolate. The two liquids don’t mix because the fondant is of a higher density. 'The orange fondant, of even higher density, is then added. The other half of the egg , which is chocolate and white fondant is then put on top. 'Because the whole egg is still liquid the chocolate surrounds the filling and completes the egg shape. 'Once the fusing process is complete, cool air is blown onto the eggs for 40 minutes and once solidified, a hammer is gently tapped on the mould and the completed eggs drop down onto a ramp. 'A robot sucks the eggs off the ramp placing them onto trays then another machine mechanically wraps each egg in foil.' Nearly ready!

There have so far been 25 versions such as the Berry Creme Eggs (Australia), Mint Creme Egg, Creme . Egg ice cream, Creme Egg Twisted, Jaffa Egg (New Zealand), Screme Eggs (For Halloween), Giant . Creme Eggs, and Caramilk Egg . In 1955 one of the first fully automatic chocolate egg machines was installed at Bournville. This meant that for the first time mould heating, depositing of the liquid chocolate, rotation of the moulds to achieve uniform thickness, cooling and de-moulding of the two halves of the egg took place in a series of mechanical operations. Over the years this process has been refined, production speeds have been greatly increased and machinery has become computer controlled. The latest Creme Egg plant at Bournville is a sophisticated computer controlled operation capable of producing up to 1.5 million eggs each day . HOW DO YOU EAT YOURS? Cadbury introduced the classic Creme Egg advertising slogan ‘How Do You Eat yours?’ in 1985 - so what was the most popular answer? - bite off the top, lick out the creme then eat the chocolate (53 per cent) - bite straight through (20 per cent) - use your finger to scoop out the creme (16 per cent)","Revealing pictures from Bourneville, Birmingham show fascinating process .

Resplendent in a fuchsia cashmere coat by Stewart Parvin and a jaunty matching hat by Angela Kelly, the Queen was wreathed in smiles as she arrived for the traditional Maundy Thursday service at Blackburn Cathedral. Joined by a dapper Duke of Edinburgh, the monarch beamed as she was greeted by cheering crowds of well wishers and handed a posy of Spring blooms as she made her way into the 188-year-old building. During the service, the Queen distributed bags of coins to a group of pensioners, continuing a royal tradition that is more than 800 years old. Scroll down for video . Elegant: The Queen was resplendent in a cerise cashmere coat by Stewart Parvin and a hat by Angela K . The original version of the Maundy Service involved the sovereign giving money to the . poor and washing their feet, a tradition which ended with James II in . the 18th century. The custom of washing feet is an an . ancient one and commemorates the last supper of Jesus with the Apostles, . echoing the story of Christ washing the extremities of his disciples shortly . before his death. Although foot washing is no longer part of the ceremony, the tradition of giving 'alms' continues, albeit symbolically. The Maundy gift, which the Queen handed to 88 men and 88 women - one for each of the Queen's 88 years - is made up of two purses, one red and one white. In a ceremony full of pomp, Yeomen in . red tunics carried the purses on golden platters, following the Queen as . she distributed the money to the accompaniment of organ music and . choristers singing God Save The Queen from Handel's Zadok The Priest. Pomp: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh pose with yeomen and schoolchildren in front of the cathedral . Imposing: The royal party stand with choristers and yeomen outside the cathedral, which was opened in 1826 . Giving generously: The Queen hands alms to 88 men and 88 women selected to receive Maundy money . Enjoying the day: The Queen accessorised her cerise ensemble with one of her trademark Launer bags . Recipient Alec Stuttard, 74, from Ewood in Blackburn, was especially pleased to receive the Maundy gift. As . a 13-year-old he was chosen to represent Blackburn . Cathedral in the choir singing at the Queen's Coronation in 1953 - but was forced to pull out because of laryngitis. Speaking about his meeting with the Queen, a delighted Mr Stuttard said: 'It was brilliant. The funny thing is as she came to give me the money . the choir started to sing Zadok The Priest, which is what I would have . sung at the Coronation. I was shaking. Another recipient, James . Nelson, 79, a former engineer, was chosen for his efforts in maintaining St Andrew's Church in Leyland, Lancashire. 'It was wonderful, just wonderful,' revealed Mr Nelson. 'A great honour and a very moving service, it's just a privilege to be here.' Stanley Smith, 73, a retired salesman from Leyland who also received a purse from the Queen added: 'Today was just absolutely wonderful. 'The Queen looks . absolutely immaculate and I feel so humble I was one of only 88 men . chosen, it's something else, I am so honoured.' This year the Red Purse contains a £5 coin, commemorating the 300th anniversary of Queen Anne's reign and a 50p coin commemorating the 20th Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer. Historically, the Red Purse contained an allowance of £3 for clothing, £1.50 in lieu of provisions and £1 for the redemption of the Sovereign's gown. The White Purse contains uniquely minted Maundy money. This takes the form of one, two, three and four silver penny pieces, the sum of which equals the number of years of the monarch's age. Busy: The Maundy tradition is more than 800 years old and used to include the monarch washing peoples' feet . All smiles: The Queen beamed as she handed the assembled pensioners the red and white Maundy purses . Custom: The Maundy purses contain money and special Maundy coins which feature the Queen circa 1952 . Since her accession in 1952, the image of the Queen on ordinary circulating coinage has undergone three changes, but Maundy coins still bear the same portrait of Her Majesty prepared by Mary Gillick for the first coins issued in the year of her coronation in 1953. The service ended with a trumpet fanfare and the national anthem before the procession left the cathedral, with the Right Reverend Julian Henderson, the Bishop of Blackburn, leading the royal party to the cathedral's Great West Door.

Like many other young girls, Leezan Salam, 17, dreams of becoming a ballerina and of taking to the stage at the Royal Opera House one day. But achieving her dream won't be easy for Leezan lives in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad; a place where, since the start of the year, more than 2,000 people have been killed in car bomb attacks and religious extremists consider dancing sinful. Despite the risks, she continues to attend the Baghdad Music and Ballet School, the only place in Iraq that teaches classical music and dance. Scroll down for video . High hopes: Leezan Salam, 17,  is desperate to pursue her dreams of becoming a professional ballerina . 'When you enter school, you enter a . place of hope and peace,' says the teenager who has been a pupil at the school for 10 years. 'It's totally different from out there. Outside . you hear car bombs and gunfire. Inside the school, everything is . beautiful.' But her dreams of a career in dance means overcoming fierce opposition from religious extremists who believe both ballet and music to be against the teachings of Islam. As a result, the school is forced to employ four heavily armed security guards for fear of being attacked. 'Ballet is prohibited and considered . infidel,' explains Wassan Jassim, one of the last two ballet teachers in Iraq. Dangerous: Like others in Baghdad, Leezan faces sectarian violence each day - 200 are killed every week . Terrifying: The aftermath of a bomb attack in Baghdad. Most are planted by Sunni or Shia militiamen . 'We have no support or protection and therefore, we avoid . performing. It's very painful. I can't arrange a ballet performance. I . can't say I'm a ballet teacher. It's very difficult to leave work . knowing that it might be blown up.' Equally deadly are the daily car bombings, most the result of intensifying violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims. So bad has the violence become, parts of the city have become no-go areas, while huge walls, ostensibly for protection, separate the Sunni minority from the rest of the city. And the students at the Baghdad Ballet and Music School aren't immune. On 13th January 2014, one of Leezan's friends, a boy named Ali Nouri, was killed by a bomb. Ali, a Shia, would join Leezan, a Sunni, after school each day as she waited for her father to arrive and pick her up. Tragedy: Leezan's friend Ali Nouri died when a bomb went off on his bus. He had to be identified by his clothes . But one day, that changed. 'He asked me, ""Should I wait with you until . your lift comes?"",' remembers Leezan. 'I said, ""Go now before it gets dark"". Minutes later, Leezan had a call from her mother. 'My mum called . and said, ""Ali has been injured"". I called Ali's phone and a stranger . answered. He said, ""Call this boy's family and tell them he's been . killed"". The bus Ali was in had been attacked by a suicide bomber. His body was so badly damaged, he had to be identified using his ID, mobile phone and clothes. 'I pray for the girls every day,' confesses Leezan's Kurdish mother. 'Once . they'd catch the bus but now it's not safe. The road, the car, even the . school is not safe. Still, I believe God will keep themselves.' Despite the dangers, Leezan refuses to give up her studies at ballet school - despite the presence of a conventional school much closer to home. 'There is a school closer to home, yes,' she admits. 'I prefer to go through the dangers for my reasons, for my ballet.' Brave: Leezan says she plans to continue her ballet training and hopes, if nothing else, to become a teacher . Angry: Teacher Wassan says she is terrified leaving school in case she returns to find it has been bombed . But with just 10 months to go before she is due to graduate from the school, she is faced with some tough decisions. Should she follow the example of 40 per cent of Iraq's musicians and dancers and leave the country? Or attempt to dance for a living at home? 'Of course I will always dream of becoming famous around all the Arab countries, Europe, America. If I stay in Baghdad, I will not gain any experience. I will not learn anything new. I will only grow within my own expertise. ''If I stay, I hope I could become a ballet teacher,' she says. 'Clearly I could train others and perform ballet at cultural events. After that, we'll see what happens.' Teacher Wassan is unconvinced. 'Graduating is it for her in ballet unless she . travels abroad,' she says. 'If she found somebody to sponsor her at the school, she . could continue as a ballet teacher. Even that's a small possibility.' High hopes: Despite the challenges, Leezan hopes to one day take to the stage at the Royal Opera House . Angrily, she adds: 'Killing, . claiming that this is prohibited, that all your work is prohibited... Before it was the opposite, it was different. Art was respected, . especially ballet. Not anymore.' Whether Leezan chooses to go abroad or not, one thing is certain: She will continue to dance whatever happens in Iraq. 'I want to dance,' she says. 'This is a natural act. There must be room for art and dancing. Maybe then, their [the extremists] mindset will change. 'If . I have to quit ballet, I will change my nationality, even if it makes me . very depressed. I will not stop dancing until I'm old.' Leezan Salam appears on Unreported World, tonight at 7.30pm on Channel .","Leezan Salam, 17, from Baghdad dreams of becoming a ballerina .

An 'ejector seat' clause in his contract, inserted in case United failed to qualify for the Champions League next season, limits his compensation to no more than 12 months of salary.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Mirrors have existed for thousands of years but the looking glass has just been given a 21st century makeover. A new digital mirror gives people X-ray vision to let them see their insides – complete with bones, organs and muscle on show. The 3D art installation, called the ‘Primary Intimacy of Being,’ recreates what a body looks like inside and eerily tracks a person’s movements as if they are seeing themselves. Scroll down for video . A new view: A 3D art installation, called the ‘Primary Intimacy of Being,’ recreates what a body looks like inside and moves along with viewers . The mirror works by using PET scans, MRI scans and X-rays of people to capture details of their anatomy in high resolution, which takes around three-and-a-half hours. This information is processed so that if the person stands in front of the 'mirror', they can see their insides because the scans and X-rays are projected on the screen in realtime. Even people who have not been scanned can see a similar person's anatomy. A Microsoft Kinect captures the participants’ movements. A gender-determining algorithm chooses whether to project a masculine or feminine form on the screen. The mirror shows a 3D image of the human body on a 65-inch screen. When a person comes sufficiently close to the projection, they see the interior of ‘their’ body as if through a magnetic resonance image. The X-ray and nuclear imaging reveal the texture of the bones and muscles, cerebral activity, the functioning of organs. The scientists said: ‘Fascinated, the participant discovers her internal organs with, which she has always lived without ever seeing them. A new intimacy is established with the stranger that is our own body.’ The mirror will go on show at the Computer-Human Interaction conference in Toronto, Canada, and viewers who experienced the technology in Paris reacted self-consciously to seeing their anatomy in a new way. One woman tried to shield herself from being laid bare on the giant black screen, which the mirror’s creators say it helps people explore how they relate to their bodies. The mirror works by using PET scans, MRI scans and X-rays of people to capture details of their anatomy in high resolution, which takes around three-and-a-half hours. This information is processed so that if the person stands in front of the 'mirror', they can see their insides because the scans and X-rays are projected on the screen in realtime. Even people who have not been scanned can see a similar person's anatomy. The mirror also knows if they are male or female thanks to a gender recognition algorithm to make a close match. The 65inch (165cm) screen uses Microsoft Kinect’s motion-capture camera to track the movements of a person standing in front of the screen, focusing on the movement of 24 joints. Laid bare: A digital mirror, which is a 3D art installation recreates what your body might look like inside and eerily tracks a person's movements as if they are seeing though themselves . Experience recorded: Xavier Maître, a medical imaging . researcher at the University of Paris-South, who came up with the . concept, observed the reactions of 30 people who were left alone with . the revealing mirror for three minutes each and then completed a . questionnaire about their experience (pictured) The X-ray and nuclear imaging reveal the texture of the bones and muscles, cerebral activity and the functioning of organs. ‘If the visitor stands in front of this mirror, gets closer or farther, she or he enters or exits her or his MRI, X-ray, or nuclear body that is reflecting her or him. She or he discovers by own means an intimacy that was hidden so far to her or him,’ the scientists said. Xavier Maître, a medical imaging researcher at the University of Paris-South, who came up with the concept, observed the reactions of 30 people who were left alone with the revealing mirror for three minutes each and then completed a questionnaire about their experience. They were shown images of other people of the same sex – to save time and so that the experiment had more impact – and the team of researchers found one third of people naturally tried to cover ‘their’ exposed bodies and felt uncomfortable. Peculiar and profound: The installation is designed to create 'a profound image; a peculiar and unexpected avatar of our identity.' Around a third of people looking at 'themselves' in a new way reported feeling self conscious . Insides revealed: The mirror shows the results of a PET scan, X-ray and MRI scan and Kinect technology animates them to match a viewer's movements . Mr Maître explained that peoples’ reactions to the mirror were similar to a child’s unsure if their reflection is actually an image of themselves. ‘It's as if you're inside your body. You're discovering something that belongs to you,’ he told New Scientist. In the study, the researchers explained that the more a person embodies an avatar, the more the avatar influences their self-perception. They said the self-conscious reaction is as old as the Greek mythological character Narcissus and that ‘standing in front of a reflecting medium is a fundamental self-perception-building experience’. Self-conscious? One woman tried to shield herself from being laid bare on the giant black screen, which the mirror's creators say helps people explore how they relate to their bodies . Mr Maître explained that peoples’ reactions to the mirror were similar to a child’s unsure if their . reflection is actually an image of themselves. Here 'naked' bodies appear to dance . Rediscovery: 'If the visitor stands in front of this mirror, gets closer or farther, she or he enters or exits her or his MRI, X-ray, or nuclear body that is reflecting her or him. She or he discovers by own means an intimacy that was hidden so far to her or him,' the scientists said . They also noted that inner images of living bodies often make people uncomfortable if they are suggesting ‘extreme nudity’. ‘This association of body interior and personal privacy is characteristic of the Western culture, for which the inner self lies deep in the body,’ they said. Mr Maitre hopes to make the experience more realistic by making the heart on the screen beat and the lungs move. While then mirror is currently an art project, he hopes the technology could be used by doctors in the future to help people prepare for operations. The digital mirror is not the only project using augmented reality for use in a medical environment. A different mirror called ‘Miracle’ projects medical imagery directly onto a person's body, while another technology can animate MRI data on a standard computer screen and show body parts that might prove troublesome in the future.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Road trips always seem like a good idea at the time, but several hours of sitting in a hot, sticky car can be enough to dampen anyone’s spirits. Now, a new gadget could mean drivers have a way to freshen up ‘al fresco’ - whether they’re travelling through the desert or stuck on the motorway. The £125 ($210) system, named the 'Road Shower; provides a hot power shower using a 5ft (1.5m) long pressurised tank fitted to the roof of a car. Scroll down for video... Outdoor adventurers craving a hot power shower can now have one by their car after an explorer developed a heated water tank to fit on the roof . When temperatures rise above 30°C, water inside the black aluminium casing heats up to a suitable temperature in around two hours. Attached to the tank is 55in (139cm) hose, which means users can also wash equipment such as bikes or surfboards. The man behind the idea is Colorado-based Joel Cotton, who had what he describes as a ‘eureka’ moment while exploring the 120 mile (193km) White Rim Trail in Utah's Canyon lands. Mr Cotton, 58, said: ‘We would ride into camp looking dusty, dirty and sweaty. Attached to the tank is 55 inch (139cm) hose, which means users can also wash equipment such as bikes or surfboards. The nozzle can be set to one of its seven settings which include shower, jet and mist . The Road Shower uses the renewable energy from the sun which heats the black surface of the tank and warms the water inside. The tank can hold five gallons (19 litres) of liquid. Once it is filled, users can pressurise the tank by inflating air into it using a bike pump - allowing it to project water up to 60ft (18m). The nozzle can be set to one of its seven settings which include shower, jet and mist. Attached to the tank is 55in (139cm) hose, which means users can also wash equipment such as bikes or surfboards . ‘We would try using solar shower bags but there was nowhere to hang them, the water would drip out and it wasn't warm. ‘As a result, I've spent the last seven years developing a shower that heats up while you drive - and came up with a rack mounted pressured solar shower.’ The Road Shower has no solar panels but uses the renewable energy from the sun which heats the black surface and warms the water inside. The tank can hold five gallons (19 litres) of liquid. Once it is filled, users can pressurise the tank by inflating air into it using a bike pump - allowing it to project water up to 60ft (18m). The nozzle can be set to one of its seven settings which include shower, jet and mist. Currently, the Kickstarter Project is the only rack mounted portable solar shower on the market and for those seeking privacy, shower Mr Cotton said curtains can be sourced elsewhere. The tank can hold five gallons (19 litres) of liquid. Once it is filled, users can pressurise the water by inflating air using a pump through a valve - allowing it to project water up to 60ft (18m). It even allows space for a bicycle rack to be attached . He added that if the temperature is below 21°C, it won't be very effective at heating water. Mr Cotton, a retired computer science professor from Glenwood Springs, said: ‘People have given us some puzzled looks when they see others' showering. ‘But a full tank should be able to do three showers if you turn it off while soaping.’ ‘You can also clip the hose to the side of the shower and turn the nozzle on so you don't have to hold the nozzle while showering. ‘Considering my first model was made from PVC, acrylic glass and an aluminium bike tray, it's come a long way.’","£125 ($210) system, named the Road Shower, uses a pressurised tank .

"By . James Chapman . Britain’s security budget will escape George Osborne’s £11.5billion cut in spending – instead winning a significant cash boost to help the fight against terrorism. MI5, MI6 and the GCHQ listening station will get a 3 per cent rise – the biggest increase of any area of Government spending, Whitehall sources have revealed. In announcing his spending plans today, the Chancellor will pledge £15billion over five years in extra infrastructure spending to boost the economic recovery. Safe: Britain's security budget will escape George Osborne's £11.5billion cut in spending - instead winning a significant cash boost to help the fight against terrorism. GCHQ in Cheltenham is pictured . But among those areas to lose out from 2015 are local government, defence and university funding. The security spending rise was settled with MI5, MI6 and GCHQ on Friday, and Mr Osborne is understood to have spoken to the heads of each agency. There will be a significant investment in the battle against cyber-terrorism amid growing concerns that the Government has not done enough to protect the UK. The police counter-terrorism budget will also be protected in real terms. Expensive: The Chancellor will today pledge £15billion over five years in extra infrastructure spending to boost the economic recovery . ‘This has been one of George’s . personal priorities. It is vitally important we look after these budgets . and they were settled last week with agreement at the very highest . level,’ a source said. The Chancellor also confirmed in the Commons yesterday that the schools and NHS budgets will again be protected. ‘These are vital public services, they are an investment in our economic future and they are all about doing what we need to do to win that economic race,’ he said. Despite criticism from some Conservatives, the foreign aid budget will also increase as the Government meets a pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on support for poorer countries. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said that asking the House for more spending cuts showed Mr Osborne was ‘unfair, out-of-touch and now revealed as totally incompetent’. The Chancellor replied: ‘Getting a lesson from you in how to balance the books is like getting a lesson from Dracula in how to look after a blood bank.’ He added: ‘I know that times are still not easy for families. But we have a clear economic plan. We’ve stuck to it. It is working. And I’m determined to go on delivering it.' Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s not good enough simply to salami-slice departmental budgets. George Osborne must be tough on cutting public spending. ‘There’s £120billion of waste just waiting to be axed if the Chancellor really wants to ease the burden on families.’","MI5, MI6 and the GCHQ listening station .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From food to medical instruments, it seems that 3D printing can be used to create almost anything. And now a team of ambitious architects are using the additive manufacturing technique to build an entire house. They are using an industrial scale 3D printer called a room builder to engineer the plastic parts that will be fused together to create everything from walls to the furniture. Scroll down for video . A team of ambitious architects are using 3D printing to build an entire house, shown in this artist's impression. Dus Architects's futuristic building is described as an exhibition, research and a building site for 3D printing architecture, which connects the science, construction and design communities . The house is the brainchild of Amsterdam-based firm Dus Architects. It is being built by the side of a canal in the north of the city and will be the world's first 3D printed house. The structure will have 13 rooms and is inspired by a traditional gable design. It is being printed by a giant 3D printer called KamerMaker or the 'room builder'. The machine will pipe thick lines of molten plastic around 10 times as large as lines printed by 'home' printers. Construction has been under way for around one month. The interior and exterior of rooms can be printed in one part and there is space within the blocks for cables, pipes and wiring because of their honeycomb and lattice design. The ‘world’s first’ 3D printed house, which is being built by a canal in north Amsterdam in the Netherlands, will boast 13 rooms when it is finished and concrete will only be used to provide structural support - at least at the moment. Amsterdam-based firm Dus Architects’s futuristic building is described as 'an exhibition, research and a building site for 3D printing architecture', which connects the science, construction and design communities. The 3D Print Canal House is being printed using the KamerMaker, which means room builder and pipes plastic lines of molten plastic on top of one another according to computerised plans – just like a gigantic version of a home 3D printer. The machine, which is made by Dutch firm Ultimaker, pipes lines around 10 times as large as a standard 3D printer and can create pieces of building that are 6ft wide, 6ft deep and 11ft tall (2metres by 2meters by 3.5metres). The KamerMaker machine pipes thick lines of molten plastic (pictured) that are around 10 times as thick as the lines drawn by 'home' 3D printers . The 3D Print Canal House is being printed using the KamerMaker, which means 'room builder' and pipes plastic lines on top of one another according to computerised plans - just like a gigantic version of a home 3D printer . Construction has been under way for around one month and so far a 9ft (three metre) high corner section has been printed, weighing 397lbs (180kg), according to The Guardian. Giant pieces like the corner will be used much like Lego bricks and stacked on top of one another to make the house, which is inspired by the traditional Dutch gabled town houses. The design consists of a number of rooms – each with unique features - which will be designed separately on site, before being assembled into the house, so experts can test their safety. Using computers to design and print the structure means that architects can create a house that has structural integrity, while also looking aesthetically pleasing so that the interior and exterior of rooms can be printed in one part. There is space within the plastic block walls for cables, pipes and wiring because of a honeycomb lattice design. The KamerMaker machine (pictured), which is made by Dutch firm Ultimaker, can create pieces of building that are 6ft wide, 6ft deep and 11ft tall (2metres by 2meters by 3.5metres) Here a small-scale 3D printer quickly makes small, scale sections of wall, the likes of which will be built for real by a giant printer . The plastic used to print the house is ‘a renewable, sustainable, strong, tactile and beautiful material that can compete with current building techniques,’ according to the architects. Scientists are currently testing different samples of materials to create the perfect one but the final ‘hot melt’ product will be approximately 80 per cent natural as it is a bioplastic mix made up of microfibres and plant oil. Hedwig Heinsman from the architect firm said: ‘We’re still perfecting the technology. We will continue to test over the next three years, as the technology evolves… It’s an experiment.’ At the moment, the lattice blocks are being filled with less sustainable concrete, which would make the structure, hard to recycle, but this seems to be an intermediary step. Using computers to design the house means that architects can create a house that has structural integrity, while also looking aesthetically pleasing so that the interior and exterior of rooms can be printed in one part. Here are some small examples of different types of walls, and the honeycomb cavities are easily visible . The plastic used to print the house (pictured) is ‘a . renewable, sustainable, strong, tactile and beautiful material that can . compete with current building techniques,’ according to the architects . If the house is a success and the technology honed, the architects hope that 3D printing could mark a new era in building houses. The cost of transporting materials and waste could be cut using the technique and the final buildings could be dismantled and moved in units, or completely recycled. Mr Heinsman said: 'This could revolutionise how we make our cities. This is only the beginning, but there could be endless possibilities, from printing functional solutions locally in slums and disaster areas, to high-end hotel rooms that are individually customised and printed in marble dust.’ Construction is under way on the 3D Print Canal House, pieces of which are being printed from piped plastic according to computerised plans (illustrated) - just like a gigantic version of a home 3D printer .","Dus Architects is building the ‘world’s first’ 3D printed house, which is located by a canal in north Amsterdam .

"By . Mark Prigg . Air pollution in China and other Asian countries is causing storms in North America to become stronger and changing weather patterns across the Northern Hemisphere, a new Nasa study has claimed. Researchers found that pollutants are strengthening storms above the Pacific Ocean, which feeds into weather systems in other parts of the world. The effect was most pronounced during the winter, the team said. Scroll down for video . The Temple of Heaven in haze-covered Beijing: Air pollution in China and other Asian countries is causing storms in North America to become stronger and changing weather patterns across the Northern Hemisphere, a study suggests. The key to the changes in weather is the Pacific storm track. This represents a critical driver in the general global circulation by transporting heat and moisture around the world, the team said. The transfer of heat and moisture appears to be increased over the storm track downstream, meaning that the Pacific storm track is intensified because of the Asian air pollution outflow. Lead author Yuan Wang, from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, said: 'There appears to be little doubt that these particles from Asia affect storms sweeping across the Pacific and subsequently the weather patterns in North America and the rest of the world. 'The effects are quite dramatic. 'The pollution results in thicker and taller clouds and heavier precipitation.' Northwest Pacific winter storms are now 10 percent stronger than they were 30 years ago, the team said. The study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In the first study of its kind, scientists compared air pollution rates from 1850 to 2000 and found that anthropogenic (man-made) particles from Asia impact the Pacific storm track that can influence weather over much of the world. The team used detailed pollution emission data compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and looked at two scenarios: one for a rate in 1850 – the pre-Industrial era – and from 2000, termed present-day. By comparing the results from an advanced global climate model, the team found that anthropogenic aerosols conclusively impact cloud formations and mid-latitude cyclones associated with the Pacific storm track. 'The climate model is quite clear on this point,' said Wang. 'The  aerosols formed by human activities from fast-growing Asian economies do impact storm formation and global air circulation downstream. Researchers found that pollutants are strengthening storms above the Pacific Ocean, which feeds into weather systems in other parts of the world, leading to heavier rainfall across North America . 'They tend to make storms deeper and stronger and more intense, and these storms also have more precipitation in them. 'We believe this is the first time that a study has provided such a global perspective.' In addition, Zhang says large amounts of aerosols and their long-term transport from Asia across the Pacific can clearly be seen by satellite images. The Pacific storm track represents a critical driver in the general global circulation by transporting heat and moisture, the team notes. The transfer of heat and moisture appears to be increased over the storm track downstream, meaning that the Pacific storm track is intensified because of the Asian air pollution outflow. 'Our results support previous findings that show that particles in the air over Asia tend to affect global weather patterns,' Zhang adds. 'It shows they can affect the Earth’s weather significantly.'","Pollutants are strengthening storms above the Pacific Ocean .

"By . Amanda Williams . Plans for a tunnel to be built under Stonehenge to tackle bottlenecks have been resurrected and are being considered by traffic experts. They are debating whether to build a dual carriageway alongside or dig an underpass beneath the ancient monument to alleviate traffic caused by visitors to the World Heritage site. In 2007, ministers shelved the plans - after the cost of the controversial 1.3 mile bored tunnel scheme on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, soared from £223 million to £540 million. Plans for a tunnel to be built under Stonehenge to tackle traffic bottlenecks have been resurrected and are being considered by road experts . Now the Government has reportedly commissioned a feasibility study examining how congestion can be eased in the area, the Telegraph reports - including the tunnel and dual carriageway. The final proposals will be outlined in the this year's Autumn Statement. Also included will be the findings of five similar road-widening proposal schemes - including widening the A27 corridor, Trans-pennine routes, and the A47 between Peterborough and Yarmouth. Two areas of the A1 around Newcastle will also be included in the study. Last  month, Conservative MP for Salisbury, led calls for the tunnel plans to be resurrected. He said any decision to make the A303 a dual carriageway must include protection for the site and added that a tunnel was the only 'realistic solution'. During a Westminster debate, Mr Glen labeled the road 'one of the most notorious traffic blackspots in the country'. They are debating whether to build a dual carriageway alongside or dig an underpass beneath the ancient monument to alleviate traffic caused by visitors to the World Heritage site . Ralph Smyth, senior transport campaigner for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said that traffic at the site had not increased in ten years and that it did not 'justify the huge cost of a tunnel'. But he said that a tunnel would be preferable to a dual carriageway, as this could cause the site to lost its World Heritage status. Last month the MoD was warned that it faces 'a global storm of protest' after it unveiled plans to build homes for soldiers near Stonehenge. Outraged experts claim that the houses would block the world-famous solstice sunrise at the Wiltshire monument. Army bosses want to build 4,000 homes for soldiers and their families returning from Germany on an old airfield overlooking the monument, but experts said the buildings would occupy the exact spot that the sun peeks over the horizon on the longest day of the year. It’s an event that’s watched by some 20,000 people and leading archaeo-astronomer Simon Banton predicted there would be uproar if the plan goes ahead.","In 2007, ministers shelved plans for a controversial 1.3 mile bored tunnel .

"By . Lizzie Parry . With rubbish strewn across the living room, dishes stacked high in the sink and a filthy bathroom, this semi-detached house in Birmingham appeared to be every estate agents' nightmare. But the three-bedroom terrace in Erdington has sold for the full asking price, after a buyer saw through the filth to bag an investment. The images on property website Zoopla revealed wall-to-wall squalor with unmade beds, piles of clothes thrown across rooms and food and rubbish left discarded on the kitchen floor. Despite being marketed with pictures revealed a spacious kitchen complete with piles of dirty dishes and rubbish strewn across the floor, this house in Erdington, Birmingham has sold for the full asking price, less than month after it went on the market . The generous lounge featuring camping chairs and stepladder among the debris, didn't appear to put off the new owners, who snapped the three-bedroom home up for £114,950 . Despite the images, estate agents Burchell Edwards, took on the challenge marketing the property for £114,950 and optimistically describing the it as a 'period style' house featuring 'Minton tiled flooring' in the vestibule and a 'generous lounge'. The property details also boasted a 'family bathroom' and a third bedroom 'bigger than your normal sized third bedroom' as well as being just half-a-mile from Erdington Train Station and local shops. The kitchen diner was described as featuring 'a range of wall and base units incorporating a one-and-a-half bowl stainless steel sink with drainer, integrated appliances to include oven, hob and microwave'. The property was viewed 14 times by prospective buyers and was on the market for one month before being snapped up for the full asking price. Burchell Edwards would not reveal the buyer’s identity but said it was a commercial investor and contracts were being exchanged to transfer ownership. Meanwhile the mystery buyer described their new investment as 'a palace'. Estate agents Burchell Edwards said the property was viewed 14 times before an offer was accepted, less than a month after it came on the market . The agent who described the third bedroom as being 'bigger than your normal sized third bedroom', refused to reveal the identity of the buyer but said it was a commercial investor . The wipes, rubber gloves and cleaning spray in the property's family bathroom clearly never had much use, but the filth has not deterred the new owner, who described the property as a 'palace' The house was listed on property site Zoopla.co.uk, where it was described as a 'traditional period style property' A traditional period style property set back off the road in need of modernisation.To the ground floor is a generous through lounge that could be split back into two receptions if required and access to the kitchen with a utility room towards the rear.To the first floor is a family bathroom and three bedrooms two of them are doubles and the third is bigger than your normal sized third bedroom.There is also a front and rear garden, the property is available with no chain. The proud new owner said: 'These are my palaces. It [the condition] will turn off ordinary folk, so the price is driven down and is more attractive to someone like me. 'I’m surprised the bank has let them [the previous tenants] leave it in that state. It’s not in a person’s interest to leave it like that.' A neighbour said the home belonged to a middle-aged couple who left the property just before Christmas. The 40-year-old, who did not want to be named, said: 'They kept themselves to themselves, but I did know them to say hello. 'There could be many reasons why they left. They might have had to look after a family member, you just don’t know.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . North and South Korea have been at war - and an uneasy truce - for decades. Now, Mark Edward Harris, an award-winning photojournalist with rare access into the secretive Northern state, is marking the 60th anniversary of the armistice which put a halt to the Korean war with a new collection of pictures from the democratic South. Harris has visited North and South Korea about eight times apiece to document life on the divided peninsula. He first travelled to North Korea in 2005 and published a book of photographs from his visits in 2007. Now, his new book of pictures from South Korea show life beyond Seoul and the Demilitarized Zone on the border of the two countries which captures so much international attention. Harris told Korea.net: 'I am not trying to make any judgment. Mark Edward Harris has travelled beyond Seoul and Pyongyang to capture the real North and South Koreas on film. Here, he photographed two small girls in matching pink coats unfazed by the sharks overhead as they walk through the enormous 6,030-ton tank in the Aqua Planet Yeosu aquarium - the biggest in South Korea . Another picture in the South Korea collection shows the right hand of the Hand of Harmony sculptures in the water off Homigot beach.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nigel Farage breaks all the political rules to boast about his smoking, drinking and visiting lapdancing clubs. The Ukip leader has built a reputation for plain-speaking and saying too much which endears him to voters and infuriates his opponents. But there is one subject he hates discussing: his wife Kirsten Mehr, a ‘stunning’ German-born bond trader who hates the limelight as much as he delights in it. Ukip leader Nigel Farage loves the limelight, but his German-born wife Kirsten is rarely seen in public . Little is known of Mrs Farage, few photographs exist and she is rarely seen in public: and that’s how Mr Farage would like to keep it. It is one of the great contradictions of the Ukip leader that while he rails against Europeans ‘coming over here’ and taking the jobs, homes and public services of Brits that he is married to a German who could move here under the rules which he wants to tear up. He jokes that being married to a foreigner is proof that he loves Europe. But wisecracks were not enough to get him out of facing difficult questions about why he employs his wife on the taxpayer. Hamburg-born Kirsten keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public. At Ukip conferences, she sits anonymously in the audience. She and Mr Farage met in Frankfurt in 1996, while he was travelling on business - and still married to his first wife, Grainne, the mother of his eldest two children. Of the moment he met Kirsten, he once said: ‘She was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance. 'She could have stepped into a pre-Raphaelite painting no questions asked.’ Mr Farage was challenged about employing his wife Kirsten during a walkabout in Sheffield . Later, he explained in typically flamboyant style: ‘My marriage, which had been on ice and torpid with its claws bound for so long we had both forgotten it was alive at all, finally expired.’ The couple divorced in 1997 and Mr Farage married Kirsten in 1999. Kirsten, gave up her career in the City, where she worked as an interpreter for a German bank, to look after the children - she and Mr Farage have two - and take her husband’s correspondence. She writes all his emails because he dislikes using computers. She is paid a salary by the European Parliament of more than £27,000 and has amassed more than £200,000 since she began working for him. She works from home and rarely visits Ukip’s HQ in London’s Mayfair, which she has described as a ‘freak show’. Yesterday the arrangement caught up with him, as he made the bizarre claim that no Brit could do that job, ‘unless they were married to me'. ‘I don’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going through emails and getting me briefed for the next day,’ he said. Mr Farage said his wife earned a ‘very modest’ wage and worked ‘extremely unsociable hours’ for ‘up to’ seven days a week. Former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire accused Mr Farage in the European Parliament of paying both his wife and 'former mistress' Annabelle Fuller using taxpayers' money. Mr Farage denies having an affair with Miss Fuller . In . 2005 there were reports of a seven times-a-night tryst with a Latvian . woman in Liga, which led to Uki colleagues presenting him with a can of . 7UP to celebrate. He has at . times dismissed the claims as ‘nonsense’ but in his memoirs recalled the . encounter: ‘I met her in a pub and accepted her invitation home for a . drink. She was sleek and seductive and I will not splutter that after . the first bottle I would necessarily have behaved like Sir Galahad.’ MEP Godfrey Bloom, Mr Farage's Brussels flatmate, has claimed the Ukip leader's weakness is women . Then . last month former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire challenged the Ukip leader . in the European Parliament over claims he employs both his wife and . ‘former mistress’ Annabelle Fuller on the taxpayer. Both Mr Farage and Ms Fuller, a Ukip press aide, deny they had an affair. Mr Farage dismissed the claims as ‘absolute nonsense’. Kirsten is said to be ‘pretty cheesed off’ about the claims. In a rare appearance in public  she told reporters outside the family’s large semi-detached home near Westerham, Kent: 'Nigel's just on his way back from Strasbourg and we will be discussing it tonight, I'm sure.’ In an interview after the claims emerged, Mr Farage gave his own account. Asked if he had sex with Ms Fuller, he replied: ‘I don’t think we should go into the grisly details.’ Has he slept with her? ‘No.’ Has he kissed her? ‘No. When you work in a tight team, I understand why people might get the wrong idea.’ It did not help that days earlier Godfrey Bloom, his Brussels flatmate and former Ukip colleague, had declared in characteristically colourful language: ‘We all have our foibles and our weaknesses – mine is real ale, I’ve never been partial to crumpet. 'Nigel’s is women. It’s not something he ever denied.’ In fact, Kirsten is said to have played a part in Mr Bloom being kicked out of the party. She was in the room at a Ukip conference fringe event for women when Mr Bloom famously described guests as ‘sluts’. She is said to have been unimpressed, and hours later Mr Bloom was suspended from the party for upstaging Mr Farage’s keynote speech. In Ukip the focus must be on the leader at all times, and the attention on his long-suffering wife will be making for uncomfortable reading for them both. Ukip leader Nigel Farage was put on the spot about whether his German wife had taken a job which could have gone to a Brit. BBC political editor Nick Robinson challenged him to explain why he employed Kirsten as a secretary on a taxpayer-funded salary from Brussels. Mr Farage insisted that 'nobody else could do that job', which included checking emails for him at midnight. ‘I don’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going through emails and getting me briefed for the next day,' he said. But a fake advert for a similar role placed by an employment agency on its website attracted 764 applications in just 12 hours - 649 of them from UK nationals.Headed 'PA Wanted For Top European Politician', it stipulated that applicants 'must be able to work long and some unsociable hours up to seven days a week' and described the pay as 'modest'. It identified the employer as Ukip, which it described as 'a Eurosceptic right-wing populist political party in the United Kingdom'. Rhys Maddock, director of Xpat Jobs, said: 'With our knowledge of the UK and European employment market, we just knew that what Farage was saying was not true. 'There are lots of highly-qualified PAs looking for work and many would jump at the chance to work for a politician such as Farage, perhaps seeing it as a stepping stone to a similar role with MPs or ministers. Asked whether a British person could take the position as his secretary, Mr Farage insisted: ‘Nobody else could do that job, not unless they were married to me.’ Mr Farage said his wife earned a ‘very modest’ wage and worked ‘extremely unsociable hours’ for ‘up to’ seven days a week.","Nigel Farage loves the limelight but his wife Kirsten is rarely seen in public .

"By . Tim Shipman . and Arthur Martin . Islamic extremist Abu Qatada won £2,000 when the court ruled he was unlawfully detained. He is one of just 202 cases that have received money from Strasbourg . Britain has lost a staggering 202 European human rights cases several of which involved murderers, terrorists, paedophiles and rapists, it emerged yesterday. Judges in Strasbourg handed the claimants taxpayer-funded payouts £1.7million which, with high legal costs, totalled £4.4million – an average of £22,000 a head. Many applicants are of good character with no criminal connections. But recipients since 1998 include the traitor George Blake, extremist cleric Abu Qatada and the IRA killer dubbed Mrs Doubtfire. The House of Commons figures fuelled fresh demands for Britain to pull out of the convention on which the European Court of Human Rights bases its rulings. Soviet spy Blake, who was jailed for 42 years, one for each of the MI6 agents he sent to their deaths, was awarded £4,700 in 2006 because Britain stopped him profiting from the memoirs he wrote when he fled to Russia.The court ruled that this breached the double agent’s ‘right to free expression’. Qatada, who was finally deported this year and was regarded as Al Qaeda’s ambassador in Europe, pocketed £2,000 because the court ruled he was unlawfully detained. Kirk Dickson kicked to death a man who refused to give him cigarettes. But he won £18,000 from the court, which said he had been denied the right to father a child by artificial insemination. Rupert Massey was jailed for six years for the abuse of three boys over a 14-year period. But he won £5,496 because he was ‘stressed’ after he waited four years for his case to reach court. IRA killer Liam Averill was dubbed Mrs Doubtfire after escaping in drag from the Maze prison in 1997. He pocketed £5,000 in 2000 while still on the run because the court said it was wrong he had no lawyer for 24 hours after his arrest. Traitors, murderers, rapists and terrorists have all received cash handouts . Tory MP Philip Davies called the shocking discovery an 'absolutely scandalous waste of money' Somali paedophile Mustafa Abdi was sentenced to eight years behind bars for raping a child. Ministers spent more than a decade trying and failing to deport him, which allowed him to pocket £7,237 for being ‘wrongfully detained’. The figures were obtained by Tory MP Philip Davies and placed in the House of Commons library. Convicted paedophile Rupert Massey was awarded £6,000 by the European Court of Human Rights because his trial was delayed for too long . He said last night: ‘To me, it’s just an absolutely scandalous waste of money. I’m not aware of my decent law-abiding constituents running off to the European Court of Human Rights. 'It is a charter for illegal immigrants and criminals. ‘We’re in a situation where we’ve got pseudo judges who are making decisions about this country. These cases highlight what an absolute racket it has become. The sooner we scrap the Human Rights Act and leave the European Convention on Human Rights the better.’ When claimants fail to get a ruling in their favour in a British court, they can go to the ECHR and the UK Government is obliged to defend the case, effectively acting as a representative of the British courts system. Claimants can also go direct to Strasbourg, bypassing the UK's legal system. That means that even when cases involve a claimant who is in dispute with a private company, the damages and compensation are still awarded against the Government – meaning taxpayers pay. But many of the cases, where the Government has had to pay up, have set potentially damaging legal precedents that end up costing taxpayers millions more than the relatively modest compensation payments. Other cases have overturned aspects of the stop and search powers and rules designed to prevent sham marriages. The case which has sparked a rethink from ministers was that of rapist Robert Greens, who complained to the European Court that banning British inmates from taking part in elections is illegal. The Government was ordered to pay Greens costs of £4,230 and to give all convicts the vote. But Parliament has voted to ignore that ruling and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has made clear that the Tories will make sure a new system they devise means Britain can refuse to obey. Mr Grayling said: ‘As I’m sure the victims and their families feel, I find it very unpalatable to such sums are being handed over to some very unpleasant individuals.’ Traitor: George Blake was jailed for 42 years, one for each of the MI6 agents he sent to their deaths. In 2006 he was awarded £4,700 because Britain stopped him profiting from his memoirs . The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Many of the court's judges are political appointees, meaning they have no legal experience . The review he has set up will examine whether the Conservatives should ditch the convention and enshrine the Supreme Court in London as the ultimate arbiter of British law in a new Bill of Rights. Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, who sat on an official review of the humans rights system, warned that unless there is a change the Strasbourg court could dramatically increase the fines in future and Britain would be powerless to resist. Britain could ‘stumble out of the European Union’ because too little has been done to make the positive case for Europe, Nick Clegg will warn today. Issuing a call to arms, the Deputy Prime Minister will say a ‘coalition for the national interest’ is needed to make the case for Britain staying in the EU.","Judges in Strasbourg paid out £4.4m legal costs and damages in human rights cases .

"Rae Dawn has since admitted 'regret' over using the racial slur but refused to make a full apology over her attack . By . Emily Sheridan . Oprah Winfrey's former Color Purple co-star Rae Dawn Chong has launched a scathing attack on the talk show host. Speaking on internet radio show Matty P's Radio Happy Hour, the Canadian actress, 52, drops the N-word and criticises the media mogul's weight and accuses her of being 'power-hungry'. Rae, who has mixed Chinese, European and Afro-Canadian heritage, claims Oprah, 59, would have been a 'house n**ger' if she had lived before the emancipation of slaves. No love lost: Rae Dawn Chong has criticised Oprah Winfrey during a radio show interview . Despite insisting she got on well with Oprah during the making of the Alice Walker film adaptation, her opinion changed when they made Commando, which was released the same year as The Color Purple. Fans of the film will know Oprah played feisty Sofia in the film, while Rae played Squeak - the girlfriend of Sofia's husband Harpo (William E Pugh). During the interview, which was first reported by TMZ, Rae swears frequently and uses the N-word twice when discussing Oprah. Host Matty P is audibly shocked after Rae said: 'If you look at the way [Oprah] looks, . she looks like 60 years ago she would have been a house keeper luckily. She would have not been a house n**ger she would have been a field . n**ger.' Screen star: Rae as Squeak in 1985 film The Color Purple . Rae has since attempted to issue an apology over the use of the racial slur in a video for TMZ. However, she appears to stands by her attack on Oprah, despite claiming she meant to use the N-word as a 'compliment'. Rae originally said her opinion of Oprah soured when she was invited to Chicago to see her talk show. She said: 'She was lovely (during The Color Purple). It was after when I starred in Commando with Maria Shriver's husband (Arnold Schwarzengger) is a movie, she was a total biatch (sic). 'She invited me to come to her show and she just wasn't having me. She’s competitive. She didn’t like me. She just wasn’t having me. 'They put me in a real s**tty hotel downtown and my son got sick and at the end of the day, it was just a nightmare. 'I ended up being backstage and she called me on stage and I was like, ""You know what, f**k you b**ch."" Oprah is all about Oprah.' Acclaim: Oprah received an Oscar nomination for her performance as Sofia in the movie . Despite her criticism, Rae insists she respects Oprah a lot for breaking barriers because she is a rare African-American women with a great deal of power. She explained: 'She's amazing, I respect her, I think . she's done great things for women of colour and women of a certain . size... but do I think she' a good person?' Rae goes on to criticise Oprah's looks and accuses the talk show host of 'brown-nosing' her way to the top. She continued: 'The thing that’s really great about Oprah that you cant take away from her is that she's a great brown-noser. 'If you were in a room with her, she would pick the most powerful person in the room and become best friends with them. 'When . we worked with her. She was the fat chick, the wannabe cheerleader in . school that was the student council president, that was best friends . with the principal... The volunteer nurse. She was the fat chick in . school that did everything so everybody loved her. That's Oprah. Love . me, love me, love me. 'You've got to respect her. No matter how vile she is, she's all about Oprah and she's boring, but you kinda . gotta go, ""Hello hats off"" like, ""You’ve done an amazing thing you have . actually shifted the DNA of the universe."" 'We have to give her props, no matter . my personal vibe with her, I gotta stop and say this woman is a miracle . and I respect her and I say kudos to you. 'She . shifted the DNA in terms of our thinking of a woman of a certain size . and a certain shade. I love her for that. I don't care what she's about. I . don't care that I know her ins and outs. I just think that she's done a . lot and I love her for that.'

Cute: William has always hinted that his son has something of a healthy appetite . Proud: Kate smiles glowingly at her little boy. It is only the fourth time the third in line to the throne has been pictured since his birth last July . As Kate carefully walked down the stairs onto the landing strip she looked effortlessly casual in a Tori Breton-style top by Ralph Lauren, her favourite J Brand skinny jeans and taupe Mint Velvet canvas pumps. She quickly pushed a pair of designer sunglasses over her eyes to combat the glare of the sun. William has always hinted that his son has something of a healthy appetite - and these new pictures certainly show George to be a bouncing little boy. George wore a white babygro and a blue and white patterned sun hat to protect his head from the fierce heat . It is only the fourth time the third in line to the throne has been pictured since his birth last July. Indeed, he has only officially been seen in the flesh once by members of the public – and that was when he left hospital with his parents when he was little more than 24 hours old. Wearing a white babygro and a blue and white patterned sun hat to protect his head from the fierce heat, George looked utterly unperturbed by his first foreign jaunt. His uncle, James, gallantly carried off his mother’s green and beige Brics hand luggage so that she could concentrate on the job in hand – a wise decision given the little prince’s size. Kensington Palace declined to comment publicly on the pictures this week but, significantly, chose not to lodge a complaint - as they have done over previous paparazzi shots of the Duchess and her son - as they were taken ‘in a public place, without any harassment or pursuit’. Indeed, the Duchess chose to take a packed commercial British Airways flight to St Vincent, mingling with other passengers before catching her small private plane to Mustique. The Duchess’s parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, also prefer to travel by BA as they are still able to obtain a staff discount with the airline. Mr Middleton was, for many years, an aircraft dispatcher with the firm while his wife was a stewardess before she started her phenomenally successful internet firm, Party Pieces. George’s doting grandparents and his aunty Pippa,were already on the island, according to well-placed sources (and indeed chose to stay on after she left). The family have taken an annual holiday on the island for several years now and this year’s trip was designed to coincide with Mrs Middleton’s 59th birthday.

Prince William stayed in England, where earlier this month he started full-time studies on an agricultural management course at Cambridge . Previously they holidayed on neighbouring Barbados – albeit at the upmarket Coral Reef Club resort – but as their fortune grew, they moved over to Mustique, favoured by both royalty and celebrities such as Mick Jagger and Elton John. The island boasts just 74 villas, two small hotels and is patrolled by eagle-eyed security guards both on and off shore. This year the Middletons again hired Rocina, a stunning £14,000-a-week beach front villa designed and built in 1971 by Oliver Messel and Arne Hasselqvist in the style of a Caribbean plantation. Four members of staff - a chef, a butler, a housekeeper and gardener - were on hand throughout the family's stay to tend to their every whim .

Indeed guests can snorkel in the crystal-clear Caribbean Sea just in front of the house. Each bedroom has its own en-suite bath and dressing rooms (two of them also have outdoor showers) and the property has an air-conditioned gym for guests who can tear themselves away from the sun and sand. Nearby is a tennis club, equestrian centre and spa. The exquisite white-washed house also offers visitors three different dining areas including an open veranda with breath-taking views out over the water and a ‘dining gazebo’.

He is undertaking a bespoke 10 week course in agricultural management course at Cambridge University and was unable to take any time off. Still, he need not worry about his air miles quite yet. The prince and his wife are due to undertake a three-week tour to Australia and New Zealand in April and are hoping to take baby George with them.

"By . Eddie Wrenn . Floating through space... Nomadic planets may pick up and harbour life as they journey around the galaxy . Researchers have come up with a startling suggestion for how life could propagate across our galaxy. Identifying the mathematical hole between the expected mass of our galaxy - The Milky Way - and what is observed, they theorise that there are billions and billions of 'nomadic' planets, unaffiliated to any particular star, floating through the darkness of space. The scientists from the Astrobiology department at the University of Buckingham have proposed that these planets . originated in the early Universe, within a few million years of the Big . Bang, and that they make up most of the so-called 'missing mass'. The scientists calculate that these planetary body would cross the inner solar system every 25 million years on average - and during each transit, dust from the neighbourhood, including living cells, would become implanted at its surface. These free-floating planets would then end up mixing harbouring the living cells . with the planet's own make-up, and life could spread by this method on a galaxy-wide scale. Since 1995, when the first extrasolar planet was reported, interest in searching for planets has reached a feverish pitch. The 750 or so detections of exo-planets are all of planets orbiting stars, and very few, if any, have been deemed potential candidates for life. The possibility of a much larger number of planets was first suggested in earlier studies where the effects of gravitational lensing of distant quasars by intervening planet-sized bodies were measured. Recently several groups of investigators have suggested that a few billion such objects could exist in the galaxy. The planets of our solar system are anchored in orbit around the sun, in contrast to nomadic planets which simply drift through the ether . The team, led by Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, have increased this grand total of planets to a few hundred thousand billion (a few thousand for every Milky Way star) - each one harbouring the legacy of cosmic primordial life. Their findings are published online in the Springer journal Astrophysics and Space Science.","Hundreds of thousand billion planets could be floating nomadically through the galaxy .

"By . Mark Prigg . Nasa has released these stunning images of the Sun which show the biggest solar flare of the year. The huge eruption on April 11th caused a temporary radio blackout on Earth, officials . say. However, they warn the worst is yet to come - with this year expected to see the sun reach its 11 year solar maximum. Scroll down for video . Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured this image of an M6.5 class flare at 3:16 EDT on April 11, 2013. The huge eruption on April 11th caused a temporary radio blackout on Earth, and is the biggest of the year so far, officials say . NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured this image of the flare. This image shows a combination of light in wavelengths of 131 and 171 Angstroms. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot . pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the . ground, however -- when intense enough -- they can disturb the . atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel. This disrupts the radio signals for as long as the flare is ongoing, anywhere from minutes to hours. The solar flare occurred at 3:16 a.m. EDT (0716 GMT) and registered as a . M6.5-class sun storm, a relatively mid-level flare on the scale of . solar tempests. It coincided with an eruption of super-hot solar plasma . known as a coronal mass ejection. 'This is the strongest flare seen so far in 2013,"" NASA spokeswoman . Karen Fox explained in a statement. 'Increased numbers of flares are . quite common at the moment, since the sun's normal 11-year cycle is . ramping up toward solar maximum, which is expected in late 2013.' Humans have tracked this solar cycle . continuously since it was discovered, and it is normal for there to be . many flares a day during the sun's peak activity, Nasa said. Officials dubbed today's solar flare . as a 'spring fling' for the sun, which has been relatively calm as it . heads into its peak activity period. The M6.5 flare on the morning of April 11, 2013, was also associated with an Earth-directed coronal mass ejection (CME), another solar phenomenon that can send billions of tons of solar particles into space and can reach Earth one to three days later. The joint ESA/NASA Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) captured this series of images of the coronal mass ejection (CME) on the morning of April 11, 2013 over the course of 3:48 EDT to 4:36 EDT. Mars can be seen on the left. CMEs can affect electronic systems in . satellites and on the ground. Experimental NASA research models show . that the CME began at 3:36 a.m. EDT on April 11, leaving the sun at over . 600 miles per second. The M-class solar flare was about 10 times weaker than X-class flares, which are the strongest flares the sun can unleash. M-class solar flares are the weakest solar events that can still trigger space weather effects near Earth, such as communications interruptions or spectacular northern lights displays. The solar flare triggered a short-lived radio communications blackout on Earth that registered as an R2 event (on a scale of R1 to R5), according to space weather scales. When aimed directly at Earth, major solar flares and coronal mass ejections can pose a threat to astronauts and satellites in orbit. They can interfere with GPS navigation and communications satellite signals in space, as well as impair power systems infrastructure on Earth. SOHO also captured this coronagraphic (a telescopic attachment designed to block out the direct light from a star so that nearby objects can be seen) image of the CME as it moves .","Flare caused temporary radio blackout on Earth .

"By . Helen Pow . A heroic teacher talked a shooter, aged just 12, into dropping his weapon this morning, just moments after the child walked into a packed gymnasium and opened fire at his classmates, leaving a 12-year-old boy fighting for life and a 13-year-old girl in serious condition. After the first shots rang out at Berrendo Middle School, the unidentified educator was quick to react, throwing himself towards the armed youngster and convincing him to lay his shotgun on the ground, New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Roswell ISD superintendent Tom Burris revealed in a Tuesday afternoon press conference. 'The student was quickly stopped by one staff member who walked right up to him and asked him to put down the firearm which he did,' Governor Martinez told reporters. Burris added: 'In the 10 seconds that transpired from the time this thing started until the teacher had control of the weapon there was no cowardice, there was protection for our kids.' The two victims were first taken to Eastern New Mexico Medical Center and then airlifted to the University of Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, where the young man reportedly told nurses he was the target of the shocking . spray of bullets. He was undergoing surgery this afternoon. Scroll down for video . Tears: Students are reunited with family following a shooting at Berrendo Middle School, Tuesday, January 14, 2014 . Security: Students surrounded by officials are escorted from Berrendo Middle School after the shooting, which injured two teens . A teacher also suffered minor injuries but refused medical aid so he could stay on to assist at the scene. Roswell police announced soon after the shooting that the suspect had been arrested at the campus and was in custody. At the press conference, New Mexico state police chief Pete N. Kassetas said the drama unfolded at the school around 7:30 a.m. '(The suspect) walked into the gymnasium. We believe the weapon was concealed in a bag and it wasn't known about until right before he started shooting,' he said. Witnesses said the 12-year-old victim was shot in the face, though officials refused to confirm this. Kassetas said the school's principal recognized a NM state police lieutenant who was dropping off his own child as she locked the door and asked for his help. However, when he arrived inside the gym, the weapon was already on the ground. He went on to applaud the bravery of school officials. 'It is one thing for a police officer whose job this is to intervene but for a teacher or staff member to intervene, I commend the principal and the teachers and people at this school for saving many more lives,' he said. Too much: A parent falls to their knees as they hear more about the early morning shooting . Police: Police were on hand at the chaotic parking lot as frightened parents waited for their children . Kassetas said detectives were conducting interviews with over 100 students and faculty as part of the investigation but they were confident the 12-year-old was acting alone. He didn't know a motive at this stage and said officers had been in touch with the parents of the suspected shooter and both victims. Superintendent Burris insisted security at his schools was not to blame and said the incident came as a total shock to all. 'We come to school daily thinking we are going to educate our kids and lead them but we never think things like today will ever happen,' he said. 'And they do.' Roswell Mayor Jere Wood told reporters he was devastated by the news and called for an end to such senseless acts of violence. 'We were saddened this morning when we heard of the shooting we were saddened for the victims and their injuries and the hurt it has brought to the community of Roswell,' he said, offering up any resources the ISD required for things like counseling. Earlier, Gabriel Tortillo, a 7th grade student at Berrendo, told the Albuquerque Journal he saw a male student carrying a gun. He said that student shot a boy in the eye area. Sixth grade student Anyssa Vegara said she was talking to a security guard when she heard the shot. 'I turned around and all I saw was someone on the floor with their arm bleeding,' the student said. Relief: Kathy Sigala cries as she hugs 11-year-old Zippy and 12-year-old Jade. 'I just want to take them home and love the,' she said . Shooter: No information about the shooter or the type of weapon used has been released . She said the security guard ran to help the injured student, and school officials ordered all the students to their classrooms. It was earlier reported that there were . at least four victims, but the injured kids appeared to have been counted twice - . once at each hospital. Roswell PD posted word of the shooting on its Facebook page not long after 8 a.m. local time. The . school was placed on lockdown and children were bused from the school . to a nearby mall where their terrified parents came to collect them. Eventually, Anyssa was able to text her mother, Monica Vegara. 'From the time hearing about it, until the time she texted, it was a nightmare,' the panicked mother told the Journal.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Chicago man has caught on video what could be the worst effect yet of the polar vortex: A burst pipe raining a storm of human waste through the ceiling of his advertising agency office. Kasey Moore, an advertising art director for Arc Worldwide, posted the stomach churning scene from the 15th floor of the Leo Burnett skyscraper Tuesday afternoon and the content is not suited for the faint of heart. It shows a sea of brown water filling up the office floor as more continues to gush down in a torrent onto the sprawling room’s desks and cubicles as horrified workers scramble to get out of the way. Scroll down for video... It's raining, it's pouring: As if the polar vortex couldn't get any worse, a burst pipe in a Chicago skyscraper caused a sewage storm to rain down on the Arc Worldwide ad agency . ‘So, this is happening on my floor at work,’ writes Moore on Instagram. ‘Poo eruption.’ It remained unclear from the video how widespread the leak was, but at over a million square feet, the 50-story tower can undoubtedly contain enough sewage to rain on a lot of employees’ parades. A spokesperson for the building officially denied that the brown liquid described by some as 'smelly' actually contained feces. 'While we appreciate the creativity, rest assured that it's only dust and water,' the spokesperson told Business Insider via e-mail. Moore’s appears to be the most vivid post yet of the ‘poo eruption,’ but some of his office mates have taken to social media to document the destruction as well.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former Stanford University student was mistakenly suspected as a terrorist and placed on the government's 'no-fly' list for nine years because an FBI agent checked the wrong box on her form. Rahinah Ibrahim, 48, an architect and scholar, is finally allowed to return to the United States after fighting to clear her name since 2005. In January of that year, Ibrahim was arrested and detained for two hours at San Francisco Airport as she boarded a flight to her native Malaysia with her 14-year-old daughter. TSA officers told her she was a terrorist watch-list, but then said it was a mistake and that she was clear to fly, reports The San Francisco Chronicle. When she tried to return from Malaysia two months later, she was told that her student visa had been revoked under a terrorism law. Rahinah Ibraham, a scholar from Malaysia living in the US on a student visa - had been fighting the federal government for years trying to figure out why she was placed on the TSA¿s no-fly list . Ibrahim and her daughter were deported back to Malaysia, where they are believed to have remained since. U.S. District Judge William Aslup of San Francisco presided over Ibrahim's trial, which was the first-ever challenge to the no-fly list and held behind behind closed doors because of the government's insistence on secrecy. On Thursday Alsup released most of his 38-page ruling. He found that the government had violated Ibrahim’s rights, has admitted that she poses no threat to national security and must allow her to apply for re-entry to the U.S. But he didn’t order her readmitted and said such decisions are within the government’s discretion. Alsup said the reason for the initial mistake was that FBI special agent Kevin Kelly, who was investigating Ibrahim for reasons the government won’t disclose, had 'misunderstood the directions' on a government form and 'checked the wrong boxes' — ignoring written instructions that she should not be placed on the no-fly list, according to The Chronicle. Alsup didn’t say what boxes Kelly was supposed to check or why. Where it all started: Rahinah Ibrahim was flying from San Francisco International to Malaysia with her daughter in January 2005 when the problem first started. She was arrested and detained for two hours . 'This was no minor human error but an error with palpable impact, leading to the humiliation, cuffing, and incarceration of an innocent and incapacitated air traveler,' Alsup said, noting that Ibrahim was then using a wheelchair after undergoing surgery. 'Whether true or not, she reasonably suspects that (her current travel restrictions) are traceable to the original wrong that placed her on the no-fly list.' The judge said the U.S. government must clear up Ibrahim’s records and tell her whether she is back on the terrorist watch-list. But he said the government still has the authority to deny a visa to Ibrahim, after reviewing her forthcoming application, and there’s not much that the courts could do about it. Ibrahim is now a professor and dean of a college of design and architecture in Malaysia.","Rahinah Ibrahim attended Stanford University on an international student visa .

"By . Leon Watson . and Daily Mail Reporter . A holidaymaker was killed on a motorway after getting out of a car on the  way to the airport following a row with his wife over their credit card. Nahinmu Nicholas had stormed out of the Ford Focus with his suitcases, saying he was going to hitch-hike to Heathrow, but was knocked down by a lorry in the morning darkness. His wife had pulled over on what they both thought was the hard shoulder of the M25, not realising that it was a live lane because of roadworks. A coroner was told that lorry driver Martin Hook was unable to avoid Mr Nicholas as he suddenly caught sight of him. (File picture) An inquest has heard Nahinmu Nicholas died after his wife pulled over on what they both thought was the hard shoulder on the M25. He was then hit by a lorry . His 13-tonne bread lorry also struck . the couple’s car in the accident just six minutes after they had stopped . on the clockwise carriageway of the M25 at junction 6 for Godstone, . Surrey, at around 4.30am on April 10. Florence . Olokun-Ola told the inquest in Woking, Surrey, that her husband was . going to Nigeria alone for 12 days and that the fight started because . she wanted their bank card while he was away. ‘The argument became very . aggressive and his voice changed,’ she added. Mrs . Olokun-Ola, who had earlier told how financial problems had caused . tension in their relationship, said she no longer felt comfortable . driving and pulled over to what she thought was the hard shoulder. She . added: ‘He took off his seat belt. As soon as the car stopped he took . the keys and opened the boot and took out his luggage. He put it by the . crash barrier.’ In an . attempt to get her husband back in the car Mrs Olokun-Ola drove forward a . bit, but he started to walk back down the carriageway  trying to thumb a . lift. The couple were on their way to Heathrow Airport near London where Mr Nicholas was going to catch a flight . Then she felt the force of the  collision as the lorry struck the rear of her car. ‘I . got out the car and at first I was angry because he didn’t come . running over to see if I was okay,’ she said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . It's a murder case that has been ongoing for 12 years, but on Tuesday it took a Miami jury just two and half hours to convict Michel Escoto of the first degree murder of his wife, Wendy Trapaga. Escoto sat emotionless as the decision was ready, while Trapaga's mother cried and through her hands up in prayer, overwhelmed that her daughter can finally rest in peace. The 42-year-old was found guilty of killing his 21-year-old bride in Otcober 2002, just four days after their wedding, in order to claim her $1 million life insurance policy. 'The truth is out and heâ€™s finally going to pay after almost 12 years,' Rita Stephan, Trapaga's sister, told CBS. Scroll down for video . Finally: Michel Escoto was found guilty of the 2002 murder of his wife Wendy Trapaga, 21, in Miami . Prosecutors said Wendy Trapaga, pictured, was drugged before strangled and bashed with a tire iron. Her husband has now been found guilty of her murder . The mother of victim Wendy Trapaga prays as the sentence is read out . In the closing arguments of Escoto's murder trial in Miami-Dade Circuit Court on Monday, prosecutor Gail Levine told jurors that Escoto had planned to drug Trapaga with crushed up sleeping pills and drown her in the jacuzzi of a Miami hotel they had booked into. But the plan failed when Trapaga woke up in the water. He then strangled her and beat her to death with a tire iron, dumping her body in a Miami-Dade warehouse district. The closing arguments brought to an end a month of testimony that included more than 20 witnesses and hundreds of pieces of evidence, The Miami Herald reported. Michel Escoto (right) acted as his own attorney until Monday, when stand-by counsel Terry Lenamon (left) stepped in to deliver the defense's closing arguments.

Myriam Banitez holds a photo of her daughter Wendy Trapaga and son-in-law Michel Escoto in 2002. Her daugher was found murdered and her husband was charged . Escoto, 42, who represented himself for most of the trial, is charged with first-degree murder and is likely to be sentenced to life in prison as a result of the guilty verdict. Escoto's behavior throughout the trial has caused much courtroom drama. At one point, Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez sentenced Escoto to 30 days in jail for contempt of court after he threatened Jorge Borron, the civil lawyer for Trapagas family, who was testifying and proclaimed Escoto a murderer. 'For a moment, you got to see the real Michel Escoto,' Levine told jurors. 'Those are his true colors.' On Monday he surprised observers by allowing 'stand-by' counsel Terry Lenamon to finish the case. Lenamon attacked the prosecution's case, saying the state exaggerated and over-dramatized the evidence during the 'vilification of Michel Escoto'. Yolanda Cerrillo was the star witness in the murder case against Michel Escoto on Tuesday, March 25, 2014. She testified that she helped Escoto plan and carry out the murder of his new bride, Wendy Trapaga, 21, in 2002 . The prosecution called Yolanda Cerillo 'evil, pathetic and selfish' after she admitted to helping murder Wendy Trapaga . 'This is not community theater,' Lenamon said. 'This is a court of law.' Escoto was long the suspect in Trapaga's death. Prosecutors described him as a womanizer who kept several ex-girlfriends, even as he planned Trapaga's demise. He persuaded her to go along with the life insurance policy while pressuring her to marry him in a rushed courthouse wedding. A few days after the ceremony they checked into the Executive Airport Motel at 6700 NW 12th St. To police, he initially claimed the two left the motel after getting into an argument, and she stormed off on her own after dropping him off at their South Beach apartment. The defense speculated that Trapaga, who they had 'multiple boyfriends' and 'was going to sex clubs', met up with someone who was the real killer. Myriam Beneitz, mother of Wendy Trapaga, listens to Yolanda Cerrillo testify in the murder case against Michel Escoto on Tuesday, March 25, 2014 . 'We don't know what occurs after she left the apartment,' Lenamon said. Prosecutors shot back, citing the medical examination of her body - Trapaga was too drugged-up to have been able to drive Escoto home that night. The state also had a powerful witness for the trial. Escoto's ex-girlfriend, Yolanda Cerrillo, who admitted to jurors she helped him plan the murder by grinding up powerful painkillers to knock Trapaga out. Together they also practiced how to drown the young woman, Cerrillo said. She also admitted to whisking him away from the crime scene and agreeing on a cover story. The details were intimate: Cerrillo described how the smell of blood made her so ill she had diarrhea and had to defecate on the side of a causeway as Escoto flung the murder weapon into Biscayne Bay. 'You don't make that up,' Levine said. Cerrillo, 40, a Homestead accountant, began cooperating in 2006, but admitted she failed to tell investigators the full extent of her involvement until August 2011. The state attorney's office, with little evidence against her, had no choice but to grant her immunity from prosecution. 'One sorry, pathetic soul. Evil. Selfish,' Levine told jurors, adding: . 'I can't charge her. I'd love to. But I can't.' Last fall, a civil jury ordered Cerrillo to pay Trapaga's family $44 million in a wrongful death lawsuit. The defense, however, insisted that Cerrillo concocted the entire story only after she believed Escoto might have implicated her.","Michel Escoto has been convicted of murdering his wife of four days, Wendy Trapaga, in 2002 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Tony Blair must not be allowed to delay the release of the Chilcot report into the Iraq War, a former Labour Attorney General warned today. Lord Morris called for ‘urgent clarification’ on whether Mr Blair, ex-PM Gordon Brown or the Cabinet Office are to blame for the delay in publication. The former law officer in Mr Blair’s first Cabinet urged David Cameron to make a ‘firm decision’ to release the report well ahead of next year’s General Election. Lord Morris, Attorney General in Tony Blair's first Cabinet, called for an urgent clarification of why the Chilcot report has not been published. Mr Blair, pictured today, has denied he is to blame for the delay . Mr Brown launched the inquiry by Sir John Chilcot in June 2009, soon after becoming Prime Minister. The inquiry last took evidence from a witness three years ago. There is mounting speculation that the process of declassifying documents, including Mr Blair’s correspondence with President George W Bush before the war, has stalled. Last week Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg expressed his frustration at the lengthy delays and suggested Mr Blair is to blame – a claim denied by the former prime minister’s office. Today Lord Morris, who spent two decades on the Labour frontbench, warned there is ‘now the real danger is that the publication will run into the 2015 election’. The Iraq Inquiry, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, was announced in 2009 and took evidence from the last witness three years ago . The British public may come to view the impact of the Iraq war 'differently', Tony Blair has claimed. In a speech in central London, the former Prime Minister defended the use of military intervention and warned of the failure to put boots on the ground in Libya and Syria. Mr Blair said: 'We change the regimes in Afghanistan and in Iraq, put soldiers on the ground in order to help build the country, a process which a majority of people in both countries immediately participated in, through the elections. But that proved immensely difficult and bloody. 'We change the regime in Libya through air power, we don't commit forces on the ground, again the people initially respond well. 'But now Libya is a mess and a mess that is de-stabilising everywhere around it.' He went on: 'It does not mean that we have to repeat the enormous commitment of Iraq and Afghanistan. It may well be that in time people come to view the impact of those engagements differently. But there is no need, let alone appetite, to do that.' Writing in the Daily Mirror, he urged Mr Cameron to commit to publication as soon as possible. ‘Who is responsible for the delay? Not Chilcot and his colleagues, who must be anxious to publish,’ Lord Morris said. ‘Two . past Prime Ministers - Gordon Brown and Tony Blair? A cabinet office . fighting to maintain a precedent that cabinet minutes and discussions . between the two previous Prime Ministers should be permanently kept . private? ‘Parliament deserves a clear statement from Mr Cameron as to the reasons for the delays.’ Cabinet Office officials insist that the declassification of the documents will be completed ‘soon’. But only after that will inquiry chairman Sir John begin the so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process of warning figures like Mr Blair, Gordon Brown and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw that they face criticism over the decision to go to war. Lord Morris added: ‘What urgently needs clarification now is where the main hold-up is. ‘Prevarication by either of the two ex-PMs? Masterly inactivity by the present Prime Minister and his Cabinet? 'Opposition by the Cabinet Office, who must have advised Gordon Brown in his statement to Parliament? Or the stringing out of the process of Maxwellisation?’ A report last week suggested that Sir John’s review may not be produced until next year, potentially making Iraq an issue in the 2015 general election campaign – something that concerns Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has sought to distance his party from the Blair years. Mr Blair has denied knowledge of the reason for the delays, telling a journalist: ‘I don’t know anything more than you do.’ Lord Morris served as Attorney General from 1997 to 1999. He had previously served on the Labour frontbench under Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock and John Smith. He was the Welsh Secretary in the Cabinet under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan.","Lord Morris slams unacceptable delay to report, five years after it launched .

"By . Tim Shipman . [captionUK] . Critics of David Cameron's decision to increase foreign aid to Pakistan came under fire today after it emerged that fewer than one per cent of Pakistanis paid any income tax. A cross-party group of MPs warned that British taxpayers should no longer be made to bail out Pakistan's poor when wealthy Pakistanis refuse to pay taxes themselves. Revelations about the scale of tax avoidance in Pakistan come as the UK prepares to boost its aid to the country by nearly £180m. The International Development Select Committee warns that ‘corruption is rife’ in Pakistan and that the local elite ‘does not pay meaningful amounts of tax’. Those accused of not paying all the tax they should include President Asif Ali Zardari, former Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani, and Interior Minister Rehman Malik. The UK government has announced plans to end aid to India by 2015, but at the same time the amount of money going to its neighbour Pakistan is set to soar from £267 million now to £446 million in 2014/15, making it the biggest recipient of foreign aid. During their inquiry MPs were told that while one in three people in Pakistan live on less than 30p a day, around 70 per cent of the nation’s MPs do not file a tax return.  The country has one of the smallest tax bases in the world, with only 0.57 per cent of Pakistanis paying income tax last year. Critics say while some of them pay tax on their official salary, it is often negligible compared to the the tax they ought to pay over all their undeclared income streams. The MPs today demand that Prime Minister David Cameron pushes for action on corruption and tax evasion from Pakistan’s leaders. And the Committee is calling for the Government to use its influence within the International Monetary Fund to press for urgent reform of the tax system. Most British money sent to Pakistan goes towards education, health and governance issues. But the report takes aim at the Department for International Development (Dfid) for failing to put action to tackle corruption, failures of the rule of law and low tax collection at the top of the agenda for its governance work in Pakistan. The MPs conclude: ‘Any increase in the UK’s official development assistance to Pakistan must be conditional on Pakistan increasing its tax collection and widening the tax base. ‘We cannot expect the people in the UK to pay taxes to improve education and health in Pakistan if the Pakistan elite is not paying income tax. ‘We cannot advocate that the British people finance, through taxation, the proposed substantial increase in development assistance to Pakistan unless there is clear evidence that the newly elected Pakistan Government is also willing to make the necessary changes so as to contribute more to improving the livelihood of its people.’ The findings of MPs led by Malcolm Bruce, left, will anger critics of David Cameron's commitment to foreign aid . In a damning indictment of the Pakistani elite, the MPs conclude: ‘Corruption is rife in a social order based on patronage and kinship networks. 'Pakistan’s rich do not pay taxes and exhibit little interest in improving conditions and opportunities for Pakistan’s poor.’ The committee said that there was a 'powerful case' for continuing UK aid. Committee chairman the Liberal Democrat MP Sir Malcolm Bruce said: 'There is a powerful case for maintaining the UK's bilateral aid to Pakistan. 'Britain enjoys a close relationship and has long established ties with Pakistan which has real poverty and serious security problems. Poverty continues to be a serious problem in Pakistan, where one in three lives on less than 30p a day . ‘Many people in Pakistan who live below the poverty line gain from the projects supported by the UK Department for International Development’s valuable programmes in education, health and governance. ‘But the committee is concerned that not enough tax is raised in Pakistan to fully finance improvements in the quality of life for poor people. 'In particular, we cannot expect people in the UK to pay taxes to improve education and health in Pakistan if the Pakistani elite does not pay meaningful amounts of income tax. ‘Pakistan’s rich must in turn demonstrate a clearer commitment to improving conditions and basic opportunities for all their fellow citizens by paying more in tax than they do under present arrangements.’ A spokesman for the Dfid told MailOnline tax reform was needed in Pakistan 'from the top down'. He said: 'This IDC report rightly sets out the urgent need for the incoming Pakistan government to deliver tax reform. 'That reform must start from the top down, with elected politicians and the wealthiest in Pakistan showing a commitment to reform by submitting tax returns and paying tax due. 'The UK government is clear that UK development assistance in Pakistan is predicated on a commitment to economic and tax reform and to helping lift the poorest out of poverty. 'We have made it clear to government and opposition politicians in Pakistan that it is not sustainable for British tax payers to fund development spend if Pakistan is not building up its own stable tax take. 'Following the election we will make available practical assistance to the incoming government to help deliver reform of the Pakistan tax system and work with the IMF, but tax and economic reform must take place.' Sir Gerald Howarth, the Tory MP for Aldershot, said that for Britain to continue to devote 0.7 per cent of its expenditure to aid did not make sense, and added that spending at such a rate would mean cuts to our own defence budget. He told The Times: 'It is not right that the British taxpayer, particularly in these times of austerity, should be shelling out aid. They are subsidising tax avoidance in Pakistan. It is simply outrageous. ' But Pakistan's High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that the country was now cracking down on tax avoidance, with those who did not pay tax now banned from running for office. He said Britain should continue to prop up the country after its infrastructure had been destroyed by warring in the area. Mr Hasan told the BBC: 'I would say that they [Britain] should continue paying knowing well what sort of problems we have [been] put into by this 30-year-long war against terrorism in the region...' 'We have spent $67bn (£44bn) since 2011 in this war against terror, our infrastructure has been destroyed, our education has been destroyed.'","British aid for Pakistan will soar from £267m now to £446m in 2014/15 .

Adorable Ippo, who has the colouring of a donkey but the distinctive stripes of a zebra, is reported to be in good health. Her incredible conception is an example of love - or perhaps simple lust - conquering all. Ippo is a rare zonkey - the offspring of a zebra father and a donkey mother. She has characteristics of both her parents' species . Against all odds: Ippo came into being after a zebra at an animal reserve in Florence, Italy, climbed his protective fence and had sex with a donkey . The zebra, who was rescued from a failing zoo, was so randy that he climbed his protective fence and made love to a Donkey of Amiata, an endangered species, in a neighboring field. Serena Aglietti, one of the employees at the reserve, told ABC, 'Ippo is the only one of her kind in Italy.' A zonkey is a type of zebroid, the offspring of any cross between a zebra and any other equine. In the majority of cases, the sire is a zebra stallion. A zorse is the offspring of a male zebra and a female horse, while a zony is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a pony mare and can even be ridden. Family: Ippo with her mother and father .

"By . Associated Press . and Helen Pow . A southwest Missouri youth football coach accused of kidnapping and killing a 10-year-old girl is now also facing rape and sodomy charges. Greene County prosecutors added the new charges against Craig Michael Wood, 46, of Springfield on Monday. Court documents indicate the additional charges in the February death of Hailey Owens stem from newly available autopsy results. The fourth-grader was abducted while walking home from her best friend's house, just two blocks from her own home. Neighbors reported watching in horror and unsuccessfully giving chase as Hailey was pulled into a pickup truck that sped away. She was found dead hours later in the basement of Wood's home. Scroll down for video . Accused: Craig Michael Wood, pictured left on March 26, enters the courtroom for a hearing. The middle school football coach is charged with first-degree murder, armed criminal action and child kidnapping in connection with 10-year-old Hailey Owens' death and now rape and sodomy . Loving: Hailey's aunt, Erin Petersen, described the 10-year-old, pictured, as 'an absolute ray of sunshine' Wood is scheduled for a preliminary . hearing Thursday, but public defender Patrick Berrigan said in a brief . interview that he plans to ask for a delay because of the new charges. 'We'll file a request to strike, or to postpone the hearing,' he said Tuesday. Wood . was a 16-year football coach at a middle school in Springfield, about . 160 miles southeast of Kansas City. He also worked as a substitute . teacher and teacher's aide overseeing suspensions. A police search of his home found child pornography and more than a dozen guns, according to search warrants. Prosecuting . Attorney Dan Patterson has said Hailey was shot in the back of the head . and had ligature marks on her wrists, suggesting she was tied up. The . prosecutor, who has said he is considering whether to seek the death . penalty, declined to further discuss the new charges. Wood . had little criminal history, according to online court records. He . pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance in 1990 in Greene . County and was fined $100. Wood . also was convicted in 2001 for illegal taking of wildlife, a . misdemeanor. Friends said Wood is an amateur bluegrass musician and . hunter who never married or had children and whose parents raised show . horses. Wood is already . facing charges of murder, child kidnapping and armed criminal action. Hailey's biological parents filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Wood . last month. The . heartbreaking revelation that the girl was also raped and sodomized . comes a few weeks after her mother came face-to-face with the suspect . for the first time. Difficult moment: Stacey Barfield, mother of Hailey Owens, and her husband, Jeff, are pictured at the March 26 hearing for Craig Michael Wood . Death: If a jury finds that Wood, center, sexually abused Hailey before he killed her, it could be a reason for them to recommend the death penalty . Hailey Owens' body was found stuffed in trash bags in Wood's basement. On . March 26, Wood appeared in court for a preliminary hearing. Wood arrived in court clean-shaven and . with short hair. He kept his eyes down throughout the short hearing on . legal motions and never once looked over at where Hailey's family, . including her mom Stacey Barfield, was sitting. Earlier last month, thousands of people held a candlelight vigil and walked through Springfield in honor of Hailey. As many as 10,000 people took place in the show of solidarity, officials told the News-Leader, and they remembered the young girl for how she lived - not how horribly she died. 'There . are no words to describe our community's broken heart,' Mayor Pro Tem . Jeff Seifried said, according to the paper. 'There are no words to . describe our frustration. The unthinkable has happened in our . community.' Others chose to focus on the positive energy the fourth grade student infused everyone she came in touch with. 'Tonight is about Hailey, not the crime,' Angela Boeddeker told the paper. She brought yellow ribbons for people to wear. 'I just knew her as a friend,' fifth-grader Russell Wise recalled. 'A good nice friend.' 'She was a nice friend,' twin Kyle said. 'She was creative and fun to play with.' Musician: Wood's band, Uncle Fudd, also released a statement following the killing, saying: 'Uncle Fudd would like to express our deepest sympathy to the family of Hailey Owens.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this devastating time' Accused killer: Craig Michael Wood, pictured, was charged on February 19, 2014, with first-degree murder in the death of 10-year-old Hailey . Body: Police and FBI agents were at Wood's house investigating after finding Hailey's body in the basement . 'Many . changed the words from 'This little light of mine' to 'this is Hailey’s . light, I’m going to let it shine' while marching through the small . city. The slain girl's . family also cried while walking in the procession. Jim and Genie Wood, the presumed killer's parents, said through a family . spokesman that they 'join the rest of the community in praying as their . hearts pour out to the Owens family.' Wood . was driving his parent's car when he allegedly abducted fourth grader . Hailey Owens from a suburban street one February evening, throwing her into . the vehicle 'like a rag doll' before speeding off. Early the next morning, the little girl's body was found is trash bags in the basement of Wood's Springfield home. 'She's . in heaven. With angel wings,' Hailey's devastated mother, Stacey . Barfield, told KYTV as she visited a makeshift memorial where . her daughter was abducted. 'At least she's not hurting.' With Hailey's aunt Sara Wells and another relative, Barfield broke down sobbing as she knelt beside . the memorial. They had gathered at the abduction site to . retrieve some of the dozens of floral arrangements and stuffed animals . left by well-wishers. Wells called her niece a bubbly girl who loved to laugh, smile and dance. 'She was pure gold,' Wells said. Meanwhile, Hailey's father, Markus Owens, told a local TV station, 'All I can say right now is I miss her and I love her.' Thousands in support: As many as 10,000 people turned out to honor Hailey Owens after her murder.

Too much: Stacey Barfield, mother of Hailey Owens, foreground left, is consoled by Sara Wells, as family member Teri Nord, right, arranges flowers left by well wishers near the site where the 10-year-old girl was abducted . Hailey was remembered as a vivacious . spirit - a trusting little girl whose cheery disposition only deepened . the heartbreak the community is trying to make sense of. 'It . has completely shocked this community,' Joe Bridges, a Springfield . resident who has helped organize a weekend vigil in the little girl’s . memory, told the Kansas City Star. 'People . can't believe this would happen. It's just the fact that she wasn't far . from her home, then instantly, poof, she's gone.' Public anger was still palpable in the tight-knit community, as questions persist about the suspect's . background and motive. Wood, a 16-year football coach at a middle school . who also worked as a substitute teacher and teacher's aide overseeing . suspensions, was allegedly found by police holding duct tape as he left . his father's pickup truck parked outside his home after the abduction. Court . records indicate the girl's body was found stuffed in two trash bags . inside plastic storage containers in the basement of Wood's home, which . was damp with bleach - presumably used to clean the crime scene. Tragic: Hailey Owens, pictured, was snatched in broad daylight in front of many witnesses . Hailey Owens: Witnesses say a man grabbed Hailey . from in front of a neighbor’s home and drove away in a gold 2008 Ford . Ranger back in February . Greene . County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Patterson . said Hailey was shot in the back of the head and had ligature marks on . her wrists, suggesting she was tied up. At least three people told police they saw Hailey as she was pulled inside a pickup truck that had driven back and forth several times down the street before the driver stopped to ask the girl for directions. One homeowner gave chase on foot, and another followed the fleeing truck in his own car. Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams defended his officers' response time as well as efforts by the Missouri Highway Patrol, which didn't issue an Amber Alert until 103 minutes after the girl's kidnapping was first reported to 911. 'It's a time-consuming process,' he said. Wells reiterated previous statements by . officials that despite Wood's status as a school employee, he and Hailey . apparently didn't know each other. Hailey's home and Westport Elementary are on the city's west side; Wood worked at Pleasant View School, which is 12 miles away north of Springfield, and lived on the city's east  side. Springfield School District officials have said their employment screening process found no warning signs when hiring Wood - first as a temporary employee in 1998 and then full time eight years later.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . An American scientist claims that your personality might determine whether you like spicy food like chillis . An American scientist claims that your personality might determine whether you like spicy food. Pennsylvania State University's research examined the link between peoples' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices such as chilli. It found that people who seek adventure and intense sensations like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations. Nadia Byrnes, a doctoral candidate at the university, conducted a study of 184 non-smoking participants between the ages of 18 and 45 without any known issues that would compromise their ability to taste. The group of people were primarily Caucasian and around 63 per cent were female. She assessed the group using the Arnett Inventory of Sensation Seeking (AISS) test. This test looks at the personality trait of 'sensation-seeking'. This trait is defined as seeking out 'novel and intense stimulation' regardless of the risks involved. People who score above the mean AISS score are considered more open to risks and new experiences, while those scoring below the mean are considered less open to those things. The subjects were then given 25 micrometers of capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, and asked to rate how much they liked a spicy meal as the burn from the capsaicin increased in intensity. Those in the group who fell below the mean AISS rapidly disliked the meal as the burn increased. Pennsylvania State University's research examined the link between peoples' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot spices including chill, which is found in lots of curries (pictured) People who were above the mean AISS had a consistently liked the meal even as the burn increased. Those in the mean group liked the meal less as the burn increased, but not nearly as rapidly as those below the mean. Ms Byrnes said: 'Theoretically, we know that burn intensity and liking are linear related. The more irritating a compound or food gets, the less people should like it. 'But that's not always the case.' She presented her findings at the 2013 Institute of Food Technologists annual meeting and food expo. People were given 25 micrometers of capsaicin, the active component of chili peppers, and asked to rate how much they liked a spicy meal as the burn from the capsaicin increased in intensity. The research found that people who actively seek adventure and intense sensations, like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations . At the same event, Dr Shane McDonald, principal flavor chemist at Kalsec, discussed the addition of 'tingling' spices to foods. The practice is not very prevalent in the U.S. diet outside of carbonation. He said that 'Ma La,' a traditional Szechuan cuisine that combines chili peppers for their heat and Szechuan peppers for their tingle, shows promise for American food manufacturers. The combination of the two sensates enhances the tingling while reducing the heat, which could make certain traditionally spicy foods more appealing to consumers, he said.","An American scientist claims that your personality might determine whether you like spicy food like chillis .

"By . Steve Nolan . A desk belonging to a French royal mistress on which she is said to have written her love letters to the king is expected to fetch £20million at auction. The beautiful desk, owned by Louis XV's lover and one of the most powerful women in 18th century France Madame de Pompadour, will go under the hammer at Christie's auction house in London later this week. The 18th century desk forms the centrepiece of a private art auction featuring two pieces belonging to Madame de Pompadour. Regal: A beautiful desk belonging to Louis XV's mistress Madame de Pompadour is expected to fetch £20million at auction this week . Beautiful: The desk is said to be the place where Madame de Pompadour wrote love letters to the French king . As well as the desk, a Louis XV ormolu-mounted Japanese lacquer secretaire-à-abattant by Bernard II van Risenburgh,  a bureau will also go on sale. The items had been owned by Paris-based Iranian businessman Djahangur Riahi and his wife who are among Paris' most prominent collectors of high value 18th century art pieces. Part of the Riahi collection fetched £40million in 2000 in a sale at Christie's New York auction house. The price of 18th century furniture by some of the most collectable cabinet makers has shot up. The illegitimate daughter of a financier Madame de Pompadour, or Jean-Antoinette Poisson as she was born in 1721, was groomed to become a play thing of the king. She became his mistress and one of the most powerful women in 18th century France. She met him at a ball in 1745 while dressed as a coquettish shepherdess and the king dressed as a tree. Royal love: Madame de Pompadour, left, was King Louis XV's mistress . Her carriage was spotted outside his apartments later the same evening and although the pair's relationship wasn't expected to last, she had moved into rooms at the Palace of Versailles within weeks of their first meeting. Madame de Pompadour is said to have been determined to make the relationship last and split with husband soon after moving into the palace. She gained her own coat of arms and the title the Marquise de Pompadour. She is said to have been attractive and educated. Madame de Pompadour had a particular passion for porcelain and used art to seduce the king. She is said to have miscarried several times and eventually the pair's relationship become platonic as she was no longer able to have sex. She began to commission images of herself based on the theme of friendship. Her final portrait shows her as a respectable, cultured middle-aged woman. She had influence over all areas of royal police and was the unofficial minister of culture. From the mid–1750s onwards, Pompadour became involved in foreign policy and was indirectly responsible for starting the Seven Years' War in which France suffered a humiliating defeat. Her popularity slumped and she died in 1764 aged just 43.

"By . Daniel Bates . Updated: . 03:34 EST, 10 November 2011 . Body parts belonging to U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan were routinely cremated and then dumped in a landfill site. For five years, between 2003 and 2008, staff at the Dover Air Force base mortuary, Delaware, disposed of parts that could not be identified or were later recovered from the battlefield. Family members were not told what happened to their relatives - and the company running the landfill site was not even informed what was being thrown away. Shocking numbers: It has been revealed that the remains of 274 soldiers were dumped in landfill in Virginia . It is the third scandal engulfing the Army in its treatment of its dead. Gari-Lynn Smith, portions of whose husband’s remains were disposed of in the landfill after his 2006 death in Iraq, told the Washington Post she was 'appalled and disgusted' by the way the Air Force had acted. She said: 'My only peace of mind in losing my husband was that he was taken to Dover and that he was handled with dignity, love, respect and honour. 'That was completely shattered for me when I was told that he was thrown in the trash.' Lt Gen Darrell G Jones, the Air Force’s deputy chief for personnel, said the body parts were cremated, then incinerated, and then taken to a landfill by a military contractor. He likened the procedure to the disposal of medical waste. The Dover mortuary changed its policy to burying the parts at sea in June 2008. Dover's mortuary processed over 4,000 sets of remains from 2008 to 2010, most of which were Iraq and Afghanistan war dead . It is not known how many body parts were disposed of, during the five years, at the King George County site, operated by Waste Management Inc. The scandal is the latest to hit the military base which receives all America's war dead and prepares them for burial. Earlier this week it was revealed that body parts belonging to deceased soldiers were lost or sawed off without the family’s permission. An 18-month probe into Dover's mortuary, pictured here, revealed one soldier had his arm cut off by staff without the family's permission . A damning report found that an arm bone belonging to a dead marine was hacked off without asking his parents by staff at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. An ankle and some soft tissue went unaccounted for due to ‘gross mismanagement’ and may have been mixed in with the remains of other soldiers. Whistleblowers also claimed that the . fetal remains of dependents of military personnel were shipped from . Germany back to the U.S. in cardboard boxes that had already been used. Three officials have been disciplined at Dover - but none have lost their jobs. The scandal at Dover Air Force base began after complaints by three whistleblowers - civilians who worked as embalmers or technicians - who sparked an 18-month investigation by the Air Force Inspector General. A separate probe was carried out by the Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative agency which looks into claims by whistleblowers. Among the most egregious instances was when the family of one marine asked to see his dead body one more time - so staff at Dover hacked his arm bone off. The heat from a bomb attack in Afghanistan had caused the soldier’s arm to fuse at 90 degrees to his body so he was unable to fit into his uniform or his casket. But instead of speaking to his family to see what was for the best, staff went ahead and trimmed it anyway. The investigation found the two body parts that went missing were a piece of an ankle belonging to a soldier killed by a bomb in Afghanistan in April 2009. The investigation found two body parts went missing entirely, including a piece of an ankle belonging to a soldier killed by a bomb in Afghainstan and a small piece of flesh belonging to an airman who died in plane crash in Afghanistan . The second was a small piece of flesh belonging to an airman who died in plane crash in Afghanistan in July 2009. The investigation did not discover what happened to them - but raised the possibility they fell out of the plastic bags where they were being stored in the morgue refrigerator and got mixed in with the remains of others. The whistleblowers also drew attention to shipping of fetal remains belonging to relatives of military personnel back to the U.S. Instead of being transported in the more dignified aluminium cases they were shipped in re-used cardboard boxes. In a statement accompanying her report Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said the findings were ‘deeply troubling’. She said: ‘The mortuary for the United States military should boast the best conditions and best practices of any mortuary.’ The report added that there was a ‘pattern of the Air Force’s failure to acknowledge culpability for wrongdoing relating to the treatment of remains of service members and their dependents. The Dover scandal comes just months after it was revealed Arlington National Cemetery had 211 graves either mislabelled or containing the wrong person's remains . It said: ‘While the report reflects a willingness to find paperwork violations and errors, with the exception of the cases of missing portions, the findings stop short of accepting accountability for failing to handle remains with the requisite ‘reverence, care and dignity befitting them and the circumstances’’. Among the other findings was a chilling insight into the chaos at Dover including one incident in July 2009 when the remains of two airmen killed in in Afghanistan were brought in. One unnamed employee admitted that it was ‘hard to keep track of everything’ and that the medical examiners were ‘messing with the bags a bit’. He said: ‘And then they would walk to the back, and then they’d come back and - it was - it was a really hectic day.’ Earlier this year a report by the Army Inspector’s Office found that at least 211 graves at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, had been incorrectly labelled or had the wrong body in them. There were also cases of remains being moved without families' consent or graves left empty when they should have remains in them. The cemetery is considered sacred ground and has been the final resting place of the nation's veterans since 1864. More than 300,000 servicemen and women are now buried there. General Norton Schwartz, the chief of staff of the Air Force, apologised for the mistakes made at Dover. He said: ‘We understand the obligation of this work, the sanctity of this work, the need for reverence, the need for dignity and respect of our fallen, just as if these were our sons and daughters’. An Army and FBI probe is still investigating the outrage at the nation’s most hallowed military graveyard.","THIRD scandal over how the Army treats its dead .

"By . Neil Sears . Having knocked a cyclist off his bike and through a hedge, most drivers would be mortified. But not accountancy trainee Emma Way. The 21-year-old’s first thought was to boast about the incident on Twitter. Writing under the name @emmaway20, she tweeted: ‘Definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier – I have right of way he doesn’t even pay road tax! #bloodycyclists’. Collision: Emma Way (left) tweeted she 'definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier'. Toby Hockley (right), 29, came forward as the cyclist involved in the collision and said he was 'lucky to be alive' following the crash . Ironically, she would have heard no more about it had she not chosen to share it with the world because injured cyclist Toby Hockley had not intended to report it. But by rejoicing in her actions, she caused a storm of protest on Twitter – and brought herself to the attention of the police. Last night officers confirmed they were investigating Miss Way, while her Twitter account suddenly fell silent. Her defence will not be helped by earlier tweets. One featured a picture which appeared to be taken from her driving seat, showing a slow-moving car in front. The caption read: ‘This is the reason for my lateness. Always stuck behind some clueless crazy fool! #smartcar.’ Now angry cyclists who claim Miss Way is the ‘clueless crazy fool’ have forwarded that message to police. Another tweet on her account passed to officers featured a picture of a speedometer at 95mph – 25mph over the national limit. But she must have realised the trouble she was in when she received the following Twitter message from Norfolk Police: ‘We have had tweets ref an RTC [road traffic collision] with a bike. We suggest you report it at a police station ASAP if not done already & then dm [direct message] us.’ Confession: This tweet by user EmmaWay20 was met with shock and prompted an investigation by Norfolk police . Mr Hockley, 29, a chef from Norwich, claimed he had ‘a miraculous escape’ after being clipped by her car on Sunday. He was taking part in the 100-mile Boudicca Sportive road riding event when the incident happened five miles from the finish line at Snetterton, near Norwich. He said: ‘A car came tearing round the blind corner and narrowly missed a cyclist in front of me. She came on to my side of the road, I took the wing mirror off and I went flying off my bike into a hedge. She hit me really hard. I am lucky to be alive. But I managed to get out of the hedge and stand up. ‘The car was nowhere to be seen. She hit me, and she was gone. All I know is that it was a blonde girl driving. ‘I have a sore elbow, a bruised knee, nettle stings from riding through the hedge, but nothing serious.’ Not angry: Mr Hockley, foreground, said he had not been planning any further action before he was alerted to the Tweet . He said he had not intended to report the accident, fearing that his girlfriend would be worried about him cycling in the future. Of Miss Way, he said: ‘I think she came across as a very silly girl and made herself look like a bit of a fool. I’m not angry, I would just like it known that her stupid comment that I don’t pay road tax is not an excuse to treat cyclists like second-class citizens.’ Contacted by the Mail last night, Miss Way refused to comment. However a friend said she had been suspended from work at accountants Larking Gowen. The friend claimed: ‘She stopped, but the other guy didn’t stop. She looked in the mirror and he was gone. It’s absolutely ridiculous. There was nobody marshalling the cyclists and they were going really fast. ‘She is a village girl who knows every pothole on every road round here. She made a stupid remark on Twitter but it’s all got out of hand.’ A police spokesman said: ‘Further to recent social media postings, we can confirm that we have had initial contact with both parties involved. Enquiries continue.'","Twitter user EmmaWay20 bragged about collision with cyclist in Norwich .

"By . Claire Ellicott . From cigar-shaped spacecraft in the night sky to abduction by aliens, they are the tales that have captivated the imagination of Earthlings for nearly a century. And now the Ministry of Defence has revealed its latest batch of reports from people claiming a close encounter in the UK. The sightings only go up to 2009, as that was the year the ‘British X-Files’ desk was closed. Scroll down for video . This doughnut-shaped phenomenon was photographed by a retired RAF officer and sent to his old bosses tasked with investigating UFOs in 2004 . The Ministry of Defence has revealed its latest batch of reports from people claiming a close encounter in the UK. The sightings only go up to 2009, as that was the year the 'British X-Files' desk was closed. Above, a UFO over Stonehenge in Wiltshire in January 2009 . The year 2009 saws the second highest number of reports recorded by the MoD - totalling 643 - beaten only by the 750 sightings in 1978, the year Close Encounters Of The Third Kind (pictured) was released in UK cinemas . Spookily, that year also saw a trebling in the frequency of UFO reports, the newly declassified files show. More than 600 alien experiences were reported to the MoD’s UFO hotline, more than double the previous year and three times the usual number, according to the papers released by the National Archives. The files from 2007 to 2009 reveal several of bizarre reports of encounters with extraterrestrials, including a man who claimed he lived with an alien, UFO sightings near the Houses of Parliament and Stonehenge, and a man whose dog and tent were abducted. This footage was taken by a BBC cameraman in Worcestershire in 2003 . They also reveal the claim by one man to have developed a weapon to shoot down UFOs. Some . experts say there was a simple, non-sinister reason why the number of . sightings soared in the hotline’s final year of operation – a rise in . popularity of Chinese lanterns being released at weddings and other . events. There were 643 reports in 2009, up from around 100 to 200 a year between 2000 and 2007. It was the second highest number of reports recorded by the MoD, beaten only by the 750 sightings in 1978 – the year Close Encounters Of The Third Kind was released in UK cinemas. Another peak had occurred in the mid-1990s, when the US TV show The X-Files was at the height of its popularity. Dr David Clarke, author of the book The UFO Files based on earlier MoD data, said: ‘There are many reasons why the number of reports trebled in 2009. 'Many of the sighting accounts – such as formations of orange lights moving slowly across the sky – describe the appearance of Chinese lanterns even though people did not recognise them at the time.’ The newly released archives also show a UFO seen here over Duns, Scottish Borders in July 2008 . The first description of a UFO was . from a sighting made in US in 1947, although Met Office reports a . quarter of a century earlier had included data on unexplained phenomena. In 1952, Prime Minister Winston Churchill took the issue so seriously that he ordered reports of sightings to be kept secret to avoid public panic. But during its 50 years of collecting and investigating reports, the UFO desk and hotline uncovered no evidence to indicate the existence of ‘any military threat to the UK’. Steven Spielberg's take on alien life, the film ET released in 1982 . The files reveal that one person phoned the hotline to report twice seeing UFOs hovering over the Houses of Parliament in London in February 2008. He described ‘green, red and white lights’ that remained still in the sky for an hour and a half. Another sent an email to report seeing ‘discoid’ shapes in photographs of Stonehenge taken two years previously. ‘I didn’t see anything in the sky at the time. Upon uploading them to my computer, though, I spotted the discoid shapes in the background.’ Another email said photographs of Blackpool Pier taken in October 2008 showed aircraft that had not been visible at the time. The UFO desk investigated and an official said two of the objects ‘look like stunt kites’ and the third ‘looks like a seagull head-on’. The MoD axed the department – which had no US equivalent and which by 2009 had only one officer – because it served ‘no defence purpose’ and was diverting resources from ‘more valuable defence-related activities’, the files reveal. There were also fears that its existence encouraged spurious UFO reports. When the announcement of the closure was made, MoD officials predicted a backlash from ufologists convinced that the truth was still out there. Many wrote to the Queen, Prime Minister Gordon Brown and ministers to demand sightings were investigated. The files are available to download at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ufos. And the little girl who asked for the truth... A young girl wrote to the UFO desk about aliens saying she had seen ‘little air crafts’ in the sky. She continued: ‘Please tell me what the truth is I’ve a right to know’, the files reveal. The letter the child sent included a picture of an extraterrestrial in a spaceship waving and asked whether there is life on other planets. The MoD replied thanking the writer, from Altrincham, near Manchester, for the letter and sent some RAF ‘goodies’. A letter from a young girl who wrote to the UFO desk . The schoolgirl’s letter reads: ‘To Mr/Mrs. Please tell me if living things live out side our planet. I would like to now [sic] because me and my father have seen little air crafted [sic] in the sky. ‘And my father have seen 2 little light dancing around each other. ‘Please send me a letter telling me the answer.’ The MoD wrote back to her saying: ‘Thank you for your letter asking if there is life outside our planet. ‘It’s an interesting question and we remain totally open-minded about it, but we don’t know of any evidence to prove life exists in outer space. ‘We do look at reports of “unidentified flying objects” but only to see if the country’s airspace might have been affected but we haven’t had any evidence of this so far. ‘I am enclosing some RAF goodies that I thought you might like.’","More than 600 alien experiences were reported to Government's UFO hotline that year .

"By . Matt Blake . The Australian radio DJ who asked prime minister Julia Gillard live on air if her live-in partner is gay simply because he is a hairdresser has been sacked. Howard Sattler sparked outrage yesterday during the drive-time interview on 6PR when he ambushed Miss Gillard into discussing the sexuality of Tim Mathieson, with whom she has been in a relationship since 2006. Furious bosses at the station in Perth, Western Australia, immediately hauled Sattler before them for a hairdryer treatment of his own before terminating his contract with immediate effect. The incident again thrusts Australian radio into the global spotlight, a week after a DJ behind last year's prank call on the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital that lead to a nurse's suicide not only kept his job but won a top award for his stunt as well. Scroll down for video. Questions: Miss Gillard Was taken aback when she was asked in a radio interview whether her partner Tim Mathieson was gay because he was a hairdresser . It has been an awkward week for Australia's first female prime minister, who expressed 'deep shock' on Wednesday after . it . emerged a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party . included a dish called 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail', . described as 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box' 6PR general manager Martin Boylen apologised 'unreservedly' for Saddler's offensive line of questioning today, telling listeners: 'In the wake of yesterday’s interview, Radio 6PR suspended Mr Sattler from broadcasting pending a review of the matter today. 'The station has now decided to terminate Mr Sattler’s engagement effective immediately.' The light-hearted interview appeared to be going well before it nosedived when Sattler demanded to know Mr Mathieson's true sexual preference, citing 'rumours' on the internet as his source. 'That's absurd,' Miss Gillard responded sharply. But the interviewer was not going to drop the subject, after earlier asking the Labour leader about the sexist menu. Australian DJs Mel Greig (right) and Michael Christian (left) were responsible for hoax calls to the hospital treating the Duchess of Cambridge . Nurse Jacintha Saldanha (left) was found hanged . three days after the hoax call. Mr Christian (right) has now been named . 'next top jock' at his radio station and said he was 'at the top of my . game' 'But you hear it,' said Mr Sattler, quoting what people were saying: 'He must be gay, he's a hairdresser. Miss Gillard made it clear that she was not going to be drawn in to the rumours Mr Sattler said were being bandied about. 'I mean, Howard, I don't know if every silly thing that gets said is going to be repeated to me now,' she said. Howard Sattler's dismissal will raise eyebrows among some after one of the DJs behind the prank call on the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital . that lead to the suicide of one of its nurses not only kept his job but even won an award for the stunt. Michael Christian, who paired with Mel Greig during the hoax on Australia's 2Day FM, has been named the 'next top jock' of the station and now describes himself as being 'at the top of my game.' His comments come despite the fact that the nurse who took his initial call Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was later found hanged. Along with the award he won a trip to Los Angeles. In a statement after receiving the gong, Christian said: 'From the start, I felt like I had something to prove to myself... Regardless of all that's happened in the past few months, I'm still at the top of my game. 'So it felt good to see my name at the top of the final leader board!' Christian . and Greig called King Edward VII hospital where the Duchess of . Cambridge was being treated last December pretending to be the Queen and . Prince Charles. Mrs . Saldanha failed to see their poor impersonations and transferred them . through to another nurse who revealed some details about her condition. She was found dead three days later. 'To all the hairdressers out there, including the men who are listening, I don't think in life one can actually look at a whole profession full of different human beings and say ""Gee, we know something about every one of those human beings.""' Mr Sattler reminded the Prime Minister that he had been promised a candid interview with her, asking: 'You can confirm that he's not (gay)?' 'Oh Howard, don't be ridiculous, of course he is not,' said the British-born Prime Minister. 'But you're in a heterosexual relationship?' he pressed. 'That's all I'm asking.' She replied: 'Howard, let me just bring you back to earth - you and I have just talked about me and Tim living at the lodge. We live there together as a couple, you know that.' And today Miss Gillard refused to answer reporters' questions on the affair, saying: 'I'm aware that a number of you want to ask questions in relation to yesterday's interview. 'I'm not intending to make any comments on that interview.'' However, she added she was concerned such questioning could have a negative effect on women and girls who enter public life. 'I don't want to see a message like that sent to young girls,' Ms Gillard said. 'I want young girls and women to be able to feel like they can be included in public life and not have to face questioning like the questioning I faced yesterday.' Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner Elizabeth Broderick told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that many women in public office faced a 'significant demeaning attitude, sexist questions, invasive questioning'. 'It's got to stop because we want women in public office, we want women to step up and be part of a decision-making of this country... [but] women and young women are put off by what they see.' The astonishing interview had begun with Mr Sattler telling Miss Gillard that she had been the butt of rumours and snide jokes many times, to which she she said that was probably right. When he asked if he could test a few out and she asked in what way, he said: 'Tim's gay.' After telling the radio host that the suggestion was ridiculous she said: 'Yes, on the internet, you know, there are lots of, you know, what I've referred to in the past as nutjobs and I'm happy to use the expression again - people who peddle and circulate vile and offensive things.' Bloggers later pointed out that the questions had put Miss Gillard off guard - she told Mr Sattler that the general election was on September 12 when it is actually being held on September 14. Mr Mathieson is divorced with four adult children, three born during his marriage and one who he fathered in his late teens. Stunt: In a vulgar incident earlier this week it emerged that a dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party included a dish called 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail',  described as 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box' Furious: Former Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (right), who was also . targeted in the menu, described the stunt as a 'snide, dirty and sexist . trick' He began dating Miss Gillard in 2006 and has been her partner ever since. It has not been an easy week for Miss Gillard.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Two Marine jets dropped four 500lb bombs on the Great Barrier Reef this week after a fuel emergency meant they could not land while carrying the weapons. The AV-8B Harriers, part of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, had been taking part in a training exercise when the pilots realized they were running low on fuel. Each Harrier was forced to drop two bombs on the UNESCO world heritage site, although there was no risk of them exploding, according to defense officials. Emergency: Two Harrier jets, like the one pictured, were forced to drop 500lb bombs in the Great Barrier Reef after running low on fuel . Protected: The bombs were dropped near the Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The bombs were dropped about 16 nautical miles south of Bell Cay in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, according to NBC News. Defense officials said they tried to pick a location that would reduce the risk of damage to the reef, and said the bomb site was in a 'deep channel' about 60 metres deep. The pilots were supposed to drop the bombs on Townshend Island as part of a training exercise, but at the last moment they were told the range was not clear. At that point, they realized they did not have enough fuel to return to the aircraft carrier USS Bonhomme Richard. 'Due to low fuel and inability to land . with the amount of ordnance they were carrying, the on scene commander . determined it was necessary to designate an emergency jettison area for . the ordnance,' U.S. Navy Commander William Marks told News AU. 'They chose to save the aircraft,' a U.S. official said. Harriers are said to be worth about $35 million. A spokesman for the Australian . Defence Force said the bombs were a 'minimal risk or threat to the . public, the marine environment or civilian shipping transiting the reef . area', and added that Australia was investigating the incident with the . U.S. The U.S. Navy has already started a salvage operation and the Marines are investigating the incident, but added that it was unlikely that the BDU 45s and GBU 12s would explode. Fragile: The 1,200 mile reef off the coast of Queensland is home to endangered species . Refuge: The protected reef is a haven for marine life, such as turtles and sea cows . BDU 45s are training bombs that mimic several types of bombs used by the armed forces, and the GBU 12 is a laser-guided weapon. It is not yet clear what the impact will be on the Great Barrier Reef. Its world heritage status means it is strictly governed by a series of rules that limit development and activities in and around it. The world's largest coral reef, covering more than 1,200 miles along the coast of Queensland, is a fragile eco system filled with marine life, from endangered green sea turtles to dugongs, or sea cows.","Marines 'chose to save aircraft' after running low on fuel .

"By . Mike Jaccarino . and Daily Mail Reporter . A woman whose three-month-old daughter was allegedly poisoned and suffocated by a 10-year-old girl has blamed the child's mother, who was babysitting at the time, for the infant's death. The elementary school student, from Fairfield, Maine, was charged with manslaughter yesterday after allegedly feeding Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway her attention-deficit disorder medication then smothering her, leaving her black and blue on July 8. But Nicki Greenaway has hit out at the girl's mother -- a work colleague -- who she said was specifically told not to leave her baby daughter alone with the 10-year-old. The Bangor Daily News of Maine reports that three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway of Clinton died July 8, and the Maine State Police declared the death a homicide Wednesday . Nicole Greenaway, the infant’s mother, . told The Bangor Daily News medication was found in . her infant’s system which was the very same medication taken by the . 10-year-old girl . 'I feel a little bit of relief that . they're charging her (the babysitter's) daughter at this point, but the . mom really needs to be responsible,' Greenaway said. 'She's the one I . left my daughter with.' The 10-year-old, who is not being . identified, is the youngest person to be charged with manslaughter in . Maine in at least 25 years. She is due in juvenile court in October. Brooklyn was in the babysitter's care overnight in nearby Fairfield. The sitter called police early on . July 8 to report that the infant was not breathing, authorities said. Emergency workers who arrived minutes later reported the child was . unresponsive. Greenaway said that the 10-year-old . had changed her baby's diaper in the past, but that she had told the . sitter an adult needed to be present at all times. The Bangor Daily News is not naming the mother in order to protect the identity of the juvenile charged with manslaughter. Police have also reportedly withheld the name of the girl . Instead, the infant, who was . reportedly fussy that night, was sleeping in a portable crib in the same . room as the girl, according to Greenaway. Stephen McCausland, spokesman for the . Maine Department of Public Safety, said he couldn't comment on whether . charges could be brought against the babysitter. McCausland said detectives uncovered . some 'troubling signs' before the state medical examiner declared the . baby's death a homicide on Wednesday. Investigators would not provide . further details on the cause of death. 'She suffocated her by putting her . hands over her face. There are bruises . all over her face.' Greenaway told The Bangor Daily News a . toxicology report stated a medication was found in the infant’s system . that was the same medication taken by the 10-year-old girl. She said that when she finally saw . her daughter at a funeral home, the baby had a black eye, bruises on the . bridge of her nose and marks that looked like fingerprints on her . cheeks. 'She suffocated her by putting her hands over her face,' Greenaway told the newspaper. 'There are bruises all over her face.' The mother of the 10-year-old has referred inquiries to her attorney, John Martin of Skowhegan. Consultation: Authorities reportedly charged the 10-year-old with manslaughter in connection with the Attorney General's office . The 10-year-old charged is the youngest person to be hit with manslaughter charges in at least 25 years in Maine, according to officials . The girl will appear in Skowhegan District Court on October 22. The babysitter hasn't been named in order to protect the identity of the juvenile charged with manslaughter. The . 10-year-old girl is now in the custody of the Maine Department of . Health and Human Services, McCausland said. Greenaway works with the babysitter at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Waterville, according to the Bangor Daily News. 'I’m definitely glad they’re finally doing something,' she said. 'I just didn’t know when they were going to do it. (The last couple of days have been) pretty overwhelming.' Greenaway, who reportedly has three . other children, aged two, 15 and 16, said the last two months have been . full of 'a lot of heartache and a lot of patience.' 'The decision on charging the girl . was made after consulting with the attorney general’s office,' McCausland told The Bangor Daily News. 'The state medical examiner’s office continues to work on the case.' 'I have not done any research farther out than that,' he said. The death of any child under age three automatically triggers an investigation in Maine.","Child charged with manslaughter in death of Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway .

An Oakland, California public school kid who has been accepted to three Ivy League schools says he has to carry around proof of his 5.0 GPA and sky high SAT score because he looks like a 'street dude.' Akintunde Ahmad has his choice of attending Yale, Brown, Columbia or a slew of other prestigious universities but the people he meets don't believe him thanks to the clothes he wears and dreadlocks he sports. To combat those snap judgments, Ahmad keeps photos of his impressive grades and 2100 SAT score on his phone and can flash them at any disbeliever he wants.

The 17-year-old Oakland Tech student proudly attests to his lifelong public education and wears the same baseball cap, gold chains, loose clothes and dreadlocks as many of his classmates. While the outstanding student's record speaks for itself, some believe his appearance says a lot, too. And those folks have been doubting or overlooking him for much of his already accomplished life. Thankfully for the promising teen, others like his Oakland school principal mother have always urged him not to give in to others' doubts.

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . The social media backlash to the NYPD's invitation for citizens to tweet pictures of its officers in action has spread to Los Angeles. Southern Californians are posting photos and stories of police brutality to Twitter with the hashtag #myLAPD, just as New Yorkers began to do using #myNYPD on Tuesday. Now the well-intentioned hashtag has become a transcontinental bashtag campaign as citizens angry at violent police tactics from New York to Los Angeles and points between. Sperading: The bashtagging of the New York police department's attempt to get citizens to tweet photos of officers doing good has spread to Los Angeles, where people are tweeting images of LAPD officers' bad behavior with the hashtag #myLAPD . Occupy Wall Street pointed out the spreading trend, which began just hours after the NYPD asked Twitter users to share pleasant photos of NYPD officers using the tag #myNYPD . The #myNYPD was set up for followers to share photos of themselves with police officers that would be viewed as positive. The LAPD did not repeat the ill planned PR tactic, but Angelenos quickly took a cue from the East Coast bashtaggers. '#myLAPD wear more combat gear then a U.S soldier deployed in Afghanistan,' tweeted @JC_Lomeli  along with a shot of a group of LAPD officers in SWAT gear, with one taking aim at something off camera. Spreading northward: This picture of a Chicago man who died after he was beaten by police was tweeted with the tag #myCPD . Twitter users in Oakland followed suit Wednesday . Another tweet simply tagged as #myLAPD from @jimmy2beers shows a police officer sitting atop a subdued black man and preparing to club him. Chicagoans also quickly hopped on the brutality-bashing trend. '#myCPD beats peaceful protesters, press and even random passersby if they dare challenge the masters,' tweeted @ChicagoRADicals . As did some citizens of Oakland: . '#myOPD likes to shoot unarmed protestors with ""less-lethal weapons""' wrote @NadiaKayyali along with a group of photos of grossly injured protestors. Within a few hours, the campaign had received 10,000 predominantly negative responses, many of which were photos of violent arrests. Scroll down for video . The original: The NYPD solicited fans to tweet photos of officers doing good around the city. But the campaign quickly backfired . Critics took the opportunity to post damning pictures on the hastag #MyNYPD, taking aim at such issues as excessive force and the controversial 'stop and frisk' practices . Occupy Wall Street NYC's Twitter account posted many photos under the hashtag. The result was a public relations disaster for the force. A Police spokeswoman responded to the negative publicity shortly before 6:30 pm. 'The NYPD is creating new ways to communicate effectively with the community,' said Deputy Chief Kim Y. Royster. 'Twitter provides an open forum for an uncensored exchange and this is an open dialogue good for our city.' In November, JPMorgan Chase suffered a similiar social media campaign fail. The bank invited followers to ask questions and speak with Vice Chairman Jimmy Lee in a live Tweeting session. What followed was a humilating series of heckling and hostility. A follow-up Q and A with Lee was quickly cancelled.","New York's police introduced the Twitter hashtag #myNYPD where citizens can show them as a force for good, but it quickly backfired .

She is a privately educated peer’s daughter who marketed her business as a godsend for busy price-conscious mothers. But the Honourable Rachel Oxburgh has resigned after hundreds of customers were left without the Christmas presents they paid for. She spoke proudly of her business credentials after co-founding the mail order firm, Casabu, in April 2012, selling ‘branded’ children’s clothes and toys at discounts of up to 90 per cent. Dr Oxburgh, whose father is former Shell chairman Lord Oxburgh, said she was aiming for a million customers by the end of 2013 and the website was named one of the top 20 start-ups of 2012 by judges including Duncan Bannatyne, of Dragons’ Den. But for reasons which are unclear, it hit dire financial troubles and Dr Oxburgh, 49, resigned as chief executive and director over Christmas. Scores of angry mothers have taken to the company’s Facebook page to complain. One disgruntled customer, Kerry Campling, wrote: ‘I haven’t received a refund, an apology or a reply to the numerous emails I have sent, and I still want some of the goods.’ Another, Natasha Harpur, added: ‘I am completely at my wits’ end with this. It’s a lot of money and the stress it caused me over Christmas was unbelievable.’  Others complained about the ‘disgusting’ and ‘diabolical’ service they had received and their inability to get through to the firm’s customer service hotline. A statement on Casabu’s Facebook page on January 6 read: ‘We have been working over the holidays to get to the bottom of the issues that caused a number of orders to go astray in December and now have a clear picture.’ The company promised ‘a full refund’ and their ‘most sincere apology’ to customers who had not received their goods, adding: ‘We will be starting on this process tomorrow and expect to have it complete by early next week at the latest.’ But when that deadline passed last week, customers accused the firm of making an ‘empty promise’. Natalia Znatkova wrote on Facebook that she was still waiting for orders placed in early November and there were ‘no signs of activity’ from Casabu. Site: The company (website pictured) offered large discounts of children's toys and clothing . Last March Dr Oxburgh was optimistic about the firm’s future, saying: ‘The beauty of the flash sales model is that we don’t need to sink capital into stock and we can use this investment to grow our customer database.’ The married mother of two – who was educated at the £14,451-a-year Perse School in Cambridge – also told Reuters in April that she had a ‘resilient’ business model. At her £1.5million home in  West London, Dr Oxburgh confirmed she had resigned and  said Casabu’s co-founder, John Heseltine, had also stood down as a director. She added: ‘The average customer’s order was £35 to £40  so I understand that they have lost out, but we are in a much worse position.’ Patrick Bradley, of Ingenious Ventures, which invested in Casabu last year, said: ‘Just because Rachel has stepped down … does not relieve her of her responsibilities for the way the business has been run.’ Sue Jones, of Westminster Council, said Trading Standards became aware in December of ‘problems with the company’ after customers called the Citizens Advice Consumer Service.","Rachel Oxburgh resigned from mail order firm Casabu over Christmas .

"By . Mark Prigg . It has been touted as the future of computing, the next revolution in technology, and also been barred from many establishments before it even goes on sale. However, until now, it has not been clear exactly how Google Glass, the search giant's eyewear, actually works. Luckily, a designer has taken it upon himself to create an infographic showing exactly how Google manages to project an image into a user's view. How Glass works: A German designer created this infographic to show how the eyewear projects an image . The infographic also reveals how Glass is focused so the image always appears sharp . 'Depending on how you wear the Google Glass, the layer appears in the . upper right corner or in the middle of the visual field,' says Missfeldt. 'When the Google . Glass is high on the nose, so that you can practically see through . underneath, you must turn the eye up to view the image sharp. 'Because . the prism is semi-transparent you can also place it directly in front of . the pupil. In that case, you have the sharp layer directly in front of . the eyes.' Martin Missfeldt, a German designer, said he created the graphic to show people how the Google system works. 'Google Glass is a technical masterpiece,' he said. 'It combines numerous functions and features in a very small unit. In addition to phone and camera (photo, video), it offers Internet connection, including GPS.' Glass is set to go on sale later this year, although will initially be limited to developers and selected members of the public. It is expected to cost under Â£1,000 when it becomes widely available. 'The core feature of Google Glass is a visual layer that is placed over the reality ('augmented reality'), explains Missfeldt . 'This layer opens a door to amazing new possibilities. 'In the Google Glass contains a mini-projector, which projected the layer via a clever, semi-transparent prism directly on the retina in the eye. 'Because of this the image, even though it is so close to the eye, is sharp and clear. 'You can move the front part of the Google Glass easily to optimize the focus.' Google has so far only released limited video footage of how Glass will actually look . Augmented reality: This demonstration shows off navigation information similar to what Google currently offers via its Maps service . Wearing glasses and using glass could be impossible, warns Missfeldt . Missfeldt also warns those wearing glasses with prescription lenses may struggle. Google co-founder Sergey Brin demonstrating Google's new Glass - but the firm has so far refused to reveal exactly how it works . 'The biggest challenge for Google will now . be to make the Google Glass also usable for people with normal glasses . (to compensate for a low vision). 'In this case the Google Glass has to . be placed ahead of normal glasses - which doesn't look and feel well or . like a glass. 'Or Google has to manufacture individual customized prisms, . but this would be considerably more expensive than the standard . production. It comes as it emerged people wearing . Google Glass eyewear could be banned from strip clubs, cinemas and . casinos because their owners donâ€™t want them filming there. Bosses . for establishments in the US said that due to privacy concerns they . would be asking anyone wearing the glasses to remove them or they wonâ€™t . be let in. Lap dance clubs . said that they would treat Google Glass wearers the same as anyone . caught filming a stripper - and would kick them out. American technology guru Brian Fung predicts wearable devices like Google Glass (pictured) will be expensive as the hardware will probably not be subsidised by phone companies and consumers will have to upgrade their data plans . t is believed Google Glass (pictured) will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity but it could also spark an increase in the cost of data plans - possibly for all consumers even if they are not taking advantage of the new technology .","Google has refused to reveal the internals of its system, or show exactly how it will work .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Survivor: Leon Leyson was the youngest Jewish survivor of the Holocaust spared by being on Schindler's List. Oskar Schindler kept an eye on the Leyson family among the hundreds of other Jews he saved. The youngest Jewish refugee to be saved from the Holocaust by Oskar Schindler has died. Leon Leyson, 83, was just 13 when he was taken on as a Schindler employee, he went on to live in Los Angeles, served in the U.S. army and worked as a teacher in industrial arts - keen to give something back to his adoptive country. Living in Krakow, he was 10 when the Nazis invaded Poland. Jews were forced to live in a ghetto but Leyon's father, Morris was one of the few men allowed out to work, NBC News reports. He was fortunate to have Oskar Schindler as his boss, a native German shocked by the horrors he saw committed by the Nazis and determined to try and save as many Jews as he could. In 1943, Schindler was granted permission to keep his workers in his own factory sub-camp. He secretly brought them more food and enabled them to live in conditions never permitted by the Nazis. Among them was the Leyson family, a family of seven who had moved to Krakow so Morris could find work. Because of Schindler's interventions and after being ultimately placed on his list of workers which meant they were save from the death camps, Leon survived alongside his parents and an older brother and sister. His other two brothers were killed. 'Five of us survived the war, this is the bottom line, out of everyone who was related to me in Poland. And we survived because we were on Schindler's list,' Leon said during an interview in 2008 on NBC4. The family moved to the U.S. in 1949. Leyson built up a good relationship with Schindler, who risked his life hiring hundreds of extra Jewish workers during the war, to save them. Ground-breaking film: Spielberg's Schindler's List was supported by the many generations saved by Oskar Schindler's actions including Leon Leyson, fifth left, pictured here with Spielberg, third left . Leyson was too small to operate the . machines properly in Schindler's factory so he stood on an upturned box, . Schindler called him Little Leyson. 'Occasionally, when he was by himself, he would come and talk to me. He ordered that I get extra rations of food,' Leyson said. When the Nazis ordered the remaining Jews of Krakow to be sent to Auschwitz., Schindler acted again paying huge bribes and using all of his influence to ensure as many as possible were relocated to outside home town and thus away from the Final Solution. Schindler also dramatically intervened when Leyson's mother and sister were among 300 Schindler women accidentally re-routed to Auschwitz when they were meant to be being led to safety. They knew the gas chambers awaited them until they heard Schindler's voice. Scroll down for video . Hero: Schindler saved hundreds of Jews including Leon Leyson. They met again in America some years later. Here Schindler is pictured speaking about those he saved in Germany in 1963 . 'What are you doing with these people? These are my people,' he told the Nazi guards, who let them go after Schindler offered further bribes. Leyon didn't talk about his wartime experiences until 1993 and Steven Spielberg's acclaimed film Schindler's List prompted him to share his story. He went on to take part in an educational program where Holocaust survivors spoke in high schools and college campuses providing a personal testimony of the horrors committed by Hitler's Nazi party. Honored: Schindler, pictured left in 1962, was played by Liam Neeson in the 1993 film by Steven Spielberg, pictured right . He often told stories of his beloved brother Tsalig, who at 16, chose to go to a death camp with his girlfriend rather than accept Schindler's offer to save him - he didn't want her to be alone. The young couple was murdered. Leyson once met Schindler in the U.S. many years on and found that he still remembered him. 'I know who you are. You are little Leyson!,' he said. Leyson worked as a teacher at Huntington Park High School, Los Angeles for 39 years. He lived in Fullerton with his wife, Liz, and had two children.","Leon Leyson, a 13-year-old Jew living in Krakow was the youngest factory worker put on Oskar Schindler's list which saved thousands from the death camps .

"By . Fiona Macrae . If you dug these up in your garden, you probably wouldn’t think twice about throwing them away. But the unassuming objects are 4,000-year-old Bronze Age beads, and worth their weight in gold. Unearthed from a prehistoric burial chest on Dartmoor, they have been heralded as one of the most significant historical finds in more than a century. The beads are part of a range of Bronze Age artefacts found in Dartmoor that have been heralded as one of the most significant finds of the past 100 years . The chest’s well-preserved contents included human bones, teeth, textiles and intricate jewellery. Bronze Age expert Dr Ben Roberts, from Durham University, said that the find was a ‘seven or eight out of ten’ on a scale where the ruins of Pompeii get a ten. Jane Marchand, senior archaeologist from Dartmoor National Park, described the haul as one of the most important discoveries since the 19th century. She said: ‘This is an incredible find. We had no idea we could end up with something as astounding as human remains. ‘The amber beads probably came from the Baltic – and meant they were long-distance trading 4,000 years ago. ‘These artefacts show Dartmoor wasn’t the isolated, hard-to-reach place we thought it was. This mystery is unfolding. 'This has been fascinating to work on, but it’s just one piece in a puzzle. The story is only part-told.' The burial chest full of cremated bones and jewellery dating back 4,000 years is excavated on Dartmoor . The archaeologists, who were funded by . English Heritage, had simply hoped that the chest would offer some clues . about the environment of times past. But its exceptionally well-preserved contents, including human bones, . teeth, a basket and around 200 beads, may contain a wealth of . information about life at the time. Mrs Marchand said: ‘We lifted the cist lid and saw some red fur with . bits of bone sticking out. We thought a fox might have died there. ‘But then a little black bead fell out and we realised it was something . much more interesting. 'And it looked like the fur had been wrapped . around some remains, lying on the granite base of the cist. We wrapped it in cling film and took it to the laboratory.’ The number of beads is particularly exciting. As well as the amber beads, human remains and a woven basket or bag were found preserved in peat . The collection of artefacts were found in a stone-built chest or 'cist' in Dartmoor National Park (pictured) Mrs Marchand said: ‘Their presence could mean it was a high-status burial that you’d normally see in Wessex or Orkney. ‘There were a number of amber beads which probably came from the Baltic - . and that must have meant they were doing long-distance trading 4,000 . years ago.’ The cist, measuring roughly 30in wide by 60in long, also contained a . band of leather complete with tassels, believed to be some sort of . clothing item. Some wooden jewellery, believed to be ear studs, was also discovered. The findings follow the announcement by scientists at the University of . Leicester this month that the skeleton exhumed in September last year . during an archaeological dig in a car park is that of King Richard III. Mrs Marchand said: ‘It is a very exciting time for archaeology. ‘We don’t yet know the age or the sex of the person whose remains have . been found, and we may not. But this mystery is unfolding. ‘To be a part of it has been truly amazing.’ The chest, which will be featured on BBC South West’s regional TV programme Inside Out, also contained a decorated leather band and a woven basket.","The amber beads were found in a burial chest on Dartmoor National Park .

"By . Damien Gayle . Vastly different species of sea microbes work together to respond as one to their surroundings as if they have one 'megamind', new research has revealed. U.S. researchers have discovered communities of infinitesimal creatures in our oceans react in unison to changes in their environment. The links between them are not well understood, but findings suggest the creatures rely on each other to almost the same extent as the different cells in a human body. Megamind: Despite the amazing diversity of marine microbes, a new research paper shows that many different groups work together to react in unison to their surroundings . As an example, if one set of the microbes were, say, creating energy through photosynthesis, which would then produce carbon dioxide, another set of microbes would somehow know and react - perhaps preparing to absorb the carbon dioxide. The open sea contains an amazing . diversity of extremely tiny organisms called picoplankton, which include . relatively simple life forms such as marine bacteria, as well as more . complicated organisms. Microbiologists who study wild marine . microbes, as opposed to the lab-grown variety, face enormous challenges . in getting a clear picture of the daily activities of their subjects. To take a look at these creatures in . their natural habitat, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of . Technology and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute used a new . method for collecting marine microbes. They created a robotic sampling device . which dangled beneath the waves to collect samples of one billion . microbes every four hours. Similar to fast photography that stops . action, the robotic device 'fixed' each sample so that whatever genes . the microbes were expressing at the moment of capture were preserved for . later study. After returning the samples to the . lab, researchers used cutting-edge analysis techniques to figure out . which genes within the microbes were actively being used at different . times of day. This involved sorting through millions . of billions of fragments of genetic material and then assigning each . fragment to a specific gene and a specific type of microbe. In so doing they created a time-lapse montage of the daily labours of a range of microbial species over a two-day period. A research vessel drifts near the buoy supporting the Environmental Sample Processor used to collect microbes for the experiment. Inset shows the yellow float with the ESP pressure housing suspended in the water . 'A naturalist like Sir David . Attenborough can follow a herd of elk and see how the elk’s behavior . changes hour to hour, day to day and week to week,' said Edward DeLong, . professor of environmental systems at MIT. Using their robot microbe collecting device, researchers were able to gather samples of one billion microbes every four hours and keep them 'fixed' at the moment of collection. This meant that whatever genes the microbes were expressing at the moment of capture were preserved for later study in the lab. Microbes are extraordinarily sensitive to slight environmental changes, altering their gene expression rapidly in response to fluctuations in temperature, light, nutrient availability and other environmental variables. Because of this, the genes they express tell a story about their habitat and their interactions with it. In essence, changes in their gene expression provide information on the good times and the bad times they experience. In a sense, each naturally occurring microbe is a living sensor and the researchers can read the sensors’ outputs by studying their gene expression. By studying these environmental responses the MIT/MBARI team were able to make completely new findings about the behaviour of the creatures. 'But we haven’t been able to observe naturally occurring microbes with that kind of resolution until now.' Professor DeLong, who is lead author . of a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . detailing the research, added: 'We've essentially captured a day in the . life of these microbes. 'As little as three years ago, I . wouldn’t have even have considered it possible to get such a high . resolution picture of microbial population dynamics and activity in the . ""real world"".' The montage showed photosynthetic . microbes, which create the oxygen, energy and organic carbon used by the . rest of the food web, ramped up their light-utilising activities in the . morning and powered those down at night, just as their domestic . brethren do in response to light and dark in the lab. But the underwater scenes also showed something scientists had never seen before. Non-photosynthetic, carbon-eating . microbes of very different species displayed synchronised, rapidly . varying metabolic gene expression - despite the fact that they came from . groups as different as humans and fungi. Some of the genes simultaneously . expressed by different species shared the same function — for instance, . genes associated with growth or respiration. Others encoded very different functions, mirroring the varied metabolic capabilities of the disparate species. 'We've essentially captured a day in the life of these microbes': Researchers readying the robotic device connected to a buoy for its two-day sampling journey off the coast of California . The researchers hypothesised that all . these microbes were reacting to the same environmental changes, but that . different groups of microbes were responding in different ways. Although the researchers cannot tell . exactly which environmental changes the microbes were responding to, . they suspect that the different groups of microbes were working together . to obtain different types of food. For example, some picoplankton could . have been consuming large organic compounds such as proteins and fats. In the process, they could have produced simpler organic compounds, such . as amino acids, which were then released into the surrounding seawater . and consumed by other picoplankton. 'These results show a surprising . amount of coordination between marine microbes,' said a spokesman for . the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. 'They also suggest that, as in the . food webs of larger organisms, many different groups of marine microbes . rely on each other to survive on a day-to-day basis. 'This could help explain why so many species of marine microbes are difficult or impossible to grow by themselves in the lab.'","U.S. researchers find that different forms of picoplankton react as one to environmental changes .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Everyone regrets not being more kind to a person at some point in their lives. And now scientists have shown that a mere seven hours of brain training can make humans kinder and more likely to help those in need. U.S. researchers have discovered that training people to be more compassionate actually changes their brains. Scientists have shown that a mere seven hours of brain training can make humans kinder (illustrated) and more likely to help those in need . Some scientists believe that kindness evolved from simple cooperation. They believe humans have evolved to think it’s better to take the risk of being generous and getting nothing in return, than destroying a potentially beneficial future relationship by being stingy. Talking about a 2011 study, Professor Leda Cosmides, of the University of California Santa Barbara, said: ‘There are two errors a co-operating animal can make, and one is more costly than the other. ‘Believing that you will never meet this individual again, you might choose to benefit yourself at his expense, only to find out later that the relationship could have been open-ended. ‘If you make this error, you lose out on all the benefits you might have had from a long-term. This is an extraordinarily costly error. ‘The other error is to mistakenly assume that you will have additional interactions, only to find out that it wasn’t necessary. Although you were “unnecessarily” nice in that interaction, the cost of this error is relatively small. Scientists at the Waisman Centre at the . University of Wisconsin-Madison, in Wisconsin, used compassion mediation . – an ancient Buddhist technique to increase caring feelings for people . who are suffering – in their experiment. Lead author Helen Weng said: ‘Our fundamental question was, “Can compassion be trained and learned in adults?” Our evidence points to yes.’ She likened the kindness training to weight training. ’Using this systematic approach, we found that people can actually build up their compassion “muscle” and respond to others' suffering with care and a desire to help.’ People who had compassion training were compared to a control group that learned cognitive reappraisal, which is a technique where people learn to reframe their thoughts to feel less negative. The researchers then looked at whether people became more altruistic and reported their findings in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science. Participants in the experiment played a . game on the internet in which they were given the opportunity to spend . their own money in order to help out someone in need. Scientists at the Waisman Centre at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, used compassion mediation ¿ an ancient Buddhist technique to increase caring feelings for people who are suffering ¿ in their experiment (stock image) Ms Weng said: ‘We found that people trained in compassion were more likely to spend their own money altruistically to help someone who was treated unfairly than those who were trained in cognitive reappraisal.’ The study also measured changes in brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after training. In an MRI scanner, participants viewed images depicting human suffering, such as a crying child or a burn victim and generated feelings of compassion towards the people using their practised skills. The control group was exposed to the same images and asked to recast them in a more positive light. The study found that people trained in compassion were more likely to spend their own money altruistically to help someone who was treated unfairly . The researchers measured how much brain activity had changed from the beginning to the end of the training and found that the people who were the most altruistic after compassion training were the ones who showed the most brain changes when viewing human suffering. They discovered that activity was increased in the inferior parietal cortex, a region of the brain involved in empathy and understanding others. Compassion training also increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the extent to which it communicated with the nucleus accumbens, which are brain regions involved in emotion regulation and the production of positive emotions. Ms Weng said people who completed kindness training learn to regulate their emotions so that they ‘approach people's suffering with caring’ and want to help those in need. The study also measured changes in brain responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after training. A stock MRI image is pictured . Compassion, like physical and academic skills, appears to be something that is not fixed, but rather can be enhanced with training and practice. Richard Davidson, a psychiatry professor at the university, said: ‘The fact that alterations in brain function were observed after just a total of seven hours of training is remarkable. ‘Compassion and kindness training in schools can help children learn to be attuned to their own emotions as well as those of others, which may decrease bullying. ‘Compassion training also may benefit people who have social challenges such as social anxiety or antisocial behaviour.’","Scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison said kindness is not fixed, but can be enhanced with training and practice .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A distant relative of the cos lettuce (pictured) was used as an aphrodisiac and as a phallic symbol by the ancient Egyptians, according to one egyptologist . Plenty of people view lettuce as a rather dull salad ingredient but the leafy vegetable had a racier function in ancient Egypt. A distant relative of the cos lettuce was taken as an aphrodisiac and used as a phallic symbol by the ancient Egyptians, according to one egyptologist. Salima Ikram of the American University of Cairo said that lettuces can be seen on the walls of tombs dating back to 2,000 BC and were supposedly the Egyptian god of fertility, Min's favourite food. The god, who is often depicted with an . erect penis in ancient wall paintings and hieroglyphs, was described as . the 'great of love' in a text from the Edfu Temple. And he might have lettuce to thank for this generous title because lettuce was believed to help Min 'perform the . sexual act untiringly,' said Professor Ikram. Lettuces have been eaten for millenia and the earliest version of the salad ingredient resembled a cos or romaine lettuce that we enjoy today, according to Smithsonian. In ancient Egypt in around 2,000BC, the leafy vegetable was not munched as a light meal or appetiser, but taken as an aphrodisiac, according to Professor Ikram. She specialises in ancient Egyptian food. Professor Ikram said Min's role changed over 3,000 years, but his association with the lettuce remained. Min (left) who is often depicted with an erect penis in ancient wall paintings and hieroglyphs, was described as the 'great of love' in a  text from Edfu Temple. The god might have lettuce to thank for his generous title as the leaf was believed to help him 'perform the sexual act untiringly' Lettuces became recognisable salad ingredients thanks to the Greeks and Romans in around 85 AD during the reign of Domitian. A salad was included at the beginning of a meal to stimulate appetite. It was eaten again at the end of a lavish meal to aid digestion. The Greeks and Romans used lettuce to help people sleep. Apparently . emperor Domitian forced his guests to eat the leafy vegetable before . their meal so they would struggle to stay awake for the remainder of . their visit. It is thought that the first depiction of the god with his favoured lettuce appears around 1980BC in The White Chapel of Senusret, although Ikram said there might be earlier examples. A relief from the funerary temple of Rameses III, shows Min's harvest festival. A statue of Min is pictured in the centre and behind him is a procession of priests holding small lettuces. The god is also sometimes depicted wearing a long red ribbon around his forehead to signify his sexual energy. Professor Ikram told Smithsonian: 'One of the reasons why [the Egyptians] . associated the lettuce with Min was because it grows straight and . tallâ€”an obvious phallic symbol.' The lettuce was thought to be sacred to Min because of its straight growth as well as the milky liquid that it exudes when first cut, which could be viewed as a symbol of a mother's milk or even semen. Interestingly the ancient Egyptians discarded the deep green leaves and instead of using the leaves in a meal, removed the seeds from flower buds. Min's role changed over 3,000 years, but his association with the lettuce remained. It is thought that the first depiction of the god and the lettuce appears around 1980BC in The White Chapel of Senusret . The Egyptologist said that the seeds were pressed to extract their natural oils, which were used for cooking, medication and even mummification. The leafy vegetable is also used as a traditional remedy for hair regrowth in modern Egypt.

"By . Tim Shipman . Tories demanded a show of force against Spain yesterday after a Spanish vessel made a ‘provocative incursion’ into Gibraltar’s  territorial waters. Britain summoned the Spanish ambassador for a dressing down after the ocean survey vessel spent 20 hours defying the Royal Navy’s demands that it depart, escalating the diplomatic tensions over the Rock. The incident was denounced in Britain as the ship withdrew last night. Scroll down for video . Royal Navy patrol boat HMS Sabre (pictured) intercepted a Spanish survey ship and asked it to leave British Gibraltar waters, but it refused. The Spanish ambassador has now been summoned to explain . But Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart, who was the British United Nations  commander during the Bosnian war, said that if the Government is serious about defending Gibraltar’s sovereignty it should send major combat units to deter Spanish grandstanding. Former Tory MP Louise Mensch added: ‘The next time a Spanish ship enters Gibraltarian waters and refuses to leave after Royal Navy warnings we should fire on them.’ The long-standing dispute between Britain and Spain has flared up over the past two years. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has blocked the Spanish-Gibraltarian border and staged numerous incursions into Gibraltarian waters. The latest crisis occurred when a research vessel belonging to the Spanish state, the RV Ramon Margalef, undertook significant surveying activity in Gibraltar’s territorial waters. A Royal Navy fast patrol boat was  dispatched to order it to leave. A video that appeared on Sky News showed the Spanish survey ship being flanked by small inflatable Navy boats. An audio recording that was also broadcast starts with the captain of the Ramon Margalef saying: ‘We have the permission of the Spanish authorities.’ Tensions have been high in the region since the summer when Spain imposed border checks on every car causing up to six hours of delays . An officer in one of the British boats . replies: ‘You are in British Gibraltar territorial waters. I consider . you to be violating the United Nations Convention on  the Law of the . Sea, article one nine,  governing the rights of passage. Your activities . are being recorded and reported via the national authorities. ‘You are to cease your ongoing activities and to leave British Gibraltar territorial waters immediately. Acknowledge.’ The captain of the Spanish boat then responds: ‘Good afternoon, sir. We are carrying out our survey work. We will continue with our work. We have got the necessary permits from Spain to perform such work. Thank you.’ The boat withdrew only after Spanish ambassador Federico Trillo was summoned by Matthew Rycroft, Acting Permanent Under Secretary at the Foreign Office – the third time he has been summoned over Gibraltar since the current Spanish government took office in December 2011. Europe Minister David Lidington said: ‘I strongly condemn this  provocative incursion and urge the Spanish government to ensure that it is not repeated. We stand ready to do whatever is required to protect Gibraltar’s sovereignty, economy and security.’ Mr Lidington said Spain has increased the number of its incursions into British territorial waters from around five per month to around 40 per month. The event comes two weeks after a Spanish boat made dangerous manoeuvres near Royal Navy  vessels in British waters, putting lives at risk and resulting in a minor collision. A Foreign Office source described relations with Spain as ‘well past the asking nicely stage’. But Conservatives expressed frustration that the Government has not taken a firmer line against Spanish provocation. David Cameron did not protest last week when the European Commission  refused to condemn Spain for blocking the Spanish-Gibraltar border over the summer. Colonel Stewart called for troops to be sent to the Rock: ‘I am afraid the Government has got to be stronger. ‘For goodness sake, can we get a stronger response to what’s happening to our people in Gibraltar? Why doesn’t the British Government make more use of the defence facilities in Gibraltar, by sending down more often an infantry company to be based in Gibraltar for perhaps six weeks at a time to exercise there, rather than sending it to somewhere  like Kenya.’ Foreign Office Minister Mark Simmonds responded: ‘We must strike a balance between being forceful, strong, determined to ensure the Spanish understand the UK Government’s position. ‘But we must also find mechanisms to de-escalate the situation, which is why we must get back to discussing solutions – without negotiating Gibraltarian sovereignty.’","Spanish ship RV Ramon Margalef entered British waters yesterday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An 18-year-old student at a Connecticut high school currently is engaged in a battle with the school board over whether her boyfriend will be allowed to accompany her to the school's senior prom. The problem: His age - Mikayla Perlotto's boyfriend will be 22 years old, and the school has a policy banning anyone over the age of 20 from attending the prom. To gain public support, Perlotto - a senior at Torrington High School - wrote a 229-word Facebook post arguing in favor of allowing her soon-to-be-22-year-old boyfriend, Ethan Gleason, to attend the prom on May 23, despite the school's policy. Too old: 22-year-old Ethan Gleason isn't allowed to go to his 18-year-old girlfriend, Mikayla Perlotto's (both pictured), prom because the school board says he's too old . Honor student: Perlotto is an honor student and has been a member of the school's softball team her entire high school career . On Wednesday, Perlotto and her mother, Donna spoke at a Board of Education meeting, making the case for the district to allow Gleason to attend his girlfriend's prom. The Board is yet to make a decision, but Superintendent Cheryl Kloczko has agreed to meet with Gleason before deciding on whether he can attend, reports the Register Citizen. 'I don’t have concerns with the person,' Kloczko told the paper. 'I just have concerns with the age. We’d like to meet the . gentleman.' The Board has only granted one exception to the rule barring non-students from attending the prom, according to Board Chairman Ken Traub. Other efforts to gain approval for an older date to attend have been shot down. 'You’re putting age groups together that are way too different,' he said. 'I know there’s going to be 15-year-olds there.' Booze: The school worries that Gleason will buy alcohol for other students, so he said they could search his car and give him a breathalyzer . Perlotto first asked the school's director of secondary education, Eric Baim, who was not swayed by her argument. Baim tells the paper he and other school officials have 'concerns' about allowing a college student to attend a high school dance. 'There’s a lot of concerns,' Baim said. 'Concerns for everybody.' Donna Perlotto says she's called Kloczko's office four times to discuss the matter, but never managed to get through to speak with her. So she and her daughter decided to speak at the Board's public comment portion of Wednesday's meeting. 'It’s a mess,' she said. 'I can’t say they don’t care; it’s just we need . to discuss this — the pros and the cons. It breaks my heart that no one . is responding.' Mikayla says that much of Baim's concern was about whether her of-age boyfriend would be purchasing alcohol for other students. Rules: School Superintendent has agreed to meet with Gleason before she makes her decision . 'His rule was that he didn’t want anybody above the age of 20 because of the alcohol,' she said. Gleason, however - a student at Branford Hall Career Institute - tells the paper that he rarely drinks and wouldn't risk the consequences of supplying minors with alcohol. 'How would I supply a whole school of minors with that?' Gleason said. 'It’s . not possible. I’m not going to jeopardize myself for some kid who wants . to manipulate the system.' He also agreed to meet with Baim to discuss the matter, and says he would even allow a chaperone at the prom to check his car for alcohol and submit to a breathalyzer at the door. 'At least meet me. Sit down and have a conversation with me,' Gleason added. 'Don’t just judge me because of my age.' Exception: Torrington High School has only made one exception to its age rule for the prom and denied all other requests . Perlotto says she plans to attend the prom regardless of the Board's decision - she says she's already picked out a dress. 'I haven’t had a chance to see her in it,' Gleason said. Gleason also says that regardless of the Board's decision, he plans to pick his girlfriend up from her house, take pictures, go out to dinner and then drop her off at the dance. who still plans . to pick up Perlotto from the house, take pictures, go to dinner and . drop her off at prom. Gleason certainly has the approval of his girlfriend's family, and Donna Perlotto said that the school district should trust that she wouldn't let her daughter date a creep. 'We don’t just let our daughter date anybody,' she said. 'But he’s been . over at for dinner, to family functions, to Easter brunch. He’s part of . our family. I see the way he talks to her, opening doors for her, He’s . caring; he’s considerate.'","Torrington High School has a policy that no one over 20 is allowed at the prom .

"Judge Nigel Seed decided not to send a rioter to prison because he had a violent childhood . A judge re-ignited the row over soft sentencing yesterday after allowing a rioter who hurled rocks at the police and helped to set a car ablaze to walk free. Judge Nigel Seed said Nooragha Zadran had seen so much violence in his home country before moving to Britain that he should not be locked up. The decision comes only days after another judge provoked an outcry by telling a burglar that it took ‘courage’ to break into somebody’s home. Tory MPs said the latest ruling showed the huge challenge facing new Justice Secretary Chris Grayling to get a grip on the legal system and end the scandal of soft sentencing. Zadran, 18, was found guilty of violent  disorder and arson during the London riots last year. But Judge Seed let him off with a fine after saying he had been used to witnessing violence every day and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Zadran claims he was only five when both of his parents were killed in Afghanistan by a bomb which struck their home, a court heard yesterday. He was left to fend for his younger brother by begging on the streets, but, after leaving him in a playground, he found he had gone missing and was never found. Zadran then managed to travel to the UK as a young boy, and has been in the care of social services. During the riots last August, he threw rocks at police and lit the rag that was used to set fire to a parked car in Lewisham, South-East London. Judge Seed described his case as ‘exceptional’. He said: ‘No other defendant will have appeared in front of the courts in such circumstances, that is why you are not being sentenced to two to three years in prison,’ he said. Nooragha Zadran, 18, (not pictured) was found guilty of violent disorder and arson during the London riots last year . Inner London Crown Court heard that Zadran – who works at a mobile phone kiosk in Lewisham – is ‘extremely vulnerable’ and prone to exploitation as a result of his childhood. He was also said to suffer from severe post-traumatic stress disorder, stress and anxiety. He was handed a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years. The judge said: ‘I take into account the fact that at an early age you were living in war-torn Afghanistan. The family home was bombed and the explosion killed your mother and father, leaving you and your siblings orphans. You were left to beg because of your destitution. The decision comes only days after another judge let a 'courageous' burglar (not pictured) walk free . ‘You left your younger brother in a playground to try to beg, and  he then disappeared, and all this happened before you were ten. ‘You suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, and a particularly complex form of post-traumatic stress disorder, which is very serious and makes you vulnerable to exploitation, and unable to think clearly.’ Neil Griffin, defending, had told the court that his client had got involved in ‘half an hour of madness’ and he wished ‘he could turn the clock back’. Zadran, of Rotherhithe, South-East London, was ordered to pay £2,000 to the owner of the car, and required to attend mental health treatment as part of his sentence. Other rioters have received immediate imprisonment. Since Mr Grayling took over from Kenneth Clarke at the Justice Department last week, he has been left in no doubt of the challenges he faces getting a grip on the soft justice system. Last week Judge Peter Bowers provoked an outcry when he told an offender who burgled three homes in five days: ‘It takes a huge amount of courage, as far as I can see, for somebody to burgle somebody’s house. I wouldn’t have the nerve.’ Handing 26-year-old Richard Richford, from Redcar, a suspended 12-month term, the judge said: ‘I’m going to take a chance on you.’ The judge, who is now under investigation by the Judicial Communications office for his handling of the case, also claimed jail would not ‘do much good’ in this case. Tory MP Priti Patel said of the Zadran verdict: ‘Cases like this do little to restore public confidence in the criminal justice system and it is about time that criminals were treated like criminals and punished for their crimes. ‘Along with standing up for the victims of crime, I am sure that restoring public confidence in our justice system will be a strong focus for our new Justice Secretary’.","Rioter let off because he was exposed to so much violence in his home country of Afghanistan .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Louise Boyle . In an apparent attempt to defend racist comments he made in a recently published New York Times profile, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy held a press conference on Thursday where he explained some of his earlier, racist remarks - specifically, one in which he said he often wonders whether 'negroe' were better of during slavery. 'I’m not saying that I thought they should be slaves. I’m not even saying they was better off,' Bundy said in his speech. 'I’m a wondering if they were better off?' The rancher then reiterated some of the points he made in his previous speech. Derp: In an attempt to defend his previous racist comments, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy made a few more racist comments . 'I’m a wondering. Cliven Bundy is wondering about the black community. Are they better off with their woman aborting their children? Are they better off with their young men in prison? Are they with the older people on the sidewalks in front of their government-issued homes with a few children?' he rambled. 'Are they better off, are they happier than they was when they was in the south in front of their homes with their chickens, and their gardens, and their children around them - and their men having something to do?' Bundy has become something of a celebrity in his frontier stronghold since his showdown over land with federal authorities earlier this month. Officials had tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 after 20 years of not paying taxes. However they were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed with sniper rifles, turned up and threatened to open fire. The incident has propelled Bundy into a position of authority among those who believe that they are being harassed by an 'overreaching' federal government. Bundy has leapt on to this platform, holding daily news conferences next to the armed checkpoint on the driveway of his ranch. On Saturday he made a rambling speech littered with racist remarks to a gathering made up of local supporters and a few scattered members of the press. Scroll down for video . Flanked by armed supporters, rancher Cliven Bundy speaks at a protest camp near Bunkerville, Nevada on April 18 . Bundy, a 67-year-old father-of-14 and registered Republican, stopped paying taxes in 1993 . During his speech, Bundy shared a story of driving through a housing project in Las Vegas, according to a report by the New York Times, beginning his tale with the words: 'I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro.' He said: 'In front of that . government house the door was usually open and the older people and the . kids - and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the . porch - they didn’t have nothing to do. They didn’t have nothing for . their kids to do. They didn’t have nothing for their young girls to do. 'And . because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they . do? They abort their young children, they put their young . men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I’ve . often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having . a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government . subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.' Rancher Cliven Bundy (center with his arm around his granddaughter Jerusha) greets supporters during a Bundy family 'Patriot Party' near Bunkerville, Nevada, on April 18 . Mr Bundy, a 67-year-old father-of 14 and registered Republican, is . accused of not paying federal grazing taxes for his cattle for 20 . years, and reportedly owes the government $1million. A federal taskforce . has been setup to deal with him, Senate majority leader and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid said last week, branding Bundy a 'domestic terrorist'. The Bureau of Land Management tried to round up Bundy's cattle earlier this month but were forced to back down after hundreds of supporters, some carrying automatic weapons and sniper rifles, threatened violence. Reid accused the militia supporting Reid of deliberately putting women and children into the firing line so that, in the event of violence, they got hurt first ensuring the worst possible headlines. Meanwhile Bundy has warned that he will never back down down from his fight. 'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline earlier this month. 'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.' He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada. He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.' Officials tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 but were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed, turned up and threatened to open fire . Bundy won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land . Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as . part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada. Craig Leff, from the Bureau of Land Management, told the Times: 'The gather is now over. Our focus is pursuing this matter . administratively and judicially.' Fears . of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped . out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call . off their operation. Supporters . of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken . in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at . any moment. Many . of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads . around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared . to take on the federal agents in a fire fight. One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down'. The . dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he . stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze . public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave . Desert tortoise. Surrounding Bundy's ranch, one armed man (not pictured) was heard saying he had officials 'in his sights' during the heated stand-off earlier this month . Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years. The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle. Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy. It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2million he owes to the Government. The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region. The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals. The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.","Cattle rancher Cliven Bundy allegedly refuses to pay $1m taxes on his herd .

"By . Helen Pow . George Clooney's business partner Rande Gerber insists the two-time Oscar winner was not drunk and had not been downing tequila shots before he called Las Vegas hotel bigwig Steve Wynn an 'a**hole.' Details of the verbal bust up, which occured two weeks ago at a restaurant inside Wynn's Encore hotel, emerged yesterday, and the 72-year-old billionaire claims Clooney had been drinking heavily before the name-calling began. But Gerber, who owns Casamigos tequila with Clooney and is married to Cindy Crawford, was also there and denies Wynn's account, insisting 'We weren't drunk... no shots were had.' Partners: 'We were not drunk' Rande Gerber, right, said of himself and Casamigos Tequila partner George Clooney, left, at the time of the altercation . The fight kicked off after Wynn, a verbal opponent to Obamacare, called President Barack Obama an 'a**hole. 'This wasn't about politics. It was about George standing up for a friend,' Gerber told TMZ. Clooney confessed to calling Wynn an 'a**hole' back and then storming off after the insult. The actor and Gerber were in Vegas promoting Casamigos tequila at a Wine & Spirits convention, and were invited to dine with Wynn and his wife, Andrea Hissom, at the fancy Botero restaurant. But when dinner was finished, the conversation turned to Obama's Affordable Care Act, and that's when sparks began to fly. Falling out: George Clooney, pictured right in January with Steve Wynn and his wife Andrea, allegedly said the F-word at a recent dinner with the couple . Clooney immediately took exception to how the billionaire chairman and CEO spoke of his 'longtime friend.' He allegedly declared that he didn't have to listen to 'this f***ing stuff' before exiting to another bar. Wynn told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Clooney likes his alcohol and 'got drunk' after drinking tequila shots. 'When he's drinking, he considers himself a close personal buddy of the president,' the said. 'Clooney's fun to be with when he's sober. If you have a chance to drink with him, you want to get there early, and don't stay late. 'Everybody who's in my business, the casino business, knows to take actors with a grain of salt.' Wynn added Clooney's partners were 'mortified.' Fancy: The row took place two weeks ago at the posh Botero Restaurant, pictured, which is located inside Wynn's Encore Hotel . Stories: Wynn, left, said Clooney had been downing tequila shots and was 'drunk' but Clooney, right, claims Wynn insulted his 'longtime friend' President Obama . Model wife: Rande Gerber is married to supermodel Cindy Crawford, pictured . However, . in a statement sent to the newspaper, Clooney said: 'There were nine . people at that table ... so you can ask them. ... Steve likes to go on . rants. 'He . called the president an a**hole ... that is a fact ... I said the . President was my longtime friend and then he said ""your friend is an . a**hole."" '...At that point I told Steve that HE was an asshole and I wasn't going to sit at his table while he was being such a jackass. 'And I walked out. There were obviously quite a few more adjectives and adverbs used by both of us. He added: 'It had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with character.' Clooney and Gerber were joined by fellow business partner Michael Meldman, as well as a few others.","Rande Gerber insists the two-time Oscar winner was not drunk and had not been downing tequila shots before the verbal bust up .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A five-month-old boy has grown a five-inch tail. Nuo Nuo was born with spina bifida, a rare spinal defect which leaves a gap in the spine. Within days, his mother noticed a prominent tail beginning to form, which is still steadily increasing in size. Nuo Nuo is awaiting surgery in Changsha, China, to remove his five-inch tail caused by a spinal defect . Distraught, she has implored surgeons in Changsha, China, to remove the growth but so far it has been deemed not possible. The growth will have started within Nuo Nuo's first month in the womb. In the first four weeks, developing babies grow a structure called the . neural tube. It is this that will eventually form the spine and nervous . system. In cases of spina bifida, the spinal column - the bone that surrounds and protects the nerves - does not fully close. The growth is a symptom of spina bifida, where the end of the spine does not fully close . The exact causes are unknown, but several risk factors have been identified, the most significant being a lack of folic acid before and at the very start of pregnancy. It affects one pregnancy in every 1,000 in Britain. In most cases surgery can be done to close the defect. However, damage to the nervous system will usually already have taken place, resulting in a range of symptoms, including paralysis and incontinence.","Five-month-old Nuo Nuo was born with spina bifida, a rare spinal defect .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Tornado alley is about to come out of . hibernation with a ‘significant multi-day severe event’ that may match . all-time historic tornado outbreaks. Forecasters are predicting severe storms across Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas from Saturday to Monday that are expected to produce strong tornadoes impacting millions of people. The confluence of a low pressure system and moisture from the Gulf of Mexico are forecast to fuel supercell thunderstorms that will produce heavy rain, damaging winds, hail and deadly twisters. The storm front will move across the Rocky Mountains and into the southern plains by Saturday morning before strengthening on the back of Gulf moisture before moving east, according to the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center. Waking up: An abnormally quiet tornado season is expected to wake up with a bang from Texas to Arkansas . Saturday night will bring the first severe weather threat, but Sunday night is when the worst of the storms and tornadoes is expected to occur. The twisters may touch down in the highly populated metro areas of Dallas, Kansas City and Omaha before shifting east towards St Louis, Memphis, Nashville and Baton Rouge, NOAA said. Historical comparisons to the current forecast by Slate have led to even more grim predictions. ‘When you match the forecasted pattern for Sunday… a few of the most infamous tornado outbreaks in decades appear,’ the site said. Some of those outbreaks include an 88 tornado event across 12 states in April 2010 that, at one point, spawned an EF4 tornado that killed 10, injured hundreds was almost two miles wide during the height of its 150-mile-long path of destruction. Tornadoes are measured from one to five on the Fujita scale, with five being the most devastating. An April 1991 outbreak that killed nearly two dozen people between Texas and Iowa included an EF5 tornado that levelled the town of Andover, Kansas. This has been the ‘least active tornado year to date,’ according to the NWS. That is about to change. Anyone living in the areas expected to be affected is encouraged by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to prepare accordingly. Also, don’t hide under overpasses.","This spring has been the least active tornado season in decades .

"By . Ted Thornhill . and Jessica Jerreat . One of two brothers who was sent to prison as a teenager over the murder of his parents in New Hampshire in 1996 has been given parole. Jeffrey Dingman was 14 when he helped his brother Robert, then aged 17, to shoot their parents and hide the bodies in the family home. The 32-year-old was released last month after spending more than half his life in prison, and will remain on parole for life. Released: Jeffrey Dingman, pictured right at a hearing last December, has been freed on parole . Dingman is currently living with his mother's sister, Elizabeth Landry, who is said to have supported his early release. She has said she plans to help Dingham, who has spent all his adult life in prison, to integrate into society again by taking him movies and social events. 'The parole board laid out some . conditions … and he met those conditions and he was released from . prison,' Andrea Goldberg, of the state Parole . Board, told Foster's Daily Democrat. While his parole case was being heard, Dingman was moved to a halfway house in Manchester, and had found a job at a mill. However, he was forced to quit after local newspapers reported on his parole hearing. Jeffrey Lyons, spokesman for the Department of Corrections in New Hampshire, said it was common for inmates to be found work. They are allowed to keep some of the wages and the rest is put in a savings account for them, for when they are released. Trial: Jeffrey Dingman, aged 15 in 1997, looks on as then New Hampshire assistant attorney general John Kacavas shows the .22 caliber pistol that was used to kill his parents, Vance and Eve Dingman . 'The parole officer offers job referrals . and treatment referral services but the state does not pay for that. However, we can assist the parolee in obtaining fee waivers when . possible,' he added. Dingman had been sentenced to 30 years in prison, with 12 years suspended, as part of a plea deal at his 1997 trial. Murder case: Dingman arriving at Strafford County Super Court in Dover for his trial in 1996 . His brother, Robert, was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder, and was sentenced to live in prison with no parole. The brothers had shot their parents, Vance and Eve, as they returned home from work on February 6, 1996. The bodies were then wrapped in bags and hidden in the home while the teenagers spent the weekend partying. Police discovered the victims three days later, when a colleague of Mrs DIngham reported that she had failed to turn up for work. At his parole hearing in December last year, Dingham said: ‘I've stayed out of trouble. I've tried to get myself prepared to move forward.' Members of the parole board had said at the hearing they were pleased with how well Dingham had done well in prison and at the halfway house, but they worried that he lacks the life skills to succeed in society because he went to prison so young. They said they were concerned that he had little experience with everyday activities such as managing money, using a cellphone or going to the movies. ‘I don't want to just throw you out there cold,’ board member Mark Furlone told him. ‘For 16 years, you've been insulated from the real world.’ Dingman earned his high school equivalency degree while in prison and has saved most of his paychecks . But when asked in December whether he had any support in the community, he answered ‘not really.’ Dingman's aunt, however, told the board that wasn't true. Speaking through tears, Mrs Landry of Greenfield, New Hampshire, said she misses her sister and brother-in-law every day, but wants to help her nephew. ‘My husband and I are willing to help Jeffrey at a second chance at life,’ she said. ‘We truly mean it from the bottom of our hearts. We forgive him.’ Remorse: Dingman, pictured center in December, says he is wracked with guilt over the shootings . Dingham's lawyer, Mark Stevens said his client was still wracked with guilt over his parents' murders., adding: 'He thinks about it every day and has every day since it happened.’ During his brother's trial, Dingman admitted wounding his parents but said his brother instigated the killings and finished off both parents, taunting each before firing the fatal shots. He said Robert asked their father, already shot once, ‘How about another one?’ and told his mother: ‘Die, bitch!’ before shooting her in the head. Prosecutors said the older brother had chafed under his parents' rules and curfews, and Dingham  described being yelled at repeatedly by his mother and hit by his father over bad grades. But family members denied the boys were abused and described the parents, both 40, as devoted to their sons. Vance Dingman's sister, Darlyn, told the Associated Press in December that she opposed Jeffrey's release. ‘Personally, we wish he had fried, but that didn't happen,’ she said. ‘He should not be let out. He's as guilty as his brother.’","Jeffrey Dingman and his brother Robert shot their mom and dad in 1996 .

"By . Tracey Cox . While it’s entirely possible to fake feelings while awake, you can’t fake anything when you’re asleep. Recent research shows the way you sleep together reveals clues about your true emotions and state of your relationship. It makes sense when you think about it: the closer you are, the closer you’re likely to sleep. If you fear someone’s about to leave you, chances are you'll cling on tight. Tracey says that the closer you are as a couple, the closer you are likely to be in bed . If you're the one thinking of leaving, you’ll create distance between you. UK Professor Richard Wiseman recently asked more than 1000 people to describe their favourite sleeping position and rate the quality of their relationship. His results match earlier Californian research. Do you fall asleep entwined in a full-body cuddle? Or is it more a case of edge-of-the-bed balancing to avoid the accidental brush of skin against skin? Here's the verdict on your sleeping style. Tracey says that if we distance ourselves physically in bed, it could be a sign that we are emotionally distant when we're awake . You sleep face to face, every part touching . You do it: The pose of new lovers smack in the middle of the I-can't-believe-I've-found-you bit. It shows a desire to connect on all levels, a need for reassurance (by hanging on possessively, they can't run away) and a total commitment to each other and the relationship. If you’re still doing it years in, however, there’s a hint of Tweedledum-Tweedledee co-dependency (not a bad idea to un-velcro your hips now and then). You don't: Panic not. This is the least favourite position of all with only four percent of couples claiming to like it. I say 'claim' because, seriously, who can sleep like this? Who doesn't worry their breath will smell (or their partner’s), that they'll dribble or snore or open their eyes to see their partner looking aghast because they’ve seen your 'sleeping face'? (My latest paranoia having recently slept and woken face to face with a mirror, worst fears realized.) Sleeping trapped in your lover's arms is blissful initially. But it's totally impractical if you want to move or itch, your arm goes dead, you’re overcome by claustrophobia, have a hot flush or the beans you ate earlier start fermenting. Tracery says it is harder to disguise our feelings when we're asleep, so where you and your partner lie in your bed could say a lot about your relationship . You sleep 'spooned' - one of you on your side, the other snuggled up behind . You do it: This is the classic 'happy couple' position - you're both loving and want to be physically close. Thirty-one percent of couples sleep facing the same direction. You don't: If it's not sweltering hot and/or it’s the 'bean thing' again (see above), how's your sex life? Few couples hug or spoon during sleep if they’re sexually frustrated or resentful. The partner who’s not eager for sex is worried any sign of affection will be interpreted as an invitation, the other gets the message any touch is unwelcome so stops trying. You sleep back to back but your bottoms touch . You do it: This is the most popular position (42% prefer sleeping back to back). Most studies suggest it's far more comfortable to sleep solo, yet few dispute the joy of sleeping with someone you love. Tracey calls sleeping at opposite ends of the bed the 'pre-divorce' position . This is a good compromise and a sign you’re in good shape. When awake, you’re likely to be affectionate and not afraid of intimacy but not overly needy either. You don't: The critical point here isn't so much if your bottoms touch but how far away they are. If it’s less than an inch, relax. Eighty-six percent of couples in the survey who slept less than an inch away were happy in their relationships. The real danger is when you’re inching into the next category… . You both sleep on the edge of the bed, facing in opposite directions . You do it: This is the post-argument or pre-divorce position. Lots of space between you during sleep usually translates to emotional distance during waking hours. If one or both of your arms cross over your body, you're protecting yourself emotionally by subliminally covering your heart. Only two percent of couples sleep over 30 inches apart (though possibly another question that should have been asked is 'How big is your bed?') You don't: If you seriously are so far apart from each other, you’re threatening to fall out of the bed, you're at the 'skin crawl' stage. The relationship's not just over, repulsion has set in. But if there’s only a few inches between you, it could mean you both simply like a bit of space or have different 'resting' body temperatures (one of you would overheat in the deep freeze, the other shiver in the Sahara.) But whatever your position, turns out the bottom line isn’t so much where your bottoms are or whether limbs entwine but how often you touch during the night. Ninety-four percent of the happiest couples were those who reached out a foot or a hand, exchanged a word, a kiss or reassuring caress (a fallout of being glued to the Pistorius trial - to check you’re both still there and alive and kicking).

"By . Associated Press . Former Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar believes he's been unfairly sacked as a TV broadcaster. Kosar has been removed as a color commentator for Cleveland's preseason games by the team. The Browns said Wednesday night he was being replaced by Solomon Wilcots, who will work with play-by-play announcer Jim Donovan. Kosar contends he's been removed because of slurred speech he attributes to 'a direct result of the many concussions I received while playing in the NFL.' 'This is very unfortunate,' he said in a . statement, 'as I believe my football acumen and ability to describe . what is happening on the field, has been well received by Cleveland . Browns fans.' Unfair: Former Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar, pictured in 2012, believes he's been unfairly sacked as a TV broadcaster . The 50-year-old Kosar estimates he has had more than a dozen documented concussions. He has been in pain for more than a decade, but said last year he found some relief through treatments at a wellness facility in Florida. In announcing their decision, the Browns said they were in discussions with Kosar about 'potential new roles"" on pregame telecasts and on the team's website. 'We want Browns fans to look forward to seeing and hearing his continued contributions and analysis,' team president Alec Scheiner said. Kosar played for Cleveland from 1985-92 and retired in 1996. The gangly quarterback from Boardman, Ohio, led Cleveland to three AFC title games. He remains one of Cleveland's most beloved sports figures. Replaced: The Browns said Wednesday night Kosar, pictured during a broadcast in August last year, was being replaced by Solomon Wilcots, who will work with play-by-play announcer Jim Donovan . Former star: Kosar, pictured during a 1988 NFL game, led Cleveland to three AFC title games . 'I love to put the personal touch, pride in the Browns, and pride in our Cleveland community into the broadcast,' he said. 'Being able to share these preseason games with my fellow Cleveland Browns fans is truly one of the remaining joys in my life. 'I would hope that WKYC would reconsider utilizing my in-game talents and overlook my concussion-induced impairment. I want everyone to know that I still bleed Brown and Orange.' Last summer, Kosar drew criticism for in-game comments about former St. Louis third-string quarterback Kellen Clemens, the Rams' receivers and assistant coach Ray Sherman. St. Louis coach Jeff Fisher said of Kosar: 'I lost a lot of respect for him. It's highly unlikely he knew anything about our football team, but felt the need to make those comments. I don't think they were justified.' The Browns apologized to the Rams and reprimanded Kosar.","Bernie Kosar has been removed as a color commentator for Cleveland's preseason games by the Browns .

One of the three American doctors killed in Afghanistan has been identified as a pediatrician who 'felt called' to move to Kabul. Dr Jerry Umanos practiced in the inner-city of Chicago before moving to Afghanistan seven years ago. Dr Umanos and a father and son who were visitng Cure International Hospital were killed at the western Kabul center on Thursday morning after an Afghan security guard opened fire. The names of the related victims have not yet been released.

"By . Snejana Farberov . U.S. Navy veteran Madelynn Taylor and her late wife, Jean Mixner, were hoping to spend eternity together, but because of an Idaho state law defining marriage as only a union between a man and a woman, they will have to be buried apart. Taylor served six years in the Navy between 1958 and 1964 before she was dishonorably discharged after a recruit went to her superior and revealed that she and another servicewoman were gay. Taylor’s status was later amended to honorable on appeal, and now she is entitled to be laid to rest in the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery. Scroll down for video . One love: Navy veteran Madelynn Taylor (right), pictured here on Veterans' Day in 2011 with her late wife, Jean Mixer (left), wants to change Idaho state law so she could be buried with her spouse . Ban: Under state law, Taylor's wife cannot be laid to rest in the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery because the state does not recognize same-sex marriages . Under state law, if the veteran was married to a man, her spouse could have been buried with her at the military cemetery. But because Taylor had a wife who passed away in 2012, her application to have the two of them interred together has been rejected. Federal law allows same-sex couples where one of the spouses is a veteran to be laid to rest together in national cemeteries like Arlington in Virginia, but the same cannot be said of state burial grounds, which are subjected to state laws. The Idaho State Constitution states: ‘A marriage between a man and a woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this state.’ Idaho Division of Veterans Services Deputy Administrator Tamara Mackenthun told KTVB that in Taylor's case, they have to follow Idaho's definition of spouse. Angered by her predicament, Madelynn Taylor has taken up the cause of same-sex military couples with the goal of changing the Idaho State Constitution. Then and now: Madelynn Taylor pictured left in 1959, when she was in the Navy; Taylor's mugshot (right) following her March 2014 arrest at an Add the Words protest at the Idaho Statehouse . ‘Normally I stammer and stutter myself. I'm not a public speaker,’ Taylor said. ‘I'm a background person. I work in the background. What's changed is I got mad at the cemetery, and decided it's time to do something about it.’ As a Navy veteran, Taylor can be buried with her deceased wife in another veterans cemetery, but the 74-year-old long-time Idaho resident does not want to settle. ‘I just feel that it's the right place for me. You know, I'm a veteran. So they should let me... in fact they would let me alone, be in that crypt,’ Taylor said. 'But I don't want to alone. I want Jean with me.’ For Taylor and Mixner, it was love at first sight when the two women met in 1995. Later that same year, the happy couple held a symbolic wedding ceremony in Oregon. In 2008, the life partners legally tied the knot in California not long before the passage of Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriages. Then two years ago, Mixner passed away from complications related to emphysema, and her widow decided that it was time to make final arrangements for herself as her health has gone into decline. ‘I'm a stroke waiting to happen,’ Taylor told KBOI 2News Wednesday. Since 2012, Taylor has kept her wife's ashes at home, waiting to be laid to rest with her own remains when her time came. Taylor said she was not surprised when her request to be buried with Mixner was rejected by the state veterans cemetery. ‘I've been discriminated against for 70 years, and they might as well discriminate against me in death as well as life,’ she said. The 74-year-old veteran said that the cemetery plot has plenty of space to house both her and her wife's ashes, so they would not have to take up any additional space. ‘I don't see where the ashes of a couple old lesbians is going to hurt anyone,’ Taylor said. The ailing septuagenarian has since joined the Add the Four Words protest to change the state constitution, which so far has landed her in jail on two separate occasions. If Madelynn Taylor passes away before the law is amended, she has made arrangements for someone to hold onto her and Mixner's ashes until they are permitted to be interred together. ‘Eventually I'm going to be there. It'll happen. They might as well give up and let us go now,’ Taylor stated.","U.S. Navy veteran Madelynn Taylor, 74, wants to be buried in Idaho State Veterans Cemetery with her wife, Jean Mixner, who died in 2012 .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . One of the most iconic women's magazines of the last century, Ladies' Home Journal, is ceasing its monthly publication and doing away with subscriptions. According to Meredith, the Iowa-based . publishing giant that owns the magazine, Ladies Home Journal is . 'transitioning' the title to 'a special interest publication,' which . will publish less frequently, in an unknown format. The publishing world is awash with rumors, and the entire New York-based editorial team was made redundant this morning - with most agreeing that the news spells the end for the magazine, at least as we know it. The end of an era: Ladies' Home Journal announced today that it will cease the monthly publication of its magazine and 'transition' it to a 'special interest' periodical instead . The women's lifestyle magazine, which has featured the likes of Michelle Obama, Madonna and former president George Bush on its cover, opened its doors in 1883 and adopted the slogan 'Never . underestimate the power of women' in the mid-Forties, a motto it has kept until . today. Just two years ago, the publication underwent a major . redesign, placing Kate Winslet on the cover of their first re-vamped issue. Oscar-winning actress Sally Field graced their latest edition. Covering the arenas of family, marriage, work, home and . beauty, it has enjoyed a relatively long life as a companion for the mainstream . women of its time. Struggles: Only two years ago, the magazine underwent a major re-design in an attempt to claw its way back to success, the first cover in the new format fronted by Kate Winslet (pictured) Material girl: Fashion chameleon Madonna graces this July 2005 issue, looking sharp in a white tweed suit, her hair in a short, curly bob . Political war: The August 2004 issue was released with two covers, one fronted by former president George Bush and his wife Laura (right), and the other with political opponent John Kerry and his wife Teresa (left) Controversial: A radiantly youthful looking Kelly Preston, posing with husband John Travolta cover this April 2005 cover, in which the Scientologist couple insisted on conducting their interview in the church's Florida headquarters . Often touching on political hot points, the magazine shot two competing covers for its August 2004 issue - half the newsstand issues featuring George Bush and his wife Laura on the cover, and the other half showing political opponents John and Teresa Kerry; both including in-depth interviews with both. Its 2010 issue profiled first lady Michelle Obama, who dished on her family's health and her eating habits, admitting she can't stand beets and that she occasionally does a dietary cleanse to 'clear her palate' and 'change her mind set'. Another notable cover starred Scientologists John Travolta and his wife Kelly Preston in 2005, who insisted on conducting their accompanying interview at the controversial church's headquarters in Florida. Ms Preston, asserted that the religion had made her a better person: '[I'm a] better wife...better mother, better friend,'  she said in the story. Precious moment: A photo from the magazine's 1995 edition, which captures a mother dutifully sewing the hem of her daughter's wedding dress . Finishing touches: This image, taken from a 1950 edition of Ladies' Home Journal, depicts a neatly groomed woman perfecting the art of baking a cake . Important conundrums: This soap advert from a 1934 issue of the magazine sees one woman ask the crucial question, 'But how do you keep such a nice gloss on your tub?' One of its most popular and enduring columns was named Can This Marriage Be Saved, which . was launched in the Fifties. In it, each member of a couple in a . troubled marriage explains their view of the problem, a marriage . counselor offers some solutions, and the outcome is published. Current . woes include 'She loves the dog more than me', 'He loves sport more . than me', and 'His elderly parents are too demanding' - we can only . guess what sort of problems were sent in during the Fifties. Back . in 1884, Ladies' Home Journal was launched under the ownership of . publishing heavyweight Cyrus Curtis, but it was written and run by his . wife, Louisa. It was one of the first of its kind; a magazine written . for women, by women. Swoon: A glimpse into romance in the Twenties, this 1929 illustration for the magazine depicts a young man proposing to his sweetheart . Wedding belles! A bride dressed in her elaborate nuptials gown is seen being tended to by a maid in uniform, in this 1912 illustration . Spot of golf? Twenty years into the magazine's life, this 1900 cover shows a party of male and female golfers in smart attire on a snowy winter's day . Lady in red: One year later and the golf trend endures, on this 1901 cover, which sees the woman adopt a relatively manly pose for the times . Mrs Curtis, who . identified herself as a strong feminist, championed women's education in . the 19th Century and argued that the success of her magazine proved how . eager women were to read and learn. The rest of Mrs Curtis' story reads like a publishing world fairytale, as it quickly evolved into a model for mass-circulation magazines. Women's Journal was the first magazine to reach one million . subscribers, back in 1903, and their covers, in their own words, have provided . 'a panoramic picture of life in the United States' since the day the magazine . launched. Pensive: Somewhat amusingly, this 1922 cover, which features a boy studying with the cover story entitled 'Beginning Foursquare' Seasons change: This beautiful cover, dating to 1919, advertised for 15 cents, celebrates Fall with a unique, autumnal illustration . Festive: Released in 1926 for ten cents, this cover, featuring an angelic young blonde bundled up for the cold, lists a feature entitled 'A Great Series on the Holy Land' Winding back the hands of time, there exists a large catalog of vintage covers from over the years, including in 1901 illustration of a woman playing golf in a cape and hat, and a 1929 illustration of a young man proposing to his future bride. Going to show that the business of love and marriage is an ever-enduring focus for women's magazines, an illustration for the 1912 edition shows a women, not a maid, in an elaborate wedding gown, tended to by her maid. A 1952 photo spread shows a mother lovingly stitching the hem of her daughter's wedding dress. For one of America's landmark publications, and for its over three million readers, today truly marks the end an era.","The magazine is 'transitioning to a special interest publication' which will publish less frequently .

"New York Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda has been suspended for 10 games after being caught using pine tar to help him grip the ball. The commissioner's office announced the penalty. The ban was to start for Thursday night's game in Boston unless Pineda appealed. There was no immediate word on whether Pineda would challenge the suspension. Suspicious substance: Michael Pineda was ejected from the game after umpires found a foreign substance on his neck . Pineda was . ejected in the second inning of Wednesday night's 5-1 loss at Fenway . Park after umpires found the pine tar on his neck. After the game, Pineda admitted he had used the pine tar to help him hold the ball on a cool, windy night. 'I'll learn from this mistake,' he said. 'It won't happen again.' Pine . tar is a sticky substance that baseball players will often put on the . handles of their bats to improve grip. Pitchers will use it for the same . reason, particularly in cold weather. However, MLB rules say that a . pitcher can't put any foreign substance on the ball because it can . potentially make the ball move more when a pitcher throws a curve ball. So pitchers will often try and hide it. If they get caught, they are . typically thrown out of the game - and that's exactly what happened to . Pineda. Scroll down for video . Busted: The substance was clearly visible on the pitcher's neck . The . right-hander was thrown out in the second inning when plate umpire . Gerry Davis found the substance on the right side of Pineda's neck after . Red Sox manager John Farrell asked him to check. Pineda walked from the . mound without protest. Both Pineda and Davis said it was pine tar. 'When . it's that obvious, something has got to be said,' Farrell explained . after the game. 'Our awareness was heightened, given what we had seen in . the past.' The ejection also set off a debate in the baseball world about pitchers who use pine tar, and whether it should be allowed in certain circumstances. Many former aces said they had done it, albeit in a more discreet manner. Rule 8.02(b) prohibits pitchers from altering the ball to gain an unfair advantage, and forbids them from having a foreign substance on them or in their possession on the mound. Pineda wasn't seen with the pine tar in the first inning, when the Red Sox roughed him up. Boston manager John Farrell asked plate umpire Gerry Davis to check Pineda after two fast outs the next inning. Got ya: Umpire Gerry Davis determined that the substance on Pineda's neck was pine tar, which is against the rules for pitchers . Earlier . this month, Pineda pitched well against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Television cameras showed a substance on his hand during that outing â€” Pineda said it was dirt, not pine tar. Among . other suspensions of pitchers for pine tar in the past decade, Tampa . Bay's Joel Peralta was penalized eight games in 2012, the Angels' Brendan Donnelly 10 days in 2005 and St. Louis' Julian Tavarez 10 days . in 2004. The suspensions of Donnelly and Tavarez were cut to eight days . after they asked the players' association to appeal, and Peralta dropped . his challenge with no reduction. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Pineda and the organization were 'embarrassed.' Yankees manager Joe Girardi called it 'an error in judgment' and a 'little bump' and 'poor judgment.' 'He had a hard time gripping the baseball. Unknown to us, he put it on and went out there,' Girardi said. 'It's a young kid. I don't think he's trying to do anything, cheat. I think he's just trying to go out there and compete.' Obvious: Boston manager John Farrell said that when it's as obvious as it was on Pineda, he has to alert the umpires . In Pineda's previous start against the Red Sox, a 4-1 Yankees win in New York on April 10, television cameras caught Pineda with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night. Farrell didn't see a photograph of Pineda's hand until the fourth inning; when Pineda came out to warm up for the fifth, his hand was clean. Pineda said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights. On Wednesday, with the game time temperature at 50 degrees, Sizemore started the first with a triple and scored on Dustin Pedroia's single. With one out, Mike Napoli singled Pedroia to third. After Mike Carp flied to left, A.J. Pierzynski singled up the middle, scoring Pedroia. After Pineda's ejection, David Phelps came in and completed the strikeout of Sizemore. Trend: A similar brown, sticky substance was seen on Pineda's hand in another game against Boston on April 10 . John Lackey (3-2) allowed one run and seven hits in eight innings with 11 strikeouts and no walks. Koji Uehara struck out three in the ninth in a non-save situation. The previous time Lackey faced the Yankees he allowed four homers in a 7-2 loss on April 12. On Wednesday, he struck out the side in the third then had two strikeouts in each of the next two innings. Mike Napoli had three hits and Boston scored two runs in the first and two more in the third. The Yankees scored on Alfonso Soriano's sacrifice fly in the sixth.","Yankee pitcher Michael Pineda has been suspended for 10 games .

"By . John Hall . Internet service providers will be able to offer websites preferential treatment in exchange for money if new plans to restructure the rules governing net neutrality are enforced, it has been claimed. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is set to propose new rules that would allow companies to pay a premium for faster internet services to make them more attractive to consumers. The move would be seen as controversial as net neutrality rules are considered vital for users to freely select the websites they want to visit without companies steering them towards those which have paid extra money for business, political or other reasons. Premium: One potential issue could occur if bandwidth-heavy websites such as Netflix and Skype (pictured) are forced to pay extra to guarantee a smoother delivery - the cost of which could be transferred to consumers . The FCC's plans would grant internet service providers the power to decide which websites will be able to run at full efficiency and, perhaps more importantly, which will be restricted, according to the Wall Street Journal, which claims to have seen an early draft of the new regulations. One concern is that this power could easily be abused, with certain websites being given the fastest services while their competitors face limits and restrictions, making them less attractive to consumers. This theoretical abuse of power could, of course, be used for political as well as economic reasons. Another potential issue could occur if bandwidth-heavy websites such as Netflix and Skype are forced to pay extra to guarantee a smoother delivery - the cost of which could be transferred to consumers. The FCC's chairman Tom Wheeler is scheduled to present proposals for a change to net neutrality rules to members of the commission later today. The new rules are meant to replace the FCC's open internet order from 2010, which was struck down by a federal appeals court in January. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed that the FCC had the authority to create open-access rules but said it failed to establish that its 2010 regulations didn't overreach. Better service: The U.S. Federal Communications Commission is set to propose new rules that would allow companies to pay a premium for faster internet services to make them more attractive to consumers . While the older rules technically allowed for paid priority treatment, it was discouraged. The new rules are expected to spell out standards that such deals would have to meet to be considered 'commercially reasonable' and will be designed to survive a court challenge in the future. Under the proposed rules, if such a deal for priority access were challenged, the commission would look at its impact on competition, on consumers, on free speech and civic engagement, and whether a broadband provider was acting in good faith. The commission will also ask for comment on how to make such dealings more transparent, but didn't have a recommendation on the matter. The proposed changes would also restore a previous rule that prohibits internet service providers blocking access to websites, which could help start ups foster the growth of the internet economy. Part of changes would require the FCC to establish a minimum standard of service - soemthing it says it will ask the public to help with. Although the FCC says it is not currently seeking to treat internet providers as 'common carriers' such as telephone companies - which would subject companies like Comcast and Verizon to even stricter rules - it is keeping the option on the table. The draft rules kick off a policymaking process that involves commissioner votes and a public comment period before a final vote sometime this summer.","FCC may change rules to allow internet service providers to charge extra .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A couple in Boston are celebrating the arrival of their baby girl, who weighed more than 14lb when she was delivered on Tuesday. Caroline Ruscak and her husband Bryan knew their baby was going to be large, but neither they, or their doctors, were expecting baby Carisa to be quite so big. Her size brought gasps from the staff in the operating room of Massachusetts General Hospital, who say she is the biggest baby to be born at the hospital in a decade. Big and beautiful: Caroline and Bryan Ruscak with their baby Carisa, who was the size of a six-month-old when she was born . Record-breaker: Carisa is the biggest baby to born in Boston for a decade . 'Everyone in the operating room was like, ""Oh my God, look at the size of this baby! Letâ€™s get her on the scale. What does she weigh?"" Nobody could believe it,' Mrs Ruscak said. At 14lb 5oz, Carisa Ruscak is the biggest baby born at Massachusetts General Hospital in a decade, and second heaviest ever born there. The record holder for the Boston hospital is a baby born In 2002, who weighed 14lb 80z. The biggest surviving baby born in the U.S. is Sammisano Otuhiva, who weighed 16lb 1.8oz when he was born in California in August 2013. The heaviest infant ever born in the U.S. was a 23lb 12oz newborn delivered in Ohio in 1877. Sadly the baby boy, who was 30in long, lived for only 11 hours. The record for the heaviest, healthy baby in the world was a boy born in Italy in 1955, who weighed 22lb 8oz. By contrast, the lightest baby is Rumaisa Rahman, who weighed only 9.17oz when she was born in Illinois in September 2004. She is now a happy and healthy nine-year-old. At 22in long and weighing in at 14lb 5oz, Carisa is about the size of six-month-old. She was just a few ounces lighter that a super-size baby born at the hospital in 2002. 'We're bigger people in general. It just makes sense,' Mrs Ruscak told CBS Boston. When Mrs Ruscak had a check up three weeks before her scheduled cesarean-section she was told her second child would be about 11lb 5oz. The couple's two-year-old daughter, Claudia, had weighed 10lb 10oz so the parents weren't surprised, although Mrs Ruscak said she had been far more uncomfortable with the pregnancy. 'It validated me because I was in a lot of pain when I was pregnant, so to hear the size, it made sense,' the new mom said. She added . that in the final month of her pregnancy she had got fed up with people . stopping her in the street to ask if she was carrying twins. Dr . Jennifer Kickham, who helped with the delivery, said: 'We were expecting . a big baby, but we weren't expecting one quite that big.' Surprised: Dr Kickham, pictured with Caroline and Bryan Ruscak, says they didn't expect Carisa, center, to be quite as large as she was . 'The baby came out screaming and crying and it was a beautiful delivery,' she said, adding that neither mom or baby had diabetes. Mr Ruscak told WCVB: 'When she came out at 14 and a half pounds, I couldn't believe it. I took a picture of the scale just to document it because I couldn't believe how big she was.' Carisa may be nearly twice the average 7.5lb weight of a newborn, but she is happy and healthy and due to go home with her parents on Friday.","Caroline Ruscak's daughter is nearly twice the weight of an average baby .

"By . David Mccormack . Quarterback Russell Wilson who starred in the Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl win in February is divorcing his wife after just two years of marriage. Wilson, 25, met Aston Meen in high school in Richmond, Virginia, and she twice transferred university to be with him during his college career. Wilson made the announcement in a statement released by the Seahawks on Wednesday. ‘Clearly, decisions like these don’t come easy,’ he said. ‘Ashton and I respectfully ask for prayers, understanding and privacy during this difficult time.’ Quarterback Russell Wilson who starred in the Seattle Seahawks' Super Bowl win in February is divorcing his wife, Aston Meen, after just two years of marriage . Wilson, 25, met Aston Meen in high school in Richmond, Virginia, and she twice transferred university to be with him during his college career . The young Super Bowl-winning quarterback also noted that he would not be commenting further on the situation. The couple had been together since high school. Meem originally attended the University of Georgia, but then transferred to North Carolina State, where Wilson was playing at the time. When Wilson transferred to the University of Wisconsin, Meem moved with him. They married in April 2012 after he finished his college career and before he was drafted by the Seahawks. The couple had been visible at Seahawks events for his first two seasons in the league. Wilson led Seattle to a dominating 43-8 victory over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII and is now predicted to become a $100 million brand . The young Super Bowl-winning quarterback has said that he will not be commenting further on his divorce . Meem infamously got a brief taste of the national spotlight during the 2012 NFL draft when her enthusiastic reaction to the news that the Seahawks had drafted Wilson went viral. In a November interview with King 5 in Seattle, she described what was going through her mind at that moment. ‘The thing of it was, we had a camera crew in [Wilson’s house] all day with us, and I guess I was a little bit newer to that style of filming,’ Meem said. ‘So I thought they were gonna be like, “okay, ready, and you’re on.” They just kept flashing back and forth to us, and I was like, I’m gonna just enjoy this and be myself.

"By . Helen Pow . An Iowa couple are in shock after a four-month-old boy they adopted died, allegedly in the care of his 'neglectful' teen father, just a month after they were forced to give him back to his biological parents. Rachel and Heidi McFarland of Ankeny cared for little Gabriel from birth until the middle of March, when his mother, Markeya Atkins, 16, took him back. But on Wednesday the couple learned, while watching the evening news, that the infant they considered their own had tragically died. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Rachel and Heidi McFarland, pictured, of Ankeny cared for little Gabriel from birth until the middle of March, and are traumatized by his death . 'It's like he's been taken away from you again,' Rachel McFarland told the Des Moines Register. Police have charged Drew James Weehler-Smith of Des Moines with neglect of a dependent person after he left his son alone in an apartment on Tuesday. The baby was found unresponsive by his mother, who had been out running errands, at around 8:20p.m., with a bottle by his side and a white substance around his mouth. Atkins is heartbroken over the death of her son, a picture of whom she's put as her Facebook cover photo. But the McFarlands, who have been married five years and together 18, are also devastated. They had supported the mother financially through her pregnancy and had been with her at every doctor's appointment. The couple said they repeatedly asked Atkins if she wanted to go ahead with the adoption and she said 'yes.' 'We brought him home from the hospital,' Rachel McFarland told the Register. 'I cut his umbilical cord.' She . said from that moment on she spent every waking moment with the baby . until his birth mother reneged on the adoption that was agreed last . September. Heidi even took maternity leave from work. Teen mom: Gabriel's mother, Markeya Atkins, 16, pictured left took him back on March 13. She is no doubt also devastated by his death . Scene: According to police, the young mom left the baby with Weehler-Smith in an apartment, pictured, in the 6500 block of Chaffee Road at about 7:25p.m. while she went to the library and to run errands . 'It just felt natural. When he was with us it just felt right. Like we were always meant to be moms,' Rachel told WHOTV.com. But, in Iowa, the birth mother has three months and then one additional 31-day probationary period to change her mind about giving up her baby. 'We had to go through our worst possible day with our attorney,' Rachel said, referring to when Gabriel was taken from them. 'And then we found out on the news today. ...Nobody called or told me.' According to police, the young mom left the baby with Weehler-Smith in an apartment in the 6500 block of Chaffee Road at about 7:25p.m. while she went to the library and to run errands. About 25 . minutes later, a friend dropped into the apartment to collect a phone . charger and saw the father holding the child. She left and called the . mother asking whether she trusted Weehler-Smith with the infant. The .

"By . Tara Brady . A survey has ranked cabin staff in the U.S. on how rude they are and unfortunately it is bad news for budget flyers. More than a quarter of 3,400 frequent passengers polled found the carrier Spirit as having the rudest flight attendants. Surprisingly, Air Canada came in second with 14 per cent of the vote. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . More than a quarter of 3,400 frequent fliers polled found the carrier Spirit as having the rudest . flight attendants . Southwest however got just one per cent of the vote. The survey was carried out by Airfarewatchdog and was based on the number of passengers who had flown between January and October 2013. George Hobica, founder and president of Airfarewatchdog, said: 'There's very little that's surprising here, with Spirit leading the list and Southwest at the bottom. • Spirit — 26% . • Air Canada — 14% . • Frontier — 11% . • Virgin America — 9% . • Allegiant — 8% . • United — 7% . • US Airways — 7% . • American — 5% . • AirTran — 3% . • Delta — 2% . • Hawaiian — 3% . • JetBlue — 3% . • Alaska — 1% . • Southwest — 1% .

'So maybe there's something going on there.' In less than two weeks, a video featuring Southwest Airlines flight attendant Marty Cobb’s hilarious rendition of the pre-flight safety speech has racked up more than 11 million hits on YouTube. 'Position your seatbelt tight, low and across your hips, like my grandmother wears her support bra,' she said as passengers began realising they weren't hearing the standard information. She added that if they landed near a hot tub 'everybody gets their very own teeny weeny yellow Southwest bikini' - as other staff held up life jackets. Despite her gags, she still managed to provide passengers all necessary safety information, and no one was left complaining. 'That's what we call very cheap entertainment,' she said as she finished the routine. 'Nobody had to pay extra but you certainly don't get a refund!' Marty Cobb's gags had passengers roaring with laughter and got her a round of applause at the end . Viewers applauded her light take on the often stale announcement. 'No one ever pays attention to the safety precautions, let alone claps at the end,' one YouTube user said. 'It was actually worth paying attention to. This was awesome!'

"By . Ashley Collman . A discharged Marine who strung himself from a ten-foot cross during Denver's 4/20 celebration on Sunday now regrets the protest which has been branded by many as sacriligious. Former recruiter Joshua Klohr was kicked out of the Corps last year after complaining about the job to superiors. Klohr was subsequently court-martialled and found guilty of insubordinate conduct, disobeying a superior officer and failure to obey an order. On Sunday, he sought to draw attention to his plight so he strung himself up on the cross across from the Colorado state capital building while the rest of the city celebrated it's first legal marijuana holiday. Making a statement: Ex-Marine Joshua Klohr hung himself from a ten-foot cross across from Denver's state capitol on Sunday while the rest of the city was celebrating the first legal marijuana holiday . But when pictures of the exhibition started popping up online, the reaction was mostly unsympathetic. 'I feel like the imagery of Christ and his point (what I've gathered anyway) are two very unrelated things,' Maximilian Uriarte wrote on his web page. Kicked out: Klohr was hoping the demonstration would draw attention to his discharge, which he believes was unjust . Even as an art piece, Christ implies martyrdom, he's just using it as ""shock value."" He's not a martyr, he's just a dude that got a court martial and f***** over.' In an interview with the Marine Corps Times on Monday, Klohr quickly apologized for the display, saying he now regrets his actions. 'I donâ€™t want people to talk me up on websites as this disrespectful person,' he said. 'I wasnâ€™t trying to be disrespectful or anything ... To get people to see how serious I am I had to do something extreme.' He added that the demonstration was not intended to be sacriligious or insulting and that his ultimate goal is to secure a presidential pardon and shed light on practices in Marine Corps recruiting. Klohr's troubles started last year when he was working as a Marine recruiter in Boulder and having a hard time making goals, despite working 14-16 hour days. He says he refused to 'fraud' enlistees by ignoring certain factors that would make them inelligble for service. When he told his superiors that he could not do what was required of him in the job, they interpretted it as him quitting and he was sent to a court-martial trial. Klohr alleges that he wasn't allowed to testify in his defense and he was subsequently found guilty of insubordinate conduct, disobeying a superior officer and failure to obey an order. He was demoted to private, sentenced to one month in the brig and discharged. However, Klohr admits that he himself hid information that would have kept him from service. He says he was expelled from school, had asthama and even a criminal record. While he says he refused to 'fraud' enlistees by ignoring things that would disqualify them from service, Klohr admits he too hid information to get into the corps - including setting a cat on fire in 2005. Pictured above in a photo posted on his Facebook . In 2005, when he was 18, Kohlr was charged for setting a cat on fire and throwing the animal off a roof.

"By . Associated Press . and Meghan Keneally . Michelle Obama has rescheduled a high school graduation speech after the students complained that her appearance would prevent many of their friends and relatives from attending the ceremony. The First Lady was scheduled to speak at a combined graduation ceremony for five high schools in Topeka, Kansas, on May 17 but will now be speaking at a different 'senior recognition day' ceremony the day before. 'Once we learned about the concerns of some students, we were eager to find a solution that enabled all of the students and their families to celebrate the special day,' said the First Lady's communications director, Maria Cristina Gonzalez Noguera. Turbulent talk: Michelle Obama (pictured at the White House today) is now going to speak at a special 'senior appreciation day' event held the day before the formal graduation ceremony in order to avoid any seating problems for relatives of the graduates . Eighteen-year-old Taylor Gifford had launched an online petition urging the school district to reconsider its plans. Gifford and the more than 1,200 people who had signed it expressed concern that Mrs. Obama's visit would limit guest seating. Mrs Obama had accepted the district's invitation to speak May 17 at the combined ceremony to mark that day's 60th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, outlawing school segregation. The case originated in Topeka. Under a new plan worked out by the district, the first lady will speak at the same 8,000-seat arena where the combined ceremony was to be held. The combined ceremony is being scrapped and the five schools will hold separate graduation exercises instead. Since Mrs. Obama will no longer speak at a graduation, seating would not need to be limited due to concerns over her security. Symbolic: District leaders asked Mrs Obama to speak in Topeka, Kansas because it coincides with the 60th anniversary of the landmark school integration case, Brown vs. Board of Education . The pushback from Mrs Obama's graduation speech was not limited to students since parents also feared that her participation would overshadow the students' big day. 'I'm a single mother who has raised him for 18 years by myself,' said Tina Hernandez, parent of Topeka High School senior Dauby Knight. 'I've told him education is the only way out. This is one of the biggest days of their lives. They've taken the glory and shine from the children and put on Mrs. Obama. She doesn't know our kids.' Hernandez was among the parents and students who spoke at a school board meeting last week and urged district officials to reconsider their decision to invite Obama. A high school senior started a petition  against Michelle Obama speaking at Topeka High School's graduation and it ended up garnering more than 1,200 signatures . Ron Harbaugh, spokesman for the Topeka school district, said Friday discussions were under way to work out the logistics and planning for the event, including how many tickets each family would be allotted. Gifford, the student who started the petition, said her initial reaction to the news was excitement, saying she was 'freaking out' about the prospect of the first lady speaking at graduation. When rumors of limited tickets surfaced, Gifford felt like the focus was being shifted from the students to Obama. 'People think it's a great opportunity, but it's the graduates' time. They are getting that diploma that they worked so hard for,' Gifford said. 'Families are feeling that they are being cheated out of the loved ones special day.'","Students and parents complained that Mrs Obama's speech in Kansas would lead to less seating for the friends and relatives of the graduates .

Principal Roy Van Meter said at the time handbags were being outlawed after students were caught texting inside them or bringing 'inappropriate' items to class. 'Things like people texting in purses, in class or inappropriate items coming into class; and so it wasn't a single incident, it wasn't even two or three, it was a combination of all those,' he said on October 18 explaining the ban.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . An American property developer is suing a British wine merchant for $25million (£15million) after allegedly being sold a 'fake' bottle of the world's most expensive white wine. Julian LeCraw Junior, from Atlanta, forked out a staggering $100,000 (£55,000) for the 219-year-old bottle of Château d'Yquem in 2006. At the time, the precious wine was reportedly flown by private jet across the Atlantic by the London-based Antique Wine Company (AWC). Case: Julian LeCraw Junior is suing the Antique Wine Company in London for $25million after allegedly being sold a 'fake' bottle of Château d'Yquem. Above, AWC founder, Stephen Williams, poses with the bottle in 2006 . Prestigious: Mr LeCraw, from Atlanta, forked out a staggering $92,000 (£55,000) for the 219-year-old bottle of Château d'Yquem in 2006. Above, Chateau d'Yquem, which sits atop a hill near Bordeaux's Sauternes region . But eight years on, Mr LeCraw has filed a lawsuit against the firm, alleging that the wine - as well as more than a dozen other bottles - are fake. The millionaire claims the firm sold him 15 counterfeit wines in total, including two bottles of d'Yquem, 12 of Château Lafite Rothschild and a six-litre bottle of 1908 Château Margaux. However, the AWC's founder and chief executive, Stephen Williams, strongly denies allegations - and says the company will 'vigorously defend' the case. Sought-after: Chateau d'Yquem is the most prestigious Sauternes dessert wine (file picture) Mr LeCraw discovered the alleged fakery after commissioning an American wine expert to taste the fine wines, according to legal documents seen by The Independent. He claims the expert uncovered evidence that the bottles were fake, including computer-printed wine labels and inaccurate corks and bottle shapes. Their 'fake' status was then confirmed by experts at d'Yquem and Lafite Rothschild - with one declaring them 'faux, faux, faux', alleges the complaint. The sale of the 1787 bottle of d'Yquem to Mr LeCraw in February 2006 was hailed as the highest price ever paid for a bottle of white wine. As the most prestigious Sauternes dessert . wine, its high levels of residual sugar, combined with the grapes’ natural acidity, serve as preservative agents which protect it from spoilage. There are only a few wines in the world that have these unique properties - and if stored properly, d’Yquem can age for indefinite periods. Chateau d’Yquem itself is one of the most esteemed and highly sought after Chateaux in the world, and sits atop a hill in Bordeaux's Gironde region. At the time of the sale, Mr Williams, who reportedly delivered the bottle in person by private jet, was quoted as saying: 'It might be the most expensive and pampered travelling companion I have ever had, but at £10,000 a glass, I have to be sure that our client is left with a sweet taste in his mouth.' However, the white wine was later overtaken as the most valuable in the world by an 1811 bottle of d'Yquem, which was sold for $125,000 (£75,000) to wine connoisseur Christian Vanneque in July 2011. Allegations: The millionaire claims the AWC sold him 15 counterfeit wines in total, including two bottles of d'Yquem, 12 of Château Lafite Rothschild (left) and a six-litre bottle of 1908 Château Margaux (right) Mr Vanneque purchased the rare bottle for his establishment, SIP Sunset Grill in Bali, Indonesia, where it went on display in September that year. Founded in 1982, the AWC specialises in exceptionally fine and rare wines - with more than 20,000 clients in 70 countries. In a statement, the firm told MailOnline . it had provided evidence of authenticity - and rejected claims that Mr . Williams had flown the bottle of wine to Atlanta by private jet. It said: 'The Antique Wine Company strongly denies all the allegations made against it.

"By . Meghan Keneally . Caroline Kennedy has said that she will 'absolutely' endorse Hillary Clinton 'if she runs' for president in 2016. The two women from similarly powerful Democratic clans have had a turbulent history in the past, but in a new interview, the American Ambassador to Japan gave a measured hint of an endorsement. 'I know it sounds like a cliché, but two years is a really long time in politics. I’m sure she’s looking forward to being a grandmother, I know she’s got to decide soon. So, so you know I hope so,' Kennedy said in an interview with ABC. Serious support: Caroline Kennedy and Hillary Clinton, seen here in 2000 when Clinton was running for Senate, have been allies for years making it even more of a shock when Kennedy opted to support Obama over Clinton in 2008 . Payback: President Obama appointed Caroline Kennedy (seen together in Japan on Thursday) as the new American ambassador to Japan in a move that many saw as a 'thank you' for her critical support in his 2008 race against Hillary Clinton . Kennedy's endorsement can be a powerful thing, and though it was assumed that she would lend her name to her longtime ally Clinton during the 2008 presidential race, she actually turned the tide by coming out in support of Barack Obama in January of that year. Many considered Caroline's endorsement, as well as that of her now-deceased uncle Senator Ted Kennedy, of Obama as the point in which the Democratic base began to switch over from the former First Lady's camp to that of the one-term Senator from Illinois. The drama between Clinton and Kennedy was not fully put to bed until nearly a year later, after Obama was elected and he had selected Clinton as his Secretary of State. Kennedy expressed an interest in being nominated to take over for Clinton, who was one of the New York Senators at the time. Keeping her options open: Kennedy said that she would 'absolutely' support Clinton (seen on Wednesday at a talk in Connecticut) in a 2016 race but echoed Clinton's own assertions that she has not yet made up her mind . Clinton's loyal band of supporters promptly attacked Kennedy, calling her out for barely donating to political causes and in some cases 'forgetting' to even vote. Clinton was the one to call off the attack dogs, and The Daily News reported at the time that she made sure that 'supporters who said anything critical were rebuked'. The wording of Kennedy’s ‘endorsement’ of Clinton shows some degree of hesitation. It may well be because Clinton has clearly not made a formal announcement of her intentions of running in 2016- even though polls have her leaps and bounds ahead of any other Democratic candidate, including Vice President Joe Biden. Another more long-shot theory, proposed by The Washington Post shortly after Kennedy was named as the new Ambassador to Japan, is that Kennedy herself plans to run for the White House in 2016 and fulfil her family destiny by taking over where her father’s legacy was cut short. Picking sides: The Democratic primary race effectively switched from having Hillary Clinton in the lead to then-one-term Senator Barack Obama once Kennedy chose him over her . ‘Could Hillary Clinton be shoved from the limelight twice by Caroline Kennedy? While that might sound premature, Kennedy delivered the argument for charisma and vision over experience when she and her uncle dealt Clinton the first of many blows in the 2008 campaign,’ reporter Jennifer Rubin wrote in The Washington Post. In her initial op-ed of support of Obama in 2008, Kennedy said that he would be 'a President like my father' and noted the importance of persona and personality. 'It isn’t that the other candidates are not experienced or knowledgeable. But this year, that may not be enough,' she said in a 2008 editorial in The New York Times. Party over person: The Kennedys and Clintons are arguably the two most powerful Democratic families in American politics (Caroline, her husband Ed Schlossberg and her uncle Ted Kennedy seen greeting the then-President and First Lady in 1997) ‘Sometimes it takes a while to recognize that someone has a special ability to get us to believe in ourselves, to tie that belief to our highest ideals and imagine that together we can do great things. In those rare moments, when such a person comes along, we need to put aside our plans and reach for what we know is possible.’ During the interview that was released Thursday, which coincided with the President's visit to Japan, Kennedy made it clear that she thinks he has held up his end of the bargain- even if many other Democrats are trying to distance themselves due to his low poll numbers. 'I think he’s been a great president. And I think that this rebalanced Asia is a really good example of somebody who’s taking the long view, advancing the United States interest,' she said to ABC.","Caroline Kennedy has said she will support Clinton even though she opted for her rival- then-Senator Barack Obama- in the 2008 presidential race .

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . A company that manufactures baby video monitors is recalling almost one million batteries after complaints that they overheated, ruining the monitors and causing damage to property. Summer Infant is recalling about 800,000 rechargeable batteries used in its baby video monitors because of a burn hazard. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based manufacturer has received 22 reports of overheated and ruptured batteries, including incidents of smoke and minor property damage. Total recall: Batteries from Summer Infant devices sold between 2010 and 2012 have been recalled . The hand-held, color video monitors were sold with a matching camera and A/C adaptors at Babies ""R'' Us, online and other retailers from about February 2010 through 2012 for $149 to $349. The batteries are about 1 ½ inches tall by 2 ¼ inches wide and are ¼ inch thick, black, and marked with TCL on the batteries' lower right corner. Consumers should remove the battery and contact Summer Infant for a replacement. The monitor can continue to be used with a power cord. 'The safety of our consumers is our highest priority. Therefore, out of an abundance of caution and in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, we have issued a voluntary battery recall in monitors that may have batteries manufactured in 2010, 2011 and 2012,' the company wrote on its Facebook page. Many consumers responded to the recall on Facebook, saying their monitors had burned out but the company had told them earlier that there was no recourse. Second time: Batteries from Summer Infant devices were recalled in 2011 for the same reason . 'I got a monitor in Oct. 2011, 6 months later the battery never kept a charge and had to keep in plugged in when I was using it!! I called and they said there is nothing they can do! I was not happy!! So finally I came up with the money jan 2014 for a new one! [sic]' wrote one. The recall comes after viewer Molly Sandlin contacted FOX 4 when her baby monitor burst into flames on her kitchen counter, filling the house with smoke and melting the monitor. A forensic report commissioned by the family's insurance company concluded the battery inside the unit had overheated, swelled and started a fire, but after a year of trying to recoup thousands of dollars from Summer Infant for the damage, the family became frustrated. Summer Infant told FOX 4 that the overheating incidents were isolated, but in light of further reports has issued the recall order. Consumers can contact Summer Infant for a replacement battery at 800-426-8627 or online at Summer Infant. The batteries were manufactured in China. About 58,800 batteries were recalled in February 2011 for the same problem.","Summer Infant has recalled batteries in baby video monitors sold between 2010 and 2012 .

"By . Associated Press . A New York man has been sentenced to spend up to seven years in prison for faking his own drowning in an insurance fraud scheme and other crimes. Raymond Roth of Massapequa, Long Island, was sentenced to between two years and seven years in prison in Nassau County Court. He admitted to faking his own drowning at Jones Beach in the summer of 2012. Going behind bars: Raymond Roth (pictured in August 2012 after his arrest) will spend between two-years-and-four months and seven years in jail due to his attempt to fake his own death for a life insurance payout . He was later convicted on unrelated charges of posing as a police officer and trying to accost a woman on a Freeport street. Thursday's sentencing covers both crimes. Roth's son, Jonathan Roth, is serving a year in the county jail for helping his father with the drowning scheme . Roth's son, Jonathan Roth, is serving a year in the county jail for helping his father with the drowning scheme. Roth also must pay $36,555.37 in restitution to cover the costs emergency workers incurred in searching for him in the drowning scam. Police marine units, helicopters and officers searched for Raymond Roth for days with no results. A relative later reported he was in Florida. The sentencing comes a month after he was found Roth not guilty of attempted kidnapping and attempted coercion. Defense attorney Brian Davis had argued that Roth thought the woman he confronted was a prostitute but conceded that Roth was guilty of claiming to be a police officer when he tried to force her into his van. He described Roth's actions as ""a lot of big-mouth bravado from somebody who really wasn't in control of all his faculties."" Davis said Roth has a variety of problems. 'It's part mental issues and also part substance abuse,' he said. 'He cannot drink alcohol. He cannot take illicit substances. And if he's going to drink, he's going to continue to get into trouble.' Roth had been looking at a 90-day jail sentence in the insurance fraud case, but that deal was negated following his arrest on the other charges. Roth also pleaded guilty to violating an order of protection obtained by his estranged wife. She notified authorities that Roth may have faked his drowning after discovering emails written between Roth and his son plotting the ruse. Police marine units, helicopters and officers searched for Raymond Roth for days with no results. A relative later reported he was in Florida .","Raymond Roth admitted to pretending to drown in an elaborate 2012 scheme to collect his life insurance payout .

"By . Emma Innes . Moderate wine consumption can prevent the development of kidney disease . Many people feel a little guilty as they sip their wine of an evening. But now, new research suggests the odd glass could actually be good for the health. Moderate wine consumption could help keep the kidneys healthy and may protect the hearts of people who already have kidney disease. Researchers at the University of Colorado-Denver found that people who drink less than one glass of wine a day have a 37 per cent lower prevalence of chronic kidney disease than those who drink no wine at all. And, people who have chronic kidney disease are 29 per cent less likely to also have heart disease if they drink a small amount of wine. The researchers, led by Dr Tapan Mehta, used 2003 to 2006 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey on 5,852 individuals, 1,031 of whom had chronic kidney disease. Thomas Manley, director of scientific activities at the National Kidney Foundation, said: ‘Similar to previous studies showing that moderate wine consumption appears to impart some health benefit by lowering the risk of heart disease and diabetes, this study suggests an association between moderate wine consumption (less than one glass per day) and lower rates of chronic kidney disease.’ Moderation is the key for kidney patients when it comes to alcohol consumption, with a few caveats, he added. ‘Excess alcohol consumption has definitely been shown to have negative effects on kidney function. ‘Alcohol can also worsen hypertension, a major cause of chronic kidney disease, so those with poorly controlled hypertension should definitely limit the amount of alcohol they consume. ‘It's also important to consider the nutritional contents of the various alcoholic drinks to be sure they comply with the prescribed renal diet.’ In people with chronic kidney disease, moderate wine consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease . The researchers are not sure exactly why wine is linked to good kidney health. Dr Mehta says it could be because moderate drinking is linked to lower levels of protein in the urine and that those with kidney problems tend to have higher urine protein levels. And while he cannot be sure, Dr Mehta says it is possible red wine is more protective against heart and kidney problems than white wine is.","Moderate wine consumption can help keep the kidneys healthy .
It can reduce the risk of developing chronic kidney disease by 37% .
People with kidney disease are less likely to develop heart disease if they drink wine in moderation - less than one glass a day ."

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The Peach State is poised to become a petri-dish for the nation's most ambitious gun-rights experiment, following Gov. Nathan Deal's signing of a law that will permit concealed-carry permit holders to keep their weapons as they enter non-secure areas of airports, along with some churches and bars, and most government buildings. Lawmakers, which passed the bill by wide bipartisan margins in he waning hours of the year's legislative session, notably excluded the state capitol where they work from the list of places where pre-vetted Georgians can now pack heat without penalty. Reaction was swift and incendiary. Time magazine called the move 'radical.' Americans for Responsible Solutions, the anti-gun group founded by former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, said it's 'the most extreme gun bill in America.' Even the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police blasted it, with executive director Frank Rotondo saying officers 'do not want more people carrying guns on the street, particularly police officers in inner city areas.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Georgia Governor Nathan Deal signed House Bill 60 on Wednesday, expanding where people with licenses to carry can bring their guns in Georgia . Conservative's paradise: Georgia is among the U.S. states where gun control legislation has the toughest time advancing . And a . Georgia Democratic congressman told MailOnline that 'schools, churches, . public buildings, and airports' are among the 'places you shouldn't be . allowed to carry a gun.' 'We . need to have limits,' insisted Rep. Hank Johnson. 'I'm opposed to . indiscriminate, wild-wild-west laws that put no limits on people's right . to carry a firearm.' Democratic state Rep. Mickey Stephens told The New York Times that it 'makes us the laughingstock of the nation because it’s a silly bill.' 'I want to know what kind of religion these guys practice that they have to carry a gun to church.' But Republican state Rep. Rick Jasperse, who sponsored the bill, said Georgians should be allowed to carry guns in more places. 'When we limit a Georgian's ability to carry a weapon – to defend themselves – we're empowering the bad guys,' he said. Second Amendment Foundation founder Alan Gottlieb told MailOnline that the move will set the bar for other states. 'You will see other states start to adopt this concept and it will spread across America,' he predicted. And Cam Edwards, the affable Virginian who hosts a daily talk show for the National Rifle Association, said it was 'an historic legislative victory for gun owners and grassroots activists throughout the state of Georgia.' Edwards said pro-gun-rights forces were 'tireless in their efforts to strengthen and secure their right to keep and bear arms in the face of hyperbolic opposition.' GeorgiaCarry, a state-level organization that may reflect the mood of a quiet majority in the Deep South red state, said 'we got a great bill and this will clear the way for some great improvements in the future.' The organization was miffed about two sections of the bill that didn't survive the amendment process. One would have extended concealed-carry rights to college campuses. The other requires churches that want to welcome gun-carrying worshipers to 'opt-in'; the legislation originally required them to 'opt-out.' 'We keep . marching down the field,' the group said in a statement to its members, . 'and one day, we will get all our rights back. This is the way we lost . our rights (one step at a time) and this is the way we will get them . back. There is always next year.' Insiders at the state capitol told MailOnline that Everytown, the successor organization to Mayors Against Illegal Guns, worked behind the scenes to strip the 'Campus Carry' provision out. The group declined to comment to MailOnline on the record. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the world's busiest, and passengers now see a sign warning them not to bring guns into TSA-secured areas -- but other public sections of the facility will now be open to concealed-carry permit holders packing heat . Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson told MailOnline that letting permit holders carry guns into bars is a recipe for disaster: 'Instead of a fistfight you get a gun battle' Republican . Gov. Nathan Deal boasted during Wednesday's bill signing that the law . 'will protect the constitutional rights of Georgians who have gone . through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia Weapons Carry . License.' He said that 'roughly 500,000 Georgia citizens have a permit of this kind, which is approximately 5 percent of our population.' Critics online quickly dubbed it the 'guns everywhere' law. Rep. Johnson latched on to the idea of bars becoming shooting galleries for inebriated Georgians. He said he was outraged at Republicans' move to 'sanction people being able to carry guns into bars where, I think, studies will show you have a lot of fights and disputes that break out.' 'And there are women, and all sorts of things happening,' he added. 'You're increasing the odds of armed confrontation. Instead of a fistfight you get a gun battle. Here comes two drunk people with guns, and innocent citizens standing around? There's no collateral damage in a fistfight.' Johnson also pointed to legislation he sponsored in November, the Airport Security Act of 2013, which would 'prohibit people other than local law enforcement and Homeland Security employees from carrying guns – concealed or otherwise – in airport terminals, lobbies, baggage claim areas, ticket counters and outside in pick-up and drop-off areas.' The measure attracted only 14 co-sponsors, all fellow liberal Democrats. Bull's eye: Cam Edwards, host of 'Cam and Company' on NRA News, called the Georgia law a 'historic legislative victory' in the face of 'hyperbolic opposition' from gun-control forces . Shotgun weddings? Clergy in Georgia can now 'opt in,' telling congregants with permits that they can carry guns into places of worship . Piers Morgan, the former CNN talk show host whose show was canceled amid a ratings slide caused in part by his frequent anti-firearms sermonizing, vented at Twitter after the Georgia governor's Wednesday bill-signing. 'Beyond parody,' he tweeted. 'America's answer to Aurora/Newtown: GUNS EVERYWHERE.' Gov. Deal has emphasized that Georgia's sweeping concealed-carry laws apply only to citizens who submit themselves to screening that would otherwise be considered an unconstitutional intrusion. 'The important premise we all should remember is these are people who have their fingerprints taken, their backgrounds checked and they have been licensed to carry a weapon,' he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'It’s not just someone walking out of the clear blue with none of those background checks. They’ve been subjected to scrutiny of the state.' Deal is running for re-election in the fall, and hadn't said until late Tuesday whether he would sign the bill. The political calculation, though, was likely an easy one. The only Democrat prepared to face him in November, state Senator Jason Carter, voted for the law, the Times noted.","Georgia's governor signed a law allowing pre-screened permit holders to carry concealed guns in more places .
Bars, many churches, most government buildings and unsecured sections of airports are included .

"By . David Mccormack . A surfboard belonging to legendary Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson which featured on the covers of two of the iconic band’s early albums is set to be auctioned for $150,000. A classic piece of rock memorabilia, the blue and yellow fiberglass board was used for the cover of the Beach Boys' groundbreaking debut album, 1962's Surfin' Safari, and again in 1963 on the front of Surfer Girl. Legend has it that Wilson - the band's only real surfer - brought the nine foot board along to the band's first ever professional photo shoot held at Paradise Cove in Malibu, California, in 1962 shortly after they had signed with Capitol Records. Surfin' U.S.A. : Legend has it that Dennis Wilson, holding the board and the band's only real surfer, brought the nine foot board along to their first ever professional photo shoot held at Paradise Cove in Malibu, California, in 1962 shortly after they had signed with Capitol Records . The iconic blue and yellow fiberglass board was used for the cover of the Beach Boys' groundbreaking debut album, 1962's Surfin' Safari, and again in 1963 on the front of Surfer Girl . The five members - Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine - were snapped holding it while striking various poses on a beach. The photos, taken by Ken Veeder, went on to become some of the most iconic images of the band. Wilson gave the board to his close friend Louis Marotta in the 1970s who in turn passed it on to Beach Boys fan Bob Stafford in 1985. Stafford was a huge Beach Boys fan and named his son Brian after Brian Wilson. Bob Stafford is now selling the board after loaning to the year-long exhibition Good Vibrations: 50 Years Of The Beach Boys, which ran between September 2012 and September 2013. The then current Beach Boys line-up posed in front of the board during the exhibition at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. The board came from a Hermosa Beach, California surf shop called The Outrigger, as evidenced by the shop's logo decal visible at the rear of the board. The then current Beach Boys line-up posed in front of the board during the year-long Good Vibrations exhibition at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles that ran between September 2012 and September 2013 . Dennis Wilson spent many pre-Beach Boys days riding the waves on this board at crowded local beaches and saw first-hand how popular the sport of surfing had become. He later suggested to his big brother Brian that he write a song about the craze. The result was Surfin', which became their debut single. The surfboard, which has never been restored, is just over 9 feet long, 21 inches wide and approximately three inches thick, with a 12 inch tall fin, which is 12 inches wide at the base. It weighs approximately 25 pounds. These days the band is a shadow of its former self. Founding members Carl and Dennis Wilson are dead, and Brian Wilson, the . sole survivor of the three brothers, has been embroiled in a series of . divisive lawsuits with Love, another founder. This 1985 photo, right, was taken the day that Bob Stafford picked the board up at Louis Marotta's house. Louis is the bearded adult and Brian Stafford, then 14 and named after the legendary Brian Wilson, is standing beside him . The five members - Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine - were snapped holding the board while striking various poses on a Malibu beach . Brian Wilson suffered a prolonged mental collapse at the height of the band's glory years, but has re-emerged as a successful solo performer in the last 20 years, although he often appears fragile in public. ‘He wrote some of the best pop songs of all time,’ said Neil Warnock, chief executive of The Agency Group Worldwide, a leading concert organizer. ‘They were absolutely riveting two- and three-minute pop songs. The more serious stuff, Pet Sounds, resonates with every single generation as being a classic piece of music. He's written a canon of music that is absolutely essential. He just thinks in five-part harmony.’ None of that changes the fact that the board is undoubtedly one of the most incredible . pieces of Beach Boys memorabilia to ever hit the market, Rockaway .

"By . David Mccormack . George Stephanopoulos has signed a new long-term deal with ABC News that will see him continue as co-anchor of Good Morning America . Following the highly-publicized departures of his Good Morning America male co-stars, George Stephanopoulos has signed a new long-term deal with ABC News that will see him continue as co-anchor of the breakfast show and presenter of the Sunday public affairs show This Week. The recent defections of weather anchor Sam Champion and co-host Josh Elliot had made keeping Stephanopoulos at GMA a top priority for ABC News executives and they initiated early contract talks a couple of weeks ago. Those talks have been concluded very quickly and to the satisfaction of Stephanopoulos who ran Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign back in 1992. Details of his new deal haven’t been revealed reports The Hollywood Reporter, but Stephanopoulos was negotiated from a clear position of strength. Co-anchor . Robin Roberts signed a new long-term reportedly worth $14 million a . year last December, while Lara Spencer was recently promoted to co-host . in a $3 million a year deal. Josh Elliott's walk out to join NBC Sports earlier this month was after they wouldn’t agree to his salary demands. Stephanopoulos' new deal is expected to be comparable to Roberts. 'This represents what he wanted - he is committed to GMA and This Week, and understands the power of those platforms,' ABC News spokeswoman Heather Riley told the Daily News. The way they were: George Stephanopoulos is the last member of the GMA team pictured here to agree a new deal, while former male co-hosts Josh Elliott, top left, and Sam Champion, center, have departed . 'We are thrilled that the team is locked in and that the deal was done so quickly and with such goodwill from all sides.' The former White House Communications Director started working for ABC News as a political analyst after leaving the Clinton administration in 1996. In September 2002, he became host of This Week, and was officially named him Chief Washington Correspondent in 2005. The appointment of the political hard-hitter at GMA in late 2009 surprised many but has proven to be a big success. The show has overtaken major rival Today and has its largest audience in more than 22 years. New order: Michael Strahan, right, made his debut on GMA last week and joined Stephanopoulos, Robin Roberts, Lara Spencer, Ginger Zee and Amy Robach . Elliott's defection briefly left Stephanopoulos as the single male anchor on the program, until Michael Strahan made his debut last week. He has joined as a contributor and remains co-host of Live! with Kelly and Michael. ESPN's Tony Reali was also named a GMA contributor on April 10. Stephanopoulos is the last member of the GMA team to agree to a new deal. In recent months, the show replaced Champion, who joined The Weather Channel, with Ginger Zee and Elliott with Amy Robach who tweeted her congratulations on Thursday morning. A big congratulations to @GStephanopoulos - here's to many many years working with the best @GMA #team,' she tweeted. 'We are united as a team and over the past few months we have . not missed a beat - in fact our audience has only grown,' said Riley.

Former President of France Nicolas Sarkozy has come out along with actor Liam Neeson to support keeping New York City's famous horse-drawn carriages as Mayor Bill De Blasio seeks to ban the industry. Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni took their young daughter Giulia in one of the carriages for a ride through Central Park on Wednesday. When asked if he thinks the carriages should stay, Sarkozy offered up an enthusiastic 'yes', the New York Daily News reports. Family time: Former President of France Nicolas Sarkozy (left) took a ride in one of New York City's horse-drawn carriages Wednesday with wife Carla Bruni (middle) and their daughter Giulia (right) Making a stance: The Sarkozy family's Central Park ride comes at a politically tense moment for the carriage industry, since Mayor Bill De Blasio is trying to get them banned and replaced with vintage cars . Sarkozy's support: When asked Wednesday if he thinks the horse-drawn carriages should stay in New York City, Sarkozy said 'yes' The Sarkozys are in town to support singer-songwriter Bruni who is set to perform at The Town Hall Thursday night. At the end of the ride, Sarkozy chatted for a bit before whisking Giulia away for a shopping spree at FAO Schwartz. They were joined by more than 900 horse-lovers at the park yesterday where the Daily News was handing out 'Save Our Horses' buttons.

He was elected out of office in May 2012 . So far more than 20,000 have signed a petition launched by the newspaper, asking De Blasio not to ban the horses. Support: Actor Liam Neeson has said carriage horses should stay in the city . While De Blasio wasn't passionate about the cause when he was a member of City Council in 2007, he became the face of a horse-free park in 2011 when he said it was time to pursue 'more humane alternatives to the horse-drawn carriages'. That statement seems to have helped the mayor when he was running for office last year, and anti-carriage groups funded a serious ad campaign against Christine Quinn - his main Democrat rival. Actor Liam Neeson, who starred in Shindler's List and Taken, has become one of the horse-drawn carriage industry's main supporters after recently touring a stables where they are housed. 'It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working,' Neeson wrote in an April 14 editorial in The New York Times. Neeson believes the horse-carriage business is 'humane' and 'well regulated'. While four horses have been killed in collisions with motor vechiles, Neeson said that is a remarkably safe record for New York's traffic. Human rights activists protested outside of Neeson's apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan last Saturday, many holding signs reading 'Liam Neeson: Stop Supporting Cruelty!' and 'Worked to Death!' Mayor De Blasio plans to replace the carriages with electric vintage-style cars.

"By . Jill Reilly . Mob wife¿ star Alicia DiMichele has quit the television show . ‘Mob wife’ star Alicia DiMichele has quit the television show to focus on fighting embezzlement charges after withdrawing her earlier guilty plea. The 40-year-old submitted a resignation letter to the VH1 cable channel three weeks ago, sources said. The wife of reputed Colombo enforcer Edward (Tall Guy) Garofalo, Jr., appeared at Brooklyn Federal Court Wednesday where she withdrew her guilty plea to helping him embezzle $40,000 in Teamsters pension funds from a Staten Island trucking company. He was handed a seven-year jail term earlier this year for murder conspiracy and witness tampering. DiMichele was earning $8,000 per episode from the show which she joined last year. - this prompted prosecutors to argue that she was able to pay a $96,000 fine, reported the New York Daily News. Federal Judge Sandra Townes is now looking at the amount of restitution DiMichele owes to Teamsters Local 282. DiMichele’s lawyer and the government had agreed the figure is $20,000, but the general counsel for the union’s benefits fund put the amount at $2.8 million including 18 per cent interest. Townes said she could not accept the lower figure and offered DiMichele the opportunity to take back her guilty plea. 'I’m relieved and as always I’m staying positive,' DiMichele told The News. Pool posers: Alicia DiMichele (left) partying in Vegas at the Palms Pool with fellow 'new' Mob Wives cast member Natalie Elise . Alicia DiMichele, seen right leaving court last year, had previously admitted she helped her husband, Edward 'Tall Guy' Garofalo Jr, (left) to scam tens of thousands of dollars in union-pension funds while working for an alleged mob-tied construction firm . 'We expect there will be a new plea that satisfies the government and the defense without having her potentially liable for $2 million in restitution,' said defense lawyer John Wallenstein. Under the plea deal, she faced up to six months in prison. The mother-of-three told the court in 2012 she 'agreed with my husband' to participate in the scheme. Evidence against her includes recordings from two wiretaps and testimony of two witnesses. DiMichele’s husband pleaded guilty to a murder conspiracy, but not the embezzling charge so the restitution is now focused on DiMichele. He had agreed to testify during Wednesday’s hearing but prison officials couldn’t get him to Brooklyn from his out of state lockup.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . and Amanda Williams . Tom Daley's Hollywood screenwriter boyfriend has denied he is to be called as a character witness in the sex abuse trial of X-Men director Bryan Singer. Dustin Lance Black, 39, whose relationship with the 19-year-old Olympic diver was made public in December, was reportedly expected to be named as a witness in lawsuit filed against Singer in the U.S. The director has been accused of hosting depraved sex parties and raping teenage boys by Michael Egan, 31, who says he was one of Singer's victims when he was 15. Scroll down for video . Called up: Dustin Lance Black, pictured right with Tom Daley, is to be called as a character witness in the sex abuse trial . There is no suggestion that Mr Black, who will appear only as a character witness, had any knowledge or was present at the time of the alleged abuse. But he is reportedly close to Singer, considering him a mentor figure, and has been seen attending a pool party hosted by the director, who has strenuously denied the allegations. Accusations: Bryan Singer allegedly raped Michael Egan at pool parties in 1999 and 2000 . A lawyer for Mr Egan had earlier confirmed the intention to call on Mr Black, telling the Daily Mirror: 'I intend to take ­depositions [statements] of all individuals who may have relevant information, including Singer’s friends. An unnamed source told the paper: 'Dustin looked up to Singer as he was such an established film director in Hollywood'. Today, a spokesman for Mr Black said there 'was no truth to reports' that Mr Black was to be called as a character witness. Mr Daley came out in a touching Youtube video in December, and revealed that Mr Black - an Oscar-winning screenwriter - was his boyfriend a few weeks later. Speaking about the relationship, Mr Daley said at the time: 'I’d never felt the feeling of love, it happened so quickly, I was completely overwhelmed by it to the point I can’t get him out of my head all the time.' Mr Egan has sensationally claimed that he caught up in a paedophile sex ring involving Singer and other Hollywood figures when he was a teenager living in California around 1999 and 2000. Speaking at a press conference last week he spoke of how Singer treated him like 'a piece of meat' and . he claims he had 'a gun put in my mouth' by Hollywood power broker Mark . Rector-Collins so he'd do as he was told. 'I . wouldn't say it was a relationship [with Singer], you were a piece of . meat,' Egan said of how he was treated at the parties that he allegedly began attending when he was just 14 or 15. He said: 'Certain situations like at the house . where the rules were no swimsuits by the pool areas. I was in the hot . tub with Singer and other individuals, they grope you, shove your head . under water, orally molest you, then they'd rape you by the side of hot . tub. You were a piece of meat.' Details: Michael Egan filed a lawsuit on Wednesday - and held a press conference yesterday claiming Bryan Singer drugged and raped him in California and Hawaii in the late 1990s . He claimed the men regularly threatened to ruin his dreams of becoming an actor if he didn't comply with their demands. Mr Egan has been dismissed as a fantasist by Singer's representatives. Responding to the allegations, attorney Marty Singer - who is not related to the director - said: 'It is obvious . that this case was filed in an attempt to get publicity,' ahead of the . film's release. 'The . claims made against Bryan Singer are completely without merit. We are . very confident that Bryan will be vindicated in this absurd and . defamatory lawsuit.' 'We look forward to our bringing a claim . for malicious prosecution against Mr. Egan and his attorney after we . prevail.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Led Zeppelin have unveiled two previously unheard recordings ahead of the reissue of the band’s first three albums in June. The two tracks - blues classic Keys to the Highway, recorded in 1970, and an early version of the famous song Whole Lotta Love - are among dozens of tracks which the band will officially release alongside the reissues. The companion discs will feature alternative versions of songs, works in progress and live performances, all recorded at the time of the original albums. Special: The surviving band members (L-R) John Paul Jones, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page have selected the two tracks from their carefully catalogued archive of music recorded in the 1970s . The tracks, like hundreds of others, had been carefully catalogued but then locked away in the band’s archive for decades. Guitarist Jimmy Page, 70, has spent two-and-a-half years combing through the vaults, listening to hundreds of quarter-inch tapes before choosing the best material. 'I don’t want to die and have somebody else do it,' he says. 'I’m authoritative about what was done in the first place.' Page says the new material 'deserves to be heard' because 'it’s performance art'. It will give fans the first chance to hear some of the band’s key recording sessions. Keys to the Highway/Trouble in Mind, to appear on Led Zeppelin III, was recorded in 1970 at the Olympic Studios in Barnes in south-west London, about half an hour after Hats Off to (Roy) Harper. But it was never released. Fans are clamouring to get hold of the subsequent reissues of three albums that will hit stores in June . Led Zeppelin disbanded in 1980 following the death of drummer John Bonham (top centre) 'It was a particularly prolific time,' says singer Robert Plant, 'where we were learning about each other’s capabilities. 'Jimmy and I were just fooling around with the stuff that we would play at home. We were just trying things out. Nothing was premeditated.' The passing of time has also given Plant, who is now 65, a different perspective. 'My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn’t I shut up a bit?' he laughs. 'I kind of overcooked it.' Page promises 'lots of surprises' on the three reissues, which are part of a plan to reissue all nine of the band’s studio albums in chronological order. Despite intense support for the band decades after they broke up, they said the chance of a new gig is 'zero' But he has dismissed rumours that there will be versions of songs featuring bass and keyboard player John Paul Jones on vocals. For a band that broke up in 1980, following the death of the drummer John Bonham, interest in Led Zeppelin remains intense. The surviving members reunited seven years ago for a concert at London’s O2. But fans will be disappointed if they are hoping there will be another one. Page said: 'I’m sure people would love to hear it. I’m not the one to be asking, I don’t sing.' Plant, however, is unequivocal. The chances of the band performing live again are, he said 'zero'.","Guitarist Jimmy Page has spent two years choosing material from archives .

The president joked with the emperor saying that the last time they met, he did not have any grey hairs. But the Japanese monarch was very sympathetic replying: 'You have a very hard job.' Mr Obama was invited to the Imperial Palace, a lush park-like complex surrounded by modern skyscrapers to start his Asia tour. He was greeted by smiling schoolchildren waving Japanese and U.S. flags before he solemnly inspected a rifle-bearing military guard of honour.

He then walked along a maze of red carpet into the Imperial Palace for a private meeting with the emperor, empress, U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy and other aides. After making several other visits, he then returned to the Imperial Palace later in the day for a state dinner with the emperor and empress, who was in traditional Japanese dress.

But Obama controlled the ball with ease although later admitted he was slightly intimated by the robot . Earlier in the day, the U.S. leader visit the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, where he came face to face with Honda's humanoid robot ASIMO. The robot, dressed in an astronaut suit went through a series of exercises and told the president it was nice to meet him and that he could kick a soccer ball. Mr Obama told the droid 'come on then' before it booted the ball towards the president, but he controlled it although later admitted he was slightly intimidated by the robot.

Today also saw the president assure Japan that America was committed to its defence including the tiny islands at the heart of a row with China. But the president stopped short of saying he had drawn any new 'red line' and urged peaceful dialogue over the islands, called the Senkaku by Japan and the Diaoyu by China.

Mr Obama also urged Japan to take 'bold steps' to clinch a two-way trade pact seen as crucial to a broad regional agreement that is a central part of the U.S. leader's 'pivot' of military, diplomatic and economic resources towards Asia and the Pacific. 'We don't take a position on final sovereignty determinations with respect to Senkaku, but historically they have been administered by Japan and we do not believe that they should be subject to change unilaterally and what is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by Japan,' Obama said. 'This is not a new position, this is a consistent one,' he told a joint news conference after his summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, using the Japanese name for the islands. Barack Obama arrived at Haneda International Airport in Tokyo yesterday on Air Force One at the start of a tour of Asia . 'In our discussions, I emphasized with Prime Minister Abe the importance of resolving this issue peacefully,' Obama added. Obama's stops in Japan will be followed by trips to South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines as part of an Asian tour. The president cancelled a visit to Asia last year because of the U.S. government shutdown. The cancellation provided fresh fodder for those in the region who worry that the White House's much-hyped pivot to Asia is continually taking a backseat to other foreign and domestic priorities. 'I think the president will want to make clear that this commitment will be unaffected by developments in Ukraine and other global events,"" said Jeffrey Bader, Obama's former Asia director. The president was welcomed to the country by ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy and her husband Edwin Schlossberg . 'Countries want to hear that the U.S. presence is in fact steady and strong as China rises.' While China is not on Obama's eight-day itinerary, leaders in Beijing will be closely watching the president's tour. Obama's advisers insist the trip - and the White House's broader Asia policy - is not designed counter to China's growing power, and they say the president is not asking Asian nations to choose between allegiance to Washington or Beijing. On the economic front, Obama is unlikely to have much new to show for efforts to deepen trade ties with Asia. Negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12 nation free trade pact, are stalled, particularly discussions between the U.S. and Japan over tariffs on agriculture.","The president was granted an audience with Japan's Emperor Akihito at the Imperial Palace at the start of his Asia tour .

'I commented on his link that I should do this to you and he said, ""Yeah? Go ahead. I don't know who would be more embarrassed - you or me,""' recalled Mr Anderson. 'So I took it as a challenge.'

"By . Alex Greig . Florida beach-goers were stunned by the sight of a local fisherman dragging a huge hammerhead shark to shore. Ryan Bolash, 21, and friends dragged the 13-foot beast onto the beach after they hooked it near the pier at Lauderdale-by-the-Sea. Bolash wrestled the thrashing shark out of the Atlantic Ocean and onto the beach, and the whole spectacle was filmed and photographed by thrilled onlookers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO: . Hooked: A fisherman caught the huge hammerhead from the pier at Lauderdale-by-the-Sea . Clear the water: Swimmers crowded the beach as the hammerhead was pulled ashore . Team effort: Bolash and friends pull the huge fish ashore so they can cut the fishing line from its mouth . The main reason for dragging the beast ashore wasn't glory, though, it was to cut the fishing line. Bolash told reporters that it's important to cut the line as close as possible to the creature's mouth so that it didn't get caught on something and injure the shark. 'In order to release the fish on the pier, you would end up having to cut the line, and there would be about 15 foot of line tangling, hanging down from the fish, which would get caught on a reef, could end up killing the fish in the long run,' Bolash told WHNT. 'It is an amazing fish, when they are that big they are old, they are amazing creature, I donâ€™t know why anyone would want to hurt them.' After the line was cut, the men dragged the hammerhead back to the sea and watched it swim away. 'It's an achievement. It's cool to catch something that big and have a picture and show everyone and be like, ""Look at what I caught!"" It's the ultimate catch,' said Bolash. Close cut: Bolash uses wirecutters to cut the line as close to the shark's mouth as possible, to ensure it doesn't catch on reef and injure the animal . Back out to sea: Bolash pulls the beast back into the ocean after cutting the line . Photographs aren't the only memory Bolash has from his close encounter with the huge hammerhead. He received a few scratches on his leg that he calls 'shark burn,' from the shark's rough skin, reports WHNT, but otherwise Bolash - and the hammerhead - was uninjured. Tourists and locals alike were amazed at the sight of the shark. 'It's a very big experience for us,' Canadian tourist Jenie Rivest told reporters. 'For sure we are going to tell everybody in Montreal that we saw this.' According to a local who works on the pier, the last time a 13-foot hammerhead was caught in the area was in the 1960s.","Ryan Bolash and friends caught a huge hammerhead shark off the pier at Lauderdale-by-the-Sea .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Segolene Royal, who has denied she has banned female colleagues from wearing low cut tops . The former partner of French president Francois Hollande has been forced to deny she has banned female colleagues from wearing low cut tops. Eyebrows were raised earlier this month when Segolene Royal, mother of President Francois Hollande's four children, was made a senior minister in Mr Hollande’s Socialist government. The new ecology minister is said to be living up to her surname by acting like an unelected queen, according to fellow Socialists. Le Point, the highly respected news magazine, claimed that she ‘banned necklines’ and imposed a ‘ruthless set of rules’. They claimed regulations insist that staff stand to attention when she walks by, bans them from ‘making too much noise’ when she is having lunch and has stopped staff from smoking. They also alleged Ms Royal insists that all offices apart from her own have to be shared by at least two people. However, as anger grew against Ms Royal, she took to Twitter to deny the new 'rules'. 'Of course I deny the ridiculous rumour concerning the banning of low cut tops in the ministry,' she said. Ms Royal also added: 'The only rules laid . down here were in regards to a greater rigor in the use of public . funds, that the French people expect from us.' A tweet by Segolene Royal, which translates as, 'Of course I deny the ridiculous rumour concerning the banning of low cut tops in the ministry' Ms Royal also added, 'The only rules laid down here were in regards to a greater rigor in the use of public funds, that the French people expect from us' However, opponents said Ms Royal, 60, was simply backtracking from a massive mistake, and that her Socialist government was notorious for its wasteful public spending. Ms Royal, had a long relationship with Mr Hollande but was famously humiliated when he left her for the Paris Match journalist Valerie Trierweiler. Ms Trierweiler was herself dumped by Mr Hollande in January after his latest affair with actress Julie Gayet, 41, was made public. The 49-year political journalist was . hospitalised after the affair was revealed and was then forced to move . out of the Elysee Palace. Valerie Trierweiler and Francois Hollande, who split in January but a new book claims the president is 'missing' his former partner . However, in a new book released yesterday, it was claimed Mr Hollande is 'missing' Ms Trierweiler and is becoming attached to the former journalist once again. The book, 'The President who Wanted to Live his Lives' claims a full break of the relationship never occurred and that the president remains 'tender and considerate' towards his ex-partner. Extracts from the book by journalist Elise Karlin, published in L'Express magazine yesterday allege Mr Hollande bought Ms Trierweiler flowers when they met for a meal at one of their favourite restaurants in Paris last month. Mr Hollande was revealed to be having an affair with French actress, Julie Gayet, pictured . In January, Mr Hollande separated from Ms Trierweiler after his affair with actress Julie Gayet became public . The book also claims he 'hates solitude' and has given the impression his feelings for her are 'far from extinguished'. Friends have also been quoted as saying he is almost 'harassing' her with tender text messages. However, the book also alleges, without citing any sources, that Ms Trierweiler expects a public act of contrition on his part before any reconciliation. But it also hints the president may have an ulterior motive, and is trying to stop Ms Trierweiler from writing her own tell-all book.","Reports that Segolene Royal had banned female colleagues wearing low cut tops .

"By . Associated Press . Israel has cut off Middle East peace talks and threatened to impose new sanctions against the Palestinians in response to a unity agreement between Hamas and Fatah. Israel's Security Cabinet made the decision during a marathon emergency meeting convened to discuss the new Palestinian deal. The rival Palestinian factions announced a reconciliation plan meant to end a seven-year rift on Wednesday. Israel objects to any participation in Palestinian politics by Hamas, an Islamic militant group sworn to Israel's destruction. The group has killed hundreds of Israelis in suicide bombings and other attacks over the past two decades. A Palestinian security official prevents bystanders from accessing the site of an Israeli airstrike on motorcycle in Beit Lahiya, in the northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday . Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement said the government would not hold negotiations . A statement from Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that the government would not hold negotiations with a government that 'leans on Hamas.' 'Instead of choosing peace, Abu Mazen made a pact with a murderous terrorist organization that calls for the destruction of Israel,' it said, using Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' nickname. 'The alliance between Abu Mazen and Hamas was signed while Israel was making efforts to promote negotiations with the Palestinians. ... He who chooses Hamas' terror does not want peace.' The statement said Israel also will respond to Mr Abbas' recent decision to join 15 international conventions 'with a series of steps,' language that typically refers to financial sanctions against the Palestinians. Israel already halted transferring tax and customs money it collects on the Palestinians behalf, worth some $100 million a month. Those funds help keep Abbas' self-rule government afloat. Mr Abbas won assurances in recent Arab League meetings that Arab countries would pay $100 million to the Palestinian Authority if Israel freezes the monthly transfers. However, some of the Arab donor countries have in the past not met their aid commitments. Palestinians waving Palestinian flags as they gather to celebrate the newly made reconciliation deal between Fatah and Hamas, ending a seven-year split . Thursday's decision was the latest â€” and perhaps final â€” blow to the embattled peace process led by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry for the past nine months. The negotiating period had been scheduled to expire next Tuesday. After nine months of fruitless talks, the sides had been meeting in recent weeks in hopes of extending the negotiations. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian peace negotiator, said Palestinian reconciliation is an internal matter. ""Israel had no right to interfere in this issue,"" he said. He condemned any possible Israeli sanctions as ""piracy,"" saying the tax revenues are Palestinian money.

"By . Louise Boyle . Cliven Bundy, a Nevada cattle rancher, has become something of a celebrity in his frontier stronghold since his showdown over land with federal authorities earlier this month. Officials had tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 after 20 years of not paying taxes. However they were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed with sniper rifles, turned up and threatened to open fire. The incident has propelled Bundy into a position of authority among those who believe that they are being harassed by an 'overreaching' federal government. Bundy has leapt on to this platform, holding daily news conferences next to the armed checkpoint on the driveway of his ranch.

During his speech, Bundy shared a story of driving through a housing project in Las Vegas, according to a report by the New York Times, beginning his tale with the words: 'I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro.' He said: 'In front of that . government house the door was usually open and the older people and the . kids - and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the . porch - they didn’t have nothing to do. They didn’t have nothing for . their kids to do. They didn’t have nothing for their young girls to do. 'And . because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they . do? They abort their young children, they put their young . men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I’ve . often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having . a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government . subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.' Rancher Cliven Bundy (center with his arm around his granddaughter Jerusha) greets supporters during a Bundy family 'Patriot Party' near Bunkerville, Nevada, on April 18 . Mr Bundy, a 67-year-old father-of 14 and registered Republican, is . accused of not paying federal grazing taxes for his cattle for 20 . years, and reportedly owes the government $1million. A federal taskforce . has been setup to deal with him, Senate majority leader and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid said last week, branding Bundy a 'domestic terrorist'. The Bureau of Land Management tried to round up Bundy's cattle earlier this month but were forced to back down after hundreds of supporters, some carrying automatic weapons and sniper rifles, threatened violence. Reid accused the militia supporting Reid of deliberately putting women and children into the firing line so that, in the event of violence, they got hurt first ensuring the worst possible headlines. Meanwhile Bundy has warned that he will never back down down from his fight. 'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline earlier this month. 'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.' He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada. He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.' Officials tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 but were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed, turned up and threatened to open fire . Bundy won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land . Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as . part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada. Craig Leff, from the Bureau of Land Management, told the Times: 'The gather is now over. Our focus is pursuing this matter . administratively and judicially.' Fears . of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped . out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call . off their operation. Supporters . of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken . in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at . any moment. Many . of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads . around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared . to take on the federal agents in a fire fight. One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down'. The . dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he . stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze . public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave . Desert tortoise. Surrounding Bundy's ranch, one armed man (not pictured) was heard saying he had officials 'in his sights' during the heated stand-off earlier this month . Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years. The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle. Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy. It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2million he owes to the Government. The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region. The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals. The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.","Cattle rancher Cliven Bundy allegedly refuses to pay $1m taxes on his herd .

"By . Bianca London . A vintage dating guide reveals exactly what first dates were like for the single women of the 1950s - and it seems that restaurants were a landmine. The unearthed guide from the October 1950 issue of Woman's Own sheds light on dating hurdles of the era. The guide, ‘How to Behave in a Restaurant’, contains plenty of tips for young women, including this one: . ‘The man always does the ordering, never ask the waiter yourself for . anything.' Vintage: An unearthed guide from the October 1950 issue of Woman's Own called 'How to Behave in a Restaurant' sheds light on the hilarious dating hurdles of the 50s . The magazine warned certain foods, such as celery, could ‘quite correctly be eaten with the hands’. However apples and pears should be approached with caution, because ‘fruit causes some embarrassment.’ 'The rules of correct procedure vary,' the magazine warned. ''There are certain foods which are eaten in a manner entirely different from others. For instance, asparagus is one of the few foods which can be eaten with fingers. 'On the Continent, fruit is always eaten with a knife and fork but in this country it is sometimes correct to cut the apple or pear into sections and eat it with your fingers or just the fork. 'Cherries should be put into the mouth whole and the stones carefully placed on a spoon.' Step-by-step guide: The article even has imagery showing a woman exactly how to behave in a restaurant, advising her how to eat fruit and to never drop cutlery on the floor . Rules: The article warns: 'Watch your table manners, people are so apt to decide what kind of person you are by watching you eat, it's easy to make mistakes' And it wasn’t just dessert which could cause a problem, the magazine steered women away from fish because it could be ‘difficult to manage’ and when the meal was over, they were reminded it was ‘bad taste’ to leave lipstick marks on a cup. Further advice suggests: 'tipping your soup bowl away from you' because lifting it towards you was the ‘height of bad manners’. The guide also adds: 'It is bad manners to put your elbows on . the table. It is also very bad manners to powder your nose or put on . lipstick at the table, and unforgivable to comb your hair at the meal.' Dropped your knife on the floor? Heed Woman's Own's advice: 'you do not start frantically hunting to retrieve it, ask the waiter to bring you a clean one.' Although the type of Woman’s Own content has moved on since the 'How to Behave in a Restaurant' days, the weekly magazine say its mantra has remained the same since the 1930's. Changing face: Woman's Own's cover, left, in 2008 featuring Cheryl Cole and, right, in 1963 . Terry Tavner, Editor in Large of Woman's Own, said: 'Since 1932, Woman's Own has been entertaining and educating women of every generation. 'The magazine is less about age and more about life stages, which is why we attract readers in their 30s through to their 70s. 'Woman's Own is a rite of passage, handed down from generation to generation and we are honoured to continue that tradition in the 21st century.' A spokesperson for CupidSpeedDater.com, who uncovered the piece, said: 'Thankfully . times have changed and the dating game is more relaxed. While dating can . still be daunting at least women no longer have to worry if they drop a . knife on the floor during a meal.'","Copy of 1950s Woman's Own magazine reveals dating guide .

Mr Smith told The Sun: ‘Apart from the side-effects you feel fantastic. In a club you feel like the biggest, strongest, best-looking, most powerful man in the world.’ But he added that he developed painful hard lumps in his bottom after injecting it with the drugs twice a week, and grew a ‘cyst that was bigger than a tennis ball’ when injecting his shoulder. Doctors told Mr Smith to get the cyst removed - which would have meant cutting away part of the muscle - but instead he drew out the liquid himself with a syringe, reported the newspaper. He also developed hard tissue in his breasts, and was told by medics that he needed an operation for that too.

'Apart from the side-effects you feel fantastic. In a club you feel like the biggest, strongest, best-looking, most powerful man in the world' Oli Smith . While steroids can enhance performance by increasing muscle mass and decreasing fat, they can also lead to lower sperm count, breast development and overgrowth of the forehead. And Mr Smith told The Sun: ‘Aggression is one of the main problems. I lost my first job because I pushed over my team leader. I wasn't at all aware of how it happened. I had a blackout.’ Some 60,000 people in Britain aged between 16 and 59 are said by medical guidance body the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to have used steroids over the past year. Concerns: While steroids can enhance performance by increasing muscle mass and decreasing fat, they can also lead to lower sperm count, breast development and overgrowth of the forehead . Earlier this month an inquest in Bradford heard how an obsessive bodybuilder who suffered two heart attacks and three strokes because of his massive intake of anabolic steroids died aged just 20. Anabolic steroids are similar to the male hormone testosterone. They can improve endurance and stimulate muscle growth. They can help athletes train for longer and some men take them to look more 'manly', according to the drug advice website Frank. The steroids are available as tablets - which cost around £20 for 100 - or as a liquid for injection. But some of the side-effects in men include reduced sperm count, infertility, baldness, breast development, severe acne and increased risk of developing prostate cancer. According to NHS Choices, the side-effects in women include facial hair growth, loss of breasts, a deepened voice, problems with periods and hair loss. The steroids are Class C drugs to be sold only by pharmacists with a doctor's prescription. It is legal to possess or import them for personal use - but possession or importing with intent to supply is illegal, and punishable by up to 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine. Fitness fanatic Oli Cooney had been told by doctors when he was 18 that he was putting his life at risk if he did not limit his weightlifting but he refused to listen - and told family he was ‘invincible’. Prices vary, but anabolic steroids cost about £20 for 100 tablets - and are also available in liquid form, the drug advice website Frank says. The abuse of steroids was highlighted in 2010 when relatives of Raoul Moat said the 37-year-old ex-nightclub bouncer, who went on a shooting spree in Northumberland, was addicted to the muscle-building drugs and prone to 'unpredictable' eruptions of anger. Increased aggression and violent episodes among anabolic steroid users have been documented across the world since the 1970s by researchers examining what is sometimes labelled 'roid rage'. Experts have also highlighted how a disturbing number of bodybuilders have been involved in murders compared with other sportsmen. In 1998, an article in the US magazine Sports Illustrated highlighted the large number of bodybuilders jailed for killings compared with other athletes. One well-known case is that of former Mr Universe Bertil Fox, who was convicted of the murders of his girlfriend and her mother on the Caribbean island of St Kitts in 1998.","Oli Smith claims Class C drugs help him have sex until he 'passes out'

"By . Mark Duell . The niece of a BBC weatherman who stalked him after claiming she was his daughter killed herself after a long campaign of harassment, an inquest heard yesterday. Former nursing sister Joanna Toner, 52, of Tiverton, Devon, had written letters to ex-presenter Bill Giles and she was charged with harassment - something for which she had previously been jailed. But the mother-of-two failed to turn up to court and police discovered her dead on her bed three days later when they went round to her barricaded home. Stalked: BBC weatherman Bill Giles (left) received letters from former nursing sister Joanna Toner (right), 52 . A coroner yesterday ruled that Toner killed herself from a huge overdose of prescription drugs. In 2000, Toner, then 40, was jailed for 30 months over her nine year-long obsession that Mr Giles was her father when she was his niece. She made hoax bomb calls to the BBC and threatening calls to Mr Giles and his wife Maureen. Toner also poured lighter fuel over herself outside the BBC’s TV studios at Shepherd’s Bush, west London. In 1998 she was jailed for six months for similar offences against the senior BBC weatherman - and she was banned from contacting him, the BBC and the Met Office. She had stopped her campaign of harassment for a short while after going to jail - but resumed it again in 1999. In 2000 her lawyer said she intended to pursue her claim about her parenthood through legal channels. Toner’s obsession began in the late 1980s when her mother - who had a severe alcohol problem - claimed that Mr Giles was Joanna’s natural father. Target: Toner made hoax bomb calls to the BBC and threatening calls to Mr Giles (pictured) and his wife . Toner stayed with Mr Giles and his family when he was married to her aunt but the couple later divorced and he remarried in 1991. In 2000, Mr Giles said: ‘I feel very sorry for her.’ At yesterday’s inquest in Exeter, it emerged that Toner had sent more letters to Mr Giles in Oxfordshire in 2012. 'I am sure she took her own life and intended to do so' Coroner Andrew Cox . Her daughter Dawn Taylor told the coroner that she had ‘sent a letter to Bill Giles’ before she died but she had not seen any of the letters. Coroner Andrew Cox said ‘the details of suicide notes were very personal in nature’ and Miss Taylor said she would find out more details of them from the police in private rather than in the public hearing. The inquest heard Toner failed to turn up in court in September 2012 at Exeter to answer the new harassment allegations. A warrant for her arrest was issued by the court. When police went to her home it was barricaded from the inside and all the windows were locked. They forced their way in and found Toner dead next to empty packets of pills - and toxicology tests revealed she had taken a massive overdose. She also left several notes. HQ: Toner poured lighter fuel over herself outside BBC TV Centre at Shepherd's Bush in London (pictured) The coroner was told that Toner had been to see her GP but had ben abusive in the surgery and left without getting a sick note - and without that her benefits had been stopped after she ‘got angry at the Job Centre’. The inquest heard she suffered from chronic depression which dated back to the 1980s and hip and back pain. 'Various things were pressing on her. She was in court. She had been bailed for an offence of harassment, failed to attend and a warrant was issued for her arrest' Detective Sergeant Angus Cottey, Devon & Cornwall Police . Neighbours told police she was ‘unusual, really friendly but kept herself to herself’ although male friends did visit her at her home. Detective Sergeant Angus Cottey of Devon & Cornwall Police said handwritten suicide notes were found and there were no suspicious circumstances and no third party involvement in her death. He said: ‘Various things were pressing on her. She was in court. She had been bailed for an offence of harassment, failed to attend and a warrant was issued for her arrest. ‘We had to break in. She had barricaded inside and the windows would not open anyway. It was very secure. There were no signs of a struggle or assault.’ Coroner Mr Cox recorded a verdict of suicide, saying: ‘I am sure she took her own life and intended to do so.’","Joanna Toner had written new letters to ex-BBC weatherman Bill Giles .

"By . Harriet Sargeant . Under fire: Labour MP Ann Clwyd has has been attacked by the NHS and her own party after she complained that her husband Owen died 'like a battery hen' in hospital . Yesterday, the hospital where Ann Clwyd’s husband died issued an official report dismissing her claims against it. The Labour MP is the latest in a long list of patients and their families who the NHS feels it can ignore with impunity. This is despite the fact that this courageous widow, grieving for her beloved husband, stood up in Parliament determined to expose the ‘indifferent’ and ‘callous’ staff and the lack of care that she claimed caused his death. It is despite the fact that David Cameron was so impressed by her first-hand experiences that he asked her to overhaul the complaints system of the NHS. It is despite the fact that her harrowing testimony brought forth a flood of letters from the public telling similar stories of neglect. That cuts no ice with University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. Owen Roberts might have died like ‘a battery hen’, shoved up against the bars of his tiny bed, his feet hanging over the edge, bereft of even socks or a blanket to keep him warm, according to his wife. But the investigation by hospital staff, overseen by an independent panel of experts, dismissed 21 of the MP’s 31 complaints as unproven or by saying ‘insufficient evidence to uphold this concern’. Anyone who has made a complaint to the NHS, whether questioning an indifferent nurse or making a more formal accusation, knows the response they will get only too well — a barrage of doublespeak designed to confuse and weary you. Only once in the report into Owen Roberts’ death does the doublespeak falter. That is when it knocks up against the fact he waited 27 hours in A&E and then died of hospital-acquired pneumonia. ‘This concern is upheld except that it is not upheld that there was a lack of care and attention,’ is the hospital’s response. Go wonder at that one. George Orwell, the writer who invented the phrase doublespeak in his novel 1984, could not have put it better. Taking on the NHS is not for the faint-hearted, as Ms Clywd is discovering. Our health service seems to have reached new levels of paranoia. Happier times: Ann Clwyd with her husband Owen Roberts on their wedding day 1963. He died aged 73 at University Hospital of Wales . When I was investigating the NHS for the Centre of Policy Studies ten years ago, managers did not know what was going on in their hospitals because they rarely visited a ward or asked patients about their experiences. They could at least claim ignorance and hope the whole thing would go away. Now, instead of not responding to complaints, the NHS turns aggressively on the person daring to complain. Our caring service has become more like something out of an airport thriller — a vast, malign organisation bullying patients and their loved ones, threatening whistleblowers and spending huge sums of taxpayers’ money to grind them down. Just this week it emerged that University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust spent £6 million on legal fees, employed a PR firm and even set private detectives to dig dirt on Dr Raj Mattu, a heart surgeon who had spoken out about the dangerous conditions on his wards. That is all he had done. Complaint: Mrs Clwyd, 77, claimed her husband had been victim of an 'almost callous lack of care' and was treated with 'contempt' by NHS staff before his death in October 2012 . For that, as his lawyer said, he was ‘vilified, bullied and harassed out of a job he loved’. Ann Clwyd does not work for the NHS, but the organisation has done its best to hit her where it hurts. She has accused hospital bosses of an ‘outrageous breach of confidentiality’ by publishing detailed information about her husband’s death. As she said: ‘No one is going to make a complaint in future if their personal details are going to be made public in this way.’ The NHS being essentially a political organisation. Ms Clwyd also finds herself under fire from her own party. Recently Wales’s First Minister Carwyn Jones launched a stinging attack on her for critical comments made about the Welsh NHS — saying she had ‘no evidence and no facts’ to back up allegations of a crisis in the service. The Labour Welsh Assembly Member Lynne Neagle was outraged at Ms Clwyd’s concerns about the high mortality rates in some Welsh hospitals. She accused Ms Clwyd of ‘denigrating’ the Welsh NHS and warned that ‘she should stop’. Actually, no, she shouldn’t.  What should stop are the high mortality rates. But that is unlikely  to happen any time soon,  given the fact that Labour’s Welsh Assembly Members have voted against inviting her to give evidence to an influential Welsh Assembly committee. Where the UK Coalition asked her to lead an inquiry, the Welsh Labour government has blocked and denigrated her. Her facts were good enough to alarm Sir Bruce Keogh, Chief Medical Officer for England, but not Welsh Labour MPs. Ann Clywd has discovered that patients come a very poor second to propagating the NHS myth. How crucial that myth is we saw in spades at the Olympic opening ceremony. Its artistic director, Danny Boyle, would have us believe that the health service is stuffed with lovely, dancing nurses in starched caps who read stories to sick children. Dream on. Many of our elderly patients would be pathetically grateful for a nurse that paused long enough at their bedside to offer them a drink — never mind bedtime stories. The response of assembly members and hospital boards is typical. I came across it when investigating the NHS over nine months. My accounts of what I had seen were also dismissed as ‘anecdotal’. While there are undoubtedly countless dedicated and caring people working for the NHS who put themselves out for patients, like Ann Clwyd, I, too, was flooded with letters from patients who’d suffered the same ‘anecdotal’ experiences of callousness and incompetence. Vision: The Olympic opening ceremony's artistic director, Danny Boyle, would have us believe that the health service is stuffed with lovely, dancing nurses in starched caps . An old man described on the phone how he had watched his wife die of neglect. His call reduced me to tears. ‘I don’t know who to complain to. No one will listen,’ he said by way of apology at the end of the conversation. In a court of law, the testimony of a witness is given due weight. In the NHS, the same testimony is traduced as anecdote. That is part of the problem. Every patient with a complaint is made to feel isolated — a one-off, who really shouldn’t presume to denigrate such a noble institution. Look at what happened to a Labour MP of long standing. What chance do the rest of us have? One of the only reasons that the scandal . of Mid Staffs came out was because a number of relatives of patients . happened to go to the same nearby cafe and started to exchange stories. Tragedy: Owen Roberts waited 27 hours in A&E and then died of hospital-acquired pneumonia . They quickly realised that what they had been told was a one-off was, in fact, a systematic failure of the trust and the whole New Labour project for the NHS. This was one reason why their evidence had to be rubbished — with the woman who led the protests falling victim to a vicious hate campaign. The tragedy is that similar evidence against the NHS is still being rubbished. Let us end with one of those anecdotes the authorities dismiss — one left by a woman to comment on a story about Ann Clywd on the Wales Online website. The woman describes the degrading treatment of her dying mother in one Welsh hospital. When she complains, she says, ‘ranks are closed so people don’t take things further’. The authorities know complaints fall on ‘deaf ears and some like myself, because of their own ill health, do not have the stamina to follow things through. Money will be another obstacle to fight these cases, as they will inevitably carry on for years before a conclusion.’ It has happened to two friends. ‘Three years down the line and they still do not have closure.’ She finishes with this heartfelt plea: ‘Let me explain how I feel about Ann Clwyd’s findings. Myself and many, many friends who have experienced the disgusting downfalls of the Welsh NHS have all said we’d rather commit suicide than go into hospital when we are too old to stay at home through ill health. ‘I will . . . trust me. I will not be treated as a discarded piece of nuisance rubbish, as my mother was.’ Rather than another expensive, time-wasting re-organisation of the NHS, let the Government take one simple step. Create a website, not particular to individual hospitals, but a general forum where people can post these heart-breaking stories. How many hospitals will have the gall to dismiss case after case with their blanket approach of ‘insufficient evidence’? That way, patients will know they are not alone. And a malign bureaucracy will no longer get away with dismissing stories of cruelty and death as ‘merely anecdotal’.","MP claimed in Parliament that a lack of care caused husband Owen's death .

"By . Liz Hull . A mayor has been accused of running his town ‘like North Korea’ after trying to expel a councillor from a debate for tweeting. Gareth Fairhurst continued to air his views on Twitter after Billy Rotherham told members not to use the network in meetings, so the mayor told the independent Wigan councillor to go and called police when he refused. Two police community support officers arrived, but councillor Fairhurst knew that, by law, only a fully qualified police officer could eject a member from a council meeting, so continued to stand his ground. The steps of Wigan town hall: Councillor Fairhurst only left after a police officer came from 20 miles away . Because there were no free officers in . the town to attend, it was another 20 minutes before a policeman . arrived from 25 miles away, in Eccles, Greater Manchester. Amid farcical scenes, the officer admitted no law had been broken, so councillor Fairhurst could not be arrested. Instead he asked councillor Fairhurst to leave, which he agreed to do, and he was escorted out of the Town Hall. Several other opposition councillors then followed him out the door in protest at his treatment. Last . night the meeting was likened to a pantomime, with the Mayor saying his . grandchildren were better behaved than some members. Councillor . Fairhurst said Wigan was being run like ‘North Korea’ by Labour, who . were using the ban to stifle any criticism of their policies. He said calling the police was a ‘joke’ and such ‘heavy-handed’ tactics were a complete waste of tax-payers’ cash. ‘We . are meant to live in a democracy and operate open and transparent . politics to engage the public, but this behaviour is more akin to North . Korea than Britain,’ councillor Fairhurst said. ‘The . Mayor requests that members don’t Tweet from meetings because, they . say, we should be concentrating fully on what’s going on. ‘But . that’s just a smoke screen, what they really mean is they don’t want . anyone Tweeting anything critical of their policies because they want to . be in control of the messages seen by the public. ‘It’s a complete joke. ‘It . wasn’t my intention to disrupt the meeting but I thought it was . important to stand my ground. They were making it up as they went along . and I knew that they couldn’t just throw me out. ‘Calling . the police was heavy-handed and a complete waste of taxpayers’ money. I . knew they were behaving unlawfully and I had to stand up for freedom of . speech.’ Councillor Fairhurst said he ‘couldn’t help’ taking to the social network when the council leader began referring to a recent survey claiming than 99 per cent of all Wigan residents were happy with the council’s performance. He tweeted: ‘Leader says 99% of residents are happy with council. I bet 99% or not happy in Standish and other areas.’ Councillor Fairhurst added: ‘I just didn’t believe it, so I passed a comment on Twitter. ‘They must have put a council officer in the chamber to watch me because the next thing I knew she was pointing to my phone and the chief executive was informed.’ The offending tweet: Councillor Fairhurst believes an official must have been watching his Twitter feed . Councillor Fairhurst also accused the Labour administration of ‘double standards’ after it emerged another councillor, Labour’s Sue Loudon, also tweeted during the meeting. She was not thrown out because she supposedly only passed comment on councillor Fairhurst’s ‘disgraceful behaviour’ once the meeting was stopped, while she was waiting for him to be removed. Mayor Rotherham told councillor Fairhurst: ‘I have got grandchildren who don’t behave like you do.’ While leader Lord Peter Smith later lamented that it was ‘the most atrocious meeting’ he had ever been to. Councillor Fairhurst said he would be complaining to Local Government Minister Eric Pickles about the council, although stopped short of saying he would take legal action against them. Mr Pickles announced plans in November to introduce legislation giving people the right to report, film, blog and tweet from council proceedings. The changes - part of the Local Audit and Accountability Bill - would ‘unlock the mysteries of local government, making it more transparent for all,’ he said. But so far Wigan has resisted implementing such plans. The council is one of Labour’s safest local councils in the country, with 63 of the 75 councillors affiliated to the party.","Wigan councillor Gareth Fairhurst ignored a Twitter ban in meetings .

Ian Gough is accused of assaulting ex girlfriend Sophia Cahill at the home she shares with her fiancé, pop star Dane Bowers, pictured . Gough, who made 64 appearances for the Wales rugby union team and currently plays for Newport Dragons, appeared at Croydon Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday charged with assault by beating. A prosecutor described the alleged assault, said to have happened on January 4, as a 'domestic-style incident'. Gough denies the charge and will stand trial before magistrates on July 29, when Miss Cahill, 30, and Mr Bowers, 34, will be summoned to give evidence. Mother-of-two Miss Cahill, who built a successful modelling career after being crowned Miss Wales in 2000, has one child with Gough, who retired from the sport in September but was coaxed back into playing by London Irish.

Miss Cahill, who has modelled for Playboy and starred in video for the pop group N-Dubz, made headline around the world when she posed naked at London Fashion Week while eight-months pregnant in 2012. Former BRIT School pupil Bowers, who rose to fame in boy band Another Level, announced his engagement to Miss Cahill in December last year. In March this year, she criticised Gough on Facebook for allegedly reclaiming from child support payments the £364 cost of petrol used to travel to pick up their son. She wrote: “Lovely to find out the fantastic CSA [Child Support Agency] are deducting £364 for the lovely Mr Ian Gough’s petrol money to pick Gabriel up, disgusted he has even asked for that to be taken from Gabe to be honest.. Keep your money, your a joke, its the principle [sic].” Sophia Cahill, pictured during a publicity event with rugby stars Gavin Henson, left and Shane Williams, right . Former Miss Wales, Sophia Cahill, split with rugby player Ian Gough in 2011 when the model was pregnant with their son .

Bowers was given a conditional discharge after admitting shouting and swearing at door staff when his brother, also of Kingswood Way, was refused re-entry to a nightclub at a Butlins holiday camp where he had been performing last year. He pleaded guilty to using threatening or abusive behaviour which was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Chichester Magistrates’ Court in February.

"By . Becky Barrow . It is one of the most genteel cities in Britain. But the beautiful city of Bath, famous for its Roman baths, the novelist Jane Austen and its Georgian architecture, has a dirty secret. Official figures reveal that it is home to the debt capital of Britain. Bath, famous for its Roman baths and Bath Abbey, above, the novelist Jane Austen and its Georgian architecture, has been revealed as the debt capital of Britain . The analysis of every postcode by the British Bankers’ Association found people living in ‘BA1 9’ have, on average, higher personal loan debt than anybody else in Britain. Each adult in the area has an average personal loan of £2,311 although, in reality, many will have nothing and others will have much higher debts. It is only one of three postcodes in Britain where the average personal loan debt, calculated on a ‘per capita’ basis, is above £2,000. The other two are EC1 V2 in east London, close to the City, and NE66 4 in Newcastle upon Tyne. Bath’s starring appearance at the top of the league for personal loan debt is unexpected, given its status as one of the prettiest, most exclusive places to live in the south-west. The area, which includes Lansdown, Kelston and North Stoke, is close to exclusive private schools such as Kingswood and the Royal High School and includes the Bath racecourse. The analysis of every postcode by the British Bankers' Association found people living in 'BA1 9' have, on average, higher personal loan debt than anybody else in Britain . Bath has been named the debt capital of Britain, with official figures revealing that each adult in the BA1 9 postcode has an average personal loan of £2,311 . The average house price in the BA1 9 postcode is nearly £750,000, up nearly six per cent over the last year, according to the property website Zoopla.co.uk. Many of the properties are big detached houses with large gardens and unspoilt views of the countryside. Patrick Anketell-Jones, a local Conservative councillor for the area, said: ‘I have had no reports of destitution in the area. The top 10 postcodes in the UK where personal debt is recorded highest with the average amount of personal debt in that area per adult: . 1. Bath, BA1 9 - £2,311 . 2. London, EC1V 2 - £2,188 . 3.

Preston, PR7 7 - £1,355 . ‘I’ve never considered [debt] at problem in the ward.’ In a sign of the wealth in the area - rather than the debt - BA1 9 is close to Beckford’s Tower, an 120-foot Neoclassical structure built in 1827 as a retreat for the writer William Beckford and to house his collection of art and books. He once said: ‘So I am growing rich, and mean to build towers.’ Danny Sacco, the manager of Lansdown Mazda, a new and second-hand motor dealership, said plenty of local people are buying cars from him. He sold 72 new cars last month, a record for March, and said the market is ‘buoyant.’ The majority of purchases are made using credit. Overall, the BBA’s report found the total amount of outstanding personal loan debt in the UK is currently £30billion. The two regions with the largest amount of personal loan debt, which excludes mortgages, are London, with £4.8billion, and the South, with £4.5billion. Some postcodes are not included in the research if the population is so low that the publication of the data would compromise somebody’s privacy. In a sign of the mortgages crippling many families, the total outstanding personal loan debt of £30billion is equal to the total amount of mortgage debt of homeowners in south-west London. The data is based on data from most banking giants, including Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, RBS Group, Santander UK, Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks as well as the building society, Nationwide.","Analysis of every postcode in UK found 'BA 1 9' in Bath has biggest debt .

"By . Simon Cable . Bleak future: Sir David Attenborough said big-budget programmes would lose funding . On and off screen, he has been responsible for some of the most enduring BBC programmes of the past 60 years. But Sir David Attenborough fears that quality programming could soon become an endangered species because of the huge rise in on-demand internet services and digital networks. The veteran wildlife presenter, who was controller of BBC2 in the 1960s, said the boom in satellite TV and online services such as Netflix – which has almost 50million subscribers – is leading a decline in viewing figures that will result in budget cuts. He fears that output such as . big-budget adaptations of Shakespeare plays will eventually only appear . on niche networks which don’t have mass audiences. Speaking at an event to mark the 50th anniversary of BBC Two, the 87-year-old was shown a series of clips highlighting its major cultural programmes, including a production of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar by the National Youth Theatre. The presenter of the renowned Life On Earth series said: ‘I think in another 25 years, or another fifty, that kind of stuff you see there…I don’t believe people will be producing Shakespeare. 'I really don't think they will, because the television audience is becoming split and split and split. ‘I saw figures the other day and Life . on Earth got 17million viewers on the first showing and has had hundreds of . millions since. 'You could sink money into making a production like that . because you know what’s going to happen. Acclaimed: Sir David with mountain gorillas in Life On Earth in 1979, after he was BBC2 Controller . A BBC impartiality review that gave . its coverage of the EU and immigration a clean bill of health was . ‘seriously flawed’, a report has found. Last year’s Prebble report – commissioned by the BBC Trust – found its . coverage was ‘broad and impressive’. But . a fresh study published by respected think-tank Civitas yesterday shed . doubt on its methodology, saying a series of basic errors meant it was . ‘not independent and not worth the paper it was printed on.’ Civitas . identified several flaws in the BBC report’s research methods and . questioned the independence of its author Stuart Prebble. The . 63-year-old – who is the former chief executive of ITV – has spent . years making programmes for the BBC through his independent production . company. It . said: ‘In particular, its analysis of output on BBC Radio 4’s Today . programme was severely limited because it monitored less than half of . the Today programme and then focused rigidly on the 7am to 8.30am block . and ignored Saturday’s broadcasts altogether.’ Yesterday, . Mr Prebble defended his report, saying: ‘I regard this as an . ill-founded smear and the authors should be ashamed of themselves.’ A . BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘We stand by the report and the conclusions . that the Trust drew from it, and we do not recognise this inaccurate . characterisation of it. ‘The . approach Stuart Prebble took in reaching his conclusions is consistent . with that taken by all previous authors of impartiality reports for the . Trust.’ ‘But every time you get another satellite on the air, you are diminishing the audience. You won’t get audiences of 17million again. 'So eventually you won’t get the budget to make those sorts of programmes.’ ‘So what will happen? Well, I suspect . that specific organisations will decide they are going to circulate . natural history programmes or Second Wold War documentaries, or operas . or Shakespeare in a different kind of way, and it won’t be available as . it is at the moment, and should be at the moment, to the universality . that comes from a licence.’ As Controller Sir David was . responsible for commissioning programmes such as Man Alive, Call My . Bluff, Chronicle, Life, One Pair of Eyes, The Old Grey Whistle Test and . Civilisation, a ground-breaking 13-part series on the history of Western . art. He later went on to present the world-renowned Life series for the BBC. Recent years has seen a huge increase in on-demand online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and LoveFilm Instant. Netflix now accounts for more than half the video streamed over the internet and has almost 50m subscribers. It now produces its own series like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Sir David’s comments were echoed by the BBC’s creative director Alan Yentob, who said: ‘The great thing about British television is that the traditions that broadcasting has emerged from are traditions of intelligence and inclusivity. ‘Those values have been shared by the whole of public broadcasting. Now we are living in a different world. This is a very tricky moment we are talking about. You’ve got Netflix, you’ve got Amazon, you’ve got what might seem like benign predators who are no longer as benign. ‘They’re all public companies now and they’ve got very vast pockets. ‘The BBC is about to do a huge Shakespeare season thanks to the licence fee, and the public consensus needs to support the idea of these things if you still want to see the kind of things that we have valued for a long, long time.’ It was earlier this year that the BBC announced it was closing youth-orientated arts channel BBC Three following a series of cost-saving measures. The channel will be broadcast only online from Autumn 2015.

"By . Julian Robinson . The BBC has allegedly spent £12,000 on a sofa for one of its studios, a whistleblower has claimed. The corporation reportedly footed the bill for a studio seat at the Points West regional newsroom studio in Bristol. It comes as the BBC looks to slash its total budget by 20 per cent, saving £250 million. Local BBC presenters Alex Lovell and David Garmston on the old red sofa that has now been replaced. It has been claimed by a whistleblower that the new seat cost £12,000 . A spokeswoman for the BBC declined to comment further on the purchase for ""commercial and confidentiality reasons"" but refused to dismiss it as untrue. But Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Licence fee payers will be rightly frustrated if the Beeb has shelled out so much for a new sofa. 'Taxpayers want their cash spent on quality programming, not lavish furniture. 'It's crucial that the BBC gets value for money as it's hard-pressed families footing the bill.' The new sofa is said to be long enough to seat eight people and sits alongside the newsreaders' desk. The previous sofa - said to seat only between two and three people - is over eight years old and has outlived two previous studio makeovers. It has now been moved to the lobby area of the BBC building in Bristol's Whiteladies Road. The outside of BBC Broadcasting House in Bristol. The £12,000 sofa is now believed to have been moved to the lobby area of the building in  Whiteladies Road . It is thought the new settee is designed to be long enough so a presenter can sit at one end with the interviewee at the other and enough space in between them for a TV projection. BBC bosses claim the new furniture is part of a revamp of the Bristol studio - but insiders say no other renovations have been made yet. A spokesperson said: 'We do not discuss studio equipment and programming costs, but we are always looking to give licence-fee payers the best value for money while ensuring wherever possible money goes into what is seen and delivered on-air. 'The BBC is on course to make £700m of savings annually by 2017.' The Points West team has also come under fire for sending two reporters to South Africa to cover the extradition of honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani, pictured with wife Anni Dewani, from Bristol . When pushed for a denial or confirmation, a spokeswoman added: 'That is the response. 'We are not able to discuss production costs or programming costs for commercial reasons or confidentiality reasons.' The corporation has come under fire for the apparently extravagant spend at a time when staff are being made redundant right across the state-funded programmer. Three years ago the BBC announced it was cutting its budgets by 20 per cent - saving an estimated £250 million in the process - and making an estimated 2,000 staff redundant. The local radio network bore the brunt of the cuts but Bristol also lost out on some programming as a result of the changes. Meanwhile, the Points West team has also come under fire for sending two reporters to South Africa to cover the extradition of honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani, from Bristol. Andrew Plant and Jon Kay were sent to Cape Town as part of the BBC-wide coverage. At the time, the rest of the BBC's South Africa news team were in Pretoria reporting on the Oscar Pistorius trial. The BBC defended the move by saying such a major story was too much for one reporter to cover for all BBC outputs.","Whistleblower claims £12,000 has been spent on new studio sofa .
