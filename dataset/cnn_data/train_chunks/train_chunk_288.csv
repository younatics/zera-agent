"(CNN) -- A teenage girl may have gotten lost in a cave looking for water, nearly 13,000 years ago. Naia, as she's known today, likely fell to her death in a deep, dark pit. Now, her remains are shining a light on the genetic heritage of what we believe are the first people in the Americas. Researchers have discovered Naia's bones in a pit in an underwater cave system in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Her skeleton, described in the journal Science this week, is one of the oldest of any humans found in the Americas. She comes from a group of ancient people anthropologists call Paleoamericans. Genetic analysis of her remains suggests that Naia is related to modern Native Americans. It's a clue to resolving the issue of whether the group we call Native Americans are indeed related to the first settlers of this land mass. This study promotes the view that ""Native Americans and Paleoamericans share a homeland,"" said James Chatters of Applied Paleoscience, who was the lead author of the study. That homeland is called Beringia, also called the Bering Land Bridge, that connected what is now Siberia and Alaska. The new research goes against the idea that the first Americans may have come over in separate migrations from Europe and Asia. Other genetic evidence from both modern Native Americans and ancient skeletons indicates that people of Siberia landed in eastern Beringia between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago, the study said. They seem to have moved south after 17,000 years ago. So how do we know who this girl was? Naia's genetic lineage was analyzed through mitochondrial DNA. This is genetic material that is passed from mothers to children, and is stored in the mitochondria, a part of a cell that is essential for energy production and is sometimes thought of as a ""power plant."" Scientists are able to characterize genetic lineages by looking at mitochondrial DNA. It's important to note, however, that this does not reveal as much information about a person's heritage as nuclear DNA, which is stored in the cell's nucleus and contains material from both parents. Researchers are planning to look at Naia's nuclear DNA also, Chatters said. Researchers found that the 12,000- to 13,000-year-old teenager's mitochondrial DNA belongs to Haplogroup D1, a category only found in the Americas these days but which originally came from an Asian lineage. Some South American populations today have this genetic signature: 29% of indigenous people of Chile and Argentina have it; so do 11% of Native Americans, said Deborah Bolnick, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin. Through her maternal line, the girl in the cave seems to have been related to modern Native Americans as well as their ancestors, Bolnick said. Why doesn't she look like Native Americans? But wait -- Naia's physical features are very different from that of modern day Native Americans. Flat, broad faces with flaring cheekbones, and short, round heads are typical of Native Americans, Chatters said. By contrast, Naia had an angular head, and a small, relatively narrow face. Naia's features are more similar to other ancient populations and isolated hunter-gatherer populations in such places as the Philippines, Chatters said. ""Paleoamericans -- those earliest people with the distinctive skull and facial features -- could have come from Siberia too,"" Bolnick said. ""It therefore seems more likely that differences between Paleoamericans and Native Americans today are due to evolutionary changes that occurred in Beringia and the Americas over the last 9,000 years."" Some scientists believe a population entered Beringia, became geographically isolated, and then experienced evolutionary changes in their mitochondrial DNA during several thousand years, Chatters said. From there, multiple migrations may have taken people out of Beringia and to the Americas. ""What this study is presenting for the first time is the evidence that Paleoamericans with those distinctive features can also be directly tied to the same Beringian source population as contemporary Native Americans,"" Bolnick said. Facial features may have evolved over time in response to such factors as changing climates and diets, Chatters said. Paleoamericans also have characteristics such as facial projection -- features such as mouth and eyes protruding from the skull -- that are related to aggression, a behavior that would be favorable in a migrating population, Chatters said. As groups settle down, however, docility tends to be advantageous. Why was Naia at the bottom of a pit? The near-complete skeleton, dated to between 12,000 and 13,000 years old, was discovered in a pit that lies in an underwater cave system in a crevice the jungle floor about five miles from the Caribbean Sea. Traversing through a flooded tunnel, divers discovered this chamber that was so dark it seemed to absorb their underwater lights, Alberto Nava of Bay Area Underwater Explorers said at a press conference. They called it Hoyo Negro, which means Black Hole in Spanish. ""The floor disappeared under us, and we could not see across to the other side. We pointed our lights down and to the sides. All we could see was darkness,"" said Nava, who is the co-director and lead diver for the Hoyo Negro Project. Nava's team found many of Naia's bones, as well as ""a small cranium laying upside down with a perfect set of teeth and dark eye sockets looking back at us."" They made this discovery in 2007. Most of the bones are still underwater, Chatters said. Scientists conducted the DNA analysis and age estimate based on one of Naia's wisdom teeth. ""Recently, to protect the skull and some bones damaged by unauthorized visitors, we recovered them from the cave, but studies of those pieces have not yet begun,"" he said. This cave site was probably dry until about 10,000 years ago, when it flooded because of glacial melting, researchers said. There is evidence from the way that the bones are distributed in the cave, and iron oxide on the walls, that it contained ""an ephemeral pool of water"" that may have been filled by storms, Chatters said. We may never know why Naia died, but Chatters said it looks like she took a great fall into the pit, fracturing her pelvis. She would not have entered the cave system through a crevice in the jungle, as the divers did, but rather from a ground-level entrance, as the ""ground"" was lower than it is today. The name Naia comes from the Greek word for ""water nymph,"" researchers said. Even if we don't know what she called herself, further investigation may uncover more about her roots and life.

"(CNN) -- The stakes in this election go far beyond just who takes the oath of office in January. Each of us is faced with choices that will have huge ramifications in our nation for decades -- and the choice is not simply about Democrats versus Republicans or even Obama versus Romney. The real stakes are this: The political strategies that prove successful in this election will be replicated far into the future. Throughout this election cycle, we've seen hyperpartisan narratives resonate more than facts, total opposition embraced as a congressional tactic, and unprecedented dark money flow through our airwaves in an avalanche of negative ads. If those forces are rewarded, we'll see much more of them from both parties going forward. They will become the new normal. Opinion: Vote, damn it! If they are rejected, it may inspire a necessary recalibration and a renewed focus on finding ways to work together in Washington. This won't be just because it's the right thing to do; it will be because it is what is seen as practical and politically expedient. When President Obama took office, the fiscal crisis was in full effect, but our nation was briefly united after the 2008 election. Then the partisan media started to try to repolarize the nation for their profit. A relentless drumbeat of demonizing the president gave rise to all sorts of dark conspiracy theories, driven by the conviction that the first African-American president of the United States was somehow un-American. Hating Obama became a profitable cottage industry, with the publication of at least 89 different obsessively anti-Obama books -- more than twice the number that were directed at President George W. Bush by the end of his first term. Unhinged ideas seeped perilously close to the mainstream, to the point that the gap between partisan narrative and actual facts seems cavernous and finds fellow Americans divided beyond reason. This has real civic cost. A president who has presided over a doubling of the stock market is called socialist or even communist. A president who ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden is seen by some as secret Islamist-sympathizer. And perhaps most important, a president whose actual record leads respected nonpartisan political scientists at the VoteView blog to say ""President Obama is the most moderate Democratic president since the end of World War II"" is instead seen as a far-left liberal. A reality check is overdue. This hyperpartisan reality distortion field has impacted Congress as well. In the past, we've achieved a great deal with divided government -- ranging from the Marshall Plan, to the interstate highway system, to the achievements of the Reagan administration, to welfare reform and the turning of deficits into surpluses under President Bill Clinton and then-Speaker Newt Gingrich. But the current congressional environment has led to division and dysfunction, Super Committee fails and justifiably low congressional approval rates. Too many conservative members of Congress took Rush Limbaugh's 2009 anti-Obama admonition -- ""I hope he fails"" -- to heart. They argued that confrontation rather than cooperation with the new president was the best strategy. Thanks to Obama's unwise overdelegation to congressional Democrats on the stimulus bill, their approach was validated, and so an economic recovery effort that was one-third tax cuts passed along stark partisan lines. A pattern was established. President Barack Obama: My vision for America . An individual mandate-driven health care bill, based on proposals from the conservative Heritage Foundation implemented by Mitt Romney in Massachusetts, was not praised as policy triangulation -- taking a Republican approach to achieve a Democratic goal -- but called an unconstitutional gallop toward socialism. Rational debate stopped when talk of ""death panels"" started taking hold. And so health care reform became the first major piece of social legislation to pass along stark partisan lines. Even onetime bipartisan legislation was no longer embraced by Congress. For example, Obama's proposed jobs bill was almost entirely composed of what had been bipartisan proposals -- but it was considered DOA on Capitol Hill. The debt ceiling was used to hold America's full faith and credit hostage, with disastrous results, including the downgrading of our AAA credit rating. The source of much congressional dysfunction is the now-routine use of the filibuster by the Senate, making a supermajority of 60 votes necessary for meaningful action. As a point of historical perspective: In the eight years that Republican Dwight Eisenhower was president, from 1953 to 1961, the filibuster was used only two times. In the four years that Barack Obama has been president, the filibuster has been invoked more than 200 times by Senate Republicans. Add to this unhealthy civic mix the unprecedented amount of money flowing into this election -- expected to exceed $6 billion total. The most troubling aspect is the rise of dark money, the abuse of tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations to hide donors while flooding the airwaves with negative ads. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, spending from these nondisclosing groups has passed $200 million in this election -- more than every other election cycle over the past 20 years combined -- and 88% of the ads airing now from outside groups are negative. Just three groups -- the Karl Rove-founded Crossroads GPS, the Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- account for more spending than the next 17 outside groups combined. This makes a mockery of post-Citizens United promises about unlimited money being combined with unprecedented disclosure, and the net impact is chilling: This is perilously close to what trying to buy an election looks like. All this matters, because if outside money spent on negative ads can indeed sway an election, we will see much more of it in the future. But if partisan billionaires believe that their money has been wasted, it will help rein in such efforts going forward. We need to stop the cycle of incitement in our politics, where every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. In the closing weeks of this campaign, Romney has been promising that he will bring bipartisanship back to Washington. But simply slapping on a new slogan won't solve these underlying problems. Mitt Romney: My vision for America . If Romney is elected president, Democrats will likely decide to follow the apparently successful path of the Republicans in recent years -- play to the base with fear-mongering claims, demonize the new president from Day One, and obstruct his agenda in Congress. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, has already announced that he will not work with a President Romney, taking a page from his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, who pledged that making President Obama a one-term president was his No. 1 priority. Republicans will complain, but they will have their own precedent to thank. The result will be all-but-guaranteed gridlock and division over the next four years. If Obama is re-elected, it will send the message that all the hyperpartisan distortions, the intensely ideological congressional obstruction and the flood of dark money didn't work. Republicans will have to confront the fact that these extreme tactics backfired by alienating the moderate majority of Americans (and interestingly, Obama currently leads among moderate voters in key swing states like Ohio by nearly 20 points). This will alter the landscape of the next Congress and shift the incentives back toward working together on a more bipartisan basis. It might even help re-center the Republican Party going forward, something I would sincerely like to see because it would be good for our democracy. America needs to break this fever of hyperpartisanship. The day after the election, we will have to start healing as a nation. Members of Congress will be confronted with a fiscal cliff and serious questions about how to deal with taxes, spending, the deficit and the debt. If they feel that extremism and obstruction have been punished by the voters, they will find a way to work together. If either party feels it has achieved an ideological mandate, it will be tempted to play chicken with the fiscal cliff. The stakes are so high because they cut to the heart of the American experiment. We cannot continue to allow extreme partisan distortions to define our policy debates and paralyze our capacity for constructive self-government. We need Washington to get the message that I've heard from swing voters so often on the CNN Battleground Bus Tour -- stop fighting and start fixing. Find a way to work together, especially on our long-term economic problems. That means both parties agreeing to compromise on issues of taxes, spending and entitlement reform -- a balanced bipartisan plan to deal with deficits and debt. It will require putting the national interest ahead of all partisan special interests -- and we won't be able to do that until this fever breaks. Washington is looking to your lead at the voting booth. These are the stakes. Now it is your decision. Go out and vote on November 6. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Election 2012 will be a test that determines future of American politics .

"(CNN) -- The Richard Nixon I knew had almost nothing to do with the Richard Nixon as portrayed in most media. The Richard Nixon I knew was a man who had served his country honorably as Dwight Eisenhower's vice president at the height of the Cold War, when Eisenhower kept us at peace for eight years -- with Nixon's help -- only to have the 1960 election stolen away from him by handsome, rich John F. Kennedy's fraud at the polls in Chicago. Nixon had endured eight years of seeing the country disintegrate into chaos in the streets and an endless, hopeless war in Vietnam under a genuinely great but very misled president, Lyndon Johnson. When Nixon won in 1968, he embarked on a presidency in which he never once had control of both houses of Congress. He faced an endless bitter assault from the media and from the so-called intellectuals -- the ""pointy-headed"" intellectuals, as George Wallace aptly called them . Nevertheless, he ended the war in Vietnam, brought home the POWs and calmed the wild streets. More than that, he saved Israel when it was threatened with annihilation by its neighbors, sending a massive airlift of arms to Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Nixon gave unequivocal support to Israel: Johnson could not have cared less about its fate. Nixon opened relations with Red China that greatly sobered up Russia and allowed the U.S. to become the world's dominant power and peacekeeper for a generation. This was the key event in ending the Cold War. By ""encircling"" the USSR and signaling that if Leonid Brezhnev began a war against either the United States or China, he would face a dreaded two-front war, he showed Russia that its hopes of global domination were not going to work. To soothe matters with the still extremely dangerous Russian bear, he even signed a strategic arms limitation treaty with the Soviets. His goal, as he often explained to me and others on his staff, was to create ""a generation of peace."" He did it. He gave us the longest sustained period of peace since World War II. When the Russians were kicked out of Afghanistan -- just as we are about to be -- the encircled Russian domination machine simply ran out of gas. Will it revive? No. But it is a menace anyway. Nixon was tortured, abused, beat up by the Beautiful People, but through it all, above all, he was a peacemaker, a trait he inherited from his Quaker mother. If we no longer have to fear Russian ICBMs screaming out of hell to start nuclear war, we can thank the shade of Richard Nixon. He was startlingly progressive in domestic affairs as well. He created the Environmental Protection Agency. He sent up to Congress the first proposal for universal health care. I know. I wrote the message sending it to Congress -- where Teddy Kennedy promptly killed it. He proposed a national energy policy far greener than anyone had ever imagined a conservative would go. Again, Congress killed it. In his personal relations with me and with my father, who was his chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and with my mother, his most devout fan and a friend and admirer of Pat Ryan Nixon as well, he was the soul of kindness, concern and politesse. He brought up two of the most wonderful women on the planet, Julie and Tricia. He was a wit and a trustworthy confidant. Why did the media hate him so much? I have always thought it was because he was vulnerable and showed it when attacked. He did not have the tough hide of a Reagan or an Obama. Like the schoolyard bullies they are, the media went after him for his vulnerability. But let's look at him with fresh eyes. Unlike LBJ, he did not get us into a large, unnecessary war on false pretenses. Unlike JFK, he did not bring call girls and courtesans into the White House or try to kill foreign leaders. Unlike FDR, he did not lead us into a war for which we were unprepared. He helped with a coverup of a mysterious burglary that no one understands to this day. That was his grievous sin, and grievously did he answer for it. But to me, Richard Nixon will always be visionary, friend and peacemaker. And I will never turn my back on a peacemaker.","The Richard Nixon whom Ben Stein knew wasn't anything like the way media portrayed him .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Sony looked to capitalize on its early sales lead in the console wars at its Electronic Entertainment Expo media briefing on Monday, repeating the mantras of ""first,"" ""better"" and ""only on"" as selling points for its PlayStation 4. Hours earlier, rival Microsoft stuck strictly to games for the Xbox One in a similar briefing. But Sony's presentation included new hardware and non-gaming services as well as promises of exclusive titles and titles that will launch on PlayStation before coming to other consoles. Andrew House, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, said the company aims to make the PS4 ""the best place to play."" Max Parker, a video game columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, noted that the more inclusive presentation was a bit of a switch with Microsoft, which last year focused on the Xbox's entertainment potential while, in some eyes, giving games less than their due. ""Sony pulled a 180 and switched roles,"" Parker said. ""Last year, they didn't talk very much about the (services and non-game content)."" He added, though, that ""there was a lot of good content, games-wise"" to go along with the extras this year. One of the biggest crowd reactions of the presentation came when ""Little Big Planet 3"" was announced for November. Sackboy, the lead character in the puzzle-platform series, will get three new friends to join him in amazing new worlds, as well as the 8.7 million levels created by current ""Little Big Planet"" players. And a never-before-seen trailer, created using the PS4, announced that ""Uncharted 4: A Thief's End,"" will be arriving for the console in 2015. On the hardware front, Sony announced that PlayStation TV will be available in the United States later this year. Already available in Japan as PlayStation Vita TV, the $99 micro-console will allow users to play more than 1,000 games on their television and stream music and video from sites like Hulu. A new ""Glacier White"" PlayStation 4 also will be released later this year, bundled with the action shooter ""Destiny,"" which will be released in September. The surprise success of the PlayStation Camera -- a $60 add-on to the console -- and Project Morpheus, Sony's attempt at a virtual-reality headset, also got mentions. Other announcements included a partnership with YouTube that will let players automatically upload video to the site, a video-streaming service (PlayStation Now) and two pieces of original entertainment -- a movie based on the ""Ratchet & Clank"" series and an animated series based on the graphic novel ""Powers."" ""The thirst for innovation at PlayStation is tremendous,"" said Shawn Layden, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America. PlayStation 4 sales jumped out to a quick lead over the Xbox One when both consoles were released in November, and it has outsold Microsoft's offering for four straight months this year. It's worth noting, though, that both are outselling their last-generation counterparts to date, and that PlayStation is currently available in more countries than the Xbox.","Sony presses advantage with exclusive, early PlayStation 4 titles .

"(CNN) -- The FBI hopes a $20,000 reward will help solve the 2009 slaying of James Kitterman, a government contractor who was found dead in his car in Baghdad's Green Zone. Kitterman was a 60-year-old Texan who owned Peregrine Eyes, a construction company that was building a helipad at the U.S. Consulate, according to the FBI. He was last seen alive on the evening of May 21, 2009, inside the Green Zone, a high-security district. Local security guards reported seeing Kitterman's car leave the compound at 11 p.m. that night. His body was found the next day in the Green Zone. Andrew Ames, a spokesman for the FBI, said Friday that ""the manner in which the murder was carried out has not been released."" CNN reported in June 2009 that Kitterman was found bound, blindfolded and fatally stabbed. His now-defunct company had about 45 employees that were primarily from the United States and Philippines, the FBI said. The agency has distributed posters in Arabic and Tagalog announcing the award money for any information leading to the arrest of those responsible, because it believes a former employee may have some clues. ""The investigation itself has included hundreds of interviews during the past five years with potential witnesses in the U.S., Iraq, Afghanistan and the Philippines, but despite that we still need the public's help,"" the FBI said. The reward is for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the death, the agency said.","Agency wants help in solving a 2009 killing in Baghdad's Green Zone .

"Lac-Megantic, Quebec (CNN) -- The head of the railway whose runaway train devastated a small Quebec town cast doubt on his engineer's story Wednesday as he arrived to face insults from survivors and harsh questions from reporters. Edward Burkhardt said the engineer has been suspended without pay and faces a criminal investigation by Canadian authorities. He said the engineer reported to railroad managers that he set 11 hand brakes on the train cars before they broke away from their engines, but ""I think it's questionable whether he did."" ""Our general feeling is now that is not true,"" said Burkhardt,chairman of the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway. The engineer had worked for the MM&A for ""many years"" and ""had a completely clear safety record up until Saturday,"" Burkhardt said. Most of the 73-car train derailed in the center of Lac-Megantic early Saturday, and tank cars full of oil exploded and burned. Quebec provincial authorities have found 20 bodies, and 30 more are missing ""and most probably dead,"" Quebec Provincial Police Capt. Michel Forget said Wednesday. Graphic: Runaway train devastates Canadian town . Authorities have said those still missing may have been vaporized by the resulting inferno. The number of those unaccounted for dropped from the 45 reported earlier Wednesday, and Forget said the numbers could fluctuate as the investigation continues. The railway cars strewn throughout the center of the town 6,000 have barely stopped smoldering, and the area around them remained cordoned off Wednesday afternoon. Hundreds of evacuees, mostly older residents, were still taking shelter in a local school, said Myrian Marotte, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Red Cross. In the beginning, there were 2,000 people who were forced to flee their homes, Marotte said . ""Everyone here knows someone who was evacuated,"" she said. Nevertheless, she added, ""You see a lot of solidarity and resilience."" A fair bit of anger was also on display as Burkhardt arrived Wednesday afternoon. Two middle-aged men shouted at him as he spoke with reporters, calling him an obscene name and challenging him to walk into the heart of the disaster. One of the men, Pierre L'Heureux, told CNN he knew at least half the people who were dead or missing. ""They should put that guy in prison,"" L'Heureux said. ""He's a murderer ... he should be in prison."" Burkhardt also was likely to face a chilly reception from Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche. Burkhardt said he was trying to arrange meetings with the mayor, who would not tell reporters Wednesday whether she would meet with him. Burkhardt said he felt ""personally, absolutely rotten"" about the crash and said his railroad would ""stand up to our responsibility."" As chairman, ""I guess it's my role to collect all this criticism,"" he said. ""We think we have plenty of responsibility,"" he said. But whether the company bears ""total responsibility"" for the crash is ""yet to be determined,"" he added. The cars broke free from an MM&A train as it was parked in the nearby town of Nantes early Saturday, plunging down a seven-mile incline into Lac-Megantic. Firefighters in Nantes had been called to put out a fire on the train before the cars broke away, and Burkhardt said those firefighters may have shut down systems on the train's five locomotives that contributed to the disaster. ""We felt this probably had an important part to play in this tragedy,"" he said. The fire department in Nantes has rejected the notion. The engineer had parked the train and set hand brakes on all five engines and then checked into a hotel for the night. Firefighters reported the blaze to a track maintenance man, who alerted the company to the incident, Burkhardt said. The engines and nine other cars remained behind when the rest of the train broke away sometime later. They stopped a quarter of a mile away from their original parking spot in Nantes. Police: Evidence criminal act may have led to train crash . Investigators have asked fire crews to stop spraying down the wreckage to preserve as much of the remaining evidence as possible. Quebec police spokesman Benoit Richard said Wednesday, ""We are no longer treating this as just an accident."" Some of the evidence led investigators to believe a ""criminal act"" may have contributed to the train crash, Forget said Tuesday. But Forget said authorities would lay no blame until the investigation shows exactly what happened. All businesses and factories in the affected region that are able were reopening Wednesday morning, Roy-Laroche said. She said the Red Cross would begin distributing vouchers to those returning home for food and other essential items, with the funds for the vouchers donated by people in the community and businesses in the region. The mayor urged tourists not to cancel their reservations in the area, noting that some 300,000 people visit the region between May and October every year. And she thanked people from around the world who sent messages in the aftermath of the tragedy. ""All these messages give us the strength to face this catastrophe,"" she said. Quebec Premier Pauline Marois said the provincial government would provide $25 million in emergency assistance immediately, with another $25 million to help with reconstruction efforts. ""It's small comfort, we know,"" Marois said. But she said the government hopes rebuilding will become ""a mobilizing force"" for the town. Tuesday, some 1,200 residents were allowed to return to their homes in the area. Among them was Michel Gagnon, who was eating lunch Wednesday on his patio, a few blocks from the edge of the cordon. Gagnon said Lac-Megantic's downtown had lost everything, but within a few years, ""everything will be back up."" CNN's Paula Newton, Ben Brumfield, Holly Yan, Umaro Djau, Jonathan Mann, Pierre Meilhan and Deanna Hackney contributed to this report.","At least 20 dead, 30 missing and ""most probably"" dead, police say .

"(CNN) -- Two billion dollars to buy the Los Angeles Clippers??? Come on, now. You might pay two billion to buy a Picasso but not to buy Dogs Playing Poker. You might pay two billion to buy a yacht but not the USS Minnow. You might pay two billion to buy the Los Angeles DODGERS -- and somebody not long ago did -- but not to buy Hollywood's basketball-playing comedy club. Would you? Uh, well, if your name is Steve Ballmer, and you've got money to burn, and the next goal on your bucket list is to own a basketball team, and you're the kind of guy who loves this game so much that you've even got ""Ball"" in your surname, $2 billion is the price you're prepared to pay, even if it means buying the Worst Franchise in the History of Professional Basketball. S-Ball, are you SURE about this? You want to bounce these numbers off your banker? Two billion ... with a B? Yep, apparently the hoop-happy Mr. Ballmer, who made much of his money by being one of the big brains at Microsoft, was in earnest when he told Shelly Sterling, semi-estranged wife of the 100% strange Donald Sterling, he would give her $2 billion for her National Basketball Association team, assuming it's for sale. Oh, and assuming it's hers to sell. Not so fast, says Mr. Sterling to Mrs. Sterling through his attorney, Maxwell Blecher, giving every indication that he intends to cling to his ownership of the Clippers by any means necessary, even if it means filing a lawsuit against the NBA for a not-exactly-peanuts ONE billion dollars. Disgraced, disgusted, dysfunctional (delusional?) Donald is deadly serious. OK, so I said some bad stuff. OK, so my ""girlfriend"" got me on tape, blithering and blathering about black people and do I want her to bring them to my team's basketball games and all? OK, so I had to give up that nice NAACP award they were going to give me, and that comedian Conan O'Brien went on TV and said, ""Instead, they're giving him the 'Reason We Still Need an NAACP Award.' "" LZ Granderson: The hypocrisy of L.A. NAACP . That doesn't mean I, Don, am giving up my Clipper ship without a fight. OK, so Steve Ballmer, the ex-CEO of that Microsoft computer business, is making a whopping offer of $2 billion for my basketball guys? Well, I may not know a laptop from a lap dance, but I do not intend to bail on my Clippers just quite yet, NBA fans! You can't miss me if I don't go away! A couple billion dollars for a basketball team might not be such a shocker if that team were, say, the Los Angeles Lakers or the Boston Celtics, organizations with a long history of success, a loyal fan base and a general reputation for integrity and respectability. They are the Bentleys and Rolls-Royces of this particular market, whereas the Clippers are the Ford Pintos, the flops, the lemons, the clunkers that catch fire. Number of NBA championships for the Clippers? Zero. Number of appearances in the NBA Finals for the Clippers? Zero. Number of people you have met who said they want to see just one Clipper championship before they die? Zero. Oh, maybe Billy Crystal said something like that in his life, because (a) he is a comedian and a very funny guy, and (b) he happens to be one of the few people from Planet Hollywood who has been true-blue to the Clippers since practically the beginning, through one dog of a season after another, through thin and thin. 700 Sundays? Was that the name of Billy's hit Broadway show? Well, this poor fellow has probably sat through 700 Clipper Days, which makes him one of the most magnificent (or most masochistic) sports fans in history in my book. Some of their season records since the Clippers have been playing in L.A.: . 31-51, 32-50, 12-70, 17-65, 21-61, 30-52, 31-51 ... Brief pause for a slightly better season or two, followed by: . 27-55, 17-65, 29-53, 36-46, 17-75, 9-41, 15-67 ... You get the idea. It is true, amazingly, that the Clippers of late have become a much better team. They make the playoffs. They have Blake Griffin and Chris Paul. They do not trip over their own shoelaces as often as before. But $2 billion worth? No way. Opinion: Cuban is no Sterling . I used to go to Clipper games once in a while, just to break the monotony of going to Laker games all the time and seeing how GOOD basketball is played. I used to go to garden parties at Donald and Shelly Sterling's home in Beverly Hills, where we would eat and drink and have a laugh about the Bad Old Days being behind this team forever because the Clippers were about to get some newer, better players and become, you know, what's that word they like to use about other teams? Oh, yeah: Winners! And did they win? Nahhhhh. I remember the season of 1994. The Clippers lost their first 16 games. I mean, when your team's record in the standings is 0-16, you could make a case that any five tall people with tickets in the stands could beat you. Loy Vaught, one of the Clip players at that time, said one day, ""I have this picture in my head of a big headline screaming, 'Worst Team Ever,' and then they have a picture of our team underneath it, and we're all sitting there smiling."" You wouldn't have given two HUNDRED dollars for that team. Sterling bought them in San Diego for the nice 1982 price of $12 million and moved them to Los Angeles, where they established themselves immediately as the slowest guns in the West. I mean, some sports fans think of bad teams like the Cubs as lovable losers, but the Clippers weren't lovable, just laughable. They were regulars in Johnny Carson's and Jay Leno's monologues. They were punchlines. And still are, more because of their owner than their play on the court. Craig Ferguson, another of the late-night TV comedians, said after word of Ballmer's $2 billion offer for the Clippers got out, ""Donald Sterling paid only $12 million to buy the Clippers. This deal is very uncomfortable for the former owner because it puts him in the black."" Race-related jokes abound while racially insensitive remarks by the man himself got Sterling in this fix in the first place. The NBA wants him to sell the team. His own players want him to sell the team. His own wife wants him to sell the team. Just about everybody except Donald Sterling wants Donald Sterling to sell the team. This guy has all the popularity of a termite in a lumber camp. Will he sell it? Will he give in and go away? That remains to be seen, because what Sterling says and Sterling does are not the kinds of things ordinary people say and do. Offering $2 billion for a middling sports team is also something a normal person doesn't normally do. So, really, what would somebody like a Ballmer offer if, say, the New York Yankees baseball team ever did come up for sale? A trillion? OK, a trillion-one, but not a penny more.","Ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer offered $2 billion to buy the Clippers .

"(CNN) -- The United States will deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast as part of efforts to enhance the nation's ability to defend itself from attack by North Korea, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Friday. Still relatively new in his post, the Pentagon chief told reporters that 14 additional interceptors to be installed by 2017 would bring the total to 44. It is part of a package of steps expected to cost $1 billion, officials said. ""The reason that we are doing what we are doing and the reason we are advancing our program here for homeland security is to not take any chances, is to stay ahead of the threat and to assure any contingency,"" Hagel said. North Korea says it's the victim of 'intensive' cyberattacks . Friday's move came after North Korea recently threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack on South Korea and the United States in response to stepped-up U.N. Security Council sanctions over its latest nuclear test last month. In December, North Korea successfully launched a long-range rocket for the first time under what the United States and other Western nations say was the guise of putting a satellite into orbit. Moreover, Pentagon officials said they became concerned about a mobile missile spotted in a parade last April. The KN-08 missile can be moved around the country and hidden, making it harder to detect compared to a missile on a launch pad. ""We believe the KN-08 does have the range to reach the United States,"" said Adm. James Winnefeld. North Korea also said last week it was nullifying the joint declaration on the de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. One of the country's top generals, according to published reports, claims Pyongyang has nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that are ready to be fired. While Hagel said the steps he announced were aimed at addressing the threat from North Korea and Iran, the focus was clearly on the potential for North Korea to some day follow through on its belligerent rhetoric. Iran also is believed to be continuing its efforts to develop nuclear weapon capability. Military and White House officials have said current U.S. missile defenses are adequate for the present level of threat, and President Barack Obama said in an interview with ABC News this week that he does not think North Korea can carry out a missile attack on the United States. ""They probably can't but we don't like the margin of error,"" Obama said. Hagel said Friday that U.S. missile defense systems in place provide protection from ""limited ICBM attacks,"" but added that ""North Korea, in particular, has recently made advances in its capabilities and has engaged in a series of irresponsible and reckless provocations."" However, Joe Cirincione of the Ploughshares Fund told CNN the planned expansion would only spend more money on a system that doesn't work to protect against a still unrealized North Korean threat. The existing missile defense system was ""deeply flawed,"" said Cirincione, whose foundation opposes nuclear weapons. He added that North Korea was ""years away from the ability to field a missile with a nuclear warhead that could hit the United States."" Hagel acknowledged a problem with the guidance system of missile interceptors and said further testing would occur this year. ""We certainly will not go forward with the additional 14 interceptors until we are sure that we have the complete confidence that we will need,"" Hagel said. ""But the American people should be assured that our interceptors are effective."" He also announced the military will work with Japan to increase radar capability to improve early warning and tracking of any missile launched from North Korea. North Koreans ready to 'rain bullets on the enemy' Asked how China would react to Hagel's announcement, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy James Miller said: "" I hope that they understand that we need to take steps to protect ourselves from potential threats from Iran and North Korea."" Part of the move announced by Hagel would involve reopening a missile field at Fort Greely, Alaska. In 2011, the Pentagon mothballed Missile Field 1, acting on direction from the Obama administration. Instead of permanently decommissioning it, the Defense Missile Agency placed it in a non-operational state. Pentagon officials testified at a budget hearing at the time that hardening and reactivating the six silos in Missile Field 1 would take two years and cost approximately $200 million. Pentagon officials testified then that ""there are no current threats dictating the need, nor plans to reactivate MF-1 in the future."" Republican congressional sources told CNN that they argued against the move. ""North Korea was doing all sorts of things we couldn't talk about publicly back then,"" said one GOP congressional official who is privy to intelligence briefings. ""The intelligence did not change. This is right where we expected North Korea to be. It takes about two years to order and take delivery of a new interceptor. That's why you have to be ahead of the threat."" In his State of the Union address last month, Obama said the United States would ""stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats."" Last week, Miller told the Atlantic Council that ""North Korea's shrill public pronouncements underscore the need for the U.S. to continue to take prudent steps to defeat any future North Korean"" intercontinental ballistic missile.

"(CNN) -- The Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics will feature designated public zones where protestors will be able to demonstrate, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced. IOC president Thomas Bach told reporters in Lausanne, Switzerland that organizers of Russia's first Winter Games had agreed to set aside areas similar to ones previously seen at Vancouver 2010 and the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing. ""We welcome the announcement of the [Sochi 2014] Organizing Committee that in Sochi there will be protest zones that will be established for people who want to demonstrate against something,"" said Bach, who replaced former president Jacques Rogge in September. ""(Protestors) will have the opportunity to do so in special protest zones. This was under discussion with the IOC for quite some time. It was announced to us today (Monday) and it will be located in Sochi."" Russia's suitability to host the Games has been called in to question following the country's introduction of anti-gay propaganda laws earlier this year. Russian officials have given assurances that the laws, which bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it, will not affect athletes or international tourists heading to the Games. On Monday, German president Joachim Gauck became the first major political figure to announce he will not be attending the Games. German newspaper Der Spiegel reported Gauck made the decision in protest against human rights violations and the harassment of Russian opposition political figures, although those claims were denied by his office. Gauck's fellow German Bach also questioned whether the president's decision was an act of protest. ""These kind of invitations are invitations from Governments to Governments and it is not up to the IOC to interfere with Government relations,"" said Bach. ""On a personal note I know President Gauck is a very straightforward man. If his decision would have any political motivation he would have said this. He cannot travel to the country without an earlier state visit. ""I know him a little bit. He knows how to use the words and if he had something to say he would have said it."" Another senior politician who will not be at the Black Sea resort is Viviane Reding, the European Union Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship. The Luxembourgian tweeted: ""I will certainly not go to Sotchi (sic) as long as minorities are treated the way they are under the current Russian legislation."" The IOC will warn athletes against taking part in any protests or demonstrations during the Games, which begin on February 7. Rule 50 in the Olympic Charter, which governs the Games, says: ''No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.'' ''We will give the background of the Rule 50, explaining the interpretation of the Rule 50 to make the athletes aware and to assure them that the athletes will be protected,'' Bach, who won a gold medal in fencing in 1976, told the Associated Press earlier this week. ''As an athlete you do not want to be confronted in the Olympic Village or the Olympic Stadium with any kind of political controversies.'' The IOC's stance has drawn the ire of tennis legend Martina Navratilova. The Czechoslovakian-born American, who came out as gay in 1981, criticized the IOC ""for really putting their head in the sand"" over the issue of Russian law. ""The IOC needs to stand up better for their athletes quite frankly,"" she told reporters at the United Nations, where she was speaking to mark International Human Rights Day. The IOC denied Navratilova's claims, saying it is against all forms and discrimination. It also said it has no place commenting on one country's laws. ""The IOC is 'standing up for athletes' by making sure that the Olympic Charter is respected by all participants at the Games and ensuring there will be no discrimination on grounds of race, sex or sexuality,"" the organization said in a statement given to CNN. ""We cannot intervene in the laws of individual countries -- we leave that to governments and the relevant international organizations such as the United Nations.""","Public protest zones will be set aside at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics .

"(CNN) -- A day after fall shrimping season began in the Gulf of Mexico and the state of Alabama reopened coastal waters to fishing, a major environmental watchdog group called for more stringent testing of seafood. The National Resources Defense Council released a statement Tuesday saying it sent letters to the Food and Drug Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, co-signed by almost two dozen Gulf coast groups, asking the government agencies to: . -- ensure that there is comprehensive monitoring of seafood contamination. -- ensure public disclosure of all seafood monitoring data and methods. -- ensure that fishery re-opening criteria protect the most vulnerable populations, including children, pregnant women and subsistence fishing communities. ""With the opening of shrimping season and near-daily reopening of fishing areas, seafood safety is a major issue right now,"" Dr. Gina Solomon, a senior scientist with the National Resources Defense Council, said in the statement. ""The government needs to show it is putting strong safety criteria and testing standards in place to ensure that the seafood from the Gulf will be safe to eat in the months and years to come."" Government officials including Vice President Joe Biden and Steve Murawski, NOAA's chief scientist for fisheries, have said in recent weeks that waters closed to fishermen after the worst oil spill in U.S. history would be reopened when officials could guarantee that seafood would pass tests for safety and edibility. The Deepwater Horizon disaster has hampered the seafood business across the Gulf as federal and state authorities put much of its waters off-limits amid safety concerns. With the once-gushing well capped on a temporary basis for more than a month now, NOAA and the Gulf states have begun lifting those restrictions -- but Louisiana shrimpers such as Anthony Bourgeoif say more needs to be done, and soon. ""It's open down over here with small shrimp, where it should be open over there where the big shrimp are,"" Bourgeoif said. ""Can't make no money with no little shrimp, man."" Bourgeoif said he planned to go out, because ""I ain't made nothing since the BP spill."" But he was concerned that inspectors might find signs of oil in his catch and make him dump it. ""So why go out there and catch it if they're just going to be dumped, and I ain't going to make no money off it?"" he asked. ""I've got to make money. I've got four grandkids I'm raising."" Deborah Long, a spokeswoman for the Southern Shrimp Alliance, said it will probably take days to assess what impact the spill has had on the Gulf catch. And while some shrimpers are eager to get back out, many are still working for the well's owner, BP, which has hired many boats to skim oil off the surface and lay protective booms along the shorelines. Two reports published Tuesday express concern about the lingering effects of oil spilled from the ruptured BP well into the Gulf of Mexico. A team from Georgia Sea Grant and the University of Georgia released a report that estimates that 70 to 79 percent of the oil that gushed from the well ""has not been recovered and remains a threat to the ecosystem,"" the university said in a release. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of South Florida have concluded that oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill may have settled to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico farther east than previously suspected -- and at levels toxic to marine life. Their study is to be released Tuesday, as well, but CNN obtained a summary of the initial conclusions Monday night. Initial findings from a new survey of the Gulf conclude that dispersants may have sent droplets of crude to the ocean floor, where it has turned up at the bottom of an undersea canyon within 40 miles of the Florida Panhandle, the University of South Florida team said. Plankton and other organisms at the base of the food chain showed a ""strong toxic response"" to the crude, and the oil could resurface later, according to researchers. ""The dispersant is moving the oil down out of the surface and into the deeper waters, where it can affect phytoplankton and other marine life,"" said John Paul, a marine microbiologist at the University of South Florida. The University of Georgia study ""strongly contradicts"" a 2-week-old government report saying that only 26 percent of the oil spilled from the well remains in the Gulf. ""That is just absolutely incorrect in the opinion of the scientists,"" Charles Hopkinson, the director of Georgia Sea Grant and a professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia, said Tuesday. The government said 4.9 million barrels -- 205.8 million gallons -- of oil leaked into the Gulf, and 74 percent of that oil had been collected or dispersed or had evaporated. Of the remaining 26 percent, ""much of that is in the process of being degraded and cleaned up on the shore,"" NOAA head Jane Lubchenco said August 4. But the Georgia study said the government's numbers were skewed for several reasons. First, because 800,000 barrels of oil were collected from the well before it could spill into the Gulf, the Georgia researchers said a total of 4.1 million barrels spilled into the water. But other factors mean more of that oil remains in the water, they said. In addition, the Georgia researchers used a fundamentally different definition of when oil is ""gone"" from the water. ""One major misconception is that oil that has dissolved into water is gone and, therefore, harmless,"" Hopkinson said. ""The oil is still out there, and it will likely take years to completely degrade."" And that oil is a lot harder to see than the huge clumps that dotted the Gulf's face like black and brown acne weeks ago. Samantha Joye, another professor of marine sciences at the University of Georgia, said that naturally dispersed oil was forming plumes in the water -- but ""not black, not brown, turbid sea water. You don't need a river of oil. It's oil that's dissolved in water."" Joye stressed that the government also had completely omitted a crucial component of the environmental pollution from its statistics. She said NOAA did not measure a third of the hydrocarbons because it did not measure gas emission, which she says are ""mostly still in water floating somewhere out there. ... Methane and other gases aren't being documented."" The spill began after an April 20 explosion on the offshore drilling platform Deepwater Horizon that killed 11 men. Two days later, the platform sank and started gushing oil into the Gulf before it was temporarily capped July 15. Thad Allen, the federal government's point man for the disaster, said Monday that attempts to permanently seal the well won't start until the latest potential problem is evaluated. Allen said engineers are now concerned about how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus, a ring that surrounds the casing pipe at the center of the well shaft. The ""timelines won't be known until we get a recommendation on the course of action,"" Allen said. Scientists began new pressure tests last week to gauge the effects of the mud and cement poured into the well from above during the ""static kill"" procedure that started August 3. From those pressure readings, they believe that either some of the cement breached the casing pipe and leaked into the annulus, or cement came up into the annulus from the bottom. The scientists believe that process may have trapped some oil between the cement and the top of the well, inside the annulus. Now, given that new variable, they're trying to figure out how to safely maintain the pressure within the well before launching the ""bottom kill,"" a procedure aimed at sealing the well from below. Allen said that when it comes to giving a green light to the bottom kill of the well through the nearby relief well, ""nobody wants to make that declaration any more than I do."" But the process ""will not start until we figure out how to manage the risk of pressure in the annulus."" ""We're using an overabundance of caution,"" he said. Allen said crews could remove the capping stack that sealed the oil in the well July 15and then replace the well's blowout preventer with one stored on the nearby Development Driller II in the Gulf. He said a new blowout preventer would be ""rated at much higher pressure levels than the annulus."" The other option would require BP to devise a pressure-relief device for the current capping stack. Once crews get their marching orders, it will take them about 96 hours to prepare, drill the final 50 feet of a relief well and intercept the main well. Then, the bottom kill process of plugging the well from below would begin.

"(CNN) -- In a twist of fate, the hosts' vanquishers became the heroes. Germany's Mario Götze's late, late strike made the difference in the final against Argentina, and his sublime goal prevented Brazil's neighbors and arch-rivals from lifting the trophy. The two finalists played out an entertaining match that left both the teams' fans and neutrals on the edge of their seats until almost the last kick of the game. Ultimately, all it lacked was the goals that these Brazil crowds have come to expect. Huge street party . The German capital came alive at the final whistle, with cars taking to the packed streets, waving German flags and scarves. Up to 500,000 fans packed into the huge fan zone in the center of the city, which was extended to 1.3 kilometer from the city's iconic Brandenburg Gate to accommodate the throngs of expectant fans. The city, whose mood wasn't dampened by the rain that fell throughout the match, hosted fans from all over the country, and beyond. The crowd in the Mitte district of Berlin erupted as Götze's goal went in on the 113th minute. The Bayern Munich star took Andre Schürrle's pass on his chest before displaying exquisite technique to volley the ball past Sergio Romero. The raucous street parties that followed were intermittently interrupted by celebratory car horns. It is the country's fourth World Cup, and its first as a unified Germany. Fans in the capital told CNN that they planned to party well into the early hours of the morning. Traveling fans celebrate in Rio . Outside Rio de Janerio's famous stadium, German fans were equally delirious. ""I feel very, very good, this is the best day of my life,"" a exuberant fan named Lars told CNN outside the stadium. ""We say before the Maracana, this is an amazing place, but I must say this is a fantastic day for my whole life."" Many of the Argentinian spectators at the Maracana in Rio left before the award presentation was over, distressed and angry at their team's narrow defeat. The heartbreak continues, at least for another four years, when the tournament will kick off again in Russia. In the end, though, no one could begrudge Germany their fourth World Cup. The team which triumphed also scored the highest number of goals, and produced arguably the most exciting football -- including that 7-1 blowout against the hosts in the semifinal. Throughout this match and the tournament, Germany coach Joachim Löw's men dominated possession and passing. Here, Germany weathered the storm of Argentina chances. ""Team spirit"" ""We've always played good football and I believe that over this tournament, over seven matches, we've shown the best performances of any of the teams here in Brazil,"" Löw said. ""The boys have also developed a team spirit which is unbelievable. ""It was good that we had played who could come on and make an impact, and [Mario] Götze is a miracle boy -- a boy wonder. I always knew he could decide the match."" Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella was magnanimous in defeat, and reserved special praise for his team, who made it to their first final in 24 years. ""My players were warriors and I congratulated them afterward because, beyond the sadness of the result, a coach must always assess his team's performance -- and I believe that was quite good,"" he said after the final whistle. ""They left everything on the pitch."" The German players marveled at a result which stemmed from many years work, which began under the previous coach, Jurgen Klinsmann. Lasting legacy . ""It is unbelievable,"" German keeper Manuel Neuer, who also picked up the tournament's Golden Glove award for best goalkeeper, told German football magazine Kicker. ""The team has done superbly, not only the players, but also the team behind the team. At some point we will stop celebrating, but we will always stand up again with a smile."" The feeling of incredulity was echoed by his teammate, captain Philipp Lahm, who lifted trophy in front of thousands of fans in Rio, alongside ten world leaders, including the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel. ""It's unbelievable what we have achieved,"" said the Bayern Munich defender. ""We improved throughout the tournament and didn't get down when things didn't always go our way. ""We just stuck to our path and at the end we're standing here as world champions. It's an unbelievable feeling. The team stayed calm and patient, we knew that we had something left at the end."" Positive press . The world's sports media praised the German victory, with Andy Brassell of Bleacher Report UK tweeting, ""Germany deserving winners, on the night and overall. Thoroughly satisfying final between two really good sides, though."" CBS' Jason La Canfora tweeted his agreement. ""Amazing tourney for Germany. We'll (sic) deserved. Began by thrashing Portugal and ended by beating both South American giants. Best team won."" Lionel Messi, named Golden Ball winner for an outstanding tournament, couldn't fulfill his destiny in the final. Plagued by comparisons with that other Argentine great, Diego Maradona, Messi couldn't replicate his usual form in this match. However, Sabella dismissed suggestions that this left him short of Maradona's achievements. ""He's already an all-time great,"" he said. ""He's very tired after a long season."" Coping with loss . Argentina's Javier Mascherano, who kept his team's hopes alive with a heroic, last-ditch tackle on Arjen Robben during the semifinal against the Netherlands, said that the pain of losing was ""immense."" The teary-eyed vice-captain, who has likely seen his last World Cup finals, said that while his team had the lion's share of chances, they couldn't convert them. ""We wanted to win this for the people of Argentina, for those who came here to support us, but we lost. ""We have represented our country the best we could, though. We have to lift our heads despite the pain. We gave everything we could out there. ""And we only had to last another five minutes at the end. We just didn't have that little bit of luck that you need in a final."" Bizarre moments at the World Cup final . Four takeaways from World Cup 2014 .

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN)  -- A jury Thursday found that former college professor Ward Churchill, who referred to victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks as ""little Eichmanns"" in an essay, was wrongfully terminated by the University of Colorado, according to a court official. Ward Churchill was dismissed as a professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder in 2007. But the jury, which deliberated for a day and a half after a trial that began March 9, awarded Churchill only $1, the minimum they could award while still finding in Churchill's favor, according to Robert McCallum, public information officer for Colorado's 2nd Judicial District Court. While an ethnic studies professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Churchill came under national scrutiny for a 2002 essay entitled, ""Some People Push Back: On the Justice of Roosting Chickens,"" which criticized U.S. foreign policy. In a reference to Nazi leader Adolf Eichmann, the Gestapo officer who was one of the chief architects of the Holocaust, Churchill referred to victims of the World Trade Center attacks ""little Eichmanns."" Churchill argued the victims were ""a technocratic corps at the very heart of America's global financial empire."" Churchill's essay drew little notice until an 1,800-student college in upstate New York invited him to take part in a 2005 forum on prisons and Native American rights. The invitation was rescinded after criticism from then-New York Gov. George Pataki, then-Colorado Gov. Bill Owens and hundreds of relatives of those killed in the attacks created a media firestorm. Churchill was fired in 2007. Churchill argued during the trial that he was fired from his tenured position for expressing politically unpopular, but constitutionally protected, views. The university argued in the trial that he was not fired for his political views but rather for sloppy academic work. During the trial, the university presented several examples of what university officials claimed were cases of plagiarism in his research. District Court Chief Judge Larry J. Naves has given both sides 30 days to present motions before he rules on whether Churchill will get his job back or will receive back pay. University of Colorado at Boulder Interim Chancellor Philip P. DiStefano released this statement on the university's Web site, saying: ""While I am disappointed by the jury's decision, I am still confident that the process we used to review allegations of research misconduct was appropriately applied in this case. The university attorneys will evaluate the next steps in the legal process. It is too early to comment on how the judge's final decision might impact the campus, as that decision has not yet been rendered."" Calls to the office and cell phone of Churchill's attorney were not immediately returned.","Jury: Ward Churchill wrongfully terminated as University of Colorado professor .

"(CNN) -- This week, NATO suspended all civilian and military cooperation with Russia. NATO's top general said that 40,000 Russian troops are in a high state of readiness and could strike Ukraine within a few days. The world is watching. Will Vladimir Putin take territory from Ukraine, again? Before Putin annexed Crimea on March 18, not too many observers thought that he was seriously going to grab a piece of Ukraine. Maybe it's just another political game for him -- all talks and nothing more. After all, Russia is legally bound by the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, an agreement signed originally by the Russia Federation, the United States and Britain. This document is an important part of the world's nuclear non-proliferation pact. It secures sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for its non-nuclear status. At the time of the agreement, Ukraine had the world's third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons. That's why when Russian nationalists began saying Crimea should be a part of Russia, few imagined that would become true. Putin can be iron-fisted and harsh, but he has shown respect for international treaties. During his press conference on March 4, when Putin was asked if Russia was considering annexing Crimea, he said no. Then something changed. When the referendum was pushed forward to March 16, it was amended to include the option of Crimea becoming a part of Russia. What happened? Is Putin just out of touch with reality, as German leader Angela Merkel once said? This would be an easy explanation for Russia's takeover of Crimea. But I suspect that Putin wants to create a new reality, one in which a breakup with the West is no longer viewed as a potential drawback, but rather, a smart and savvy move. In Putin's new world order, existing institutions do not matter anymore: Neither the G8 nor the U.N. Security Council. What are they going to do? Suspending Russia from G8 membership isn't going to scare Putin. The United States, Britain and Canada are upset that Russia has breached the Budapest Memorandum, but so what? Putin's approval rating has increased, his political oppositions are split, and many Russians support the return of Crimea. Russia has more territory now, and there's been no significant side effect. Moreover, Putin wants more control over the Russian elite and their money. Back in 2003, the wealthiest of the Russian oligarchs, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was suddenly arrested and served over 10 years in prison -- mostly because he was aggressively sponsoring different opposition parties and planning to run for president. Putin, who himself became president of Russia partly because of heavy contributions from oligarchs in his first presidential campaign, knows that the only thing that can defeat him is huge money. So he spent the last decade turning himself into a very rich man and making sure that he owns more resources than any potential competitor. Being an oligarch in Russia is great -- as long as you don't get involved with politics. The regulations are strict and the transactions are traceable. The oligarchs know the rules: When they want to have access to their money in Russia, they get out of Putin's way. Certainly, after 2003, no one really dared to try to compete with him. They can just look at Khodorkovsky as an example. What worries Putin is money from abroad that would leak through the borders easily. That money is harder to keep track of. Putin has long insisted that the country's new elite should bring money back to Russia. But the Russian oligarchs have been spending their money outside of Russia -- by sending their children to Western schools, buying up homes in Manhattan, or going on shopping sprees in neighboring European countries. The capital flight from Russia has steadily increased in the past years, reaching over $60 billion in 2013. Now, every Russian oligarch has to decide either to leave the country and lose access to its endless resources, or bring all the money back. Crimea gave Putin exactly what he desired -- an opportunity to build a financial iron curtain between Russia and the West. And now that some of the elite are being sanctioned by the West, they're finally forced to turn their attention -- and pocketbooks -- to Russia. Acquiring Crimea and breaking up with the West is a win-win situation for Putin. Putin can also take a page from other bad guys who didn't obey existing rules. Maybe their successful experiences have taught Vladimir Putin that it's OK to play an enfant terrible of the world's politics. Just look at Fidel Castro, Kim Jong Un and even Bashar al-Assad -- they are all doing quite well, aren't they? Putin is playing by his own rules. What could the modern world do against a dictator with nuclear weapons and vast approval within his own country? Not much. And about the economic sanctions: How often are they truly successful? Only Putin knows whether he's going to take more pieces of Ukraine. The answer, ""No, because Putin said he would never go beyond Crimea,"" is incorrect. ""Maybe yes, maybe no"" is much closer to the reality. That's bad news for the world.","NATO general said Russian forces are ready and could strike Ukraine in days .

"(CNN) -- There's no disputing Tracy Morgan's comedic voice is one of a kind. Whether playing animal enthusiast Brian Fellow or imitating Star Jones of ""The View"" on ""Saturday Night Live,"" or just an exaggerated version of himself as Tracy Jordan on ""30 Rock,"" Morgan has commanded the stage and small screen. He was a series regular on ""SNL"" for seven years and earned an Emmy nomination for best supporting actor in a comedy for his ""30 Rock"" role. Known for over-the-top characters (Astronaut Jones, Dominican Lou) and outrageous celebrity impressions (Mike Tyson, Oprah Winfrey and Marion ""Suge"" Knight), Morgan performs his standup routines with the same characteristic 'no holds barred' attitude. The actor also starred in ""The Tracy Morgan Show"" from 2003-2004 and has hosted and executive produced the hidden camera show ""Scare Tactics"" on SyFy. A multivehicle accident on the New Jersey Turnpike left Tracy Morgan, 45, in critical condition on Saturday, authorities said. One person was killed. Morgan and two other passengers in a limo bus remained hospitalized late Saturday. Morgan performed a comedy act Friday night at the Dover Downs Hotel & Casino in Delaware, according to the venue. The actor-comedian-producer grew up in New York City -- raised by a single mom, along with his four siblings. In 2009, he published an autobiography titled ""I Am the New Black"" chronicling his rise from a Brooklyn housing project to starring on the ""SNL"" stage from 1996 to 2003. His father died of AIDS when Morgan was 17. In an interview, Morgan said his father taught him the key to survival was to learn from your mistakes. The comedian is no stranger to controversy. After being arrested twice for drunk driving and ordered to wear an ankle monitoring device, Morgan said it took tough talk from his then-teenage son to sober him up. The comedian credits his son for confronting him about his drinking and saving his life. In a 2010 PBS interview, Morgan referred to fame as the ""worst drug known to mankind,"" saying it led down the path of ""partying and hanging out"" and the end of his first marriage. He was previously married for 21 years to his high school sweetheart, Sabina Morgan, mother of his three sons -- Gitrid, Malcolm and Tracy Jr. ""I started to hurt even people that I love. I was changing and I'm glad that I caught it in time,"" Morgan said. In 2011, Morgan received backlash from a standup routine he performed in Nashville. An audience member recorded Morgan's show in which he went on a homophobic rant which included a comment that he'd ""stab his son to death if he said he was gay."" The audio of Morgan's routine was later picked up by several websites. A few weeks later, Morgan returned to Nashville to meet with members of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) and deliver a face-to-face apology to people who were in the audience the night of his performance. ""I don't have a hateful bone in my body,"" Morgan said. ""I don't believe anyone should be bullied or made to feel bad about who they are."" After that meeting, Morgan vowed to change his comedy routine, saying the controversy, gave him the ""opportunity to change my message onstage."" ""In my heart, I really don't care who you love, same sex or not, as long as you have the ability to love, that's the important thing here,"" he said. Over the years, Morgan has had his share of health challenges, battling diabetes and surviving a kidney transplant in 2010. In 2012, the actor was rushed to the hospital at the Sundance Film Festival after collapsing after giving an awards acceptance speech, according to industry trade publication Variety. Morgan's representative told CNN that the actor sought medical attention for ""a combination of exhaustion and altitude."" The father of four is engaged to model Megan Wollover and the two have an 11-month-old daughter, Maven. According to a statement by his publicist, Morgan's ""family is with him and he is receiving excellent care."" Actor Tracy Morgan in critical condition after wreck in New Jersey .

"(CNN) -- Truck driver Kevin Roper has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in connection with the crash last weekend that killed comedian James McNair and injured comedian Tracy Morgan. The question has arisen: Why was he charged with death by auto and aggravated assault before we even know how he was driving? In this sort of crash, what makes the difference between an accident and a crime? The answers lie in the criminal code. Homicide . Roper has been charged with ""death by auto"" in connection with the killing of James McNair. In New Jersey, homicide as a crime is divided into three different categories: murder, manslaughter and -- in a category by itself -- death by auto. Vehicular homicide is causing a death by driving a vehicle or vessel ""recklessly."" There are two elements hidden in that definition. First, causation: The defendant has to have caused the death. It must be shown that the defendant caused the crash, the crash caused the death, and that the victim's death was foreseeable. The concept of recklessness, however, is a little more difficult to grasp. Recklessness and negligence are often spoken of together, but they are two very different points on a ""mens rea"" (state of mind) spectrum. Criminal negligence is the least blameworthy state of mind. It's an ""objective"" standard, which means that we simply ask if an ordinary, reasonable person would have done the same act -- the act that created the risk in the first place. The prosecution doesn't have to prove that the defendant actually knew better, just that he should have known better. Recklessness is totally different. Both the negligent person and the reckless person create a risk of bodily injury, but the reckless person does so in conscious disregard of that risk. So, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant's driving created a substantial and unjustifiable risk of bodily injury. With recklessness, the state must also prove that the defendant consciously disregarded this risk, which was a gross deviation from what a reasonable person would have done. So how on earth does a prosecutor get into a defendant's brain to know what he was thinking at the moment of impact? The truth is that we never know for sure what a defendant actually thought -- unless, of course, the defendant tells us what he thought. Often defendants give statements or admissions to the police that can be introduced against them in court. While it's true that hearsay (what the person told someone else) is supposed to be inadmissible, the admission of a criminal defendant is an exception to this rule. Of course, if a confession is obtained through compulsion or coercion, it is considered unreliable, and is inadmissible. But, as long as the state can prove conclusively that a confession was made voluntarily, it will be admissible. But how often does a driver admit to police ""I drove recklessly?"" Not often. Therefore, the law also permits us to draw inferences about a person's state of mind, based just on their conduct. In fact, certain behavior is specifically considered reckless by the law. And that's where this defendant may find his words come back to haunt him -- even if he never uttered the words ""reckless"" to the police. New Jersey's criminal code has this to say: ""[p]roof that the defendant fell asleep while driving or was driving after having been without sleep for a period in excess of 24 consecutive hours may give rise to an inference that the defendant was driving recklessly."" The easiest way to find out a driver was dozing off is if he admits it. Since the defendant in this crash was alone, only he would be able to tell police if he was asleep. Even an offhand comment to investigators about ""drifting off"" would have dire consequences, because it all but establishes a major part of the case against him. The 24-hour alternative could be proved with circumstantial evidence, such as records, communications, or even witness testimony. Either way, the state would have the burden of proving sleep. If the defendant admits to dozing off, he's saved the state the inconvenience of its burden. See why criminal defense attorneys are always begging clients to not try to talk their way out of trouble? This kind of homicide is a second-degree offense, punishable by up to 10 years in state prison, and there is a presumption of incarceration. This means if he's convicted, he's probably going to prison. Assault . Roper has also been charged with ""assault by auto"" in connection with the other injuries caused. Assault by auto also has the recklessness standard, but here the seriousness of injury also guides the degree of the crime charged. Assault by auto is a crime of the fourth degree if serious bodily injury results. On the other hand, if only ""bodily injury"" results, it is only a disorderly persons offense. It's interesting that criminal statutes define culpability in part by the injuries suffered, but in this case, the ""seriousness"" of the bodily injury -- Tracy Morgan was left in critical condition, for example -- is apparent, which is why the state has charged Roper with a fourth-degree offense. This is punishable by up to 18 months in state prison. Ultimately, for both assault and death by auto, the prosecution must prove reckless behavior beyond a reasonable doubt. If Roper made statements or admissions to the police about falling asleep at the wheel, those statements could dramatically alter the course of the prosecution against him, potentially conceding a major part of the state's case against him.","Danny Cevallos: Trucker in Tracy Morgan crash charged with death by auto, assault by auto .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Six Chinese maritime surveillance ships briefly entered waters around a group of islands at the center of a heated territorial dispute between Tokyo and Beijing, ignoring warnings from the Japanese authorities amid escalating tensions in the region. The Chinese ships arrived near the uninhabited islands -- which Japan calls Senkaku and China calls Diaoyu -- on Friday morning and began patrols and ""law enforcement,"" China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The islands, situated in the East China Sea between Okinawa and Taiwan, are currently under Japanese control, but China claims they have been an ""inherent"" part of its territory ""since ancient times."" The long-running argument over who has sovereignty has resulted in occasionally violent acts of public protest. The United States,a key ally of Japan, has repeatedly urged Tokyo and Beijing to resolve the dispute through dialogue. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta will meet with his counterparts in Japan and China during a visit to the region that begins this weekend, the Department of Defense said Thursday. The Chinese ships entered Japanese territorial waters Friday despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard, said Shinichi Gega, a spokesman for Japan's 11th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters. The vessels had all left the waters by mid-afternoon and headed north, the Japanese Coast Guard said later Friday, noting that sea in the area was getting rough as a huge storm, Super Typhoon Sanba, approached from the south. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said Japan would intensify its own patrols of the area in response to what he described as an ""unprecedented scale of invasion"" of Japanese waters. See a map of Asia's disputed islands . Tokyo has protested the ""inappropriate, illegal act"" to the Chinese authorities, Fujimura said. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan would ""take all possible measures to ensure security"" around the islands. Two of the Chinese ships responded to a Japanese Coast Guard vessel's warning by reiterating China's territorial claim to the islands and saying they were carrying out patrol work, according to Gega. Japanese ships and helicopters are continuing their own patrols of the area, he said. The controversial Chinese move to begin patrols around the islands follows the Japanese government's purchase of several of the islands from a private Japanese owner earlier this week, a deal that China described as ""illegal and invalid."" Read about China's warning of economic fallout . The purpose of the patrols is ""to demonstrate China's jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islets and ensure the country's maritime interests,"" Xinhua reported Friday, citing a government statement. This week, China announced what it said were the boundaries of its territorial waters around the islands to back up its claim of sovereignty. It said it had filed a copy of the announcement with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday to comply with international law. But Fujimura insisted Friday that the islands are an ""integral part of Japanese territory"" under international law, highlighting how directly opposed the two sides are. Animosity between the two countries over the islands runs deep. They have come to represent what many Chinese people see as unfinished business: redressing the impact of the Japanese occupation of large swathes of eastern China during the 1930s and 1940s. China says its claim goes back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. Tokyo's diplomatic corps suffered an unexpected setback Thursday when the newly appointed Japanese ambassador to China, Shinichi Nishimiya, collapsed in Tokyo and was hospitalized just two days after he was named to the post. CNN's Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.","NEW: All the Chinese ships have left the area, Japan says .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The principal of a high school, which lost 244 students and 10 teachers in the deadly Sewol ferry disaster in April, has been removed from his post, according to the local education office. ""I cannot reveal detailed reasons for his removal because it is personal information, but it is regarding the Sewol accident,"" said an official with the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education. The second-year class from Danwon High School was on a school trip on the ill-fated ferry on April 16. The Sewol ferry departed from Incheon headed to Jeju island carrying 339 students and teachers when it sank. Of the school group, 77 were rescued. Later that month, classes resumed with remaining students and staff in shock and grief, as nearly an entire class had been lost. The name of the dismissed principal was not released Wednesday. ""The decision was made a while ago, but was carried out only recently because the focus was on dealing with the accident,"" said the education official. Overall, 12 people remain missing and 292 died in the Sewol incident. Three days after the Sewol ferry sank, the vice principal of Danwon High School, who had been rescued from the vessel, was found dead after apparently hanging himself.

"(CNN) -- This year, on the 15th season of NBC's weight-loss show ""The Biggest Loser,"" Rachel Frederickson did exactly what the show producers, the celebrity trainers and the audience asked her to: She lost the most weight. She lost so much weight, in fact, that many have decided she is now unhealthily thin. Jaws dropped at her final weigh-in. Social media exploded. At 5-foot-5 and 105 pounds, her body mass index is below what the National Institutes of Health considers healthy. I won't speculate on her health. That's for a doctor to determine, and hopefully she's regularly seeing one. She says she's ""never felt this great."" I think I know exactly how Rachel is feeling right now. In a word: intoxicated. And as I also know from experience, that intoxication can be deadly dangerous. 'Biggest Loser' winner: Too Thin? Growing up as a student of classical ballet, I floated in and out of all kinds of unhealthy eating disorders. I experimented with bulimia, starvation, laxatives and diet pills. Dancers knew plenty of terrible tricks. We'd eat carrots and use the bright orange to mark when to stop throwing up before all the nutrients and energy we needed to dance were expended. We ate tissue paper to feel full. We were caffeine addicts --some even snorted it. Many smoked cigarettes and a few did drugs. Our unhealthy habits at Boston Ballet even led to a ""Dateline"" investigation in 1997, when a friend and fellow dancer died suddenly at 22. She weighed 93 pounds. Not only did all of this make for very bad habits, but as an impressionable, insecure and developmentally immature adolescent girl, body issues were ingrained at the worst possible time, and when I was least equipped to deal with them. My teen years were spent, irrationally, consumed with being too fat. There was depression. There were suicidal thoughts. There was therapy. When I finally left ballet, I found relief in the normalcy of college. That relief turned to excitement when I found friends -- and boyfriends -- who thought I was pretty great, even without starving myself. And that excitement turned to empowerment when I found a career in writing that turned me on and didn't care what I looked like. I left body issues behind. I knew who I was. Ironically, all that self-esteem spurred unexpected weight loss. I suddenly dropped 10, 15, 20 pounds without trying. I was eating healthily, working out occasionally, and enjoying my 20s. I'd never been happier. And then it happened. The compliments, the attention, the looks on friends' faces who hadn't seen me in a few months -- it was all euphoric. Watching the numbers on the scale tick backward, clothing sizes drop -- I'd chased that feeling for so long as a teenager, and it was finally happening. And as the compliments turned to concern I grew even more determined to hold on to that euphoria, to keep the weight off and maybe drop a few more pounds. If someone didn't mention my weight loss, I was despondent. What was once occasional exercise became compulsive working out. Eating healthy turned into not eating. Instead of going out with friends I preferred to stay in, so I could not eat in private. I hadn't been trying to lose weight, didn't even think I needed to. But when it happened inadvertently the euphoria was so addicting, I didn't want it to stop. The good news is, older, wiser and having beat body issues before, I knew I didn't want to get sucked back in to a dark and compulsive life controlled completely by my weight. I made a decision to never return to those addictions, no matter how good they felt. I stopped the feverish workouts. I returned to normal eating. I saw my friends again. Years later, I make daily decisions to strike a balance between being healthy and being obsessive. And if the choice is between being 10 pounds overweight and 10 pounds underweight, I choose over. It hasn't been easy. I have a job on television now and the pressure to look good and stay thin is immense. I simply don't pay attention to it. I was recently a bride, and unlike many women preparing to walk down the aisle, I refused to embark on some crazy crash diet to look my thinnest in a corset, though the temptation was there. And I am sure that when I have children, I'll worry about losing baby weight like every other new mother does. But I will do all I can to obsess over my baby and not those stubborn remaining pounds. I'll bet that Rachel Frederickson can relate to much of my story. I bet that when she was at her heaviest she was unhappy, and maybe even depressed. I bet she never thought she could look the way she wanted. I bet she fantasized about what it would be like to be thin. And now I bet she is intoxicated by the attention she's gotten for losing so much weight, intoxicated by the rush of losing another pound, by the boost in energy she has from working out. And I bet she has vowed to herself never to gain the weight back, never to return to the previous her. I just hope that in addition to weight loss and workout techniques, the trainers and doctors on the show have equipped her to deal with the addictive behaviors that can result from successfully getting in shape. I hope they've warned her about a mental anguish that can be just as dark as the one she felt as a heavier woman, and maybe even more dangerous. And I hope they've told her that despite the thrill of losing the most weight, she will not become a ""loser"" if she gains some back. I'm proud of Rachel for getting healthy. And I hope she loves who she is. But the next year will be an important and potentially dangerous one for her, with addictive behaviors lurking around every corner. I just hope she's strong enough to avoid them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S. E.

"(CNN) -- Tender, loving vampires? Look elsewhere than FX's ""The Strain."" The new thriller series, produced by Guillermo del Toro, Carlton Cuse and author Chuck Hogan, wants to make bloodsuckers scary again. ""The vampire genre has sort of been overrun by romance,"" Cuse told reporters on a press call. ""We had had our fill of vampires that we're feeling sorry for because they had romantic problems."" Instead, ""The Strain's"" vampires lose their heart, their hair and their genital organs. When these vampires fully transition, there's no mistaking them for the really pale guy in science class. For Cuse, that was the selling point for hopping aboard. ""The idea of sort of reimagining the vampires, going back to the roots of what vampires are -- that they are scary, dangerous creatures -- that was something that was incredibly compelling for me; the idea that when you see these things, it's not good."" An adaptation of Hogan and del Toro's books, ""The Strain,"" premiering Sunday, July 13, begins with the mysterious deaths of passengers aboard an airplane that lands in New York. All but a few on the flight appear to be dead, and CDC epidemiologist Dr. Ephraim Goodweather (Corey Stoll) heads over to investigate with a few colleagues. But the wormy outbreak they're examining is far more ancient and sinister then they realize -- and it isn't long before the horrific outbreak spreads. ""I've been obsessed by vampires for a long, long time, since I was a very young kid, and a very strange kid,"" del Toro said during the press call. ""I read about vampire mythology worldwide and I familiarized myself with the Japanese, Filipino, Malaysian and Eastern European variations on the vampire, and many, many others. And I kept very detailed notes as a kid on where to go with the vampire myth in terms of brutality, social structure (and) biology. Some of those notes made it into my first feature, 'Cronos.' Some of them made it in 'Blade II' when I directed that, and most of them made it into 'The Strain.'"" In del Toro's world, the undead do not sparkle, do not brood and do not hesitate to take out someone they once loved. In fact, the first thing to go is their heart. ""The older that they stay alive, the more they lose their humanity,"" del Toro explained. ""They start literally by losing their heart; their heart is suffocated by a vampire heart that overtakes the functions. This was important metaphorically for me because the beacon that guides these vampires to their victims is love. Love is what makes them seek their victims. They go to the people they love the most. So they turn their instinct that is most innately human into the most inhuman feeding mechanism."" With ""The Strain"" being on FX, hardcore horror fans are likely skeptical that the drama can be as graphic as an R-rated movie would be. Cuse told press that the network gave the producers ""the latitude"" to tell the story their way -- and critics have taken notice. ""'The Strain' is packed with so much macabre imagery and so many clever ideas that it doesn't feel like the resuscitation of a tired genre, but the launch of something new and fun,"" says HitFix's Alan Sepinwall. Granted, like the show's gross-out billboards, the producers' commitment to ""unadulterated"" storytelling may not sit well with some viewers. ""This is cult-classic, midnight-movie horror, designed in meticulous, mythology-respecting detail for comic-book readers and fangirls and -boys,"" says Entertainment Weekly.

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five people were discharged from hospital Friday, state media reported, a week after a meteor exploded in spectacular fashion in the skies above Russia's Urals region, shattering glass in thousands of buildings. Eleven children were among the patients who went home Friday morning, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. More than 60 people were hospitalized across the region, the local emergencies ministry said. The total count for those hurt climbed in the days after the meteor's arrival on February 15 to more than 1,500, according to RIA Novosti. Most of the injuries were minor and caused by flying glass. The Chelyabinsk region, the hardest-hit area, asked federal authorities Monday for $16.6 million in aid, RIA Novosti said. Russian scientists track down fragments of Urals meteor . The total bill for the damage is estimated at 1 billion rubles ($33 million), with more than 4,000 buildings affected, many of them apartment blocks. About 200,000 square meters (almost 240,000 square yards) of glass were broken in total, authorities said. Meanwhile, the first fragment of meteorite arrived in Moscow on Friday for analysis, RIA Novosti reported. About 50 small fragments have been found so far, the news agency reported earlier this week, some in a crater in the Chelyabinsk region's Lake Chebarkul. Opinion: Don't count 'doomsday asteroid' out yet . Images taken soon after the meteor blast showed a hole in the ice covering the lake where a chunk of meteorite was believed to have fallen. Because the meteor exploded in a huge fireball in the atmosphere, the fragments could be scattered over a huge area. A couple of purported pieces of Chelyabinsk meteorite were advertised for sale on the eBay online auction site Friday. The national space agency, Roscosmos, said scientists believe one meteoroid entered the atmosphere, where it burned and disintegrated into fragments. Amateur video footage showed a bright white streak moving rapidly across the sky before exploding with an even brighter flash and a deafening bang. According to NASA estimates, the meteor measured 55 feet (17 meters) across and had a mass of 10,000 tons. CNN iReport: Meteor in the sky over Chelyabinsk . The space agency put the amount of energy released in the meteor's explosion at nearly 500 kilotons. By comparison, the nuclear bomb the United States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 released an estimated 15 kilotons of energy. The whole event, from the meteor's atmospheric entry to its disintegration in the air above central Russia, took 32.5 seconds, NASA said. Residents told CNN of their shock as they saw, heard and felt the awesome blast, and the chaos and confusion they witnessed in the moments afterward, when no one knew what had happened. Denis Kuznetsov, a 23-year-old historian from Chelyabinsk, told CNN via e-mail of his experience. At first there was a blinding flash lasting several seconds, which made him want to shut his eyes. The light shone ""like 10 suns,"" he said. ""This is no exaggeration."" Kuznetsov said he experienced what felt like ""a push,"" as a sound wave passed through his body. ""For some seconds I simply stood,"" he said, amid the sound of breaking glass. Interior Minister Vladimir Puchkov told state news agency Itar-Tass this week that he wanted to see scientists develop new technologies that would allow such meteors to be spotted in advance. ""I believe that this emergency situation will push us towards generating new resources, approaches and ideas in tackling this serious problem,"" he is quoted as saying. The European Space Agency said that events of the magnitude of the Chelyabinsk meteor blast ""are expected once every several of tens to 100 years."" It calculates that the meteoroid burst and disintegrated about 15 to 20 kilometers (nine to 12 miles) above the ground. ""The terminal part of the explosion probably likely occurred almost directly over Chelyabinsk,"" said Detlef Koschny, of the European Space Agency. ""This was perhaps the single greatest contributor to the blast damage.""","Local officials say 25 people injured by the blast were discharged from hospital Friday .

"(CNN) -- Marine biologists have a mystery to solve: Why have the carcasses of two rare oarfish washed up on Southern California shores within a week? Sightings of the huge deep-sea creatures -- dead or alive -- are unusual, because they typically swim thousands of feet below the surface. A dead 14-foot-long oarfish came ashore in Oceanside, California, on Friday afternoon, according to an Oceanside police dispatcher. A representative of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was called to haul the serpent-like fish away for study, she said. A group of third-graders on a beach study trip made the discovery, according to CNN affiliate KGTV. The incident is especially puzzling because of the discovery made five days earlier by a marine science instructor while snorkeling off Catalina Island. Jasmine Santana was about 15 feet underwater when she found an 18-foot-long oarfish floating nearby. ""I was first a little scared,"" said Santana, who has been working for Catalina Island Marine Institute since January. ""But when I realized it was an oarfish, I knew it was harmless."" Giant eyeball washes up on beach . It took Santana 15 minutes to drag the dead fish ashore, where 14 others helped lift the 400-pound carcass out of the water. ""I was really amazed. It was like seeing something in a dream,"" said Mark Waddington, the senior captain of Catalina Island Marine Institute's sailing school vessel the ""Tole Mour"" who gave Santana a hand. ""It's the first time I ever witnessed an oarfish this big."" Discovery makes a splash: The rarest whale . Suzanne Kohin, a scientist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, was on hand Friday to take a look at the Oceanside oarfish. ""It's so rare to find in Southern California, especially in surface water,"" Kohin told KGTV.

"(CNN) -- Familiar terrorist groups, familiar threats, familiar boasts and grievances -- all in new messages tied, either directly or indirectly, to al Qaeda. Two videos and one audio link have come to light in recent days that suggest that the world's most recognizable terrorist group is still active, at least in online postings. The audio is a question-and-answer session purportedly involving al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri that was published Friday on the radical Islamist website Hanein. While CNN has not verified the authenticity of the tape, the voice is similar to al-Zawahiri's from previously authenticated recordings. In a wide-ranging, nearly hour-long interview with al Qaeda's media arm, known as al-Sahab, al-Zawahiri touches on everything from drones to Syria to Egypt. He insists that al Qaeda is holding strong 13 years after the United States launched its ""war on terror"" following the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""The upper hand is for the one who does not withdraw from his land,"" al-Zawahiri says. ""Who has withdrawn from Iraq, and who has not? Who has withdrawn from Afghanistan and who has not?"" Al-Zawahiri adds that even U.S. President Barack Obama knows al Qaeda ""is expanding."" ""Al Qaeda is scattered in all the Islamic world and among the oppressed,"" he said. That analysis is relatively peaceful compared with the chilling words uttered in a newly discovered video from Al-Shabaab. Among its threats: ""We will blow you up, until we finish you off."" Members of the Somalia-based, al Qaeda-linked militant group also use the video to reflect on one of its most memorable, deadliest attacks to date -- the four-day siege last September of an upscale Nairobi, Kenya, indoor shopping center that ended with at least 67 killed. That Westgate Mall attack may have been one of the bloodiest tied to Al-Shabaab, but it won't be the last, men featured on the video suggested. ""It's not that Westgate was enough,"" they say. ""There are still hundreds of men who are wishing for such an operation."" Peter Bergen, an authority on terrorism who interviewed the late Osama bin Laden and is a CNN national security analyst, said that this Al-Shabaab threat has to be taken seriously. ""We certainly can't dismiss their ability to carry out those kinds of terrorist attacks,"" Bergen said. The two messages come on the heels of another one that got attention this week showing what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years. In the middle of that video clip, the man known as al Qaeda's crown prince, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, appears brazenly out in the open, greeting followers in Yemen. Al-Wuhayshi is the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda globally and the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, which is considered the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate. In a speech to the group, al-Wuhayshi makes it clear that he's going after the United States, saying ""We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!"" The video started appearing on jihadist websites recently, drawing the attention of U.S. officials and global terrorism experts. U.S. officials say they believe it's authentic. They believe the highly produced video is recent. With some fighters' faces blurred, there is worry it signals a new round of plotting.","Al Qaeda's Ayman al-Zawahiri purportedly answers questions on range of subjects .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes a single moment in time captures the essence of an individual. That became clear to me in late June 1995. We were at the end of a grueling three days in Alabama interviewing George Wallace, the state's former segregationist governor and nemesis of President Kennedy, for John's maiden interview in his new magazine, George. The enfeebled governor was barely coherent during the 10 hours we sat with him, and we were panicked there would be a gaping hole in our inaugural issue. Worse, John himself was sick with a thyroid condition that left him lethargic, cranky and frighteningly thin. Adding to the anxiety of the moment, he was carrying around an engagement ring in the hope his girlfriend, Carolyn, would accept when he proposed to her that weekend. Imagine our appreciation when two amiable Alabamans with close ties to the governor offered us a quiet dinner at a roadside restaurant. But as we approached the restaurant, I suddenly noticed there were perhaps a hundred cars parked alongside the road -- the restaurant parking lot itself was overflowing. I looked over at John, and he at me, and we both realized in that same instant: we'd been played. This would be no quiet dinner for four, but the show-and-tell of an American icon. ""I'm not doing it,"" he said to me angrily as we sat in the back of the car, mulling our options. ""I'm going back to the hotel."" But one thing John had in more abundance than anyone I knew was grace. And he wouldn't let down the 200 or so people who had gathered in the restaurant or embarrass our hosts, who had covertly planned this minirally. So John put on his tie, set aside his fury and gamely walked across the dirt driveway and gave himself up to the adoring crowd. For the next two hours, as only John could, he charmed everyone, signing dozens of pictures of his father, standing for dozens more and patiently listening to the endless stories people related of their ties to his extended family. What I realized that night, and what has stayed with me these past 15 years since his passing, is this: No one of my generation was born with more privilege or promise than John, yet no one wore it more comfortably. When we walked out of the restaurant, John smiled at me and without the slightest irony said, ""That was really fun."" And he meant it. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","John F.

"(CNN) -- Popes John XXIII and John Paul II will be declared saints in April, the Vatican said Monday. The announcement came after Pope Francis met with cardinals to discuss the planned canonizations of two of his predecessors. The ceremony will take place on April 27. It will be the first time two popes will be canonized at the same time. Why does a pope become a saint? To be named a saint involves a series of steps, but the qualifications are straightforward, according to the veteran Vatican analyst John Allen. ""You put a holy life and two miracles together, according to the Catholic system, you've got a saint,"" he said. The calls to canonize John Paul II began even before he had been buried. People attending his funeral in 2005 held banners saying ""Santo Subito,"" short for ""make him a saint now."" Their call was heard. Bypassing the normal five-year waiting period, Pope Benedict XVI set in motion the process to canonize his predecessor. John Paul is said to have miraculously cured Sister Marie Simon-Pierre, a French nun stricken by Parkinson's disease, several months after his death. Read more: Pope names first Native American saint . The church says the second miracle occurred when a Costa Rican woman with a brain aneurism recovered after praying to John Paul. John XXIII, revered for his role in the Second Vatican Council, is only recorded as having performed one miracle after his death in 1963. ""Pope Francis has decided that there already was a decree of heroic virtue saying that the man had lived a holy life,"" Allen says. ""There already was one miracle certified for his beatification in 2000, so Pope Francis has decided he doesn't have to pass go, doesn't have to collect $200, he can go directly to sainthood."" In fact, canonization by the Catholic Church simply formalizes on earth what is already in place in heaven, Allen points out. ""It's not like Karol Wojtyla, John Paul II, will suddenly become a saint when the canonization ceremony occurs,"" he says. ""The belief would be he is already in heaven with God, living the life of a saint. All that's going to happen when the ceremony occurs is that the church will officially recognize that."" CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","To become a saint, a person needs to lead a holy life and perform two miracles .

"(CNN) -- Shrimp: It's not just for surf-and-turf anymore. In fact, thanks to research at Harvard University, the little crustaceans may be the next thing in plastic. In experiments with the material in shrimp shells, called chitosan, and material from silk, known as fibroin, researchers at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering put the two together at a nano level. The result was a material they call ""shrilk"" -- a substance that's both remarkably malleable and incredibly sturdy. ""It actually feels like a huge beetle shell, or cuticle,"" says Don Ingber, the director of the Wyss Institute. ""(It) can be very strong in terms of tensile strength. If you wet them they can actually get more flexible,"" he adds. ""We can get the range of different properties of plastics by changing how we fabricate these."" Though the word ""plastic"" applies to any moldable solid, it's come to be associated with materials made out of petrochemicals. That's both a blessing and a curse. Plastics are made in such quantity that they're both inexpensive and versatile, yet most aren't biodegradable. Indeed, the infamous Pacific trash vortex -- the large area of garbage suspended in the Pacific Ocean -- is primarily made up of plastic debris, which has killed fish and wildlife and wreaked havoc on local ecosystems. Shrilk, on the other hand, is fully biodegradable, says Ingber -- a necessity if the product is to succeed. ""In the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific there's continents of plastic floating that fish are getting entangled in and dying. We can't keep going on like this,"" he says. ""I think many people are searching for replacements for plastics that would have the properties of plastic but be fully biodegradable. This may not solve all the problems but we feel like it's a first step."" The current challenge for shrilk is to make it cost-effective. There's plenty of raw material, says Ingber -- the seafood industry has so much shrimp shell discard ""that they have to pay to get it cleared away sometimes"" -- but there's still a ways to go. ""We need to work with real manufacturers who know what the design challenges are and the durability and the cost,"" says Ingber. ""The materials exist, the manufacturing processes exist, it really just requires it to be integrated into the pipeline."" The researchers say there is plenty of room for growth. Literally, in fact: the material in shrilk makes excellent fertilizer. ""They are so rich in nutrients that you could put seeds in them, just in the broken down material, and a plant will grow,"" says Ingber. Perhaps, a new part of the plastics industry will as well.","Harvard researchers have developed plastic made of shrimp shells, silk .

"(CNN) -- When you think about Russian style, don't think Moscow, think St. Petersburg. Like the city -- which is crammed with elegant architecture -- the citizens of Russia's fashion capital know how to look good. Their reputation for being easygoing and adventurous is often expressed in clothing. Gaudy colors and bad leisurewear aren't the thing in St. Petersburg -- here fashionistas are more likely to mix designer threads with Grandma's castoffs. But getting the look can take some effort; it requires legwork. St. Petersburg isn't about grabbing something boring off the peg, its about experimenting. Best street market . Good street markets are hard to find in St. Petersburg, but a 30-minute subway trip to the northern suburbs takes you to a clothing goldmine where you can find just about anything. Udelnaya station, on Line 2, gives its name to Udelka, a nearby market featuring row after row of commercial ""secondhand from Europe"" outlets. These are best ignored en route to the main attraction: a huge field where on weekends hundreds of locals gather to sell attic plunder. Vintage Soviet clothes, furniture, cameras, antiques, musical instruments, vinyl, old military outfits, pins and medals are all on sale -- as are weirder items such as breast enlargers. Half the sellers are professional rag men, so they're usually able to help in the hunt for something special -- although their definition of special may differ from their customer's. Best garage sale . A hipper version of Udelka featuring fewer mothballs and considerably more fashionable goods is held regularly in the Loft Project Etagi (74, Ligovsky Prospekt), a cultural center in an old bread factory. During summer, the monthly ""Garage Sale"" occupies the whole building, but the best finds can be made in the yard or on the terrace. Even if there's no market, it's worth a visit Etagi to check out art and photo exhibitions and cupboard-sized shops such as Milnaya Belka (2/F, Loft Project Etagi +7 812 980 11 66), which sells Russian and Asian designers. There's also the Green Room (+7 812 458 80 03), a cheap but cheerful cafÃ©. Best retro shops . When the markets aren't on, you can still bag a bargain. Worth a look is St. Petersburg's legendary second hand and clothing rental shop, Off (60 Obvodnogo Canal Quay, +7 8 812 929 92 03). Run by a pair of extravagant shopkeepers, Off features an extensive collection of Soviet retro and vintage clothes and was favorite with Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe, a Russian artist and gay rights icon who died last year. Off is located in a popular loft called Tkachi, where locals come to lay their hands on bicycles, furniture, shoes and musical instruments. Best place for boots . They're not particularly stylish, but when it comes to handling the St. Petersburg rainy seasons -- all three of them -- it's hard to beat a pair of Soviet gumboots. These can still be picked up at the vast Red Triangle factory (136 Obvodnogo Canal Quay) that once produced them. If you're not interested in the boots, it's still worth a trip for a glimpse into St. Petersburg's industrial communist past -- one that's slowly being reclaimed by its capitalistic future. Best places for designer clothes . Russia's fashion industry is just emerging, but with St. Petersburg is at the forefront it's slowly making a name for itself. Leonid Alexeev (4, Veselnaya Street, 4, +7 812 322 08 96), the engine of the local fashion scene and one its most productive designers, sells haute couture and pret-a-porter clothes, plus accessories and perfumes. Another leading light is Tatyana Parfionova (Nevski Prospekt, 51, +7 812 713 14 15). Parfionova is one the city's most popular designers and while her striking outfits might not protect against the snowy rigors of a Russian winter, they regularly appear on fashion week runways and represent the country abroad. One of St. Petersburg's youngest and most challenging designers is Asya Malbershtein (Kazanskaya, 5, +7 812 6491699; by appointment only), who specializes in minimalistic leather goods. Best places for accessories . Sticking with Asya Malbershtein, her accessories can also be found in 8-Store (Dvortsovaya Quay 20), one of several designer outlets in Taigaspace -- a beautiful 18th-century merchant house that also houses creative start-ups. Marmeladova buketik (Rubenstein St., 40, +7 812 988 0448) is a somewhat girly outlet named after the heroine of Fyodor Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment."" This clothing, accessories and flower shop is owned by a St. Petersburg socialite who, in addition to making the clothes himself, also runs a chic Sixties-style barbershop around the corner. Best places to people-watch . For those who have mastered St. Petersburg style, there are plenty of places to show it off. The best people-watching can be found in the large-windowed cafes on Nevsky Prospekt, a central street that's busy and crowded day and night -- particularly in summer when the day is almost indistinguishable from night. In the fashionable Rubenstein Street, party animals, foodies and local celebrities can be found mingling among the dozens of bars, upscale restaurants and coffee bars that include Mitte CafÃ© (27 Rubenstein St.; +7 812 416 14 16). A more highbrow scene can be found at the art house foreign language film screenings in the elegant Angleterre hotel (Malaya Morskaya, 24; +7 981 870 7757). And because this is the city Dostoevsky once called home, there's St. Petersburg's best independent book retailer, Word Order (Fontanka Quay, 15). Offering more than just books, and surrounded by popular bars such as Produkty (Fontanka Quay 17; +7 812 312-57-54) this tiny shop has long been the unofficial center of the city's intellectual activities and regularly hosts discussions on contemporary Russian cinema, philosophy and media. Anna Balagurova is editor of the St. Petersburg edition of The Village, a Russian internet newspaper focusing on the city, its style and culture.","The citizens of Russia's second biggest city are known for having a style of their own .

"London (CNN) -- One of the most eagerly awaited films to come out of Africa in recent years, starring Thandie Newton and Chiwetel Ejiofor, is hitting the big screen. ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" recently premiered at Toronto's International Film Festival. The British-Nigerian production is about the Nigerian civil war -- the Biafran war -- that tore up the country between 1967 and 1970, and is an adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's bestselling novel of the same name. ""It is essentially a love story set in the war,"" the film's Nigerian-born director Biyi Bandele told CNN. CNN met with the UK-based playwright and director just before the screening of ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" at the London Film Festival. Sporting his dreadlocks in a hair band, the 45-year-old talked about Thandie Newton, typhoid and turning an award-winning book into a film. ""The book is an epic book,"" Bandele said. ""It's about 500 pages long, and I had to make a movie that works under two hours. So I had to make some difficult choices when I was writing the script and it took me quite a few years actually to get the script right."" Read this: The movie they tried to ban . The romantic drama spans over a decade, starting with Nigeria's newly found freedom from the British rule in 1960, and continuing until the end of the fighting. It follows the fate of four people who become entangled in both their relationships and the civil war. It focuses on two wealthy sisters, Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Anika Noni Rose), who, upon returning from their UK education, choose two completely different lives. Newton's Olanna gives up her social status to live with the radical academic Odenigbo (Ejiofor), whilst Rose's Kainene becomes a successful businesswoman who falls in love with an English writer. Betrayals threaten to tear the sisters apart but soon they are both in the middle of the civil war turbulence. Adichie's novel came out in 2006, and Bandele immediately started working on the script. He knew from the start that he wanted Newton to play the part of Olanna. ""I just felt she would be perfect. And it took me quite a few years to finally persuade her to accept the role,"" Bandele said. ""(But) once we decided to shoot I was actually glad it took that long, because I was ready and I had the perfect cast. I mean, Chiwetel Ejiofor was just again another actor at the top of his game."" Part of the funding for the movie came from Britain, but it was all shot in Calabar and Creek Town in Nigeria. Originally, Bandele said, they had an eight-week schedule, but the tight budget meant cutting it short to five weeks instead. As if that wasn't enough, the shoot itself proved challenging to both the director and his crew. ""Myself and quite a few members of my crew contracted typhoid and some people had Malaria,"" Bandele said. ""Thandie (also) contracted typhoid and she didn't take a single day off. She was just there all the time. I have no idea where she got the physical energy from, but she was there."" Newton, born to a Zimbabwean mother and a British father, has described Olanna as the ""most sophisticated, modern woman"" she's ever played and critics have praised her performance as the highlight of her career so far. ""It was a really tough shoot and Thandie was just always a member of the team and it was great,"" Bandele said of working with Newton. ""The budget we had and my mission were not completely compatible, but somehow we managed to pull it off and I think we did because I had a great cast, an amazing crew and the support of the people of Calabar."" Read this: 'Star Wars' town disappearing into the desert . Bandele said he even had the support of the book's author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, but that he was anxious to find out what she thought of his adaptation. ""The day she came to see it, during the end of post-production, I didn't go into the production room because I was so nervous,"" he said. ""I also wanted her to respond however she wanted to respond, and when I heard that Chimamanda loved it I just sighed with relief."" ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" -- said to be the most expensive Nigerian movie to date, with a reported budget of $8 million -- is a milestone in Nigerian film. Nigeria is the second-largest producer of films in the world, after India, with around 50 movies per week. To Bandele this is just the beginning. He is currently working on an online series called ""Shuga"" and has high hopes for the country's movie industry. ""The future of Nigerian film is very good,"" he said. ""There are many young filmmakers right now out there. Some of them have grown up within the Nollywood tradition, others have gone to film school and you just have this mix of talent (and) lots of voices and I'm really excited.""","""Half of a Yellow Sun"" is the movie adaptation of award-winning novel of same name .

"(CNN)  -- The United States must resolve what I call the Great American Conundrum by clarifying its policy toward Muslims. It cannot treat its Muslim citizens as second-class citizens at home and hope to win them over abroad. American Muslims complain of their second-class status by pointing out that their religion and houses of worship can be attacked with near impunity. When they do object, they are told that this kind of abuse is a small price to pay for living in a free society. Yet it is blatantly clear that only Islam is being attacked in such a crass fashion. It is virtually unimaginable to hear of any other ethnic or religious group being so targeted without an uproar. The conundrum came into being on 9/11. That day, we saw how 19 men could plunge two world civilizations into world confrontation. They succeeded in creating conflict between America and the Muslim world, and almost 10 years later, nothing but a big black hole remains where the World Trade Center once stood. Muslims have not fully understood how deeply symbolic 9/11 has become for Americans. They have neither forgotten nor have many forgiven. Now a plan to create an Islamic center near the site of the World Trade Center has exacerbated tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims. The imam behind the center is a well-meaning and scholarly man who did not clearly think of the consequences of his actions. Most Americans see the befuddled actions of the imam as rubbing salt in their raw wounds. Non-Muslims are already threatening to blow up the center as soon as it is constructed. Once again, we are reminded how easy it is for individuals to drag their respective civilizations into conflict. Across the land, stories are emerging of other mosques under pressure or attack. When traveling throughout the United States for my project, ""Journey into America,"" to study the American Muslim community, we visited about 100 mosques. We saw some with windows smashed and others destroyed. The mosque in Columbia, Tennessee, had been firebombed. Graffiti with Nazi slogans appeared on the walls still standing. When told to go ""home,"" the Muslim worshippers, especially the young, were puzzled. ""We are home,"" they said. In the midst of this crisis there was light. The heroic  Rev. Bill Williamson approached Muslims and offered them the keys to his Presbyterian church, even suggesting he would remove anything they found offensive when they said their prayers there. Ramadan, the month of fasting, will start in the next day or two. Most Muslims who fast tend to spend more time than usual in mosques. Many young men dress in traditional clothes to worship late into the night. Sensibilities are heightened and worshippers are in a state of high spiritual excitement. The stage is almost set for those non-Muslims looking for a fight. As if the situation around mosques was not already tense enough, the Rev. Terry Jones of ""Dove World Outreach"" in Florida has declared September 11 ""Burn a Quran Day."" This is as provocative for ordinary Muslims as an imam promoting the burning of the Bible would be for Americans. All this would be headache enough for those who want peace and harmony within communities, but there is an international dimension to it. Gen. David Petraeus, the head of American forces in Afghanistan, has repeatedly expressed the need for winning the ""hearts and minds"" of local people by treating them with dignity and respect. This way, he hopes to marginalize or weaken support for the Taliban. Those Americans who believe they are being patriotic when they attack mosques or burn the Quran need to ask how Petraeus would respond to their actions. Will it help American troops in Afghanistan and Pakistan, both deeply conservative and religious societies ready to fight for Islam? Or would it make their task more difficult? No one -- least of all prominent American figures like Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich, who have jumped so blithely into the discussion and condemned the New York center -- must underestimate the danger. We are sitting on a tinderbox. A serious attack on a mosque in which people die could trigger a revenge attack, which would in turn create further attacks against Muslims. Because everything happening in America is seen in the Muslim world, murder and mayhem would follow globally. I believe those who chose the site for the Islamic center (to be called Park51) should have been more culturally sensitive. But now that plans are developed, there are ways to calm the situation. Considering the seriousness of the situation, I suggest the following steps be taken seriously and urgently. For a start, the imam in New York should ensure that the cultural center -- which he has clarified is not simply a mosque -- invites Christians and Jews to include a church and a synagogue so that the building is truly a symbol of interfaith worship. That is the American way. Also, the center must include a special memorial to those who died on 9/11, as proposed, so that people of different faiths can pray for their souls and thus begin to heal the wounds. President Obama should deliver a strong call to the nation, on the onset of Ramadan, for religious tolerance, and make it clear that no violation of this law of the land will be allowed. It is time he walked the walk, and not just talked the talk, to live up to the promise of his speech to the Muslim world in Cairo, Egypt. Bishops, rabbis and imams must work vigorously to bring the temperature down. Interfaith conferences in churches, synagogues and mosques should be conducted. Muslim leaders should organize iftar parties at the opening of the fast to invite non-Muslims, to create good will for the community. The media has too often played a negative role by associating Islam with violence and terror. It is time for media to play a more responsible role. TV news shows, for example, should encourage more Muslim guests to participate, so that Americans can finally begin to see Muslims as normal people and not members of a threatening alien species. Given the situation in America, both Muslims and non-Muslims need to be much more culturally sensitive to each other. Muslim leaders need to be more active in explaining Islam to non-Muslims, and non-Muslims need to appreciate Muslims as citizens and fellow countrymen. These steps will help resolve the Great American Conundrum. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Akbar Ahmed.","Akbar Ahmed: U.S. can't treat Muslims badly and win ""hearts and minds"" abroad .

"(CNN) -- Rape by mop handle, smashed teeth, broken bones, lacerated faces, concussions and dislocations. That's a short list of sexual exploitation and physical maltreatment that teen boys suffered at a naval training school in Australia. The abuse at the HMAS Leeuwin naval base occurred mainly in the 1960s and '70s, according to a report released by a defense department task force investigating abuse in the country's armed forces. The victims, mostly aged 15-17, were junior recruits at the school. They were mostly abused by higher-ranking junior recruits, who were not reprimanded for their behavior, but staff also committed much of the brutality, the Defence Abuse Response Taskforce said. Investigators heard 238 complaints of abuse, which detailed instances of forced sodomy, naked beatings and brutal rituals including genital abuse, and verbal and physical intimidation. The nightmarish mistreatment scarred young men for life, many of whom sought solace in drugs and alcohol or, in later years, suffered breakdowns of their careers and relationships. The youth training program at HMAS Leeuwin ended in 1984. Australian panel told of sexual abuse of boys at Salvation Army homes .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Call it a case of high tech meeting low tech, really the lowest of tech. Satellites are locating penguin waste, which is easier to find than the penguins themselves . British scientists are using pictures from high-powered satellites to pinpoint emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica. The penguins are difficult to pick up on sea ice, because of their natural camouflage that helps them blend into the shadows -- so the British Antarctic Survey had to come up with another method. Fortunately, penguin waste shows up nicely from space, staining the ice a light brown. ""We can't see actual penguins on the satellite maps because the resolution isn't good enough,"" said mapping expert Peter Fretwell. ""But during the breeding season the birds stay at a colony for eight months. The ice gets pretty dirty and it's the guano stains that we can see."" The method helped scientists identify 38 penguin colonies -- of those, 10 were new. Of previously known colonies, six had re-located and six were not found. ""This is a very exciting development. Now we know exactly where the penguins are, the next step will be to count each colony so we can get a much better picture of population size,"" said penguin ecologist Phil Trathan. ""Using satellite images combined with counts of penguin numbers puts us in a much better position to monitor future population changes over time."" Estimates put the total number of penguins at between 200,000 and 400,000 breeding pairs.","British scientists are using a new way to pinpoint penguin colonies in Antarctica .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Russia said Saturday it's satisfied that its humanitarian convoy sent over the border without authorization from Ukraine delivered supplies to its destination. In total, 227 vehicles were sent into eastern Ukraine on Friday, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through. Russia has said the vehicles were on an essential humanitarian mission, but international powers condemned it as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. A senior Ukrainian official characterized the convoy as a ""direct invasion"" of his nation by its mighty neighbor to the east. Several dozen Russian aid trucks left Ukrainian territory on Saturday morning, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. The Ukrainian Border Guard press office said it had seen the first of the Russian trucks go back over the border on Friday afternoon but that it could not confirm how many had returned in total. All the vehicles were supposed to be monitored by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross. However, the Red Cross said it wasn't accompanying them due to the ""volatile security situation"" -- a reference to continued fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces. In the statement expressing its satisfaction, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow intended to ""continue to cooperate with the ICRC"" in aid efforts in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of directly and indirectly bolstering the rebel movement in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, allegations Moscow denies. In a statement Saturday, OSCE chairman Didier Burkhalter deplored the failure to deliver the aid according to the agreements made between Russia and Ukraine. Appealing to all sides to cooperate in helping civilians impacted by the fighting, he urged them ""to exercise maximum restraint and refrain from any actions which could contribute to the further escalation of the situation."" Amid the furor, German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrived in Kiev on Saturday for talks with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. NATO: 'So-called humanitarian convoy' The Kiev-based government and its allies -- including the NATO alliance -- roundly condemned Russia's actions on Friday. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that the ""so-called humanitarian convoy ... can only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel."" ""The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists,"" Rasmussen said in a statement. ""We call this a direct invasion for the first time under cynical cover of the Red Cross,"" said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine's security service. The UK ambassador to the United Nations, Mark Lyall Grant, said that Russia had no support at a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday on the topic. ""It is an undeniable and blatant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and clear breach of international law and the U.N. charter,"" Lyall Grant told reporters. ""It has nothing to do with humanitarianism."" However, Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed the finger at Ukraine. He expressed ""serious concern"" to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about endangered civilians and other impacts from Ukraine's ""continued (military) escalation,"" according to the Kremlin. He further criticized what he characterized as ""Kiev's blatant attempts to hinder the delivery of Russian humanitarian aid"" into southeastern Ukraine. ""Further delay would have been unacceptable,"" a Kremlin statement said. Russian troops . Lithuania condemned Friday the killing of its honorary consul in the city of Luhansk, who Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said had been ""kidnapped and brutally killed by terrorists."" The OSCE also called for the killers of Mykola Zelenec to be brought to justice and said his murder demonstrates the urgent need to stop the violent escalation in eastern Ukraine. There's also growing international concern over the apparent massing of Russian troops at the border with Ukraine. There were up to 18,000 such ""combat-ready"" troops on Friday, a significant increase from previous public estimates by the Pentagon, according to a U.S. defense official with direct access to the latest information. The official described the units as being in a ""fully combat-capable offensive posture."" A second U.S. official said the United States has believed for weeks that some Russian troops have crossed the border as part of the convoys of military gear and weapons moving from Russia into Ukraine. Of particular concern is the apparent transport of long-range and advanced systems including at least two SA-22 surface-to-air missile system and a number of pieces of longer-range artillery. The fear is that any advance of any kind could make the ongoing fighting -- sparked last year by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia -- even worse. U.N. officials estimate that more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 5,000 have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April.

"Beijing (CNN) -- A Chinese court sentenced 55 people on terror charges before thousands of onlookers in a stadium in Xinjiang Province Wednesday, as part of a hardline response to a string of deadly attacks across the country. The trial was held in a stadium in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in the restive western province of Xinjiang, before about 7,000 spectators, according to reports. The accused were found guilty by the Higher People's Court of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of charges including intentional homicide, separatism, and organizing, leading and participating in terrorist activities. Three of the accused were sentenced to death, state media reported, for the murder ""with extreme cruelty"" of a family of four in Yining City, using blades and axes, on April 20. The court named one of those sentenced to death over the attack, whose victims included a three-year-old girl, as Abulimiti Abdullah, state media reported. Pictures from the sentencing showed the accused held on the back of pick-up trucks, dressed in orange jumpsuits and surrounded by security forces. A banner across the back of the stadium read: ""Yili Prefecture Public Judgment, Public Seizure, Public Arrest General Assembly."" Li Minghui, vice-secretary of the prefectural Communist Party committee, vowed to strike hard against terrorists. ""We have the confidence, resolution and capability to take a firm stance, form an iron hand and hit hard and fast like a thunder to vanquish the enemy's arrogant audacity,"" he was reported as saying. ""We will achieve the final victory of this war of the people to stop terrorism and maintain stability."" Report: Extremist groups busted in northwest China . 'Deplorable' show trial . Human rights organization Amnesty International called the proceedings a show trial, labeling it ""deplorable"" and saying it was no way to address public security concerns in the wake of the violence that has spread from the province. Most of those sentenced were believed to be Uyghurs, it said in a statement. ""Those responsible for the recent violent attacks have shown a callous disregard for human life and must be held to account. But speedy show trials will not deliver justice for the victims,"" said William Nee, Amnesty's China researcher. ""Hastily sentencing people after unfair trials will only exacerbate tensions."" He said Chinese authorities appeared ""more concerned with courting public opinion than justice."" ""It is highly doubtful the accused received fair trials,"" he said, adding that those sentenced were believed to be at risk of torture in detention. READ MORE: Xinjiang and tensions in China's restive west . Spate of terror . The trial follows a spate of terror attacks in public spaces across China linked to Xinjiang's Uyghur population, a mainly Turkic-speaking Muslim minority. The latest bout began when a jeep plowed into crowds in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October, killing five and injuring at least 40, and have intensified in recent months. Twenty-nine people were killed and 130 injured when men armed with long knives stormed a train station in Kunming in March. The following month an attack on a train station in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, left three dead, including the attackers, while an attack on an Urumqi market earlier this month killed at least 39. In response, police in Xinjiang launched a crackdown on extremist groups in the province, arresting 200 suspects and seizing hundreds of explosive devices, Chinese state media reported this week. The state's anti-terrorist force has been beefed up in Xinjiang, and security tightened around the country. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment towards China's Han majority in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang. Amnesty said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination, including in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization.

"(CNN) -- It's almost entirely illegal to use drones for money-making purposes in the United States. But a little Hollywood magic could change that. The U.S. government is considering a request from movie and TV producers to let them use unmanned aircraft to shoot aerial video. Currently, there's only one exemption to the Federal Aviation Administration's nationwide ban on commercial drones, called unmanned aircraft systems or UAS. That's a spot off Alaska's coast where drones are used by an oil company. But a second exemption could make it easier and less expensive to create memorable movie moments like the opening sequences from Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" and Academy Award winner ""American Beauty."" ""Unmanned aircraft systems offer the motion picture and television industry an innovative and safer option for filming,"" Neil Fried, senior vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America, said in a written statement. ""This new tool for storytellers will allow for creative and exciting aerial shots, and is the latest in a myriad of new technologies being used by our industry to further enhance the viewer experience. ""We welcome the FAA's leadership and support their guidance to safely authorize the use of UASs for the motion picture and television industry."" On Monday, the FAA officially confirmed it is considering the request, which came from seven photo and video production companies. The administration's statement acknowledged that Hollywood could see ""tangible economic benefits"" from an exemption. ""However, all the associated safety issues must be carefully considered to make sure any hazards are appropriately mitigated,"" the statement continued. Companies would still have to apply individually for permission to use drones if the exemption is approved, the FAA said. How to shoot amazing video from drones . SnapRoll Media, a production company that specializes in aerial shots, is one of the companies that have asked for the exemption. In their application, published by Ars Technica, a CNN content partner, Snaproll said shots done with lightweight, remote-controlled drones would be safer and less disruptive than current shoots that use helicopters. Snaproll said its drones weigh less than 55 pounds, including camera equipment, and almost always travel at speeds of less than 57 mph. ""All flights will occur over private or controlled access property with the property owner's prior consent and knowledge,"" the Tennessee-based company wrote. ""Filming will be of people who have also consented to being filmed or otherwise have agreed to be in the area where filming will take place."" The suggestion of an exemption marks something of a change for the FAA. As companies from Web retail behemoth Amazon to pizza chain Domino's have toyed with the idea of deploying drones, the administration has been slow to craft new rules and regulations for them. The Alaska exemption, for ConocoPhillips oil company, came only after prodding from Congress. Hobbyists in the United States are allowed to fly small drones below 400 feet for noncommercial purposes. But one of the administration's key concerns is how to allow commercial drones without endangering airplanes and other existing, manned aircraft. After a decade of pondering, the FAA said it plans to release a proposal for new regulations in November. Even if it does, it could be months, if not years, before the proposals become legally binding. In its statement, the FAA said companies from three other industries have filed similar appeals for exemptions to the federal ban on commercial drones: agriculture, power line and pipeline inspection, and oil and gas-line inspection.","Seven production companies have petitioned the FAA to use drones for aerial video .
The Motion Picture Association of America filed on behalf of them .

"(CNN) -- What the heck has happened to John McCain? First he flip-flopped on immigration reform. In 2006, Sen. John McCain was a primary co-sponsor of and worked closely with Sen. Ted Kennedy to craft immigration reform legislation that included a path to citizenship for America's undocumented immigrants. But faced with a primary challenge from a tea party Republican in 2010, McCain denied that he had ever supported a path to citizenship. McCain subsequently threw his support behind Arizona state legislation that ostensibly allows for racial profiling of Latinos and is considered one of the harshest anti-immigration laws in the nation. Then he flip-flopped on legislation meant to address the dangers of climate change. In 2003, McCain was a key supporter of so-called ""cap and trade"" legislation that would create a market-based solution to limit pollution. During his 2008 presidential run, McCain boasted of his support for cap-and-trade measures. ""We stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great,"" said McCain. ""The most relevant question now is whether our own government is equal to the challenge."" McCain, it appears, was not. By 2009, McCain was calling such measures ""cap and tax."" By 2014, McCain was blasting Secretary of State John Kerry for even talking about climate change. And now we have Bowe Bergdahl. Recently, the Fact Checker column of the Washington Post found that Senator McCain had flip-flopped on his support for a prisoner swap in exchange for the release of Sergeant Bergdahl. The Post awarding McCain a rare upside-down Pinocchio for his switch in positions. In February 2014, McCain told CNN's Anderson Cooper, ""Now this idea is for an exchange of prisoners for our American fighting man. I would be inclined to support such a thing depending on a lot of the details."" That was before Obama actually made the exchange. Then McCain said he was against it. McCain claims his objection was based on the details of the five Taliban prisoners swapped for Bergdahl but as the Washington Post Fact Checker pointed out, the details around those five specific prisoners were widely known in February when McCain originally commented. In fact, the Washington Post ran a front-page story with details about the prisoners. McCain's flip-flop, like all his others, was nothing more than political opportunism, plain and simple. Moreover, these are not the only times McCain has wildly switched positions on fundamental issues. Suzy Khimm, then of Mother Jones magazine, produced a thorough list including other flip-flops as of August 2010. But it's somehow especially stunning to hear John McCain flip-flop on the issue of Bergdahl in particular. After all, McCain is without question a true American hero. And he has been, from his earliest days, a man of principle. In 1968, a year into his imprisonment and torture as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War, McCain was offered early release â€” the North Vietnamese seeking to gain publicity points after McCain's admiral father was put in command of all U.S. forces in the region. The young John McCain refused. He would only agree to be released if every American taken prisoner before him was released as well. It was only then that McCain was subject to heinous and severe torture, including beatings every two hours. Five-and-a-half years later, the principled POW and his fellow soldiers were released and came home. They received a heroes' welcome. The New York Times put a picture of McCain's homecoming on its front page. It's important to remember that McCain was ultimately released by the North Vietnamese as part of winding down of the war. That's what happens when you end a war; you exchange prisoners â€” even the dangerous ones. In the case of the five Taliban prisoners swapped for Bergdahl, even a legal adviser from the George W. Bush administration has argued there would be no grounds to continue holding them after the war in Afghanistan officially ended later this year. And by then, they wouldn't even be useful as leverage for Bergdahl's return. Certainly John McCain knows the immense suffering and brutality of being a prisoner of war. He also knows what happens when wars end. In fact, I like to imagine that John McCain knows a lot of things including how ridiculous his repeated backtracking seems in light of his own self-proclaimed principled ""maverick"" identity. But these radical shifts in position say less about McCain as a person and more about the political party to which he belongs, a party that was for immigration reform and for cap-and-trade regulations and for doing whatever it took to bring Bowe Berdahl home up until the moment that President Obama took the same side. The modern Republican Party is desperately opportunistic and reactionary, trading whatever thin principles it may have once held to simply stand against whatever the other side is for. And John McCain, whether willingly or unwittingly, is at best an illustrative canary in the coal mine or at worst, yet again held hostage -- this time by an increasingly reckless and irrational GOP. UPDATE: An earlier version incorrectly listed McCain as being awarded the Medal of Honor.","Sally Kohn wonders why Sen. John McCain gets away with his constant flip-flops .
He was first in favor of prisoner swap for Bergdahl, she says, then was against it .
She says McCain's flip-flops are nothing more than political opportunism, plain and simple .
But the real reasons may be an desperate and reactionary Republican party ."

"Seattle -- The crops for sale carry labels like ""dark vader,"" ""uk cheese"" and ""white russian."" But the overwhelming smell of cannabis gives away the fact that there is really only one item for sale here: medical marijuana. There was little publicity for Seattle's first medical marijuana farmers market held on Sunday. No posters or signs were hung outside the market's venue, a small club where ""erotic poetry"" readings are held. Word of mouth alone though packed the hall as hundreds of people lined up to go in. They gained entrance with a recommendation from a health care provider stating that they need marijuana to treat a medical condition. ""I am actually standing upright because of cannabis, there's nothing else I found that would help me with chronic pain issues,"" said John Muise, a gaunt figure with long dangling dreadlocks. ""I couldn't even explain how my life would be if I didn't have cannabis. I would probably be addicted to opiates and in a wheelchair."" Despite the packed crowds and stands full of marijuana, the farmers market operates in a legal gray zone. ""Medical marijuana is not legal in the state of Washington,"" said state Department of Health spokesman Donn Moyer. A law passed in 1998 allows for what is called the ""medical marijuana defense"" -- that allows for juries to take into account if someone charged with pot possession was taking the drug for health purposes. Under the current law, certain health care providers like doctors or nurse practitioner can issue the recommendations for medical marijuana for a variety of ailments including cancer, HIV and anorexia. But unlike in California or Colorado where medical marijuana initiatives led to an explosion of dispensaries that provide the drug, in Washington the medical marijuana community has remained, for the most part, underground. ""Dispensaries are not legal, co-ops are not legal here,"" Moyer said. ""The intent of the law is that you receive medical marijuana from a designated provider who can only help one patient at one time. Some people are interpreting that as they provide marijuana to someone and then 15 minutes later do it again for another patient."" ""It's a city by city, county by county situation right now,"" said Philip Dawdy, a spokesman for the Sunday market and medical marijuana advocate who says there is still ""an old West"" feel to the medical marijuana community in the state. In Seattle, however, medical marijuana users have something of safe haven. A 2003 measure officially pegged arresting people for personal use of marijuana as the lowest priority for the city's police department. Still fears persist among medical marijuana users. At the market, several attendees asked the handful of news crews present not to take images of them. One couple said they would lose their jobs as teachers if the school where they worked found out they were at the event. ""This could be construed as dealing drugs,"" medical marijuana grower Ken Bell said as a line of customers grew in front of his ""Ken's Medicine Bowl"" stand. ""We need the state to clarify the gray areas."" Market organizers said they are hopeful that a bill working its way through Washington's legislature will provide medical marijuana users and growers in the state surer legal footing to operate on. In the meantime, organizers say they will hold more farmers markets and push for medical marijuana rights -- within limits. ""We don't want to be anything like California,"" market spokesman Dawdy said. ""They literally have dispensaries on top of each other in Venice Beach and out in the valley.""","Recommendation from a health care provider needed to shop at the farmers market .

"(CNN) -- A drunken English soccer supporter who attacked a former international goalkeeper during a match last Friday has been jailed for 16 weeks and given a six-year banning order. Aaron Cawley, a fan of English second division team Leeds, pleaded guilty to charges of assault and entering the field of play before being sentenced on Monday. The 21-year-old was arrested after invading the pitch during Leeds' match at Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday and shoving Kirkland in the face, knocking the one-cap England international to the ground. Cawley escaped back into the crowd after the incident, which came in the 76th minute of the game, but was arrested on Sunday. ""We are pleased to see the matter dealt with by the courts so quickly,"" said a spokesman for Leeds, which plans to ban Cawley for life once his court order expires. ""Our one disappointment is that we feel the sentence could, and should, have been considerably longer."" In March 2007, Timothy Smith was fined Â£300 and given a three-year banning order after running onto the field and attempting to punch Frank Lampard during Chelsea's FA Cup replay at Tottenham. Two years earlier, a Stoke fan was jailed for three months after attacking Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Simon Royce. British media reported that the court in Sheffield was told Cawley had been drinking heavily before the match, and that he had previously breached other banning orders. His solicitor said her client ""was absolutely disgusted by his own behavior"" and that he could not recall the incident due to his state of inebriation. Kirkland, who has played for Premier League clubs Liverpool and Wigan and represented his country in 2006, was left shaken by the attack. ""I caught a glimpse of someone coming towards me on the pitch,"" he told Wednesday's website after the match. ""I thought he was going to give me some abuse but then suddenly he came at me with both hands and I was stunned. I felt the full force and I was just shocked because you never know what could have been in his hands. ""I thought of my family watching something like that and it was not a nice feeling to think my daughter saw me assaulted like that."" Sheffield Wednesday manager Dave Jones said Leeds fans should be ""banned from every league ground."" ""They are vile animals,"" Jones said after the match. ""The authorities have to look at it and sort it."" Jones, who was found not guilty of charges of child abuse in 2000, said he was taunted throughout the game by Leeds supporters. ""The abuse aimed at me on Friday was personal. It was also wrong, it was offensive and not the first time I have endured such abuse from Leeds United supporters,"" he said in a statement on Wednesday's website on Monday. ""Why make it personal? Why were the chants aimed at me? I cannot emphasize strongly enough that I condemn any abuse of any kind from any supporter and I would stress that the vast majority of fans at every club in the country are decent and law-abiding."" The Kirkland incident came on the same day that Russian fans attacked Dynamo Moscow players using paintball guns at the club's training ground. Having arrived in camouflage at the club's training base in Novogorsk, just north of Moscow, they unleashed a flurry of paintballs at the players.","Football fan jailed for attacking Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland .

"(CNN) -- In 1954, wanderlust, a desire previously associated with nomads and hobos, officially became a competitive sport. A clique of frequent fliers -- before the term was co-opted by the airline industry -- banded together to start the Travelers' Century Club. To join, members needed a minimum of 100 country stamps in their passports. Rivalries between members and various groups eventually became cutthroat. Factions duked it out over what qualified as an official destination: The United Nations now claims 193 countries; Travelers' Century Club, 321 countries and territories; and MostTraveledPeople.com offers 873 places to methodically cross off your list. Other issues included how much dust has to gather on a traveler's boots before a visit counts. The bickering got so contentious that Guinness discontinued its listing for ""world's most traveled person."" Today, the Travelers' Century Club has more than 2,000 members and 20 regional chapters, and no surprise, the competition for the crown of most traveled remains intense. At latest count, there were four affiliate groups with members who tick off destinations the way birders might tick off white-throated needletails or upland sandpipers. Ultra-travelers . For the most part, members of these rarefied groups (many belong to more than one) enjoy camaraderie and comparing notes. After all, who else could they consult for tips on the best B&B in Chuvashia? Or commiserate with over the three times they attempted to tick off Bouvet Island, only to fail, three weeks and $25,000 later, because the icebergs were too massive for the ship to break through? ""More than anything, TCC is a social group,"" says Klaus Billep, chairman of the Santa Monica, California-based organization. ""It started at country clubs in Los Angeles before jets and the ability to get places caused an explosion of travel agents. ""In many ways, it was one of few places you could swap travel tales and learn that if you stay at this place versus that place, you'll be right on the beach and have the chance to meet the owner and his daughter who works as the chef."" 'This title cost me six marriages' Over the years, with new ways to parse destinations and titles -- endorsements and websites have come, too -- the social interaction part has become more competitive. At age 37, Charles Veley became the youngest person to bag all 321 countries and territories on the Century Club's list. Some then thought he went too far in attempting to take over the coveted Guinness World Records title by adding more official destinations to the list. Tahiti, for example, is by some official counts part of the French Republic; Veley wanted it counted on its own. John Clause, an attorney from Indiana and at the time the decade-long record holder of ""world's most traveled man,"" got his travel shorts in a knot. As he said before he died in 2008, ""This title cost me six marriages, and I do not intend to surrender my sword lightly."" Jeff Shea is another road warrior who has walked across Transylvania, sailed across the Pacific and reached the mountain summit of every continent, including Everest. He contends that he's seen far more of the world than Veley, who, after selling his successful high-tech company at the height of the dot-com boom, became so focused on marking off countries that he logged all but 70 of the club's 321 in three years. The one thing all these modern day Marco Polos agree upon is this: Naysayers who insist an obsession to collect passport stamps is an inferior way to travel are simply spitting sour grape seeds. We'll ask you to decide. Do these jet-lagged travelers suffer from dromomania, an uncontrollable psychological urge to wander? Or is all this scheming and plotting to get to the more obscure reaches of the globe a noble vocation? Here are arguments both ways. Thirteen countries in two weeks does not an expert make . Neither does living for six weeks in Provence. ""Who's to say how long is long enough?"" asks Veley. ""If you stay a week, they'll tell you you need three weeks. Stay three weeks, they'll say you need to spend the whole season. ""You can never win that game."" As far as he's concerned, ""for a complete world view, you have to go everywhere. Because the news media doesn't begin to present an accurate picture."" Veley says the more information you can get on your own, the better. ""Five hundred countries is better than 400,"" he says. ""Every place you're going to learn something new."" As of two weeks ago, Veley had been to 829 countries -- at least by his count on MostTraveledPeople.com, the site he started to help quell the Guinness furor. Travel is supposed to be fun. Why do it this way? Getting to many destinations requires massive amounts of planning, time and cash. Even then, it doesn't always work out. BIOT (also known as Diego Garcia), a British territory leased to the American military halfway between Africa and Indonesia, usually requires hiring a British law firm to secure a permit. You'll also need to inform the U.S. military base located there that you're not a Somali pirate (so they'll call down their missiles). Bouvet Island, a Norwegian possession located between Africa and Antarctica, is covered in glacial ice and penguin guano. Getting there requires cooperation from Mother Nature. You can pay the $25,000 for three attempts to get to the island, but there's no guarantee. The Russian icebreakers that take you there might still be unable to make landfall. Even Veley, one of a handful who has been to Bouvet, says there were times he was ready to throw in the towel. Bragging about all the countries you've visited makes you sound like a self-involved ass . According to Billep, bragging isn't part of the program. Rather, members seek out enlightening and useful conversation with others who share their hobby. It's like finding a fellow Depeche Mode fan who caught their ""World Violation"" tour at the Spectrum in Philly. Only a few will ever really ""get it."" There's enormous satisfaction to be had in meeting rare, kindred spirits. What's the point of being in a country for a day or two, or for that matter, a few hours? Point taken, but Fred Finn, a British-born businessman who holds the Guinness record for most air miles logged (a less contentious title than ""ultimate traveler""), flips that sentiment on its head. Over the years, Finn hasn't just traveled a lot; he's amassed an impressive rÃ©sumÃ© of experiences. He's been serenaded by John Denver (""Take Me Home, Country Roads""), spoken with Mikhail Gorbachev, had ribs with fellow first-class passenger Johnny Cash and played celebrity cricket with Pamela Anderson. He also calls Richard Branson a friend and has more tales than Scheherazade. Does all this really make you a better person? In the end, ""competitive travelers"" generally make the case that the pursuit of travel stamps is really a way to better understand the world. Sure, as Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder so eloquently put it, ""we all know that people are the same wherever you go,"" but it takes being in a place to truly understand its people and customs. Or to understand how geography explains everything -- how rain falling on one side of a mountain and not the other radically affects how people live. ""The more you travel, the more regional perspective you get,"" Veley says. ""It helps you relate to different types of people, and the world becomes more beautiful because of it. It helps you understand the chaos.""","Travelers' Century Club, for travel to 100 countries or more, has more than 2,000 members .

"(CNN) -- He took on ""the Dark Side,"" overcame a plane-load of rogue reptiles and struck down his enemies with ""great vengeance and furious anger."" However, Hollywood star Samuel L. Jackson is more at home on the genteel fairways of a golf course. The actor, whose numerous film credits include Pulp Fiction, the Star Wars prequels and, yes, Snakes On A Plane, is so dedicated to perfecting his game that he has a clause written into his contracts that allows him time off to play golf. ""They have to let me play at least twice a week,"" Jackson told CNN's Living Golf. ""Generally they either move me onto a golf course or I join a club so I can play there."" The 64-year-old plays off a six-handicap and is a regular at celebrity pro-am tournaments, having lined up at famed courses such as St. Andrews and Pebble Beach. Jackson has teed off alongside peers such as Clint Eastwood and Don Cheadle, as well as saxophonist Kenny G -- the man he rates the best amateur golfer he has played against -- but his favorite round was with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods. ""The first time I played St. Andrews (in Scotland) I actually played with Tiger,"" Jackson said. ""That's kind of a big deal. ""The first time I met him I played with him at the Dunhill (Championship) and I think his advice to me was 'Follow me' -- and I actually did. ""I didn't hit the ball as far as he did but I kind of hit the same balls."" Reluctant beginnings . Jackson was born in Washington D.C and studied in Atlanta before moving to New York to pursue an acting career. But it was in Los Angeles, the city he has now made his home, where he first discovered golf -- although it took some cunning and persuasion for friends to pique his interest. ""I had never played and they kept trying to get me to go out, and I wouldn't,"" Jackson recalled. ""They tricked me one day and told me they were going somewhere else and we ended up on a golf course. ""I didn't like the fact that they could do something that I couldn't and I started playing -- now they don't play with me!"" Jackson told the PGA Tour website that when he's not working he plays golf every day, sometimes shooting 27 holes at a time. But, despite playing the game around the globe, there is one course that Jackson rates as pretty special. ""The best course in the world I've played? That would be Augusta National where they play the Masters,"" he explained. ""When I was shooting Freedomland (filmed in the state of New York) the producers gave me as my wrap gift three rounds of golf at Augusta."" Golfing good deeds . Jackson's love of golf is now such an intrinsic part of his off-screen character that the profile on his Twitter page shows him channeling movie star in a sharp black suit -- while he holds a putter behind his back. He also blends his celebrity status with his golf game to raise funds in his annual Shooting Stars charity fundraiser. The 2013 event, held just outside London, raised funds for the Alzheimer's Association -- a charity that has a personal meaning for the actor. ""My mum passed from Alzheimer's last year -- my grandfather had it, her sister's got it, her brother had it, my paternal grandmother had it, so it seems like I'm kind of surrounded by it,"" Jackson explained. ""I may need the help of that organization at some point so I better raise some money for them!"" As henchman Jules Winnfield in 1994's breakthrough Pulp Fiction performance, Jackson memorably quoted the Bible as he sought ""the path of the righteous man"" -- and he also has advice for those seeking the perfect golf stroke. ""The first thing is keep your head down,"" he says. ""That's the hardest thing to do when you're a beginner because you always want to see where the ball is going, so you always tend to look up before you swing. ""So keep your head down, swing easy -- not hard -- find a tempo that's comfortable for you, and have fun. Don't take it seriously.""","Hollywood star Samuel L.

"(CNN) -- Police in Nigeria's capital have banned all protests planned in support of the more than 200 girls kidnapped in April. Commissioner Joseph Mbu said the proliferation of such protests ""is now posing a serious security threat"" to those living around, and driving through, demonstration sites in the capital city of Abuja. ""I cannot fold my hands and watch this lawlessness,"" he said in a statement Monday. ""Information reaching us is that too soon dangerous elements will join the groups under the guise of protest and detonate explosive(s) aimed at embarrassing the government. Accordingly protests on the Chibok Girls is hereby banned with immediate effect,"" the commissioner continued. More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in northern Nigeria in April by Boko Haram, in an act that drew international condemnation. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. Nigerians and others have accused their government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls seized in the dead of night. Boko Haram translates as ""Western education is a sin"" in the Hausa language. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Demonstrations are banned in the capital city of Abuja .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The phrase most spoken by AEG Live's co-CEO during his testimony in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial was: ""I don't recall."" Katherine Jackson and her oldest daughter, Rebbie Jackson, watched as Paul Gongaware, who was in charge of producing and promoting Jackson's ill-fated comeback concerts, testified this week that he couldn't remember sending key e-mails or approving budgets that included $150,000 a month for Dr. Conrad Murray. CNN exclusively obtained video of Gongaware's deposition in the case, which was played to jurors Wednesday. He is back on the stand for more testimony Thursday and Friday. Gongaware also denied thinking that Jackson's health was frail in the last days of his life, despite e-mails from others in the production suggesting the singer needed help. Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending the concert promoter is liable in the pop icon's death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray. AEG's lawyers argue it was Jackson who chose, hired and supervised Murray -- and their company only dealt with Murray because Jackson demanded they pay for him to be his ""This Is It"" tour doctor. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's drug overdose death and he is serving a prison sentence. Gongaware seemed to dance around some questions like Jackson doing a ""Moonwalk,"" including when he explained an e-mail to his boss' assistant in which he said he was having nightmares and cold sweats about the concerts. It was not an admission that he was concerned about Jackson's ability to do the show, he said. ""It was just playing around, joking,"" with AEG President Tim Leiweke's assistant, Carla Garcia, he testified. ""Carla is an absolute babe and I was just chatting her up,"" he said. While that testimony drew laughter in the court, it was unclear how jurors and the female judge viewed it, because Gongaware also acknowledged his girlfriend worked at AEG. Gongaware's repetition of ""I don't recall"" several dozen times under questioning by Jackson lawyer Brian Panish eventually drew laughs from jurors, including when Panish began answering for him with that phrase. After the jury left the courtroom Wednesday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos commented on the number of ""I don't recall"" responses. ""We've had a lot of that,"" she said. ""How much more of that?"" AEG exec called Jackson ""freak"" before signing concert contract . The 'smoking gun' Panish questioned Gongaware about an e-mail Jackson's lawyers call the ""smoking gun,"" which they argue shows AEG Live executives used Murray's fear of losing his lucrative job as Jackson's personal physician to pressure him to have Jackson ready for rehearsals despite his fragile health. Show director Kenny Ortega e-mailed Gongaware 11 days before Jackson's death expressing concerns that Murray had kept Jackson from a rehearsal the day before. Ortega also raised his own concerns about Jackson's health. Gongaware testified on Wednesday that he thought Ortega was ""overreacting."" His e-mail reply to Ortega read: ""We want to remind (Murray) that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary. We want to remind him what is expected of him."" Gongaware, in a video deposition played in court on the first day of the trial, said he could not remember writing the e-mail. Trust your memory? Maybe you shouldn't . Panish on Wednesday played for jurors a section of Gongaware's deposition, recorded in December, in which Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle questioned him about what he meant when he wrote to Ortega, ""We want to remind him that it is AEG, not MJ, who is paying his salary."" Boyle: ""Based on the assumptions that AEG is your company and MJ is Michael Jackson, do you have an understanding of what that means?"" Gongaware: ""No, I don't understand it, because we weren't paying his salary."" Boyle: ""So why would you write that?"" Gongaware: ""I have no idea."" Boyle: ""Now, let's go on to the next sentence. When you say 'his salary,' who are you talking about?"" Gongaware: ""I don't know."" Boyle: ""Oh, but how do you know you weren't paying his salary if you don't know who we're talking about?"" Gongaware: ""I don't remember this e-mail."" Boyle: ""Didn't you just testify that 'we weren't paying his salary'?"" Gongaware: ""AEG?"" Boyle: ""Yes. No. You just testified 'we weren't paying his salary.' You just testified to that a few seconds ago, right?"" Gongaware: ""I guess."" Boyle: ""Well, whose salary were you referring to? Dr. Murray?"" Gongaware: ""Yes."" Watch more of Gongaware's testimony here . After Gongaware began recalling in court Wednesday what he meant in the e-mail, Panish suggested it may be a case of ""repressed memories"" where ""someone doesn't remember something for three or four years."" ""You didn't have any psychotherapy to remember what you wrote here?"" Panish asked. ""You didn't like get put to sleep --"" (Judge Palazuelos injected: ""Hypnotized?"") ""--to see if you remembered this? ""No,"" Gongaware answered. Sweet controversy at Jackson death trial . The Elvis connection . Gongaware's career as a concert promoter started with Elvis Presley's last tour. He testified that he met Jackson when he was with Presley manager Col. Tom Parker in Las Vegas. Elvis' name came up in the trial on Tuesday as Panish questioned Gongaware about his knowledge of drug use during concert tours. He should have been able to recognize red flags signaling Jackson's drug use because of his experience with Presley and his time as Jackson's tour manager in the 1990s, the Jacksons contend. An e-mail to a friend two weeks after Jackson's death supports their argument, the Jackson lawyers contend. ""I was working on the Elvis tour when he died so I kind of knew what to expect,"" Gongaware wrote. ""Still quite a shock."" AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam later told reporters that Gongaware was referring to the public reaction to Jackson's death, not saying he expected Jackson would meet the same fate as Presley. Presley collapsed in the bathroom of his Memphis, Tennessee, mansion -- Graceland -- on August 16, 1977, at age 42. While his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat, the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that the abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem. Jackson died on June 25, 2009, at age 50. The coroner ruled his death was caused by a fatal combination of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol. Murray told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of propofol to treat his insomnia. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, sentenced to four years in prison and stripped of his medical license. Gongaware -- who has worked as a tour promoter for 37 years for bands including Led Zeppelin, the Grateful Dead and many others -- testified that the only artist he ever knew who was using drugs on tour was Rick James. Gongaware is currently the tour manager for the Rolling Stones North American tour.

"Madrid (CNN) -- An Iranian and three Spaniards who secretly tried to export to Iran industrial equipment that could be used to make missile parts or enrich uranium have been arrested in Spain, the Civil Guard said Monday in a statement. The European Union and the United States ban the export to Iran of certain dual-use machinery and technology that could be used to aid Iran's military program. The four suspects were arrested April 1. The Iranian man, 47, was detained in Palma de Mallorca on Spain's Balearic Islands, and a judge remanded him to prison April 3 on suspicion of contraband in dual-use material, belonging to a criminal organization and money laundering, said a Civil Guard captain with the intelligence division, who spoke on condition of not being identified. The three Spaniards are from the same family. The father, in his 70s, and a son, in his 40s, were arrested in Tarragona, in eastern Spain. A daughter, in her 40s, was arrested in nearby Barcelona. They face the same preliminary charges, but the judge released them on the condition that they do not leave Spain and report regularly to authorities, the captain said. The charges carry potential prison terms of about 10 years, he said. The investigation began last year when the Civil Guard detected that two metal-forming ""dual use"" industrial machines had been illegally imported into Spain. The three Spanish suspects were administrators of the import firm, the captain said. Authorities later determined that the machines had been acquired from a company that works in the defense sector in the United Kingdom and had been brought to Spain with the aim of waiting for an opportune time to secretly send them to Iran, violating international sanctions against Iran for the development of its nuclear and missile programs. Authorities seized two metal-forming industrial machines, which could be used to make missile casings or equipment to aid in the enrichment of uranium, the captain said. The Civil Guard also seized abundant documentation about exports and the sale of defense and double-use equipment, as well as a large amount of computer data that is being studied, the statement said. In January 2013, national police arrested two people in northern Spain and seized a trailer truck carrying 44 valves made of nickel and chromium alloy that were intended for export to be used for Iran's nuclear program, the Interior Ministry said at the time.

"(CNN) -- ""Hoylake, blown upon by mighty winds, breeder of mighty champions."" -- Bernard Darwin (1876-1961 - golf writer and grandson of British naturalist Charles Darwin) In 1930, in a small corner of England's green and pleasant land, the idea for one of golf's most desirable accoutrements was born. The champion golfer of the age -- American Bobby Jones -- won that year's British Open at Hoylake, near the city of Liverpool, as the second leg of an unprecedented grand slam of championships. But before he would tame the winds of the Wirral Peninsula, and go on to win all four major titles on offer in a single season, Jones was invited to a players' reception at the club. And it was this soiree that would sow the idea for Augusta's legendary green jacket, awarded to the winner of The Masters. ""The story goes that Jones was sitting next to a chap called Kenneth Stoker, who was captain of the club the year before,"" Hoylake club historian Joe Pinnington told CNN. ""All the captains were wearing their formal kit -- the red coats that we have. ""Jones asked about it, was fascinated by it, and eventually Stoker said to him: 'Now look here Mr. Jones, if you win the tournament this week I'll give you my coat.' ""Of course Jones won and he got the coat."" Atlanta-born Jones was afforded a ticker-tape parade in New York when he returned in early July with the British Open and British Amateur titles tucked away in his locker, along with that red blazer from Hoylake. He was the champion of a nation at a time when sport helped the American public escape the stench of poverty and despair in the wake of the Great Depression. But his mission was only half completed. Triumphs at the U.S. Open and the U.S. Amateur would follow, causing the New York Times to label Jones' achievement ""the most triumphant journey that any man ever traveled in sport."" Having completed what was known as ""the impregnable quadrilateral"" at the tender age of 28, he promptly retired, exhausted from his feats, plunging a nation and a sport into mourning. His next project was Augusta National, a place for him to play with his pals away from the spotlight, a course that would stage the first incarnation of The Masters in 1934. Three years later Augusta members started wearing green jackets to make themselves identifiable to patrons, and in 1949 it was decided that year's victor, and all the previous champions, would be issued with their own version too. ""It's a wonderful link for our golf club to have and the Masters is one of golf's great events,"" Pinnington says. ""That red jacket is now at Jones' home course -- the Atlanta Athletic Club -- in a part of their museum which is called the Hoylake Room. ""We have a wonderful reciprocation with their club, a lot of their members are members at Hoylake and we have four or five who are members there."" Jones headed for Hoylake having secured the first leg of his historic quadruple at the home of golf -- St. Andrew's in Scotland -- the week before. That made him a nine-time major champion and one of the most talked-about sportsmen of the day. Unsurprisingly, his arrival at Royal Liverpool Golf Club was headline news. ""Jones was at the height of his fame when he came to Hoylake,"" explains Pinnington, a former club captain. ""He'd eclipsed Walter Hagen and he was a phenomenal man who won 11 majors in total. ""Amateur golf was followed very closely in those days because professionals were not really socially acceptable. In 1930, they weren't allowed through the front door of clubhouses. ""Jones came at a time when magazines likes Vanity Fair and Country Life as well as The Times and The Telegraph newspapers covered golf. ""For the first time sport was on the front pages and Jones was the hero of everybody. ""He was a magnetic sort of bloke. A good-looking man with a beautiful golf swing and a wonderful temperament, very different to the bad-tempered man who arrived in 1921."" Jones had smoothed out his irascible constitution, the most famous eruption of which saw him pick up his ball and withdraw from the 1921 British Open at St. Andrew's after a disastrous start. But though he exuded a confident air during the course of his four rounds in two days at Hoylake, he grappled desperately to combat the stress that plagued him on the inside. ""He fell apart during these championships because the nerves were overwhelming,"" Pinnington says. ""He hardly ate -- he had a bit of toast and maybe a whiskey and water at the end of the day. He was in a right old ragged state. ""Although he looked totally supreme on the outside he was a complete wreck on the inside. There were a couple of British guys in contention but Jones ground out the last round to win by two from another American, Leo Diegel, and Macdonald Smith, from Scotland. ""It was a key part in his grand slam and we are amazingly lucky to have someone like that in our history at Hoylake."" The links between Hoylake and one of its most illustrious champions don't end there. Jones' ill health meant he had to decline an offer to return for the club's centenary celebrations in 1969, but contained within his correspondence was another accolade. He noted that his first competitive round in Britain came at Hoylake, during the inaugural international match between the United Kingdom and the United States in 1921, as did his last -- the 1930 Open. Jones was made an honorary member in the wake of his latter triumph -- his third, having also won the Open at Royal Lytham and St. Anne's in 1926 and at St. Andrew's the following year. It gave Hoylake a unique hat-trick -- the only other amateur golfers to have won prestigious tournament (John Ball in 1890 and Harold Hilton in 1892 and 1897) were also Royal Liverpool members. Jones died in in 1971, aged 69, but a corner of Hoylake's clubhouse is devoted to his feat and ensures his legacy lives on.","Hoylake, this year's British Open host, was the inspiration for Augusta's green jacket .

"(CNN) -- Urine and feces have been a hot topic among Hong Kongers the past week, leading to Chinese netizens calling for a boycott of Hong Kong on June 1. It all began with a dispute between locals and Chinese mainland tourists over a toddler who reportedly answered the call of nature on a Hong Kong street. Videos of the clash went viral over the last week, stirring online uproar in both Hong Kong and the mainland, prompting Foreign Policy to brand the incident ""bladdergate."" Several video clips capturing the alleged event have spread around the Internet. In one, seen by CNN, A Hong Konger can be seen yelling ""We have called the police,"" while the enraged father asks, ""Do you have kids? Don't your kids need to pee?"" The mother claimed not to know where the toilets were. Some locals came out in the parents' defense, saying, ""Don't scare the kid. It's not a big deal."" The fiasco ends when the police arrive. The parents were arrested on suspicion of theft and assault, but were not charged. Under Hong Kong's Public Cleansing and Prevention of Nuisances Regulation, no person in care or custody of any child under 12 years of age shall permit, without reasonable cause, such child to answer the call of nature in public places. The man was released unconditionally while the woman was released on bail and has to report back to the police in mid-May. The boycott pledge . When news of the clash hit the Internet, many Chinese netizens called out Hong Kongers for their perceived lack of empathy and for filming the urinating toddler. Hong Kongers countered that it was uncivilized for Chinese parents to let their kids urinate on the street. One Chinese netizen on a popular Chinese forum, Tianya, pledged to boycott Hong Kong from June 1. ""If us, the mainlanders, stopped traveling to Hong Kong for months, they will come begging us to go back,"" he said in his declaration. ""We are not entirely sealing off Hong Kong but just to show them we are god as we are the consumers."" Some netizens agreed with the action while some said it might be a conspiracy to stir conflicts between the two parties as Hong Kong 2017's universal suffrage's public consultation is on the way. Hong Kong has been fighting for a universal suffrage for the chief executive election in 2017, which has in the past been chosen by a small group of elites and said to be influenced by the Chinese government. On the other hand, similarly irritated Hong Kong netizens were thrilled at the prospect of a boycott. ""Who cares for your money, you who think shopping is an act of charity,"" said one commenter on Apple Daily, a local news website. ""Remember to keep your promise and never come to Hong Kong again."" Another said, ""It's the first movement both Hong Kong and China support!"" Mass urination? The fiasco has escalated to another, smellier level. Another pledge on the same forum was posted under the heading ""Declare war on Hong Kong's civilization!"" The poster asks Chinese tourists to let their children relieve themselves on the streets of Hong Kong during the upcoming Labour Day holiday, which spans a week from May 1. Hong Kong netizens called for a photography competition on Facebook in response, telling locals to take photos as evidence if toddlers are seen relieving themselves in public places. Sohu, a popular online news outlet and platform in China, even conducted a survey on the incident, asking: ""A mainland toddler spotted urinating on the street of Hong Kong was reported to the police. What do you think?"" Out of more than 260,000 responses, about 40% said they consider it a prejudice against mainlanders by Hong Kongers. Another 40% thought it's understandable that a child would urinate on the street if there's a line of people outside the washroom. Global Times, a tabloid owned by the state news media People's Daily, quoted academics on the case. ""Some Hong Kong citizens, especially the young, have no cultural identification with the mainland and they have always seen mainlanders as uncivilized people,"" said Zhu Shihai, a professor from the Central Institute of Socialism, in the Global Times. Zhu dismissed the incident, saying Hong Kongers were being ""overdramatic, in this case."" Zhang Dinghuai, a professor at the Contemporary Chinese Politics Research Institute of Shenzhen University, told the Global Times that people with vicious intentions have deliberately upgraded a simple incident into a conflict.","Clash between Hong Kongers and Chinese tourists after Chinese toddler filmed urinating on street .

"White Oak, Maryland (CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration announced Friday it will deny the National Resources Defense Council's petition asking it to prohibit the use of bisphenol A, commonly known as BPA, in products manufactured in the United States. However, the federal agency stressed the announcement is not a final safety determination and it continues to support research examining the safety of BPA. In 2008, the council submitted a petition asking the FDA to regulate the use of BPA in human food and food packaging. The FDA had been silent since the petition was filed more than 41 months ago. The council finally, last December, sued the administration to get some form of action. Friday's announcement is a response to that suit. BPA is a chemical used in many consumer products, including clear and hard plastics called polycarbonate used in water and soda bottles, as well as in the resin linings of food and beverage cans and containers of infant formula. The Natural Resources Defense Council responded by saying it believes the FDA ""made the wrong call."" ""BPA is a toxic chemical that has no place in our food supply,"" said a statement from Dr. Sarah Janssen, a senior scientist in the council's public health program. ""The agency has failed to protect our health and safety in the face of scientific studies that continue to raise disturbing questions about the long-term effects of BPA exposures, especially in fetuses, babies and young children,"" the statement said. ""The FDA is out of step with scientific and medical research. This illustrates the need for a major overhaul of how the government protects us against dangerous chemicals."" The Natural Resources Defense Council says the FDA's approval of BPA for use in packaging food ""results in human exposure"" to the chemical and is ""dangerous to those who use the products."" It says studies have linked BPA exposure to a number of dangerous side effects, including defects in newborns, harm to the central nervous system, increased rates of prostate and breast cancer, and metabolic changes in the body that lead to obesity and insulin resistance, which are the main causes of diabetes. In a separate news release, the council noted a group of 38 scientific experts recently published a statement saying the evidence of adverse effects of low doses of BPA from laboratory experiments on mice ""is a great cause for concern with regard to the potential for similar adverse effects in humans."" The FDA, which has been getting pressure regarding BPA exposure from other food safety groups as well the Natural Resources Defense Council, is working to remove the chemical from baby bottles and sippy cups, steps already taken by some states, such as California. Many food manufacturers have removed or are considering removing BPA from their packaging. Campbell Soup Co. recently announced it would be taking BPA out of its cans. Also, a growing body of research looking at subtle effects of low levels of BPA exposure has led the National Toxicology Program at the National Institutes of Health and the FDA to announce it has ""some concern"" about the potential effects of BPA ""on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants and young children."" However, in the FDA announcement Friday the agency noted that, in response to the petition, while evidence from some studies have raised questions as to whether BPA may be associated with a variety of health effects, there remain serious questions about these studies, particularly as they relate to humans and the public health impact of BPA. The agency also stressed that it ""has been studying and continues to study the effects of BPA and will make any necessary changes to BPA's status based on the science."" It said the agency ""is working toward completion of another updated safety review on BPA this year to include all relevant studies and publications.""","The FDA says the decision does not represent a final safety determination .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The United States knows that the leader of Pakistan's Taliban is dead because he has not appeared in public to prove that he is alive, the top U.S. envoy to the region told CNN on Monday. Baitullah Mehsud, right, and a bodyguard arrive at a meeting in South Waziristan, Pakistan, in 2004. Richard Holbrooke said that the Pakistani Taliban have not confirmed the death of Baitullah Mehsud because of an ongoing power struggle over his successor. ""The reason it's clear he's dead is that if he weren't dead, he'd be giving TV and radio interviews to prove he's not dead,"" Holbrooke told CNN's Cal Perry. Mehsud rarely gave news conferences or appeared before the media. There has been conflicting information from the Pakistani Taliban about whether Mehsud died in a suspected U.S. missile strike earlier this month.  Watch Holbrooke say Mehsud is dead » . Last week, Pakistani Taliban spokesman Maulvi Umar told CNN that Mehsud is alive, but ill, and will speak to reporters when he feels better. Other media reports have quoted another spokesman for the group as saying Mehsud is dead and a mourning period is underway. U.S. and Pakistani government officials have said they are confident that Mehsud was killed in the August 5 strike. DNA tests were reportedly being conducted to back up those claims, but U.S. officials have expressed doubt that enough genetic material would be left behind, considering the enormity of the strike. Holbrooke said Mehsud's death has sparked ""a succession crisis"" among the Pakistani Taliban.

"London (CNN) -- Scientists are to sequence the entire genome of Richard III -- the King found buried beneath an English car parking lot -- in an attempt to discover once and for all what the long-missing monarch really looked like. Experts hope the project will reveal the color of Richard's hair and eyes, and uncover the genetic markers for any health conditions he suffered, or might have been at risk of, had he not been killed, aged just 32, at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. ""It should give us an insight into his genetic make-up, his predisposition to disease,"" said Turi King, the geneticist who will lead the genome project. King, who carried out the DNA tests on the bones, proving their royal identity, said she was particularly keen ""to see whether or not Richard was predisposed towards scoliosis, for example."" If the tests succeed, they should enable historians to tell just how accurate portraits of the controversial King are, and give them an insight into whether pro-Tudor propaganda in the decades after his death meant he was painted in a deliberately unflattering light. ""There are no contemporary portraits of Richard,"" said King. ""All the portraits that exist post-date his death by about 40 to 50 years onwards. So it's going to be interesting to see what the genetic information provides in relation to what we know from the portraits."" Richard III is best known as the hunchbacked anti-hero of Shakespeare's play, whose physical deformities echo his villainous nature, and who is blamed for the murder of his nephews, the princes in the tower, but many modern historians believe that image is exaggerated, and have sought to rehabilitate his reputation. He will be the first known historical figure to have his genes studied in this way; scientists have previously sequenced the genomes of Oetzi the Iceman, a number of Neanderthals, and most recently a hunter-gatherer from Spain. Sequencing the first human genome took 13 years and cost about $3 billion; now it can be done for a fraction of that cost, in a matter of hours. Read more: Body found under parking lot is King Richard III . Richard's remains were found under a parking lot in Leicester in 2011, by archaeologists from the city's university looking for the lost Grey Friars church. Their announcement in February 2012 that the almost-complete skeleton they had uncovered -- featuring a strikingly curved spine and deadly battle wounds -- was that of a king missing for more than 500 years ignited worldwide interest. But it also sparked controversy: An argument over where the bones will be reburied -- in Leicester, close to where they were found, or in York, which some supporters believe would have been Richard's choice -- has developed into a lengthy and bitter legal battle, with no end in sight. Wherever is eventually chosen as Richard's final resting place, the genome project will ensure the king leaves behind a lasting scientific legacy. ""Once he is reinterred, everything is reinterred,"" said King. ""The bones, the samples, everything. We can't keep anything, and that's the reason for doing this now, while we can. We have the technology, so this opportunity has come along at the right time."" Once completed, the full details of Richard's genome will be published online, offering historians and scientists intriguing research opportunities. ""As we know more and more about which genes are responsible for what, we can keep going back to check for evidence,"" King said, adding that experts should be able to look for clues to everything from curly hair and obesity to lactose intolerance and heart disease. King said there was even the possibility, in future, of discovering clues to Richard's temperament. Read more: Richard III - the mystery of the king and the car park . Members of the public will also be able to access the genome, and even compare it to their own genome to see if they share a genetic link with the last Plantagenet king. ""We're all related to Richard III, it's simply a matter of degree,"" said King, ""But some people would love DNA evidence of that link, and this will mean they can check for matches,"" though she cautioned that a genetic link is not the be-all and end-all of proving a royal family tie. ""Accurate documented genealogy is more proof of relatedness than DNA, but people see DNA as a kind of magic bullet to prove everything,"" she said. One man who has both is Michael Ibsen, Richard III's closest living relative. King will also be sequencing Ibsen's genome, to look for any other genetic similarities between the pair -- aside from the matching mitochondrial DNA which allowed her to positively identify the Leicester remains as those of the long-dead English ruler. ""Theoretically, Michael Ibsen and Richard should not be genetically related any other way -- apart from the mitochondrial DNA -- after so much time, but it will be really interesting to see if there are other similarities,"" King said. The project, which is expected to cost about $165,000 (Â£100,000), is being jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust, the Leverhulme Trust and Alec Jeffreys, the scientist who developed genetic fingerprinting, and who, like King, is a professor of genetics at the University of Leicester. It will be carried out in Leicester and at the University of Potsdam in Germany. So could the controversial King ever be cloned? The experts insist that would be impossible -- for a host of reasons -- ""you can't clone anything from fragmentary DNA,"" says King. ""Practically, you can't -- and morally, you can't,"" insists Dr. Dan O'Connor, head of medical humanities at the Wellcome Trust. ""It's a whole different ethical issue.""","Scientists announce plans to sequence the entire genome of King Richard III .

"(CNN) -- Six members of mine-removal team were killed and three others were abducted following an ambush by gunmen in western Afghanistan on Thursday, a police official said. The attack took place as the team was traveling to work in the Kohsan district of Herat province. All of them worked for the HALO Trust, a UK-based mine clearance agency, according to Abdul Rauf Ahmadi, a spokesman for Herat's police chief. The organization has 150 mine defusing teams and employs more than 3,000 Afghans, it says on its website. It also destroys other munitions. Since the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, multiple warring parties have laid landmines, bringing the total number of mines to as many as 640,000, Halo Trust reports. Afghanistan is one of the most-mined countries in the world, according to HALO. In January, armed men abducted 68 members of another landmine-removal team. 4 service members among 16 killed in eastern Afghanistan attack .","The landmine crew was on its way to clear areas of Herat province .

"(CNN) -- Our bikes rattle over the cobbles as we leave Grote Markt in central Ypres and nose our way toward the Menin Gate. On July 9, this stone arch memorial to the thousands killed in battles around this pretty Belgian market town between 1914 and 1918, will see the riders of the Tour de France pass through. The centenary of World War I looms large over this year's Tour and organizers have ensured that the race pays fitting tribute to the millions who lost their lives on the Western Front. Stages also go through the Somme and Verdun, key sites where Allied and German forces engaged in a brutal war of attrition. These stages are also a fitting way to commemorate riders of the prewar races who lost their lives in the fighting. Lucien Petit-Breton, Francois Faber and Octave Lapize, winners of the tour in 1907/8, 1909 and 1910 respectively, were all killed in action. Marcel Kerff, who raced in the first Tour in 1903, was among the first Belgians to be killed in August 1914. Cycling a way of life . This year is the first time that the Tour passes through Ypres and, despite the air of remembrance, excitement is building. Cycling is a way of life here, with the ""Cobbled Classic"" Tour of Flanders tackling some of the pretty, winding country lanes of the surrounding region. My guide, Jerome, fully kitted out in Lycra, hands me gingerbread for much-needed energy as we read the myriad names on the walls of the Menin Gate before we take on another cobbled lane and leave the town behind. The route to Arenberg follows wider, main roads, so Jerome leads us away from the traffic to explore the excellent tourist riding routes that the local government has signposted. Soon, we're heaving up a 12% gradient climb to the top of one of the few hills in this flat region. The views back to the spires of the churches in Ypres are huge and it's easy to see why this high ground was treasured by the Germans during the war. It allowed them to launch massive attacks on the town, which was flattened by artillery and completely rebuilt during the 1920s. Loudest explosion ever . We press on, cycling to the Pool of Peace, a pretty pond surrounded by trees that's just one of a number of craters created after a series of huge explosions under German lines in June 1917. At the time it was the loudest explosion ever and its noise could even be heard in London. Across the road from this once barren place is Lone Tree Cemetery, a beautifully maintained spot where Allied miners killed in the explosions were laid to rest. It's hard to square such chaos and noise with the peace and quiet that abounds in this now green corner of Belgium. Back in Ypres after a 45-kilometer (28 mile) ride that also takes in a thigh-stinging cobbled climb to the towering French Memorial at the top of Kemmelberg, I call in at the In Flanders Fields Museum (+32 57 23 92 20) to meet researcher Annick Vandenbilcke. Her team is currently pulling together a display detailing the history of sports and WWI, with cycling a large part of their focus. In the hushed reading room, she explains about Belgian troops cycling into battle in the early days of the war. She shows me photos of soldiers and their trusty steeds. With the dawn of war, racing bikes were replaced by more stout models, as a modern form of cavalry briefly held sway over the Western Front. Battlefield perspective . The next morning I opt for a leisurely ride to see more of the key battlefield sights and cemeteries. I ease my bike out of Ypres and follow the designated Peace Route, which takes in the Tyne Cot (Allied) Cemetery, the ruins of the much fought over Hill 60, the superb Passchendaele 1917 Museum (+32 51 77 04 41) and Langemark, where German troops lie buried. This ride is much less taxing than the Tour de France/Spring Classic route I tried the day before and my guide Patrick and I are able to ride side-by-side along a series of well maintained cycle paths. Fellow riders are scarce, most tourists preferring to take a bus tour. Riding up to these historic spots, however, affords a better idea of just what the soldiers who fought so valiantly would have gone through. This close to the ground, stopping every 10 minutes to see another cemetery, another crater, it's possible to see how small the gains were for both sides, how futile the loss of life for barely 20 feet of land. The Tour may only zip through Ypres and Flanders, but anyone with more time than the world's speediest cyclists would do well to rent a bike and enjoy a leisurely trip around this historic countryside. Well marked routes, peaceful resting spots and a sense of remembrance at every turn make this a good way to reflect on the centenary of one of the most vicious wars in history. Alternative WWI bike rides . An excellent circular route runs from Albert to La Boiselle and Poizieres taking in the Thiepval memorial before heading to Beaumont Hamel and the new Newfoundland Memorial and trenches. The end point, in Albert, features the stunning Basilica with the Golden Virgin. Another ride from Le Cateau to the cemetery at Le Pommereuil and then Maison Forestiere follows in the footsteps of WWI poet Wilfred Owen. It takes in a memorial to Owen and his grave in Ors, where he fell in the last days of the war. Also recommended is the ride from Peronne, where the Museum of the Great War is housed in a beautiful chateau. It takes in key Battles of the Somme sights, including the South African Memorial at Delville Wood and the memorial museum at Longueval. For more information visit Cycling in Flanders.

"(CNN) -- Apple's fingerprint sensor, Touch ID, is the flagship feature on the iPhone 5S. But it doesn't always work the way it should. Since the sensor's introduction in September, a growing number of issues have surfaced — including everything from phones that don't recognize when a finger is present to those that don't approve fingerprints they're supposed to approve. What's going on here? While faulty software or hardware could be to blame in a few cases, the problem might also be you. Determining the real culprit requires a closer look at how Apple's sensor technology really works. Touch ID is composed of an 8 x 8 millimeter, 170-micron-thick capacitive sensor located just beneath the home button on the 5s. This is used to capture a 500-pixel-per-inch (ppi) resolution image of your fingerprint. The sensor can read pores, ridges, and valleys. It can identify arches, loops, and whorls. It can even recognize fingerprints oriented in any direction. When you place your finger or thumb on the sensor, it looks at the fingerprint pattern on the conductive sub-dermis layer of skin located underneath the dermis layer. It also measures the differences in conductivity between the tops of the ridges and the bottoms of the valleys in your prints in this layer. This is more accurate than looking at the dead surface of the skin alone, which is constantly changing and isn't conductive. 13 of the Year's Best Infographics . This capacitive sensor is made of raw silicon. As such, it tends to be very fragile and susceptible to performance problems caused by dust, moisture, and electrostatic discharge, or ESD. To protect and insulate the sensor, Apple layered laser-cut sapphire crystal on top of the silicon. It chose sapphire for a few reasons. The material is very clear, and it acts as a lens for your fingerprint. It's also hard (it scores a 9 on the Mohs scale of hardness), which means it's difficult to scratch. If the home button does get scraped or scuffed, the images sent to the Touch ID sensor will be flawed and it will cease to work properly. What's more, a stainless steel ring encircles the button and acts as a capacitive touch switch, turning the actual touch sensor on and off when a finger is present so it doesn't eat up your iPhone's battery life. Which Should You Buy: Xbox One or PlayStation 4? After you register your fingerprint — a process known as enrolling — an encrypted mathematical representation of that information is stored on the device's A7 processor in what's called the ""secure enclave."" When the sensor captures an image, software algorithms determine whether the print is a match with the stored information or not. A match allows access to the homescreen. A non-match won't. There are obviously a few possible points of failure in this process, but it all hinges on first getting that robust fingerprint data. ""Any good biometric has to start with a high-quality image,"" Integrated Biometrics' CEO Steve Thies told Wired. His company makes a variety of compact fingerprint sensors that use a different method from Apple's Touch ID (electroluminescence and a thin film transistor) to read fingerprints. Basically, the larger the sensor, the easier it is to pick up a more accurate representation of your full fingerprint because it's working with more data. This makes it easier for recognition algorithms to confirm that your fingerprint actually belongs to you. But a larger sensor also introduces two problems: cost, in the case of a capacitive scanner like Apple's, and thickness, in the case of another popular fingerprint technology, optical sensing. (You've probably used the latter at the DMV or gym.) The 13 Best Movies You Didn't See in 2013 . Based on what we've seen from Apple's patent applications, it's highly likely the company considered other implementations of a touch sensor. But ultimately, it opted for a smaller version that could more easily fit inside the home button. Apple partially gets around the small sensor issue using the enrollment process, which includes rolling your finger around to try to capture every microscopic nook and cranny on your finger. Then, at least, it has a large source to pull from, even if it's only scanning a section of that each time you tap your finger. Still, the less data you have from a fingerprint to process, the harder it is to get a match. Precise Biometrics COO Patrik Lindeberg offers a good analogy: If you have a picture of a face and you see only a small part of that picture — the eyes, or part of one eye — it will be hard to recognize if it is a friend, or someone you don't know. If you have the full face, it's easy to process. Seeing only a portion of a fingerprint sets higher and higher requirements on software algorithms, Lindeberg says. Indeed, the more sensitive the algorithm (to get a more exact match), the more false-negatives (failed when it should have passed) are produced, which may frustrate a valid user, according to Kevin Luowitz, CTO of biometric identity service startup CLEAR. 16 Gifts Every Music Freak Will Love . ""The challenge is then to find that happy balance of acceptable false-negatives and false-positives and user experience,"" Luowitz says. For security's sake, you would want the algorithm to veer towards false-negatives rather than false-positives. Apple's Touch ID algorithm is designed to learn and improve over time — with each scan, it checks if it is a better reading than what is stored, and can update the master data for your print this way. This algorithm could certainly be changed or improved through iOS updates, as well. User error, and a lack of knowledge about biometrics and how they work, could also be causing some people's issues with Touch ID. ""A lot of us in the industry, we are very impressed by the job Apple has done with Touch ID,"" Lindeberg said. ""But on the consumer side, a lot of people have never used biometrics at all."" Twitter Founder Reveals Secret Formula for Getting Rich Online . There are a variety of small things that could be going on to interrupt a successful Touch ID experience. First, for it to work properly, your finger needs to make contact not just with the sapphire of the home button, but also the stainless steel ring surrounding it. Next, the sensor itself works by measuring electrical differences between the ridges and valleys of your fingerprints. If your hands are too dry, it's going to be difficult for your print to be recognized (this could be a growing problem in the dry winter months ahead). Conversely, if your fingers are too moist or oily, recognition can also fail, as those valleys get filled. If the button gets dirty, as it likely will over time, you'll also want to clean it to keep Touch ID working properly. Apple suggests using a clean, lint-free cloth. But what about that touch sensor itself? Some have worried that, like traditional capacitive-based fingerprint sensors, it will degrade over time. Thies of Integrated Biometrics thinks that as long as the sapphire crystal and metal ring are not damaged and are properly sealed, the sensor should last the life of the phone. Capacitive sensors in the past were unprotected, or covered in a very thin layer of carbon, and thus were very fragile. The Best Map Ever Made of America's Racial Segregation . For those experiencing Touch ID issues that cause their phone to freeze, or to not work as well over time, restarting the phone or recalibrating the sensor are your best bets. And if you're new to Touch ID or having trouble, Apple also has a guide you can reference for help. Fingerprint sensors may not be a new technology. But Touch ID is certainly a new implementation of it. It's bound to experience some bumps as Apple tweaks its algorithms, and as users get accustomed to using biometrics on a daily basis. At the very least, by understanding how it works and the inherent pitfalls of fingerprint sensors, we can help minimize those issues ourselves.

"(CNN) -- The great director Alfred Hitchcock used to describe the distinction between surprise and suspense in terms of a bomb placed underneath a table. A bomb specialist (Jeremy Renner) finds more than he bargained for in ""The Hurt Locker."" If two people sit at the table and the bomb suddenly goes off, Hitchcock explained, that's surprise. But if an audience watches the bomb get placed under the table, and the people at the table have an innocuous conversation, and the bomb is set to go off in a few minutes, and time ticks away while the audience fidgets -- that, said Hitchcock, is suspense. ""The Hurt Locker"" director Kathryn Bigelow had plenty of both to work with. ""The Hurt Locker,"" which opens in limited release June 26 and wider throughout July, concerns a Baghdad-based American bomb disposal unit in the Iraq war. It's the job of the unit, and particularly Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), to find and defuse the bombs set around the city, a constant battle during the film's 2003-04 time frame. The IEDs (improvised explosive devices, planted by insurgents) the unit must deal with are a constant presence -- and cunningly planted. One is in an abandoned vehicle outside a government building. Another is implanted in the chest cavity of a murdered youth. Others are left in trash heaps, buried in the ground and attached to an unwilling suicide bomber.  Watch a clip from the movie » . Bigelow, who directed from journalist Mark Boal's script, gives the film a documentary style, shooting from the perspective of bomb-finding robots, the windows of nearby apartments and even the inside of James' heavy-duty high-tech protective suit, which resembles nothing so much as a real-life military version of the spacesuits worn by the astronauts in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The cast and crew primarily shot in Amman, Jordan, as well as near the Iraqi border, heightening the realism. The bombs aren't in some remote desert; they are placed on city streets, among people and soldiers trying to go about their business. ""I wanted to create a real you-are-there, boots-on-the-ground feeling,"" Bigelow (""Point Break,"" ""K-19: The Widowmaker"") said in a joint phone interview with Boal. ""But I wanted to humanize the film, ground it in geography using the canvas of the city."" ""The Hurt Locker"" -- the expression refers to the pain of explosions -- is based on Boal's reporting for Playboy. The journalist and screenwriter, who also wrote the story on which ""In the Valley of Elah"" was based, was embedded with a bomb squad for several weeks. He observed that although the units have the latest technology -- along with the suits and robots, the men communicate through helmet microphones and protect one another with various guns and ordnance -- bomb disposal still comes down to experience and wire cutters. ""The technology is only useful up to a point,"" he said. ""It doesn't cure everything. You only have to open up the newspaper to see how much damage [bombs] can do."" In the film, James is an adrenaline-fueled expert who joins an Explosive Ordnance Disposal squad after its previous leader, played by Guy Pearce, is killed in action. James has to win over a by-the-book sergeant (Anthony Mackie) and a despairing specialist (Brian Geraghty) while trying to get through the five-plus weeks until the company's tour is over. The movie doesn't gloss over the challenges of the duty -- Geraghty's specialist regularly meets with a therapist, while Renner and Mackie's characters lock horns over the safety of James' methods -- but also showcases the heroism of men doing a thankless job in a war zone. Indeed, the film barely scratches the surface in showing the sheer volume of IEDs: A bomb disposal unit could face a dozen a day, Boal said. ""The Hurt Locker"" also proved a showcase for its performers, some of whom ended up in the film almost by accident. Along with its film stars -- there are cameos from Ralph Fiennes, David Morse and Evangeline Lilly -- the movie gave screen time to actors forced out of Baghdad during the war. ""A great surprise was, of the hundreds of thousands of refugees living in Amman, many were actors. There was a fairly big theatrical community in Baghdad,"" Bigelow said. ""They were really grateful for the opportunity to act again."" ""The Hurt Locker"" has its own challenges. It's being released during summer movie season, a time when people welcome the fake explosions of action films but may find the tense struggles of real bomb disposal experts too much to take. But the film also has much in its favor (including, for studio bean counters, a low budget). It's won a number of prestigious awards (including four honors at the Venice Film Festival), and it's received glowing reviews. "" 'The Hurt Locker' is a near-perfect movie about men in war, men at work,"" wrote Time's Richard Corliss. ""[It's] one of the rare war movies that's strong but not shrill, and sympathetic to guys doing an impossible job."" Bigelow, who says the film fits comfortably in the war-movie adventure genre, said she was drawn to the ""opportunity to look at the heroism of these men,"" what that bravery costs and what it saves. She hopes she's succeeded. ""The film,"" she said, ""doesn't let you forget.""","""The Hurt Locker"" is about a bomb squad in Baghdad in 2003-04 .

"(CNN) -- Have you ever dreamed of dog mushing through Alaska, climbing El Capitan or running the ultimate underground sand mine challenge? Whatever your interests, there's an inspirational adventure for every taste and skill level in Lonely Planet's new book ""1000 Ultimate Adventures."" Lonely Planet's picks include the world's craziest caves, greatest airborne adventures, best spots to catch a big wave and the most thrilling canyoning, among others. Lonely Planet editors made the final selections after gathering nominations from their authors, contributors and larger Lonely Planet community. Of those 1,000 adventures around the world, 85 are located in the United States. While most of us may never qualify to race the famous Iditarod challenge from Anchorage to Nome, the race might inspire you to try a guided dog mushing trip. And while you don't need to do all 8,000 miles of the Triple Crown of Hiking, the idea might encourage you to hike a part of the Appalachian Trail. ""We hope people find the inspiration to embark on one of these adventures,"" said Emily K. Wolman, editor-at-large at Lonely Planet. ""The addition of 'adventure' offers the further realization that you're capable of more than you thought, as it takes you out of your comfort zone, pushes your boundaries and increases your confidence."" CNN asked Lonely Planet's editors to recommend 10 U.S. adventures to readers. Will they inspire you to take a more daring vacation? The Iditarod, Alaska . Known as ""the last great race,"" the Iditarod was first held in 1973 to promote Alaska's dog-sledding heritage. Held the first Saturday in March, the nearly 1,100-mile race from Anchorage to Nome is famous for its tough tundra and climate. It can take experienced mushers and their dogs anywhere from nine to 15 days (or more) to complete. Not qualified to race in the Iditarod? Novices can head to Fairbanks, often called the dog-mushing capital of the world, for a guided overnight trip to get a sense of the incredible beauty of Alaska. Triple Crown of Hiking . Never mind that hiking just one of the three longest trails in the U.S. -- the Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide Trail or the Appalachian Trail -- is an enormous commitment of body, resources and time. Even hiking 15 miles per day, it could take you 18 months to complete all three hikes. Conquer all three and you'll have hiked nearly 8,000 miles and achieved the Triple Crown of Hiking. Whether you're a novice or don't have much vacation time, a day hike is a nice way to get a taste. (Mount Washington is on the Appalachian Trail and is part of a New Hampshire state park.) Surfing Jaws, Hawaii . The world's best big wave surfers head to Maui's North Shore in the winter to try to conquer Jaws, one of the biggest surf breaks in the world. Waves as high as 60 to 70 feet have been reported. To safely see the professionals take on Jaws, bring your binoculars and lawn chair to Peahi Cliffs and catch the view. Achieving Zero Gravity, Cape Canaveral, Florida . You don't have to go into outer space to achieve zero gravity if you've got $5,000 to book a flight on Zero Gravity Corp.'s specially outfitted Boeing 727-200F known as G-Force One. About 30 minutes after taking flight, the airplane flies up and down to create the sensation of zero gravity. You'll feel one-sixth of your earthly weight. Check the company's flight schedule for other departure cities. Climbing El Capitan, Yosemite National Park, California . El Capitan at Yosemite National Park is known as the rock where big wall rock climbing began, and the views from the top are spectacular. The nearly 3,600-foot vertical wall isn't thought to be difficult or technical for experienced climbers, but it's long. It takes many climbers about five days to ascend, and they sleep in slings hanging from the rock during their journey. To admire the climbers from a distance, head to the eastern end of Yosemite's Wawona Tunnel to admire El Capitan, Half Dome and other Yosemite legends. Canyoning the Grand Staircase, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Utah . Less known than Utah's Arches and Zion National Parks, Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument covers about 1.7 million acres in southern Utah and is much less crowded than the two national parks. The Escalante has long, gorgeous canyons known as slots for people who love canyoning. For people who want to move through the monument at a slower pace, the Grand Staircase is packed with millions of years of geologic history, including dinosaur fossils, marine fossils (from when oceans covered this area) and Navajo sandstone. Winter wolf tracking, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming . Sure it's cold during the winter at Yellowstone National Park, and some of the roads are closed. But the 3 million people who visit the park during the summer are also gone. The landscape is pristine and the wildlife spotting even better than usual as some animals head to lower elevations in winter. Hire a guide to track the lovely grey wolf; with temperatures dropping to -4 degrees Fahrenheit in winter, you don't want to get lost in this beautifully wild place. Snowshoeing in the White Mountains, New Hampshire . The White Mountains of New Hampshire are popular for winter outdoor sports enthusiasts because they keep their snow longer than other regions of the United States. But the weather there can be intense and unpredictable. Even if you're experienced in snowshoeing, you'll need reliable winter weather navigation and avalanche preparedness. It's not for the novice traveler. Sandmine Challenge, Missouri . When you mix running with spelunking â€” the exploration of caves â€” you get ""sperunking"" at the annual Sandmine Challenge each February in Crystal City, Missouri. Technically, the 4-mile race is held under Crystal City, located about 35 miles south of St. Louis. Competitors in the underground race through an old sand mine. They run, climb, wade and crawl almost entirely on a sand surface. That surface is sometimes wet and sometimes dry, sometimes shallow and sometimes deep. Race proceeds benefit PayBack Inc., a St. Louis nonprofit juvenile restitution/community service agency. Snorkeling with the Manatees, Crystal River, Florida . The natural springs of Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge are warm enough for manatees during the Florida winter season. But humans might still need wetsuits if you want to swim with the manatees between October and March. Snorkeling trips are recommended to view these social creatures. (They don't like bubbles from scuba tanks.)","Catch a killer wave off of Maui's North Shore (or watch from a nearby cliff)

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Suicide bombings targeting Shiite Muslims on Tuesday killed 16 people in Pakistan, 13 in Lahore and three in Karachi. The Lahore blast occurred in front of a market and near a procession of Shiite mourners commemorating the 40th day of Ashura, which observes the death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson. In Karachi, a suicide bomber riding a motorcycle blew himself up next to a police van at a security checkpoint outside another Shiite festival, police said. Two police officers were killed in the blast. Police say Shiites were the target. The attacks reflect the sectarian violence that erupts in Pakistan from time to time. Shiite Muslims are a minority in Pakistan, a Sunni majority country. Zahid Pervez, medical superintendent at a hospital in Lahore, told reporters that dead bodies, including one woman, were brought to the hospital. Police said at least four officers were killed. Pervez said 52 injured people were also brought to the hospital, and 15 of them were in critical condition. Shakir Ullah Shakir, a spokesman for the Fedayeen-e-Islam, said his group targeted the Lahore procession and labeled the Shiites enemies of Islam. The group is an offshoot of the Pakistani Taliban and Laskhar-e Jangvim Sunni militant groups who are notorious for targeting Pakistan's Shiites. One of the senior leaders of Fedayeen-e Islam is Qari Hussein -- widely believed to be the trainer of child suicide bombers for the Pakistani Taliban. Nayab Haider, Lahore police spokesman, told CNN the suicide bomber was between 13 and 15 years old and that the boy tried to enter the procession carrying a bag. Moments after police stopped him, the attacker blew himself up, Haider said. Local TV reports showed footage of debris and rescue crews whisking away injured people. Pakistani intelligence agencies had warned Shiite religious leaders in Pakistan's major cities about the threat of attacks targeting events commemorating the holy day.","Shiite Muslims were targets of the attacks, police say .

"(CNN) -- Iceland is losing its only three McDonald's restaurants as a result of the poor economic situation in the country. Businessman Magnus Ogmundsson, who owns the only McDonald's franchise in Iceland, said it had become too expensive to operate the restaurants after Iceland's currency, the krona, plunged in value. ""The krona is quite weak and we are buying everything in euros, and we have very high tariffs on imported agricultural products,"" he told CNN on Tuesday. In January 2008, it cost more than 95 Icelandic krona to buy one euro, according to the Central Bank of Iceland. Tuesday, that price had shot up to more than 186 krona. That means the currency is worth half as much today as it was in January 2008 -- and things priced in euros now cost twice as much to buy. Ogmundsson said the McDonald's Corporation worked with him to find a solution, but in the end he had no choice but to close. There was ""good cooperation"" with McDonald's, Ogmundsson told CNN. ""No hard feelings."" McDonald's said it had become financially prohibitive to continue operating in Iceland because of ""the unique operational complexity of doing business in Iceland combined with the very challenging economic climate in the country."" It said there are no plans to seek a new franchise partner in that country. The three stores will close at midnight Saturday, but they will reopen as an independent chain called Metro, with more domestic ingredients and fewer imported products. ""We believe we can be more successful with our own brand,"" Ogmundsson said. A McDonald's Big Mac hamburger currently sells for the equivalent of $5.29, making Iceland one of the most expensive places in the world to buy the sandwich. Only Norway and Switzerland charge more, according to the countries listed on the Economist magazine's Big Mac Index, published in February. A Big Mac costs about $3.54 in the United States, $2.19 in Australia, $5.07 in Denmark, $1.66 in South Africa, and $1.52 in Malaysia.","Iceland is losing its only three McDonald's restaurants after economic collapse .

"(CNN) -- The row over same-sex marriage could see thousands of Christians flocking to Chick-fil-A on Wednesday, while same-sex couples will turn up at the fast-food chain Friday for public displays of affection. Both events are intended as mass shows of support by people on both sides of the marriage issue and mark the latest round in a longstanding beef that gay and lesbian rights groups have with Chick-fil-A's leadership, which has openly espoused biblical values, not only in its operating principles but in its conservative definition of family as well. The controversy came to a boil after an interview with the fast food restaurant chain's president and COO Dan Cathy appeared in The Baptist Press on July 16 and he weighed in with his views on family. ""We are very much supportive of the family -- the biblical definition of the family unit,"" Cathy said. ""We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that."" Proponents of same-sex marriage spread Cathy's comments, eventually creating a firestorm of criticism on social media, including assertions that his comments and position were bigoted and hateful. A handful of politicians joined in denouncing or backing Cathy's remarks. Opinion: Religious liberty under threat . Former GOP presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum encouraged people to show their support for Chick-fil-A by buying food there Wednesday. Huckabee dubbed the day ""Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day"" and touted in his TV and radio shows and online. Over 550,000 visitors to Huckabee's event page on Facebook have responded that they will participate. The action enjoys the support of the Rev. Billy Graham. Proponents of same-sex marriage have organized a simple counterprotest for Wednesday, asking people to donate the approximate cost of a Chick-fil-A meal, about $6.50, to gay and lesbian rights groups, according to the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). Friday's protest promises to be the more visible, as GLAAD is backing a ""National Same-Sex Kiss Day"" to be held at Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide and encourages participants to take and post photos to the Internet. The organization says on Facebook that this particular protest is not a response to Huckabee's call to demonstration and that it was announced July 19 -- three days after the interview with Chick-fil-A's president . GLAAD encourages supporters not to go in groups and to keep the kisses on the conservative side. Currently, same-sex marriage is legal in six states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, along with the District of Columbia. Washington and Maryland voted this year to allow same-sex marriages, but the laws have not taken effect. Another five states -- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- allow civil unions, providing state-level spousal rights to same-sex couples. Opinion: The right way and the wrong way to protest Chick-fil-A . President Barack Obama, who previously opposed same-sex marriage, said in June he now supports it. At least four Democratic officials in three major northern U.S. cities spoke against Cathy's views, some essentially telling the Atlanta-based restaurant chain not to try to expand in their cities. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino told the Boston Herald last week he doesn't want Chick-fil-A in his city. The company is considering opening a location there. ""Chick-fil-A doesn't belong in Boston. You can't have a business in the city of Boston that discriminates against a population,"" he said. Menino also wrote to the company, urging Chick-fil-A officials to ""back out of your plans to locate in Boston."" Philadelphia City Councilman James Kenney sent a letter to Cathy, telling him to ""take a hike and take your intolerance with you"" and vowing to introduce a resolution at the next council meeting condemning the company. And Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said ""Chick-fil-A's values are not Chicago values."" This drew perturbed reactions from conservatives. ""I have been incensed at the vitriolic assaults on the Chick Fil-A company because the CEO, Dan Cathy, made comments recently in which he affirmed his view that the Biblical view of marriage should be upheld,"" Huckabee writes on the Facebook page calling for the protest to support the sandwich company. Opinion: Chick-fil-A and free speech . He went on to accuse ""the left"" of too often taking a stand on ""same sex marriage, abortion, or profanity"" and of labeling Christians as ""homophobic, fundamentalists, hate-mongers, and intolerant,"" if they ""affirm traditional values."" Although Chick-fil-A's business stands to both benefit and suffer this week, the company has announced the appreciation day was not its idea. Earlier it said it planned to stay out of the marriage debate. ""Going forward, our intent is to leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena,"" the company announced in another statement. Are there demonstrations near you, or are you participating? Let us know on CNN iReport.

"(CNN) -- Talk shows have proliferated in Egypt since the beginning of the January 25 revolution nearly two years ago. One host has become particularly famous, to the point of being described as the ""Jon Stewart of the Arab world."" Bassem Youssef was even a guest on ""The Daily Show"" itself in June, and recently CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour interviewed him about freedom of speech in Egypt. In the aftermath of the passing of Egypt's new constitution, it seems Youssef himself may become an example of the ultimate test of that very freedom. Since Youssef -- a 38-year-old heart surgeon -- hit the airwaves in 2011, he's received a great deal of criticism for his satirical style, expressed in a quintessentially Egyptian idiom and flair. No one, it seems, escapes his sharp tongue -- if they are in the political arena or have affected public discourse, then they're fair game. The more significant their influence and impact, the more they can expect to be lampooned on Youssef's weekly program -- called, simply, ""The Program."" All the famous members of the political opposition today, such as the Nobel Laureate Mohammed el-Baradei, as well as all the major candidates in this year's historic presidential election, have been the subject of spoof on ""The Program."" The show's latest season began a few weeks ago, and, as expected, the country's new president, Mohamed Morsy, as well as his ""renaissance"" project to improve Egypt, was critiqued and scoffed at for political failings. News: Morsy praises voters as constitution becomes law . While Jon Stewart may be unpopular in certain sections of America, it's hard to imagine him being sued or censured for his scathing wit. In Egypt, however, the very day after the new constitution was approved in a poorly attended vote on December 22, a lawyer filed a complaint with the prosecutor general against Youssef for ""insulting"" President Morsy on his show. The complaint involves one of Youssef's recent episodes, when Youssef affectionately held a pillow imprinted with the president's picture amid hearts. If the prosecutor takes it up, it could become a serious case. Other threats have come from religious radicals. Youssef is, in his own words, a ""proud Muslim,"" and has made it clear on his show and in interviews that he takes his religion seriously. Like many Egyptians, he is particularly sensitive to a religious discourse that divides, encourages polarization and incites hatred. His show has mocked the sectarian and heterodox preachers and journalists who promote such sentiments. In response, many of those same figures have viciously attacked Youssef's program, claiming that it is ""religiously impermissible."" The public, however, seems uninterested in such politicization of religion, and more mainstream religious figures, such as Habib Ali al-Jifri of the Tabah Foundation, declared that the abuse of religion in the discourse Youssef was criticizing was a real problem. Opinion: Middle East will muddle through 2013 . But Youssef's program is not really the point. Rather, it is a test case. The reaction to his show touches upon two key issues for post-revolution Egypt: freedom of expression, particularly with figures in authority, and the reaction of Egyptian society toward the abuse of religion for sectarian, political gain. The protests that led to former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak's downfall were indelibly linked to breaking the curtain of fear that surrounded any criticism of a political figure. Egyptian society is unlikely to favor going back to that kind of public atmosphere. While the overwhelming majority of Egyptians are not given or sympathetic to sectarian or radical ideas, many were unaware -- or ignored -- that there is a potent minority that supports such notions. How Egyptians now respond in terms of both issues will affect not only Youssef's television program, but how Egypt itself will develop in the months and years to come. Incidentally, with true Egyptian humor, Youssef responded to the news of the legal complaint against him in a way that shows he still intends to carry on: He asked Morsy to autograph the pillow in question. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H.A. Hellyer.","Bassem Youssef, a heart surgeon, is a satirical sensation on Egyptian TV .

"(CNN) -- They're among the rarest instruments in the world, but they'll be discarded come spring. They're so fragile even the players' breath risks nudging them out of tune. Turn up the temperature in the concert hall and you'd have, not a finely chiseled viola, flute or conga, but a glass of water. ""And you'd be healthier for drinking it!"" says Tim Linhart, ice-instrument maker extraordinaire to an orchestra playing a series of concerts throughout the winter in the remote Swedish town of Luleå, just beneath the Arctic Circle. Hearing is believing . Hearing really is believing when it comes to these evanescent instruments made -- bar the strings and other odd parts of metal or wood -- entirely from frozen water. Linhart has held ice concerts not only in Sweden over the past 15 years but also in far-flung locations from Beaver Creek, Colorado, to the Italian alps. His main problem, he says, in attracting a greater audience to the genre is people's incredulity that an ice instrument could make more than the most rudimentary sound. A recording of an ice violinist busking a solo classical piece outside Luleå's House of Culture in around -10 C is evidence to the contrary. The sound is sharp and ethereal, with a wide tonal range. Not only classical . But the ice repertoire doesn't include only refined, classical pieces. Along with the violins and a viola, cellos and a bass, there's an ice banjo in this year's lineup to accent country and bluegrass numbers. Six- and 12-string guitars suit rock 'n' roll, and an ice xylophone resting on bicycle inner tubes -- to aid its resonance -- works across the genres. As for the orchestra's gigantic spherical ""bubble drums,"" Linhart tells CNN, ""they really shake your skeleton."" Doubtless they'll be deployed to funky effect in the -- inevitably, this being Sweden -- series of Abba-themed concerts among the 40 or so on the program this year. Winter pursuit . A stone sculptor in warmer months, the bearded Linhart, 53, makes all the instruments for the winter concerts in a six-week burst in his back garden. They're transported to a specially built igloo auditorium seating 170 people in a nature park outside Luleå, where the orchestra plays. Originally from New Mexico, Linhart was invited to this town of 80,000 residents in Swedish Lapland 10 years ago to take part in the building of one of the world's first ice hotels. He met his wife here. That's one reason he's stuck around, but no doubt it also helped that Luleå is one of the coldest towns in Sweden. Saving on its air con bills, Facebook is building its first server farm outside the United States in the town. Lovers of a cold climate . So, apart from loving a sub-zero climate, how else do ice instruments differ from the conventional kind? They're quicker to make, for a start, Linhart says. ""I can do the carving on the front and back plate of a standup bass in two hours. ""The chisel just glides through the ice. ""My tools are similar to those of a regular instrument maker,"" he says. But when it comes to sealing one of his creations together, ""the only glue I use is water."" ""If you want to glue a crack in an ice instrument, you just take a little straw, blow through it until the ice melts and then let it freeze again. ""With wood, you can only carve. ""With ice, you can also grow."" Just add water! Another difference from conventional instrument making? Linhart wears dishwashing gloves while he's carving, something you wouldn't see many master violin makers doing. Icy materials . The sculptor works mainly with ""white ice,"" a pearl-colored blend of water and snow that's especially flexible when frozen. Then there's clear ice: ""Pure frozen water with no flaws, just molecule against molecule all the way through."" But it's harder to find. Northern Sweden is a good place to look, but you have to dig 20 centimeters beneath a lake surface to find the bubble-free stuff. Instruments wrought from either material are both more beautiful and more fragile than traditional instruments, Linhard says. What other instrument, he asks, lets the light shine through? Their unique visual qualities are exploited in the performances, when non-warming LEDs, constantly shifting in color, are placed inside the instruments. ""It's like a nightclub in heaven,"" Linhart says. Spring thaw . The instruments are exceedingly delicate. They melt in springtime and require constant maintenance before then. When played, the violins are suspended by strings from the ceiling to keep them from the musician's warm body. Just the breath from players and audience means every instrument has to be re-tuned slightly between each song. Such attention is worth it, says Linhart, for the exquisite sound these magical objects produce. ""Ice instruments have a more detailed sound than wood, say, which absorbs the vibrations from the strings and dampens the sound,"" he says. ""Ice is stiffer. It picks up all the vibrations. ""That's why it makes your hair stand on end. ""You might think the sound on a normal instrument is perfectly clear -- until you hear an ice instrument and go, 'Ah ha!' ""The clarity is crystal."" Flight plans . Up next on Linhard's icy agenda is an instrument dreamed up specifically for ice called the orgasmatron, after the machine in the Woody Allen film ""Sleeper."" It's like a cello, but one a player bows from inside, making his or her body part of the sound. Linhart doesn't intend his ice-crafting career to end with instruments. His dream project is an ultralight airplane made from ice. Luckily, temperatures tends to get colder the higher you fly. Ice Music continues in Luleå until April 6.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama said on Thursday the United States will ""not rule anything out"" with regard to the situation in Iraq, but that it will need more help. Obama made the remarks at the White House as the security situation worsens with Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, firmly under the control of the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. U.S. officials previously said things there are ""extremely urgent"" and the United States is looking to see what more support it can provide. ""This is an area that we have been watching with a lot of concern,"" Obama said, noting the United States and the international community should extend additional support. ""So my team is working around the clock to identify how we can provide the most effective assistance to them,"" Obama said. ""I don't rule out anything because we do have a stake in making sure that these jihadists are not getting a permanent foothold in either Iraq or Syria, for that matter."" However, a senior administration official followed up by saying the use of American ground forces is not under consideration. ""No boots on the ground. Not being considered,"" the official said. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told CNN on Thursday that no one is calling for ""American troops into Iraq."" He said Washington has been cooperative and has a responsibility to be proactive in the current fight against militants. The U.S. government has already provided $15 billion in training, weapons and equipment to the Iraqi government. Iraq on Wednesday indicated a willingness for U.S. airstrikes. But there has been no indication if that's under consideration. Obama also came under pressure over Iraq from foreign policy critics in Congress. ""The President should get rid of his entire national security including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,"" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said prior to a classified briefing for Armed Services Committee members. He said Obama should bring back David Petraeus, the former commander of American forces during a decisive period of the Iraq War, among other Bush-era generals to ""turn this whole situation around."" Although McCain was highly critical of Obama's handling of Iraq, he did not advocate for military airstrikes. House Speaker John Boehner declined to take a stance but suggested the Obama administration should have taken action earlier. ""I think what we should do is to provide the equipment and technical assistance that the Iraqis have been asking for,"" the Ohio Republican said. ""But it's not like we haven't seen this problem coming for over a year, and it's not like we haven't seen over the last five or six months, these terrorists moving in, taking control of western Iraq, now they've taken control of Mosul, they're 100 miles from Baghdad, and what's the President doing? Taking a nap,"" Boehner added. Another reliable voice against the administration's foreign policy agenda, Sen. Lindsey Graham, acknowledged that Americans are tired of dealing with conflicts in the Middle East. ""But the people that are moving into Iraq and holding ground in Syria have on their agenda not only to drive us out of the Mideast but hit our homeland,"" he said. Some Democrats, however, urged caution about getting involved in Iraq, vacated by American troops only three years ago. ""I don't think there's any appetite in our country for us to become engaged in any more military activity in Iraq,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said. ""Are we going to refight the war that we just got out of?"" she asked. Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan who chairs the Armed Services Committee, told reporters that all options should be on the table but warned against a hasty response. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, also expressed concern, indicating the outcome could be devastating if militants continue to move forward. 5 predictions revisited: Iraq's troubles are years in the making .

"(CNN) -- I'm fairly certain there's nothing haunting my house, save maybe the leftover Super Bowl cheese dip still in the fridge. But so far, its intentions seem friendly. You just have to ignore the constant paranoid screams from the tofu. ""It wants my soul!"" ""Shut up, tofu."" It's not entirely uncommon for me to have these lively conversations with my food. I probably need a girlfriend. Or a hobby. Or years of therapy. Fortunately, though, since the worst of my supernatural household concerns is confined to the lingering spirit of old Velveeta, I do sleep fairly well at night in the 2 square feet of bed space kindly allotted to me by my dog. Quite simply, I respect the demon cheese. The demon cheese respects me. And my dog respects nobody. Which is far better than what could have been said of two flatmates in London who recently sold an antique mirror on eBay because they were convinced it was haunted and willfully endangering their lives. ""I'm going to murder both of you. Probably tonight."" ""But, Mirror, we saved you from the trash heap!"" ""Meh."" According to their eBay listing, it all started when one of them saw that the building's landlord had put the old hallway mirror out on the lawn as rubbish. So, being resourceful, he retrieved it, added some silver paint and leaned it up against their wall above the radiator. Soon after that, things supposedly got weird. ""We both experienced what I can only describe as intense sharp stabbing pains,"" the sellers wrote to prospective buyers. ""They would strike us both at the same time."" The two flatmates also complained of waking up completely drained of energy, screaming in the early morning hours with horrible feelings of impending doom. Though, to be fair, that kind of sounds like my typical weekday. Only with fewer tears and significantly less self-doubt. Regardless, this is the point where one of them should have turned to the other and asked, ""How about we just ... throw it away?"" But, that would be too logical. And, besides, the sudden emergence of blood was sort of interesting and new. Yes. Blood. You see, in addition to growing increasingly sick and depressed from all the evil hauntings, one of the flatmates even claims to have woken up with deep body scratches, for which he blamed the mirror and kindly provided a link on eBay for photographic proof. It's also entirely possible that he just has a pet cat. Or, perhaps, an amazing lover. Or both. (But not like that.) Of course, any potential buyer would need to believe such humorous nonsense as haunting pains and bloody scratches in the night. They, presumably, would also require an itchy Paypal trigger finger. The kind that leads you to bid on a used toilet brush at 3 in the morning. Click. ""Booya! Who's the wild man now?"" With the mirror, it was all about finding that absolutely perfect buyer, and the sellers noted that they ""would ideally like it to go to somebody who has experience with the paranormal/supernatural and knows what they are getting themselves in for."" Amazingly, thanks to the powers of the interwebs, there was no shortage of interest. And for everyone's amusement, a few potential bidders began asking entirely reasonable questions of the sellers: . ""I'd like to buy this as a present. If I win the auction is there any way you could deliver it to my ex for me?"" Eventually, the mirror sold for Â£100, or a little over $150. So, good on them. Well-played. As a result, I plan to list everything I sell in the future as potentially haunted. ""But this isn't just any Bell Biv DeVoe CD. It's a *haunted* Bell Biv DeVoe CD."" In the end, it doesn't really matter whether the mirror was evil or if their stories were even mildly believable. What matters is that somebody paid for the simple possibility. And I love that. It's important to have a few good conversation pieces sitting around the house, and nothing sounds better than explaining how you bought a haunted mirror off two random guys on eBay. The story counts. Which is why, if anyone's interested, I now have some leftover Super Bowl cheese dip for sale.

"(CNN) -- For anyone around 30 or older, this week's royal engagement left one with an uneasy feeling of déjà vu. The photographs of Prince William and Kate Middleton, facing the flashing cameras of the world's press, were uncannily like those of William's parents, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, when they announced their plans to marry in 1981. The color of the dress, the pose, the linked arms, the looks -- they were almost identical. Kate was even wearing Diana's ring. The rapturous response from the media was a rerun of 1981, too -- the special supplements, the pages and pages of photographs, the speculation about who will design the dress, where they will honeymoon, where and how they first met, who their friends are and from whom their families are descended. Television channels were saturated with more of the same, the only difference being that this time around we have nonstop rolling news broadcasts so there was even more on which viewers could feast. Bad news took a back seat. The British people, struggling with job losses, cuts and economic hardship just as they were 30 years ago, were lifted out of the gloom for a day. When it comes, the wedding will be another great boost to the country's morale, an excuse for a giant party, for people to take to the streets, embrace strangers and celebrate, just as it was in 1981. The nation fell in love with Diana, and the nation has once again fallen in love with the woman who wears her ring. So where does the comparison end? The first wedding was dubbed a fairy tale, but the story didn't play out as it should have. Looking back, it is all too easy to see why and to see why this marriage between William and Kate has every chance of being the real thing. Charles and Diana scarcely knew each other when they became engaged. He had played the field during his 20s. He had a string of pretty girls who adorned his arm, each one exciting speculation in the press, but by 32, the pressure to find a suitable bride had become intense. Once the press identified Diana Spencer as a possible candidate, they hounded her mercilessly until Charles was told by his father that he must make his mind up and either marry this girl or let her go. He asked her to marry him. Diana was just 19. She was from a broken home, albeit an aristocratic one. She was poorly educated and had little experience of the world. She was quite unprepared and emotionally ill equipped for life as a member of the royal family, a life that is as bizarre as it is unreal. When asked on the day of their engagement whether they were in love, the Prince of Wales famously replied, ""Whatever love is."" William and Kate met at university in St. Andrew's and were friends before they were ever lovers. They have known each other for eight years and appear to have become soul mates. No one who has seen them together can question that their love is genuine. Kate is 10 years older than Diana was. She may be middle-class, but she comes from a stable, loving and happy family. She is well-educated and has traveled and seen the world. She has held down a responsible job, and crucially, they got to know each other away from the public gaze. The monarchy learned a lot during the Diana years and is infinitely better armed today to protect the privacy of its members. The press may not have been tamed but they have certainly been given boundaries that never existed in Diana's day. Kate is going into this marriage and this bizarre life with her eyes wide open. She has had a taste of what life in the gold-fish bowl is like. She's been followed and photographed, analyzed and criticized, and her humble origins have been chewed over in the press. She has proved herself to be made of strong stuff and to be discreet, loyal and trustworthy. Diana became a superstar and at times she eclipsed Charles because she was young, glamorous and fun, and he was seen as rather staid and serious. It wasn't good for their relationship. William is a superstar himself; he is young, glamorous and fun. And he is Diana's son. Kate won't eclipse him; she will complement him. His overriding desire is to be seen as relevant in his public life, and with someone who is so grounded and so normal by his side, I have a hunch they will become a formidable team. The failure of Charles and Diana's marriage almost destroyed the monarchy. This union has every chance of securing its future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Penny Junor.","Penny Junor: Déjà vu seeing Prince William and Kate Middleton announce engagement .

"Kuala Lumpur (CNN) -- More than a month after the airliner they were traveling on was shot out of the skies above eastern Ukraine, the bodies of 20 Malaysian passengers arrived back in Kuala Lumpur as Malaysia observed a national day of mourning. Families of the victims of Malaysia Flight MH17 gathered at the Malaysian capital's international airport for the repatriation ceremony, as a special chartered Malaysia Airlines Boeing 747 touched down just after 9.30 a.m. local time Friday following its journey from Amsterdam. After the airliner taxied to its stand at the airport's Bunga Raya complex, usually reserved for receiving visiting dignitaries, it was met by uniformed pall bearers from Malaysia's armed forces, who proceeded to unload the caskets, which were all draped in the country's flag, into the waiting fleet of white hearses. The victims' families were joined by Prime Minister Najib Razak, who escorted King Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah and Queen Haminah Hamidun to their seats among the gathering of around 1,000 people. A minute's silence was observed nationwide at 10.55 a.m. as the last of the caskets was unloaded. ""Last month, 43 Malaysian lives were taken over eastern Ukraine. Today we mourn the loss of our people. Today, we begin to bring them home,"" the prime minister said. ""Our thoughts and our prayers are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives. Today we stand with you, united as one."" MH17, which was en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam, was shot down by a missile as it flew over Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. Forty-three of those on board were Malaysians, including 15 crew members and two infants. Investigators have been carrying out the painstaking task of recovering bodies from the crash site before transporting them to the Netherlands for identification -- a process that could take months, Dutch authorities have warned. About two-thirds of those killed were Dutch, with Malaysians and Australians making up a large proportion of the others. Day of mourning . Malaysia Airlines, which experienced its second tragedy this year following the disappearance of Flight MH370 as it flew to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur on March 8, distributed black ribbons to cabin crew company-wide, while a flag at its offices flew at half-mast. A statement from the airline read: ""Malaysia Airlines is deeply saddened by this devastating tragedy. It has been a long and painful wait for the families and friends of the passengers and crew onboard MH17."" While the mood at the airport was expectantly somber, the awaiting families were nevertheless prepared for the occasion. Some broke into tears as they shook hands with government ministers and airline crew, but most just took their seats at the side of the tarmac to await the special flight. The motorcade carrying the 20 passengers moved slowly past the families and on towards two Hercules C-130 transport aircraft and three military helicopters. Seven were flown back to their respective hometowns, while the remaining passengers will be transported by land for proper burials. Outside the airport, crowds gathered nearby to catch a glimpse of the ceremony, as many other Malaysians across the country watched a live broadcast. On the roads leading in and out of the airport, cars stopped to allow the convoy of hearses to pass by.

"(CNN) -- Add REO Speedwagon to the list of musical acts canceling SeaWorld shows because of the documentary ""Blackfish."" ""Due to concerns regarding our February 16 appearance at SeaWorld, we have chosen to cancel the performance,"" the rock band said on its Facebook page on Friday. A promoter could put together a great concert series with the acts who have canceled SeaWorld shows in the past several weeks, including Trisha Yearwood, Willie Nelson, Cheap Trick, Heart and Barenaked Ladies. The acts bailed on the Orlando theme park's ""Bands, BBQ and Brew"" concert series amid pressure from fans who started online petitions, tweeted and posted on Facebook pages demanding they not play SeaWorld. The fans became upset after watching the CNN documentary ""Blackfish,"" which first aired on CNN in October. The film tells the story of the killing in 2010 of a SeaWorld trainer by an orca. It raises questions about the safety and humaneness of keeping killer whales in captivity. ""In light of recent concerns, Trisha has decided to remove the February 22 date from her upcoming tour plans,"" Yearwood's representative told CNN on Thursday. SeaWorld confirmed the REO Speedwagon withdrawal on Friday and referred CNN to its previous statements about the cancellations. ""We expect that other artists will be targeted in this campaign,"" SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck told CNN in consecutive statements Wednesday and Thursday, starting with Cheap Trick's cancellation. Joan Jett to SeaWorld: Stop rockin' the whales .

"New York (CNN) -- An international custody battle over a 70 million-year-old dinosaur skeleton ended Monday with the fossil being repatriated to Mongolia after having been illegally smuggled, handed from owner to owner multiple times and sold at auction. The ""nearly complete"" skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus bataar -- also known as a Tarbousaurus bataar -- was turned over to representatives of the government of Mongolia by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. attorney's office in a New York City repatriation ceremony. ""This is one of the most important repatriations of fossils in recent years,"" said ICE Director John Morton. ""We cannot allow the greed of a few looters and schemers to trump the cultural interests of an entire nation."" ""After a year-long legal adventure and the worldwide publicity, the Tarbousaurus bataar indeed became a hero dinosaur at home in Mongolia,"" said Tsagaan Puntsag from the office of the president of Mongolia. ""(We) are very grateful to all the organizations and individuals who helped make it happen."" Under Mongolian law, dinosaur fossils are property of the Mongolian government and exporting them from the country is a criminal offense. According to court documents, the dinosaur skeleton was imported into the United States from Great Britain on March 27, 2010. Largely inaccurate import documents listed the bones' country of origin as Great Britain, while several paleontologists say Tyrannosaurus bataars have been recovered only in Mongolia. The skeleton, standing 8 feet tall and stretching 24 feet in length, also was incorrectly described as various fossil reptile bones and other broken bones. U.S. authorities gained possession of the skeleton after a self-described ""commercial paleontologist"" from Florida pleaded guilty in December 2012 to smuggling and other charges. As part of his plea agrement the defendant, Eric Prokopi, agreed to forfeit the bataar skeleton, as well four other dinosaur skeletons. Prokopi, whom federal investigators called ""a one-man black market in prehistoric fossils,"" is out on $100,000 bond and is awaiting sentencing that is tentatively scheduled for August. He faces a maximum sentence of 17 years in prison, according to his lawyer Georges Lederman. Lederman has advised his client not to make any statements until he is sentenced. The government has requested, however, that Prokopi be available to lend his expertise to Mongolian paleontologists about shipping and reconstructing of the skeleton, and he is complying, according to his lawyer. Earlier in 2012, the skeleton had been listed in an auction catalogue of Texas-based Heritage Auctions, Inc. at an estimated value between $950,000 to $1.5 million. Around the same time, Mongolian President Elbegdorj Tsakhia hired a private attorney who obtained a temporary restraining order from the Dallas County District Court to prevent the sale of the skeleton. ""At stake are the heritage, history and culture of a sovereign nation,"" attorneys for Tsakhia said in the restraining order filing. The auction house disregarded the restraining order, and it was sold to an undisclosed buyer in New York for $1.05 million on May 20, 2012, contingent upon the outcome of any court proceedings instituted on behalf of the Mongolian government. In the following months, investigations by U.S. authorities and paleontologists determined the skeleton was from the western Gobi Desert in Mongolia, uncovered between 1995 and 2005. The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York filed action to seek forfeit of the bones, which were eventually seized by ICE's Homeland Security Investigations. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said Monday, ""Cultural artifacts are part of the fabric of a country's history, and it is immensely satisfying to play a role in their return.""

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis spoke out against sexual abuse by Catholic clergy on Monday and said he plans to meet with victims in early June. In a wide-ranging talk with reporters, he also discussed celibacy in the clergy, saying it's not dogma so ""the door is always open."" The Pope fielded questions on these subjects during an informal chat with reporters. He simply walked to the back of the papal airplane, sat down with a group of journalists and took questions for about 45 minutes, answering in Italian. When the Vatican spokesman suggested he stop after half an hour to rest, the Pope indicated he was happy to continue. Such informality has become a hallmark of Pope Francis. Stressing that sex abuse constitutes a horrific crime, he told reporters that three bishops are under investigation. One has already been found guilty and a penalty is being considered, he said. It was not clear whether the bishops are under investigation for alleged abuse, or for purported involvement in some sort of cover-up. None of those clerics were named. A priest who abuses a child betrays the body of the Lord, the Pope said, according to pool reports. He called for zero tolerance. ""This is very serious,"" he said. ""It is like, by way of comparison, holding a black Mass. You are supposed to lead them to sanctity and instead you lead them to a problem that will last their entire lives."" Among the expected invitees to the meeting are abuse victims from Germany, England and Ireland, and Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the archbishop of Boston. Terrence Donilon, a spokesman for the cardinal, said the time and date of the meeting have not been finalized. ""Cardinal O'Malley has been asked by the Holy Father to assist with the planning for a meeting with survivors of sexual abuse in the coming months,"" said Donilon. ""The cardinal looks forward to supporting this effort by Pope Francis in whatever manner will be most helpful."" The meeting at the Vatican will not be the first time a pope has met with sexual abuse victims, according to John L. Allen Jr., CNN's senior Vatican analyst. However, it will mark the first time Pope Francis has done so. ""This is a clear indication that Francis is trying to get the message out that he 'gets it' about the need to confront the church's abuse scandals,"" Allen said. However, the U.S.-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests said the pope's comments did not go far enough. ""No child rape will be prevented, no abuse cover-up will be prevented and no predator priest will be exposed by anything the pope said today or will do next month,"" Joelle Casteix, western regional director of SNAP, said in a statement. ""His upcoming and self-serving meeting with victims is more of what we've seen for decades -- more gestures, promises, symbolism and public relations."" When reporters asked about celibacy in the clergy, Pope Francis showed an open mind but didn't say he's ready to make a change yet. ""The Catholic Church has married priests -- Greek Catholics, Coptic Catholics, those of oriental rites,"" he said. ""Celibacy is not a question of dogma, but rather a rule of life that I greatly appreciate, as I believe it is a gift for the Church. But, since it is not a dogma of faith, the door is always open."" The pontiff spoke as he was returning to Rome from a three-day trip to the Middle East. During that trip, the Pope extended an invitation to the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to travel to the Vatican for peace talks. In comments aboard the plane, he clarified the talks would not focus on finding a solution. ""It will be a meeting of prayer,"" he said. The Pope also appeared to open the door to the possibility he might resign one day, like his predecessor, if he no longer had the strength to carry on. ""I think that Pope Benedict XVI was not a unique case,"" Francis told reporters. ""I will do what God tells me to do."" Kick out those who sexually abuse children, U.N. panel tells Vatican .

"Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- You've heard of the ""Oprah effect."" Having the queen of talk endorse your product can be like winning the lottery. In the technology world, the same apparently applies to Steve Jobs. That's what some Stanford University grad students learned when the Apple CEO praised their iPad app during a recent event. Akshay Kothari and his partner, Ankit Gupta, both from India, have no experience in journalism. Yet their creation, a mobile application called Pulse that aggregates news from multiple sites, is one of the top-selling news apps for the iPad and its smaller cousin, the iPhone. The app got an unexpected boost when Jobs mentioned it onstage at Apple's developers conference in June. ""That was really special,"" said Kothari, co-founder and CEO of Alphonso Labs, which produced the Pulse app. ""We got the biggest stamp of approval we could have gotten."" The idea for the app originated while the two were taking a Stanford course for aspiring entrepreneurs. The class, called Launch Pad, challenges students to create a product in the course of 11 weeks. Kothari, 24, who considers himself a news junkie, didn't like how he had to view several different apps to get the news he wanted. He wondered whether it would be possible to take content from news sites and, using RSS feeds, create a rich, aesthetically pleasing app. Pulse, which also has an app for Android devices, allows users to assemble content from as many as 60 publications. Users also can touch a link that takes them to the actual publication's website. ""The first week of class, we decided we're going to do something for our iPads, and we released our app in six weeks,"" Kothari said. The pair had no real hopes for the app and didn't imagine turning it into a full-fledged business. And yet today their company has six full-time employees and is moving from the small Palo Alto office it shares with other startups into its own office space. A representative from Time magazine recently paid a visit to inquire about a possible partnership, Kothari said. ""It's been a truly exciting ride, and we hope it stays like that,"" said Kothari. The Pulse app costs $1.99 for the iPad and 99 cents for the iPhone and mobile Android devices. The company declined to disclose revenue figures. The Stanford duo's timing could not have been better. The mobile news industry is exploding as more and more people rely on smartphones and tablets to stay connected in their daily lives. Smartphone sales increased by 50 percent in the second quarter of 2010 versus the same time last year, according to Gartner, a leading tech research company. At the same time, advances in mobile devices have spawned a new generation of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Kleiner, Perkins Caufield & Byers, the giant technology venture capital firm, set aside $200 million this year for products that build upon the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. ""Welcome to the brave new post-PC era where a swoosh of fluidity replaces the traditional mouse. ... A new, truly revolutionary platform is rare, and a prize for entrepreneurs,"" firm partner John Doerr said in a press release. Some media companies, including CNN, see an opportunity to make a mark on these emerging platforms. ""Mobile news is a fertile ground for growth and innovation,"" said Louis Gump, vice president of CNN Mobile. ""We know a lot of people want to get news on phones."" Nielsen data show that CNN, which leads the mobile news category, has more than 14 million unique mobile users a month. Users also tend to keep coming back. According to CNN data, the vast majority of consumers who download the CNN app for iPhone are still using it a month later. Khotari, who only a few months ago was in graduate school, still can't believe he stumbled into the news business. ""The first thing we were thinking is, we're spending a thousand dollars to get two iPads. Will we be able to recover that? Our goal was to sell a few of these apps and at least recover that,"" he said. Despite their sudden success, the two entrepreneurs haven't allowed themselves many splurges yet. In fact, Gupta has yet to purchase an iPhone 4. ""I'm waiting for my upgrade window from AT&T,"" he said.","The Pulse app allows users to read content from up to 60 publications on one interface .

"(Instyle.com) -- It has been nearly 30 years since Princess Diana walked down the aisle at St. Paul's Cathedral and the world is anxious for another royal wedding of the same fairy tale proportions. And if Kate Middleton and Prince William's appearance at their friends' wedding over the weekend in England is any indication, the wait may be almost over. The usually publicity-shy couple arrived together for the festivities in Gloucestershire and even smiled for photographers when exiting the church. (Adding fuel to the matrimonial speculation -- the couple had just returned from a safari in Kenya. Yet another reason they look so relaxed and happy?) At the wedding, the always-elegant Kate wore a bright blue dress topped with a fitted black blazer and, in keeping with British tradition, an oversize hat -- hers accented with a feather. Prince William wore a dapper tailcoat and purple tie. InStyle.com: The best dressed celebrity brides . Kate often lands on best-dressed lists for her princess-worthy fashion and, inevitably, her style is compared to Prince William's mother, Princess Diana. Surely the late princess would have approved of Kate's outfit on Saturday -- bright pops of color and full skirts are pages right out of Diana's style playbook. Like the people's princess, Kate is frequently seen in well-tailored clothes that flatter her figure without ever being overly revealing or too tight. Princess Di isn't the only royal to whom Kate has been compared. Among others, Kate takes style cues from the royals of Monaco and shares a penchant for fedoras, as did Princess Grace of Monaco, classic trench coats a la Princess Caroline of Monaco and sporty equestrian style as seen on Princess Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco. InStyle.com: Kate Middleton's Spot-On Princess Style . The next biggest question after when in the royal wedding guessing game is who, as in which lucky designer will nab the honors of designing Kate Middleton's wedding dress? Will she opt for a relatively unknown name, as did Princess Diana when she asked David and Elizabeth Emanuel to design her dress? Or will she go to Bruce Oldfield who designed fellow royal Queen Rania of Jordan's dress for her big day? Perhaps to the delight of fashionistas Kate will work with one of Britain's top designers like Stella McCartney, Christopher Bailey of Burberry, or Vivienne Westwood who famously designed the dress Carrie wore when she got jilted in the first ""Sex and the City"" movie? One thing is for sure, all eyes will be on Kate Middleton to see how her fashion choices will evolve over the years. She has already scored points for her ladylike, princess-appropriate style and chances are once the title is official, the rest of the world will start copying her wardrobe and a Sotheby's auction of her closet to benefit her favorite charity is inevitable!

"(CNN) -- Notes left behind by film director Tony Scott did not provide a motive for why he may have taken a suicidal plunge Sunday, a Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman said Friday. The notes also did not mention any illnesses, diseases or other health issues, Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said. He would not provide additional details about what was written in the notes. His death had led to reports that the British director suffered from inoperable brain cancer. His family has disputed such reports. Scott, best known for the films ""Top Gun"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop II,"" apparently committed suicide by jumping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California, about 12:30 p.m. Sunday, said Lt. Joe Bale of the coroner's office. Scott, 68, wrote two notes before his death, including a message left in his Los Angeles office that was apparently for family members, a coroner official said this week. The second note, detailing contact information for authorities investigating his death, was found in his Toyota Prius parked nearby, the official said. It will be weeks before the findings of a Monday autopsy are made public, the coroner's office said Tuesday. ""Our examination is complete, and we will be working towards a comprehensive document once we close the case,"" Winter said Tuesday. An ABC report Monday suggested the director was scripting his own death after being told by a doctor that he was dying of inoperable brain cancer. The network did not name the source of its information. ""I did talk to the family ... and according to his wife, he did not have brain cancer as reported, and (she) does not know who told ABC that information, which is absolutely false,"" Winter said. Coroner, family dispute cancer report . Scott's unexplained death shocked the Hollywood stars who worked with him on a long list of successful movies over the past three decades. Denzel Washington, who starred in several Scott-directed thrillers -- including 2010's ""Unstoppable"" -- said it was ""unfathomable to think that he is now gone."" ""He had a tremendous passion for life and for the art of filmmaking and was able to share this passion with all of us through his cinematic brilliance,"" he said. Born Anthony D.L. Scott in North Shields, England, in 1944, the director got his start as a teenager in front of the camera, starring in his older brother Ridley Scott's film ""Boy and Bicycle."" In 1995, the two joined forces to create the production company Scott Free Productions. Tony Scott became a household name in 1986 as director of the mega-hit ""Top Gun,"" starring Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis. He followed that up with the Eddie Murphy action movie ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" in 1987. Opinion: An unstoppable Hollywood force . Both Cruise and Murphy released statements mourning the loss of their director. ""Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him. He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable. My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time,"" Cruise said. Murphy described Scott as a ""wonderful collaborator"" and said he will be missed. Pepperdine University film professor Craig Detweiler called Scott ""the supreme stylist"" who ""operated at the top of his game throughout each decade of his career."" ""He was able to make the thinnest of premises into something pulse-pounding and exciting, and he's almost a filmmaker as a magician who found drama amidst almost contrived situations,"" he said. Taking his own life by jumping from a bridge is ""a high-adrenaline ending, which matches his dramatic style,"" Detweiler said. ""He put Denzel Washington, Will Smith and Tom Cruise in movies where one man overcomes all struggles, triumphs over struggles, and yet it appears he was not able to write that story for himself,"" he said. Tony Scott: An appreciation . Actor Michael Rapaport, who was directed by Scott in ""True Romance,"" took to Twitter to praise the director. In one post, he said there hasn't been a day since the movie was released in 1993 that someone doesn't tell him how much they loved the film. ""Tony Scott was a sweet enthusiastic & lovin man,"" Rapaport wrote. Scott cemented his reputation for big-budget action films with 1990's ""Revenge"" starring Kevin Costner and ""Days of Thunder"" with Cruise. In 1998, he directed ""Enemy of the State"" with actors Smith and Gene Hackman. It was on the set of ""Days of Thunder"" where Scott met actress Donna Wilson, whom he married in 1994. They had twin sons. Reaction to Scott's death poured out Monday, with directors, actors and fans mourning the news. ""Being around you was always the ultimate experience -- intensity, vitality and celebration. Pure rock and roll and great cigars. Your warmth and generosity was palpable to all us. You treated everyone with care and respect,"" said actor Edgar Ramirez, who starred in Scott's 2005 film ""Domino."" ""You always focused on the subtleties, taking the best out of us. I am proud to be your friend, and although I won't be seeing you for a while, you will live on in the laughter of our memories of you."" ""Tony Scott as a friend and a mentor was irreplaceable. Tone, wherever you are, I love you man. RIP,"" director and producer Joe Carnahan said on Twitter. Carnahan recounted how when his movie ""The Grey"" was finished, Scott called to tell him he had seen it. He told Carnahan it was great and not to allow anybody to change anything in it. ""Tony always sent personal, handwritten notes & always drew a cartoon caricature of himself, smoking a cigar, with his hat colored in red,"" Carnahan said in a post. Scott directed his last film, the train thriller ""Unstoppable"" starring Washington, in 2010. ""For me, it was the most challenging movie of my life, and the most dangerous because I'm shooting 90 percent of the movie on a train that is running between 50 and 70 mph,"" Scott said at the time. Opinion: Tense films for jittery times . Scott's reputation in Hollywood was low-key. ""He wasn't a showy kind of guy,"" longtime entertainment reporter Jeanne Wolf said. Scott was often seen sporting a frayed, faded red ball cap on movie sets and at red carpet premieres. The ball cap, Wolf said, was his trademark. While Scott's movies garnered box office success, they never received the acclaim that generated Academy Award nominations. In 2002, the Scott brothers won an Emmy for the television movie ""The Gathering Storm."" Scott also was nominated for the Emmy as a producer for the CBS drama ""The Good Wife."" ""So very, very sorry to hear of the death of Tony Scott,"" actress Martha Plimpton, who appeared in ""The Good Wife,"" said via Twitter. Among his last projects was serving as an executive producer on the TV miniseries ""Coma,"" which is due to air this year. CNN's Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.","The revelation comes from Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Historically, the tech industry has not been especially hospitable to women. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor released a list of the 20 leading occupations of employed women. None of them was in the technical field. That same year, only 3% of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies were women, according to the National Center for Women & Information Technology. From coders to venture capitalists, women remain a small minority in most tech-related businesses. This issue was a recurring theme at last week's South by Southwest Interactive festival in Austin, Texas, where attendees gathered at women's-only parties and panels featured such titles as ""Sausagefest: Getting More Women Into New Media & Tech."" Conversations focused on the unique set of challenges women face as minorities in the tech workplace. This isolation, they said, spurs a need to gather and to collectively exchange ideas. As a result, an increasing number of groups has formed to help women find mentors and build their confidence. Tamara Hudgins is the executive director of Girl Start, an nonprofit based in Austin. The organization provides science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programming for girls outside of the classroom. ""Less than 12 percent of STEM jobs in America are filled by women. So for us, making sure that more girls feel that they have access to STEM jobs is critical,"" she said. ""Having more women in the field is important for innovation."" In interviews with CNN, many female developers said they felt they had to fight for respect or deal with internal issues of self-doubt to advance in their career. ""As a female, there's kind of that perception that you don't have certain skills or reasoning,"" said Patty Cifra, a software developer for IBM in Austin. The perception goes, ""You are just not as good at science as males, or else why wouldn't there be more females (in scientific fields)?"" Women at SXSWi also talked about the desire to be respected in the tech workplace, not just liked. ""How we have been conditioned to be maybe works fine for being the popular girl in school. But at a certain point in our professional life, being the nice one does not get us to the level of respect or responsibility that we want,"" said Tara Sophia Mohr, a San Francisco-based life and leadership coach for women. ""We have to be more authoritative and more assertive and be OK with not being liked by everyone,"" she added. Laura Kilcrease, sitting in an audience at a panel on women entrepreneurs, jokingly refers to herself as the only female venture capitalist in Austin. She said a lack of assertiveness can prevent women from properly scaling their new business venture and asking for money. ""Women generally want less money than they really need, and they don't show me a big business plan,"" Kilcrease said. ""I challenge women to think about scaling their business and asking for enough funds to cover their projected growth."" As conferences like SXSWi bring together thought leaders from all over the world, women here hope these discussions can help close the gender gap in tech fields. Business strategist Valeria Maltoni of Philadelphia offered a solution, broken into three parts. ""Women need to become better at stating clearly what they want,"" she said. ""We're not very good at stating clearly and consistently what our contribution is going to be and asking for our part in the project. ""The second part of that is be better at self-promoting. As women, as wives, as daughters, as partners, as team members, we tend to be very good at promoting others. We tend to really suck at highlighting what we're good at,"" she added. ""We need to find a way to be OK with the results we bring to the table and being OK with being confident in those results."" Finally, she stressed the need for women to find mentors, whether those mentors are male or female. However, having a female role model can help women visualize their own future, she said. The desire to connect other like-minded women and build a community led developer Garann Means to form all-girl hack nights in Austin. Attendees come together to exchange ideas and work on projects. ""If it was open to men, it would be mostly men. The fact that it's exclusive to women helps bring women out,"" Means said. ""It's just a little easier when you know this is for you."" ""Being the only [female developer], you don't have role models,"" Cifra said. ""Then you go into these groups and you see distinguished engineers at IBM that are females, and it encourages you to be like, 'Yeah, she did it. She went through the same path, and it's something that I can follow.' "" ""I think these organizations form because women have certain issues that don't pertain to guys,"" agreed Cifra. ""You're more comfortable voicing these opinions to someone who is sympathetic and understanding of what you are going through."" Such segregation by gender is not a popular idea to everyone in the industry. But Hudgins said they are necessary because time and time again, educators see women drop out of nonsegregated programs. Despite the bleak statistics, there was plenty of optimism in Austin. With so many people working together to increase opportunities for women in tech, many of the woman CNN interviewed at SXSW said they don't think this conversation will be happening in 10 to 15 years. ""Development is becoming more social. They (men and women) are talking. They're not hiding in basements. I think that's really good for this industry,"" Means said. Cifra also is hopeful about the future of the industry, thanks in part to the rise of social media, which tends to attracts more women, she said. ""The social computing aspect brings a lot more people,"" she said. ""I see more and more women in the technical field.""","Conversations at SXSW focus on issues women face as minorities in workplace .

"(CNN) -- The man who says he was behind the Manti Te'o girlfriend hoax claims he was in love with the Notre Dame linebacker, but the athlete knew nothing about the ruse. ""He had no idea,"" said 22-year-old Ronaiah Tuiasosopo in the first segment of a two-part interview that aired Thursday on ""Dr. Phil."" The second part is scheduled to air Friday. ""He did not know anything."" Asked if he was in love with Te'o, Tuiasosopo told host Phil McGraw: . ""I mean, yeah ... as twisted and confusing as it may be, yeah, I cared for this person. I did all that I could to help this person become a better person, even though I wasn't getting nothing out of it. Of course, it's very shameful and it's very painful to even talk about. Even now, it's hard to talk about. But, you know, the truth of it is that that happened. I grew feelings. I grew emotions that, sooner or later, I couldn't control any more."" Asked whether he is gay, he said, ""I would say, yeah, I am gay, but honestly, I am so confused, I'm so lost."" Bleacher Report: Twitter Erupts as Hoaxer Tells Story to Dr. Phil . In the interview, Tuiasosopo said the relationship began after he started a Facebook page under the name Lennay Kekua, the first name an elision of his mother's and grandmother's first names and the last name one he had heard ""thrown around in the neighborhood."" He said he ""randomly added different people"" as Facebook friends with the persona he had created. ""One of the people I happened to add was his cousin,"" he said, referring to Te'o's cousin. ""Shortly after, I got a friend request, and it was from Manti."" Tuiasosopo said he found out, as Lennay, that the gridiron star was in a relationship. ""I never wanted to become a relationship wrecker or nothing like that,"" he said. But that did not stop him; the relationship grew. They began speaking nightly, and Te'o seemed to have been smitten, too, Tuiasosopo said. ""He really had fallen in love with this, we'll say, character."" Tuiasosopo said he and his younger sister met Manti in November, the night before Notre Dame's 22-13 victory over rival USC at the team's hotel. ""It was really awkward at first,"" he said. ""I wanted to tell him everything right then and there."" But Te'o's relatives intruded, and he decided it wasn't the right time, he said. Tuiasosopo said his motives were pure; he never tried to make money off their relationship. ""I just wanted to help him become better,"" he said. The charade became difficult to maintain, and he tried to end it several times. ""There are many times where Manti and Lennay had broken up. But something would bring them back together, whether it was something going on in his life or Lennay's life, in this case in my life,"" Tuiasosopo said. He added: ""I wanted to end it because after everything I had gone through I wanted to move on with my life. Me, Ronaiah, I had to just start living and let this go."" Finally, after learning that Te'o had Skyped with four women -- including two of his former girlfriends -- Tuiasosopo said he essentially killed off Lennay, having her die of leukemia. ""I was just trying to do everything to end it because I knew that, no matter what, you know, it just wasn't right -- and it was never going to be."" A love story unravels . Thursday's segment is the latest revelation in what began as a story of one of the nation's best college football players leading his team to victory hours after learning his girlfriend had died, a story dismissed as a hoax after it was revealed Kekua did not exist. Te'o: My emotions were real . Sports website Deadspin broke the story this month that the girlfriend whom Te'o, this year's Heisman Trophy runner-up, had talked about and had claimed died in September wasn't real. Te'o rose to national prominence while leading Notre Dame's Fighting Irish to an undefeated regular season. As he and his team excelled, Te'o told interviewers in September and October that his grandmother and girlfriend, whom he described as a 22-year-old Stanford University student, had died within hours of each other. ""I miss 'em, but I know that I'll see them again one day,"" he said then. An online relationship . Last week, Te'o told talk show host Katie Couric that Tuiasosopo had called him the day the story broke to confess. During that interview, Te'o said he doubted the voice he knew as Kekua was a man's voice. Tuiasosopo has said he faked his voice to sound feminine. In the interview, McGraw questioned his veracity and repeatedly challenged him to prove it. McGraw said his show had contacted private contractors for the FBI and the Secret Service, giving them a voice mail message that Tuiasosopo said he had left for Te'o. ""They looked at everything from voice intonation to tonal qualities"" and concluded that ""the chance that you are the person on that voice mail is like one in 10 million,"" McGraw said. Tuiasosopo insisted he was telling the truth but said he would be uncomfortable talking in his feminine voice for the TV host. ""I've never done it in front of people,"" he said. Who's who on the Internet? Who knows . Tuiasosopo' s state of mind . Psychotherapist Robi Ludwig said the behavior described by Tuiasosopo to McGraw is very possible. ""We see this with Internet dating. Sometimes people lie,"" Ludwig told CNN's Erin Burnett OutFront. ""It's a place where they can experiment and where they can impersonate the other sex."" Ludwig said it is possible that Tuiasosopo ""actually did have a crush on Manti Te'o and was confused about his sexuality."" ""And the reason why he impersonated this woman was to see what it would feel like to be intimate with Manti Te'o, to be loved by Manti Te'o,"" she said. ""Who would say this if it weren't true?

"(CNN) -- Still concerned about some faceless government bureaucrat peeking at your e-mails and other online communications? Well, you've got a new champion: Microsoft. The computing giant has announced a set of new privacy features, in a post that specifically calls out ""government snooping"" as the reason. Responding to news reports that the National Security Agency may be monitoring more online activity than was previously believed, Microsoft attorney and executive vice president Brad Smith wrote that the company is rolling out three new features: . -- Expanded encryption across Microsoft services. -- Reinforced legal protections for customer data. -- Enhanced transparency designed to show customers that Microsoft products don't have ""back doors"" that make government surveillance easier. ""Like many others, we are especially alarmed by recent allegations in the press of a broader and concerted effort by some governments to circumvent online security measures -- and in our view, legal processes and protections -- in order to surreptitiously collect private customer data,"" Smith wrote in the post published late Wednesday. ""... If true, these efforts threaten to seriously undermine confidence in the security and privacy of online communications. Indeed, government snooping potentially now constitutes an 'advanced persistent threat,' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks."" Just over a month ago, a Washington Post report said the NSA can tap into overseas data links to collect millions of text, video and audio records from tech giants like Google and Yahoo every day. The NSA denied that report. NSA spying claims: Five things you need to know . Wednesday's post says Microsoft launched ""a comprehensive engineering effort"" to enhance encryption on communications via tools like e-mail service Outlook, productivity suite Office 365, SkyDrive and Windows Azure. Data sent between customers and Microsoft is now encrypted by default, meaning messages will be garbled during transition so they become useless to anyone who may intercept them between the sender and intended recipient. All messages traveling between Microsoft servers will be added. Some changes went into effect immediately, and all will be active by the end of 2014, Smith wrote. ""While we have no direct evidence that customer data has been breached by unauthorized government access, we don't want to take any chances and are addressing this issue head on,"" the post said. In recent months, some of tech's biggest players have been pushing back against perceived government intrusions. In September, CEOs Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Marissa Mayer of Yahoo took to the stage at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference to condemn government surveillance of private citizens online. Microsoft's move follows Google and Yahoo, both of which have stepped up encryption of users' data in light of reports about the NSA. In a blog post last month announcing the new protections, Mayer wrote that ""Yahoo has never given access to our data centers to the NSA or any other government agency. Ever.""","Microsoft rolls out new encryption protections for customers' data .

"London, England (CNN) -- News of Britain's next royal wedding was on the front page of every British paper Wednesday, but so were mentions of the late Princess Diana. The day after Prince William announced he had proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Kate Middleton, tabloids carried full-page pictures of the couple and broadsheets ran large, above-the-fold headlines. ""We got there in the end, darling!"" was the headline on the Daily Mail. ""(And it's sealed with Diana's ring!)"" ""Something borrowed, something blue,"" wrote The Times, referring to the large sapphire-and-diamond ring William used to propose to Middleton last month. ""With this ring, Di thee wed,"" wrote the Daily Mirror. William said in the couple's first joint interview Tuesday that he chose to use the ring because he wanted his mother to ""be with us at such a happy time."" Diana died in a Paris, France, car crash in 1997, when William was 15. Attention on the ring and the link to Princess Diana showed how much her memory is already hovering over the upcoming wedding. ""The presence of Diana, it has always been there throughout William and Harry's life, and it will now become even greater, because Kate is going to be compared at every turn,"" said Mark Saunders, the author of several books on the royals, also making reference to William's brother and Diana's youngest son. His remarks were made on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""We're supposed to call her Catherine now -- Catherine will be compared to Diana constantly. It will never go away."" Richard Fitzwilliams, a public relations consultant and royal commentator, said the comparisons with Diana can only go so far. ""I assure you that Kate Middleton is not being looked at as another Princess Diana,"" he told CNN. ""I think Prince William was emphasizing in the interview it's time to move on."" British Prime Minister David Cameron passed on the congratulations of the whole House of Commons during his weekly question time on Wednesday. ""This is wonderful news,"" he said. ""We look forward to the wedding itself with excitement and anticipation."" That same sentiment will also draw huge numbers of tourists to Britain over the next few years and boost the British economy by 620 million pounds ($985 million), a retail research firm said Wednesday. Wedding-related merchandise sales alone could top 26 million pounds ($41.3 million), according to Neil Saunders, a consulting director at Verdict. Food and grocery retailers could also benefit as people buy extra food, treats, champagne, and wine to celebrate the occasion, he said. Tourism and travel could bring in an additional 216 million pounds ($343 million), he said. ""Although times have changed since the last big royal engagement of Prince Charles and Lady Diana, many people will still be keen to buy some form or keepsake or memento and retailers will rush to capitalize on the merchandising opportunities,"" Saunders said.","The engagement news is on the front page of every British newspaper .

"London (CNN) -- It's confirmed: Monty Python isn't quite dead yet -- unlike the Norwegian Blue parrot featured in a famous sketch. The British comedy troupe will perform live at London's O2 arena on July 1 -- the five surviving stars' first show on stage together since appearing at the Hollywood Bowl in September 1980, the group announced Thursday. Tickets will go on sale on Monday, priced between Â£27 ($43) and Â£90 ($145), with further details expected to be announced on the troupe's website montyphythonlive.com. Member John Cleese said at a news conference Thursday that the show will have some new material, but it will have many old bits -- some featured in perhaps new ways -- that fans will expect. ""I remember going to the Royal Albert Hall and seeing Neil Diamond where he got booed in the second half for singing new numbers. People really do want to see the old hits, but we don't want to do them exactly in a predictable way, so it's going to be a mix-up, I think,"" Cleese said. Opinion: Will Python humor still fly in 2013? Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and the late Graham Chapman became comedic legends with the creation of Monty Python's Flying Circus in October 1969. They produced 45 TV episodes for the BBC and five feature films together before going their separate ways in 1983. The shows mostly consisted of a string of barely coherent sketches, often lacking conventional punch lines and loosely tied together by Gilliam's stream of consciousness animations. Although the TV show ran for only four seasons, it proved a massive cult hit when it was shown in the United States beginning in 1974 -- just as the show was winding up on the other side of the Atlantic. The five survivors have a combined age of 357, meaning that some of the more slapstick sketches, such as The ""Ministry of Silly Walks"" could prove difficult for their aging bodies. But there may be more shows, ""depending on how long Eric and Mike live for."" Jones paid tribute to Chapman, who died in 1989, saying, ""we'll miss him a lot although he will be appearing with us on stage in films."" ""We've told (Chapman) that he'll be on. If there's a God, he'll turn up,"" Idle added.

"(CNN) -- President Obama said that police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, ""acted stupidly"" in arresting a prominent black Harvard professor last week after a confrontation at the man's home. Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. talks Wednesday about his ordeal with Cambridge police. ""I don't know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played,"" Obama said Wednesday night while taking questions after a White House news conference. Cambridge authorities dropped disorderly conduct charges against Henry Louis Gates Jr. on Tuesday. Obama defended Gates on Wednesday night, while admitting that he may be ""a little biased,"" because Gates is a friend. ""But I think it's fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 ... that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.""

The mayor of Cambridge said she is going to meet with the city's police chief to make sure the scenario that caused Gates' arrest does not happen again.

Gates said the mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, called him to apologize about the incident, in which he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.  Watch Gates talk about his arrest » . CNN could not confirm Wednesday night that an apology was made. Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons did not respond to requests by CNN for comment.

Gates was arrested for ""loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space"" and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station. He said Wednesday that he and his lawyers were considering further actions, not excluding a lawsuit. Gates said that although the ordeal had upset him, ""I would do the same thing exactly again.""

"(CNN) -- Stargazers crossed their fingers Thursday as NASA attempted to revive the planet-hunting Kepler probe, idled since a piece of critical equipment gave out in orbit two months ago. Kepler has been sidelined since mid-May, when a reaction wheel that helps aim the spacecraft's telescope failed. Controllers launched a series of tests that will determine whether that device can be restarted, or whether another reaction wheel that quit in July 2012 can be reactivated. Controllers have remained in communication with the craft, which is about 45 million miles from Earth. It takes about four minutes for a radio signal to traverse that gap. In the first round of tests, telemetry from the craft indicated the wheel that shut down in May spun counterclockwise, but didn't respond to commands to turn clockwise, NASA reported. Controllers will go ahead with tests scheduled for next week on the other wheel while they study the results of Thursday's effort. Kepler project manager Roger Hunter called Thursday's findings ""an interesting development."" ""While this is a positive start, it is very early in the multi-stepped process to characterize the performance of the reaction wheels and to determine if one could return to operation,"" Hunter said in a written statement. ""The team will remain focused on the upcoming tests and report the cumulative test results at the end of the month."" The 15-foot, 2,300-pound spacecraft was launched in 2009 to search for Earth-size planets circling stars like our sun. The roughly $600 million mission has so far confirmed 134 planets and identified nearly 3,300 possible planets beyond our solar system. Kepler was built with four reaction wheels and needs three to keep the spacecraft aimed precisely at its targets -- one to fine-tune the spacecraft's position on each axis. After May's failure, only two remained in service and the probe went into a low-powered state to preserve fuel. ""We're kind of hoping for the best, but planning for the worst,"" said Sara Seager, an astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kepler's observations have focused on a sliver of the cosmos around the Northern Hemisphere constellations Cygnus and Lyra. They have led scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them. The craft's light-recording photometer has shown that the intensities of as many as two-thirds of stars are more variable than our sun. And in April, researchers reported that they had identified three planets that could potentially host life. Two of those -- Kepler 62e and 62f, located about 1,200 light-years away -- are considered the best candidates so far. ""We really want Kepler to be able to return to be able to operation in the same way that it was before the wheel failed,"" said Seager, a former member of the Kepler science team. ""That's the ultimate hope."" But the probe has already surpassed its three-and-a-half-year minimum expected lifespan, and it has collected enough data to keep scientists busy for up to two years. And even if Kepler can't regain the kind of steady precision required for its observations to date, NASA may be able to use the spacecraft for other purposes, Seager said.","NEW: First round of tests yields mixed but ""interesting"" results, NASA says .

"(CNN) -- Courthouses and other government buildings in 30 Tennessee counties received bomb threats Tuesday, a state official said, making it the fifth state this month to see a similar round of false alarms. No explosive devices had been found in any of the counties where threats were called in, said Dalya Qualls, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Homeland Security. Qualls said county courthouses, as well as federal and state buildings, received threats on Tuesday. Tennessee's bomb scares came eight days after similar threats were made to 28 courthouses and a state office building in Oregon and within a month of similar incidents around Nebraska and Washington, according to Oregon state police. Qualls said Tennessee Highway Patrol officers are assisting local authorities as needed, but the threats were still being investigated at the local level Tuesday evening.

"(CNN) -- Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa on Saturday defended his country's decision to grant WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange asylum, slamming Great Britain's behavior toward Ecuador as ""intolerable"" and ""unacceptable."" Assange is currently holed up inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Ecuador offered him asylum this week, but British authorities have said they are committed to extraditing him to Sweden, where Assange is wanted to face questioning over claims of rape and sexual molestation. The situation remains at a standoff. Assange demands U.S. end WikiLeaks 'witch hunt' ""Who do they think they're dealing with?"" Correa asked rhetorically of Great Britain during his weekly address. ""They don't realize Latin America is free and sovereign. We won't tolerate interference, colonialism of any kind."" The president said Ecuador had sought but did not receive guarantees that Assange would not be extradited to a third country. Assange, an Australian national, and his supporters claim a U.S. grand jury has been empaneled to consider charges against him. They fear if he is extradited to Sweden, he could be sent next to the United States. Assange was arrested in Britain in 2010 because Swedish authorities wanted to question him about the allegations. Two women accused him of sexually assaulting them during an August 2010 visit to Sweden in connection with a WikiLeaks release of internal U.S. military documents. Assange denies the allegations and argues they are in retribution for his organization's disclosure of American secrets. Publicly silent since last March, Assange is expected to speak at 2 p.m. Sunday -- two months to the day since he sought asylum -- according to WikiLeaks' official Twitter feed. Also Sunday, foreign ministers from member states of the Union of South American Nations will convene in Guayaquil, Ecuador, to discuss the asylum situation. Assange sought refuge at the embassy five days after the Supreme Court in Britain dismissed his bid to reopen his appeal of the decision to send him to Sweden, his last option in British courts. He is subject to arrest for breaking the terms of his bail, which required that he spend his nights at the home of a supporter outside London, police said the day after he entered the embassy.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and his opponent former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney have touted their records of hiring women while in office—but both candidates have a mixed record on equal hiring and closing the gender pay gap. Under the Obama administration, the median salary for female federal employees is nearly 93% of what men make, according to the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an agency that works to protect the rights of federal employees. That figure -- while up from just over 83% in 1991 -- does not represent complete pay parity. The Obama White House had women holding just under 40% of jobs paying $75,000 or more in 2011. According to a University of Massachusetts Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy study, when Romney was sworn in as governor in 2003, 42% of his administration's senior-level appointments were women. That figure dropped to 25% during the last two years of his tenure. Opinion: Does Romney 'get' women who work? The political gender wars erupted anew during Tuesday night's presidential debate when each candidate accused the other of not doing enough to help women. Some of the most heated exchanges between the candidates in their second debate were over so-called ""women's issues."" Obama pointed to the fact that the first bill he signed as president, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, eases the way for women to sue if they aren't being paid equitably. ""So we fixed that,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And that's an example of the kind of advocacy that we need because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family."" Romney had not stated a public position on Lilly Ledbetter before Tuesday's debate when he said he would not seek to repeal it. His running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, voted against the bill. 'Binders,' cooking and equal pay: Did Romney undo gains with women voters? Romney attempted to appeal to women's pocketbooks saying that women have been especially hard hit by the economic downturn — a problem he said he would solve if elected president. ""There are three and a half million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office,"" Romney said. ""We don't have to live like this. We can get this economy going again."" Ryan focused on how women fared under the Obama administration at a campaign rally in central Florida Thursday. ""Over 5 million women have just left the work force. Fewer women are working today than when he took office. And so of the people who have been hit the hardest, it's women."" Women are back on the job . ""[W]e've got to champion small businesses which are the kinds of companies that have flexible job schedules that women can get easily back in to the work force,"" continued Ryan. ""And of all the things we can do to get women back into the workforce, get them the skills they need, get an economy, and help those small businesses bring them back into the work force so they can provide for themselves and their families."" Nationally, women earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Behind the war of words is the reality that both candidates must make significant inroads with female voters — a group that makes up the majority of the electorate—in order to win the election. POLL: What are the most important women's issues? The candidates are statistically even among women voters in swing states, according to a new USA TODAY/Gallup Poll with Obama at 49% and Romney at 48%. These numbers track with similar polling data following Romney's strong performance in the first presidential debate. ""The race among women was much tighter in swing states,"" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. ""From now on, I would expect that President Obama will tout his record on pay equity and support for contraception to shore up support among women. Still, I would expect that Obama's performance will be stronger among single than married women. The question will be whether he can get single women to turn out in high rates this time around."" POLL: In swing states, likely women voters are split . Both candidates have used their records of hiring women to illustrate to potential voters that they understand women's issues. The White House points to highly placed women in the administration as an example of what it sees as its strong record of gender equality. Those positions include Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan as well as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. The White House also says that more than half of the staff is made up of women, who fulfill key senior leadership roles. Romney, who worked in business before serving as governor of Massachusetts, said he ""learned a great deal"" about the inequalities between men and women in the workplace when leading his state. The highest-ranking woman in his administration was Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey. Beth Myers has long held senior positions in Romney's political campaign. CNN Fact Check: Candidates positions on contraception? When he and his staff ran into problems finding qualified female applicants to fill Cabinet posts, Romney said he ""went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' and they brought us whole binders full of women."" Obama was quick to use the ""binders"" line against Romney on the campaign trail on Wednesday. ""We don't have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women ready to learn and teach in these fields right now,"" Obama told supporters in Mount Vernon, Iowa. Undecided women voters who were watching the debate and participating in a focus group in Ohio, reacted positively to Romney's anecdote during dial-testing for CNN. The responses from the women jumped sharply on-screen when Romney spoke about workplace flexibility. Three of Romney's former female cabinet members talk about their experience working for Romney when he was governor in an ad put out by the campaign on Thursday. Ellen Roy Herzfelder, who served as Romney's former secretary of environmental affairs; Jane Edmonds, Romney's former secretary of workforce; and Beth Lindstrom, former director of consumer affairs and business regulation, all appear in the ad.

"(CNN) -- The steep, picturesque canyons that wind through Colorado's northern Front Range have been a draw for tourists, day-trippers and homebuyers for more than a century. But when record-setting rainfall began to hit last week, those picturesque canyons became funnels that poured hundreds of tons of water per second into towns like Boulder, Longmont and Lyons and left hundreds stranded in the mountains above. ""This flood was a direct result of the large amount of rainfall that occurred in a widespread area, essentially from Denver north to almost the Wyoming state line, and for a long duration -- for about a 48-hour period last week,"" said Robert Kimbrough, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver. Coloradans are still digging out from those floods, which have been up to 1,000-year events in some communities. A stream of unusually humid air that was sweeping over the area early last week helped fuel the storms. High pressure east of the mountains bumped up against a low-pressure system to the west, triggering several days of storms as moist air flowed up the peaks of the Rockies, where cold air wrung the water out of it. The rain began September 10, with an inch recorded in Boulder. Nearly two inches fell the next day. Then on September 12, Boulder recorded 9.08 inches of rain -- nearly double the city's previous one-day record, and almost half its 20.5-inch yearly average. A forecaster in the National Weather Service office there called it ""biblical."" More than 4 more inches of rain fell by the week's end, bringing the September total to more than 17 inches so far. That's boosted the yearly precipitation figure, measured from October through September, to more than 30 inches to date -- the most in 120 years of record-keeping. The biggest rainfall amounts occurred over the foothills of the Rockies, Kimbrough said. That water poured down the mountainsides into the major tributaries of the South Platte River -- Boulder Creek and the St. Vrain, Big Thompson and Cache la Poudre rivers. How to help . ""It really originated in the streams that drain off the east side of the Continental Divide into the front range of Colorado, but it all happened fairly quickly,"" Kimbrough said. ""Even though the leading edge was in the foothills, we did see it very quickly on the 12th in communities like Boulder and Lyons and Longmont."" The result was six dead and about 200 who remained unaccounted for, though most of those are believed to be alive and well. Boulder County reduced its count from 109 people to four still unaccounted for on Wednesday, while in Larimer County, to the north, the number remained at 197. Nearly 18,000 homes have been damaged statewide. Now the runoff is coursing down the South Platte into neighboring Nebraska, where forecasters are warning of flooding into the weekend. ""We're in the Grand Island area anxiously waiting to see how the Platte River responds and to see how much of the water reaches us here,"" Mary Harner told CNN affiliate KHAS. Many in Colorado returned home to heartbreaking scenes. In Lyons, on the St. Vrain River 15 miles north of Boulder, high water pushed entire houses around like furniture. Streets were dotted with snapped utility poles. Stories of grief, generosity and gratitude . The extensive damage may present long-term problems for communities even as workers scramble to make repairs, Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said Tuesday. Questions of how to provide emergency services to areas where roads have been washed out or protect properties where the owners have been evacuated are still being worked out, he said. ""We have a new normal in Larimer County for months, if not a few years,"" Smith said.

"(CNN) -- The first time an assassin's bullet tried to find her, Maria Santos Gorrostieta escaped, but her husband was killed.

President-elect: More than drugs define Mexico . The bullets found her in January of 2010, but again, she survived. She remained defiant, lifting her shirt at one point to show reporters her bullet wounds and scars after the second attack. Gorrostieta finished her term as mayor in 2011 and remarried. But the forces who wanted her dead prevailed this month, kidnapping her while she drove her daughter to school. Gorrostieta's body was found last week, her hands bound. No bullets this time. Investigators said there was evidence of a blow to the back of the head. It was a shocking end to a public servant who vowed to put her small town's interests first while she held a position that many try to influence. ""I will rise up again as many times as God allows me to so that I can keep on seeking, fighting for, and working out plans, projects and actions for the benefit of the people, especially those most in need,"" Gorrostieta, who was also a medical doctor, said after one of the unsuccessful attacks against her. Michoacan is the scene of a turf war between rival drug cartels, and smaller organized crime groups operate there as well. In 2009, she spoke about the importance of entrusting the mayor's office to a woman. ""The most important thing is not to be afraid,"" she said then, gaining a reputation for civic-mindedness. Stories of heroes and villains constantly emerge from Mexico, where acts of bravery and savagery coexist in the midst of a plague of drug violence. Mexican beauty queen killed in shootout . Mexican president-elect: Not just drugs . Gorrostieta's story appears to fall easily within the heroic category, though a report published Tuesday in the leading newspaper El Universal is a reminder that the most accurate tales often include shades of gray. Even though a majority of Mexico is safe from drug violence, the newspaper described Gorrostieta's city of Tiquicheo as one where the local drug trade called the shots and, citing unnamed sources, may have factored in its politics. Investigators are not ruling out any possible motives -- political, personal or criminal -- in her killing, the state's deputy attorney general, Marco Aguilera, told CNN. The investigation is focusing on reconstructing the 11 months of Gorrostieta's life since leaving office and whether there is anything that indicates impending danger. The former mayor did not reach out to authorities to seek protection or to report threats at any time, Aguilera said. The deputy attorney general said that her first husband, Jose Sanchez, had been the target of a failed assassination attempt before the first attack against his wife, in which Sanchez died. Between them, the couple was targeted a total of four times, and a motive for the attacks was never established, Aguilera said.","Maria Santos Gorrostieta was fearless in the face of assassination attempts .

"(CNN) -- U.S. health officials expressed concern Friday that a swine flu virus that has infected eight people in the United States matches samples of a virus that has killed at least 68 people in Mexico. Swine flu is usually diagnosed only in pigs or people in regular contact with them. U.S. health experts also are concerned because more than 1,000 people have fallen ill in Mexico City in a short period of time. ""This situation has been developing quickly,"" said acting CDC director Richard Besser. ""This is something we are worried about."" New York health officials announced Friday they are testing about 75 students at a Queens school for swine flu after the students exhibited flu-like symptoms this week. A team of state health department doctors and staff went to the St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens on Thursday after the students reported cough, fever, sore throat, aches and pains. There have been no confirmed cases of swine flu there. The tests results are expected as early as Saturday. Of the 14 Mexican samples tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, seven were identical to the swine flu virus found in Texas and Southern California, Besser said at a news conference. An eighth U.S. case was reported Friday. All of the eight U.S. patients have recovered, Besser said.  Watch for more on the U.S. cases » . As a precaution to avoid further contamination, schools and universities in Mexico City and the state of Mexico were closed Friday, said the national health secretary, Jose Angel Cordova Villalobos. He said the schools may remain closed for a while. Sixty-eight people have died in Mexico City, Cordova said at a news conference. More than 1,000 other people have gotten sick, he said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon canceled a trip Friday to northern Mexico so he could remain in Mexico City to monitor the situation, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Calderon met with his Cabinet on Thursday night to discuss the outbreak. Six of the U.S. cases were found in California, and two in Texas, near San Antonio, CDC officials said. The Public Health Agency of Canada issued a respiratory alert for Mexico on Wednesday, recommending that health providers ""actively look for cases"" in Canada, particularly in people who've returned from Mexico within the last two weeks. An alert issued Friday by the International SOS medical and consulting company said more than 130 cases of a severe respiratory illness have been detected in south and central Mexico, some of which are due to influenza. ""Public health officials in Mexico began actively looking for cases of respiratory illness upon noticing that the seasonal peak of influenza extended into April, when cases usually decline in number,"" the medical alert said. ""They found two outbreaks of illness -- one centered around Distrito Federal (Mexico City), involving about 120 cases with 13 deaths. The other is in San Luis Potosi, with 14 cases and four deaths."" Authorities also detected one death in Oaxaca, in the south, and two in Baja California Norte, near San Diego, California. There was no indication why the International SOS tallies did not match the Mexican health secretary's figures. The majority of cases are occurring in adults between 25 and 44 years of age. The CDC first reported Tuesday that two California children in the San Diego area were infected with a virus called swine influenza A H1N1, whose combination of genes had not been seen before in flu viruses in humans or pigs. The first two cases were picked up through an influenza monitoring program, with stations in San Diego and El Paso, Texas. The program monitors strains and tries to detect new ones before they spread, the CDC said. Other cases emerged through routine and expanded surveillance. The human influenza vaccine's ability to protect against the new swine flu strain is unknown, and studies are ongoing, Schuchat said. There is no danger of contracting the virus from eating pork products, she said. The new virus has genes from North American swine and avian influenza, human influenza, and swine influenza normally found in Asia and Europe, said Nancy Cox, chief of the CDC's Influenza Division. The new strain of swine flu has resisted some antiviral drugs. The CDC is working with health officials in California and Texas and expects to find more cases, Schuchat said. A pandemic is defined as: a new virus to which everybody is susceptible; the ability to readily spread from person to person; and the capability of causing significant disease in humans, said Dr. Jay Steinberg, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta. The new strain of swine flu meets only one of the criteria: novelty. History indicates that flu pandemics tend to occur once every 20 years or so, so we're due for one, Steinberg said. ""I can say with 100 percent confidence that a pandemic of a new flu strain will spread in humans,"" he said. ""What I can't say is when it will occur."" CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.","NEW: Swine flu found in U.S. is same that killed at least 68 in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Before Sheldon Bruck told his orthodox Jewish parents he was gay, the teenager looked for a way out of homosexuality. His search led him to JONAH -- Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing -- which claimed on its website to help people ""struggling with unwanted same-sex sexual attractions."" JONAH co-director Arthur Goldberg promised Bruck, then 17, that ""JONAH could help him change his orientation from gay to straight,"" according to a consumer fraud lawsuit filed Tuesday against JONAH, Goldberg and a JONAH counselor. ""This is the first time that plaintiffs have sought to hold conversion therapists liable in a court of law,"" said Samuel Wolfe, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center. 'Gay cure' therapists, 'cured' student sue California over new law . The defendants did not respond to CNN calls and e-mails for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in Hudson County, New Jersey, Superior Court. A page on the organization's website touts success stories from the program with letters from past participants and their family members. Bruck and three male plaintiffs contend they were defrauded by JONAH's claim that ""being gay is a mental disorder"" that could be reversed by conversion therapy -- ""a position rejected by the American Psychiatric Association four decades ago,"" the lawsuit said. The therapy, which can cost up to $10,000 a year, put them at risk of ""depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior,"" while giving them no benefits, the suit said. Jo Bruck, Sheldon's mother, and Bella Levin, the mother of plaintiff Chaim Levin, are also plaintiffs because they paid for their sons' conversion therapy and the counseling the suit said they needed to recover from it. The conversion therapy techniques included having them strip naked in group sessions, cuddling and intimate holding of others of the same-sex, violently beating an effigy of their mothers with a tennis racket, visiting bath houses ""in order to be nude with father figures,"" and being ""subjected to ridicule as 'faggots' and 'homos' in mock locker room scenarios,"" the suit said. ""As long as you put in the effort, you're going to change,"" Goldberg told Bruck in the summer of 2009, the lawsuit said. JONAH counselor Thaddeus Heffner blamed Bruck's gay orientation ""on Bruck for not working hard enough to change, on his father for being too distant, and on his mother for being too close to him,"" the suit said. California governor OKs ban on gay conversion therapy, calling it 'quackery' Bruck quit after five sessions, delivered through an online video link, because he ""experienced deepening depression and anxiety leading to suicidal ideation and feelings of hopelessness about his life,"" the suit said. Heffner angrily warned Bruck that he was ""making a big mistake"" and ""throwing (his) life away"" by ""giving into (his) desires"" and that he would ""never lead a happy life,"" but would ""lead a life of unhappiness in that unhealthy lifestyle,"" the suit said. Chaim Levin, also an orthodox Jew, was about to turn 17 in 2007 when he talked to his parents about his sexual orientation and sexual abuse when he was younger. A rabbi in his Brooklyn, New York, community suggested to his parents that they enroll him in JONAH's program. ""You can change if you just try hard enough,"" the suit said Goldberg told him. ""You just need to work really hard, we are experts at this. We have helped so many people."" Levin attended weekly sessions for 18 months at JONAH's Jersey City, New Jersey, headquarters conducted by Alan Downing, an unlicensed JONAH counselor who calls himself a ""life coach,"" the suit said. Downing is named as a defendant in the case. ""I was manipulated into believing that I could change my sexual orientation, but instead I was subjected to terrible abuse that mirrored the traumatic assault that I experienced as a young person,"" Levin said at a news conference Tuesday. "" What I can tell you is that conversion therapy does not work. My family and I have wasted thousands of dollars and many hours on this scam."" The lawsuit described what happened in one of those sessions in October 2008 with Levin, who was 18 at the time. ""Downing initiated a discussion about Levin's body and instructed Levin to stand in front of a full-length mirror and hold a staff,"" the suit said. ""Downing directed Levin to say one negative thing about himself, remove an article of clothing, then repeat the process. Although Levin protested and expressed discomfort, at Downing's insistence, Levin submitted and continued until he was fully naked. Downing then instructed Levin to touch his penis and then his buttocks. Levin, unsure what to do but trusting in and relying on Downing, followed the instructions, upon which Downing said 'good' and the session ended."" Two other plaintiffs -- Benjamin Unger and Michael Ferguson -- described similar incidents in the suit. ""On one occasion, Downing instructed Unger to beat an effigy of his mother with a tennis racket, as though killing her, and encouraged Unger to scream at his mother while beating her effigy,"" the suit said. ""Conversion therapy was, in Unger's experience, 'psychological abuse,'"" it said. ""By the time he terminated sessions with JONAH, he was deeply depressed and had commenced taking antidepressant medications."" Downing ""picked apart every human emotion and childhood disappointment"" of Unger, to present them as treatable origins of Unger's orientation, the suit said. ""I watched as grown men were frenzied into fits of emotional rage against their mothers and encouraged to act out physical violence against their parents in order to access their so-called true manhood and become more heterosexual,"" Ferguson told reporters Tuesday. Unger's ability to have physical and emotional relationships with men was impaired and he was unable to work for a year, the suit said. Bruck, Levin, Unger and Ferguson are ""adjusting well"" four years after their last conversion therapy treatments, according to Wolfe. ""They have had time to get on with their lives,"" he said. Their lawsuit should put all conversion therapists on notice that they can be held accountable, Wolfe said. The SPLC has identified 70 conversion therapy providers across the United States. A California law signed by Gov. Jerry Brown last month made it illegal for licensed counselors to use the therapy with clients under 18. ""We really want to bring this lawsuit to bring attention to this practice that takes place in many parts of the country, preying on vulnerable young people,"" Wolfe said.

"Washington (CNN) -- At one time, Susan Rice seemed to be on a trajectory that would take her to the secretary of state's office in President Barack Obama's second term. But that trajectory changed Thursday when the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations withdrew her name from consideration to succeed current Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In a letter to the president, Rice explained her decision to pull herself out of the running. ""I am highly honored to be considered by you for appointment as Secretary of State,"" the letter read. ""However, if nominated, I am now convinced that the confirmation process would be lengthy, disruptive and costly -- to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities. That trade-off is simply not worth it to our country. ... Therefore, I respectfully request that you no longer consider my candidacy at this time."" A former administration official with knowledge of Rice's decision said this was Rice's decision; the White House did not ask her to stand down. Obama said that while he regretted Rice's decision to withdraw he would continue to rely on her advice. Rice's path began decades ago with the help of family friend Madeleine Albright, the woman who became the first female secretary of state. Benghazi talking points omitted link to al Qaeda . Albright, while serving under President Bill Clinton, recommended that he tap Rice for a high-level State Department post on African affairs in the late 1990s. Albright had previously served with Rice's mother, Lois Rice, on a school board in Washington and watched Rice grow up with her own daughters. ""If I were to characterize her, whether it's playing basketball or anything else, she's fearless,"" Albright said about Rice in a Washington Post interview during her time as the top U.S. diplomat. Rice, 48, was born in Washington to parents with distinguished careers. Her mother, who currently serves as a guest lecturer at the Brookings Institution and is an expert on financing of higher education, served on the board of directors of 11 major U.S. corporations. Her father, Emmett Rice, died in 2011. He was a professor of economics at Cornell University, was a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and flew with the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II. Susan Rice told the Washington Post after her father's death that he instilled in her ""a strong sense of personal and social responsibility"" that guided her career decisions. ""He believed mightily in the power of the individual to determine his or her own destiny,"" she said. And by all accounts, Rice determined her own destiny and amassed a slew of notable accomplishments. Stanford, Oxford, White House job . One of Rice's former teachers at the National Cathedral School noted her accomplishments in a letter to the editor after the Washington Post's Dana Milbank published a November 18 column questioning her readiness to become secretary of state. Rice, who was valedictorian of her class and a star point guard on the basketball team, exhibited ""superior leadership skills"" and ""left behind a remarkable legacy"" that included a revised honor code still used at the school, John Wood wrote. Intelligence on Benghazi shifted after Obama administration described attack as 'spontaneous' Rice earned Phi Beta Kappa honors at Stanford University, where she earned her bachelors degree in history and won a Rhodes Scholarship to study international relations at Oxford University in 1986. Rice's work at Oxford, where she earned her masters and later a doctorate in international relations, earned the Chatham House-British International Studies Association Prize for the top doctoral dissertation in the United Kingdom in international relations. After graduation, Rice headed to McKinsey & Company in Toronto, where she worked as an international management consultant. In 1992, she married Ian Cameron, a producer for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, whom she had met at Stanford. In 1993, Rice returned to Washington to take a position with the National Security Council as director of international organizations and peacekeeping. A year later, she toured war-torn Rwanda after the genocide campaign there killed more than 800,000 people in 100 days. She told journalist Samantha Power that if she ever faced such a crisis again she would come down on the side of taking action, unlike the course the Clinton administration and the rest of the world took at the time. Rice was promoted in 1995 to become special assistant to the president and senior director of African affairs at the White House National Security Council. Clinton stands by Rice after calls to step down . She became a senior fellow in 2002 at Brookings, where she specialized in the study of U.S. foreign relations, and was national security and foreign relations adviser for Obama's 2008 campaign. In nominating her to the ambassador's post, Obama called Rice ""a close and trusted adviser"" and said she ""shares my belief that the U.N. is an indispensable -- and imperfect -- forum."" At the same time, she has drawn some attention for the way she operates. Insiders say Rice is ambitious and aggressive. Colum Lynch of the Washington Post and Foreign Policy told CNN that one of her nicknames at the U.N. Security Council is ""The Bulldozer."" ""I think that everyone has complicated feelings about her,"" Lynch said. He characterized her as ""very personable, likeable, charming, smart, funny, down to earth"" but also someone with sharp elbows. ""You don't want to get in the way of her, and whether that's a point to her advantage or a point against her, well, I guess it depends on who you are asking,"" Lynch said. Benghazi controversy . In the days following the September 11 attacks on the Benghazi consulate that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, Rice became the administration's point person on the matter. In multiple TV appearances after that attack, Rice cited a hateful video that fueled a spontaneous mob attack as the reason for the deaths. Senior U.S. officials have said that Rice's comments were based on an intelligence assessment that was later updated to reflect a preliminary view that demonstrators were not the culprits. Lawmakers say meeting with Rice left them with more questions . The most strident Republicans suggested the characterization of the attack as a mob gone awry might have been the basis for a cover-up during a ferocious political campaign. Criticism intensified as the explanation of events slowly shifted, with the administration eventually raising the possibility that the attack was planned by al Qaeda. Some leading Senate Republicans said they could not support Rice if Obama nominated her to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. While Obama has not indicated whom he might appoint, White House sources have said that Rice was a top candidate. Rice did little to quell criticism of her when she visited the Hill to meet with her toughest critics over Benghanzi -- Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. The session, called by Rice to answer questions about her comments, ended up with the lawmakers saying they were ""significantly troubled"" by many of her answers. Graham said Rice's comments amounted to a ""statement disconnected from reality"" and that his concerns about Rice were ""greater today than they were before."" McCain said the ""information that she gave the American people was incorrect."" In a statement following the meeting, which also included Acting CIA Director Michael Morrell, Rice said the two stressed that ""neither I nor anyone else in the administration intended to mislead the American people at any stage in this process, and the administration updated Congress and the American people as our assessments evolved."" After Rice had withdrawn, an administration official voiced frustration that Rice had been unfairly targeted over Benghazi. ""It's absolutely a fact that she had nothing to do with the security presence in Benghazi and the intelligence collection or assessment. All she did was some interviews using cleared talking points that reflected our best understanding of the situation as we knew it at that time, the official said. ""The fact that four people died in Libya is a tragedy, but Susan Rice had nothing to do with that tragedy. The fact that they focused on her talking points is a disservice to everyone who cares about this issue."" Following Rice's decision, Graham released a statement saying, ""I respect Ambassador Rice's decision.,"" Graham said."" President Obama has many talented people to choose from to serve as our next Secretary of State."" Graham added that he would continue to try to get the bottom of Benghazi. Obama, had fiercely defended Rice since Republicans first began to question her nomination -- first in the second presidential debate and later in his first news conference after his re-election. He continued his support in a statement responding to Rice's decision. ""I have every confidence that Susan has limitless capability to serve our country now and in the years to come, and know that I will continue to rely on her as an advisor and friend,"" the president said. ""While I deeply regret the unfair and misleading attacks on Susan Rice in recent weeks, her decision demonstrates the strength of her character, and an admirable commitment to rise above the politics of the moment to put our national interests first.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistan Taliban said Wednesday it will not extend a cease-fire with the Pakistani government, six days after a weeks-long pause in hostilities officially ended. In a statement released to the news media, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, alleged the Pakistani government hadn't responded positively to the cease-fire, which began as a monthlong observance on March 1 and eventually was extended to April 10. One of the militant group's leaders, Umer Khalid Khurrsani, said Wednesday that the government wasn't serious about peace and that the only way to implement Sharia, Islamic law, was jihad. The group made a series of demands this month, including the release of detained noncombatants. Pakistan's government has not yet issued a response to the announcement, Interior Ministry spokesman Danial Gillani said Wednesday. The TTP has waged an insurgency against the Pakistani government, fighting for its austere version of Sharia across Pakistan and rejecting the country's constitution. Pakistan announced a peace initiative, and a cease-fire was reached to pave the way for talks, but discussions broke down in March after Taliban attacks. Pakistani government representatives did meet the Taliban for talks on March 26, the first direct contact between the two sides. The Taliban had made demands, including the release of noncombatants, in early April. At least 19 Taliban noncombatants were released earlier as a good will gesture to promote peace talks, said Shaukatullah Khan, governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The release came at the directive of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Khan said. Since taking office last year, Sharif faced mounting pressure to bring the violence under control.","The cease-fire was agreed upon March 1 and officially was in effect until April 10 .

"(CNN) -- The bullets that killed Colorado prison chief Tom Clements came from the gun found with a former inmate who died in a shootout with Texas police two days later, investigators confirmed Monday. The news came as Colorado held a public memorial service for Clements, the executive director of the state Department of Corrections. The El Paso County, Colorado, Sheriff's Department said it was still trying to determine whether the suspect in Clements' slaying, Evan Ebel, acted alone or what his motive may have been. ""Tom Clements was a remarkable person,"" Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said. ""He oversaw all of the coldest, darkest of worlds with the warmest and, you know, and most tender of hearts."" FBI seeks links in Texas, Colorado killings . Clements was shot to death Tuesday night at his home outside Colorado Springs. Ebel was killed Thursday in northern Texas after a gunbattle with authorities that left a sheriff's deputy wounded. The 28-year-old was a former white supremacist gang member and the son of a longtime friend of Hickenlooper. Police also said there is a ""strong connection"" between the killings of Clements and the killing of Nathan Collin Leon, a Denver pizza delivery driver who was found dead in suburban Golden. Investigators said they have been looking into whether Ebel might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements. The corrections chief earned widespread recognition not only for prison reforms but also for a crackdown on prison gangs, including the white supremacist 211s, who once counted Ebel among their ranks. Ebel got out of prison in late January after serving seven years -- three for felony menacing, robbery and assault, another four for assaulting a guard. He spent five years of that time in solitary confinement. It was his second stretch in prison, after doing one year of a three-year term for armed robbery. Ebel's father, attorney and former oil executive Jack Ebel, ""was one of my first friends in Colorado,"" Hickenlooper said. But the governor said Evan Ebel ""had an anger and a cruelty"" from an early age. ""He had a bad streak, and they tried everything,"" Hickenlooper said. ""One of the things Tom fought for was we have too many people in solitary confinement with mental disorders like Evan Ebel, and we release them -- we won't release them in prison, we release them into the general public,"" Hickenlooper said. It was a ""quiet crusade"" for Clements to identify and treat mental illness among prisoners, he said. The governor said Clements' death was ""incomprehensible, but I don't think it is part of a larger conspiracy."" The Texas Rangers said Ebel opened fire on sheriff's deputies northwest of Dallas on Thursday. He slammed the black Cadillac he was driving into a tractor-trailer, then crawled out and fired more shots at deputies before being shot in the head. The 9mm pistol and a Domino's Pizza uniform jacket and box carrier were found with the Cadillac. Witnesses had reported a similar vehicle, -- a black, boxy car with Colorado license plates -- near Clements' home in Monument the day he was killed. Investigators had already said the brand and caliber of the shells found with the weapon were the same as those found at Clements' home. CNN's Brooke Baldwin and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","Suspect ""had an anger and a cruelty"" early on, Hickenlooper says .

"(CNN) -- U.S. journalist Austin Tice, who went missing while working in Syria two weeks ago, has been captured and is being held in Syrian government custody, The Washington Post reported Thursday, citing a senior diplomat and others familiar with the matter. The Post is one of several news outlets for which Tice, 31, filed stories since he began reporting from Syria in May. He also reported for McClatchy Newspapers and Al-Jazeera English. Tice's family immediately called for his release, saying in a statement, ""Austin is our precious son, and we beseech the Syrian government to treat him well and return him safely to us as soon as possible."" The executive editor of The Post, Marcus Brauchli, also urged authorities to release Tice, as did Anders Gyllenhaal, McClatchy's vice president for news. ""We welcome the news that Austin Tice is likely being held by the Syrian government, although this has still not been confirmed by government authorities,"" Gyllenhaal said in a statement. ""If this is indeed the case, it means we move to a new stage of waiting for his release. ""There's no basis for detaining a journalist. Austin is a respected and very dedicated reporter and we would expect his immediate release."" Tice's last public post was August 11 on Twitter, where he said he spent the day with members of the rebel Free Syrian Army at a pool party with music. The U.S. State Department has been working through the Czech Embassy in Damascus to learn details of Tice's whereabouts. The Post and the Committee to Protect Journalists, an advocacy group, both reported it was the Czech ambassador to Syria who first revealed the news about Tice on Thursday. Reporters Without Borders, another advocacy group, says Syria is one of the most dangerous places for journalists. Ten have been killed since the start of the conflict early last year, it says.","The Washington Post says Austin Tice is being held in Damascus .

"(CNN) -- The evacuation of thousands of Pakistani civilians has become a major challenge as military planes attacked suspected anti-government militant hideouts in North Waziristan. More than 60,000 people, many of them children, have fled for safer areas in Pakistan and Afghanistan, according to a United Nations-supported news network that reports on humanitarian efforts. The Integrated Regional Information Networks said Pakistani authorities haven't set up camps yet. But Pakistani officials said school buildings in the Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Tank, Karak and Hangu districts would be opened as shelters for people fleeing the conflict. Pakistan on Sunday launched a military operation in North Waziristan, a restive province near the border with Afghanistan,in an attempt to ""finish off"" militants in the area ""once and for all,"" Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told CNN. The Pakistani Taliban is among the targets. Scores of vehicles have moved toward North Waziristan to evacuate the stranded people. Local tribesmen complain that transporters are charging high rates because there's a severe shortage of vehicles. A registration point has been established at Saidge near Bakkakhel and a camp has also been set up at Baran Dam, the government said. Two women were among seven civilians killed in Hangu when gunmen opened fire on them Wednesday. Police spokesman Noor Mohammed said unidentified men trespassed into a house and killed the seven people. Mohammed told CNN the killing may be sectarian in nature.

"(CNN) -- I'll never forget watching Lady Diana Spencer tie the knot with Charles, the Prince of Wales, on July 29, 1981. Like most women in the Western world, I'd been obsessed with ""The Royal Engagement"" since the shocking announcement that Charles was finally giving up his single status at the fairly old age of 32, to marry the adorable 20-year-old Diana. I was as naïve as the poor unsuspecting Diana and had no idea that this wasn't a real fairy tale romance. I breathlessly read the stories about how the pair had met through her older sister, Sarah Spencer, whom Charles had once dated! And I closely followed the endless speculation about who would design Diana's dress. If you think that the media and the public have gone hog wild over Prince Williams' wedding to Kate Middleton, you'd be surprised by how we were whipped into even more of a royal frenzy by the Diana and Charles nuptials. Watch the royal wedding and share it with iReport . After all, William and Kate have dated for eight years, whereas Charles was linked to a series of blue-blooded types and then, suddenly, was marrying an adorable kindergarten teacher who had also worked as a nanny. Diana may have been the daughter of the 8th Earl Spencer, but she was also the first relatable royal. Diana was just like us! She was shy and pretty but not beautiful, and she was caught by photographers wearing a skirt that turned sheer in the sunlight. She'd suffered a wardrobe malfunction that we could all sympathize with. So of course, I had to be one of the 750 million people out of bed on the big wedding day, watching the royal procession to St. Paul's Cathedral in London. In fact, my husband and I honored the occasion by gathering for a 6 a.m. tea party around my friend Barb's TV, along with several other of our friends. While we watched Diana ride in a beautiful traditional carriage to St. Paul's, we munched on scones and clotted cream, and drank endless cups of tea. The guys all wore bow ties and top hats. My girlfriends and I turned out in old prom dresses and white gloves. Hey, we wanted to get fully into the wedding spirit. When Diana stepped out of her carriage, our mouths dropped at the sight of her stunning ivory silk taffeta and lace dress designed by the husband-and-wife design team, David and Elizabeth Emanuel. The unusual design of Diana's dress, with its ruffled v-neck neckline, stunned us. It was unlike anything we'd ever seen --extravagant but but modest, with its big puffed sleeves and full skirt. And as romantic as it was, Diana herself with her adorable shaggy haircut looked perfectly modern. No one expected a bride to be sexy in those days, like many brides today -- especially celebrity brides. I hope Kate Middleton resists the temptation to go sexy or body conscious when she weds William. Hopefully, the reason she is dieting down to next-to-nothing now isn't because her gown is form-fitting. When I watched Diana wed Charles, I never imagined that I would get to meet her twice, in the coming years. The first occasion was when Diana hosted a party honoring English designers at London Fashion Week in Flare, 1987. At the time, I was editor-in-chief of Flare, Canada's fashion magazine. Diana greeted all of us in a reception line, with 5-year-old Prince William by her side. Little William looked thrilled to be standing next to his beautiful mommy in formal shorts and a white shirt, shaking everyone's hand. When it was my turn to take Diana's hand, I complimented her on what a wonderful job she was doing as Princess of Wales, and she smiled, looked directly into my eyes and murmured that her husband was a wonderful teacher. She seemed completely genuine and still very much in love with Charles. She was also charismatic and even more stunning up close, in person, than in pictures. She made me feel like she was thrilled to meet me. She had the same effect when I met her again at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards in January 1995, in New York City. Diana had come to present her good friend Liz Tilberis, then editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar magazine, with an award for editorial achievement. Diana was stunning, and you could see her toned arms in a sleek navy gown. When we were introduced, she seemed completely engrossed when we chatted for a few minutes about how competitive the fashion magazine world was. I was the editor-in-chief of Marie Claire then, and Diana had the same effect on me as she had the first time we met -- she was far more beautiful in person than in photos. Everything about her -- from her skin and her eyes to her handshake and conversation -- emanated warmth. With a mother like that, it's no wonder William wanted to marry Kate, a woman he knows through and through, and with whom he has an obviously warm and loving relationship. Having met Diana, I have no doubt she would have made Kate, her soon-to-be daughter-in-law, feel like her BFF from the moment William brought her home. If Diana were here Friday, she'd be beaming to the Westminster Abbey rafters. There's no doubt in my mind that she's beaming in heaven!","Bonnie Fuller: The media and the public went hog wild over the Diana and Charles nuptials .

"(CNN) -- In a presidential election dominated by Iran's conservative ruling clerics and Ayatollah Khamenei's followers, a virtual female candidate named ""Zahra"" rose to compete with the all-male ensemble approved by the country's Guardian Council. ""Zahra is created to demand fair and free elections and seek respect for our basic human rights, especially for women who were rejected to run in this election; and others who can't have their voices heard in Iran,"" said Firuzeh Mahmoudi, executive director of the U.S.-based non-profit organization United4Iran, which ran her online campaign. ""The goal of the Zahra campaign is to expose a corrupt and exclusive political landscape through satire,"" said Mahmoudi, adding that he believed creative opposition tactics could help revive people's hopes and dreams. United4Iran said Zahra received almost 2,000 virtual votes. Her campaign also had nearly 4,000 Facebook supporters, with many from Iran. WATCH: Iranian cartoon popular candidate on the web . Amir Soltani -- an Iranian-American writer -- and Khalil, an Arab illustrator based in San Francisco, had previously created Zahra as the main character in an online graphic novel aimed at blurring the line between the virtual space and the real world and showing support for democracy in Iran. In their novel, Zahra searches for her young son ""Mehdi"" -- a ""Green Movement"" activist -- in the aftermath of the much-disputed 2009 Iranian elections. She eventually finds him dead in ""Zahra's Paradise,"" Tehran's largest cemetery. Soltani and Khalil were inspired by the true events of the 2009 post presidential election, including the fatal shootings of Neda Agha Soltan and Sohrab Aarabi, whose deaths at peaceful anti-government protests became a rallying cry for the opposition and human rights groups. ""We did not have to bury the body and the dreams of another generation of Iranian youth in dust and dirt. There had to be some ways of turning all that death back into life, some way of defying gravity and turning time around -- for me, that way was to tell the story of a burial in Zahra's Paradise,"" Soltani told CNN. Websites associated with Iran's government attacked the Zahra campaign for presidency as a ""highly sophisticated and professionally organized plot"" launched by the CIA and Zionist agents. Soltani said Zahra's campaign gained momentum in May, as the international media noticed this fictional character particularly after almost 700 candidates -- including 30 women -- were rejected during the Guardian Council's vetting process. The council is made up of six clerics and six lawyers and operates under the oversight of Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader. From all those registered, only eight were given the opportunity to run in Iran's eleventh presidential election and replace the outgoing president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ""It's a slap to the people's face, when a group of 12 old men, almost all of them over 70, decide who gets to run for presidency; and determine the faith of a society -- especially, a society where woman are arguably its most vibrant, energetic and bright sector that make up 60% of its educated class,"" said Abbas Milani, an Iran scholar who heads the Iranian Studies Department at Stanford University. In the days leading up to Iran's presidential election, Ayatollah Yazdi, one of the 12 members of the Guardian Council denounced women's right to run for president. The semi-official Iranian Mehr news agency quoted Yazdi as saying the ""law does not approve"" of a woman in Iran's highest elected office and that this is ""not allowed."" In March, the Iran Human Rights Documentation Centre said the 1979 revolution that brought Iran's current regime to power was ""in many respects a point of 'no return' for women's rights."" ""Women suffer from severe oppression, whether it's discrimination in universities by the governing system, or on the street being harassed by the 'morality police' about what they are wearing and whether or not their head scarves are covering enough of their hair and abiding the regime's Islamic rules and regulations,"" said Sahar Rezazadeh, a student activist who finished her Master's Degree in Communication in Tehran. Recently, Rezazadeh and her husband Reza took refuge in the United States as her husband was an outspoken reformist and activist in Iran. ""The goal with Zahra's campaign is to move our basic fundamental human, civil and social rights from dreams to reality; because by creating our reality, even if not currently political viable, we are introducing possibilities to change the political landscape of today and tomorrow,"" said Mahmoudi. A political landscape that former female parliamentarian Fatemeh Haghighatjoo said for the past eight years had ""oppressed people, especially women and youth through a strong militant governing body."" Haghighatjoo served from 2000-2004 and was the first to resign when the Guardian Council banned more than 2,000 reformist candidates from the seventh parliamentary election. In 2005, she moved to the United States. However, Haghighatjoo said that the election of moderate politician Hassan Rouhani to the presidency had ""created a change in the political landscape."" Rouhani was backed by former reformist President Mohammad Khatami and Iran's political power-player Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. During his campaign, he strongly criticized the conservatives and promised social, political and cultural reforms for women. He also promised to create a Ministry of Women's Affairs to help address women's issues. ""Rouhani now has the ability to shift the socio-political and cultural landscape of Iran from the old didactic and heavily militant ambiance into a liberal and reformist society that allows change and reform for everyone, especially women,"" Haghighatjoo said. ""I just wanted a reformist, someone different, someone who is not a lunatic conservative,"" a 25-year-old university student, Roshanak, told CNN via Facebook. Roshanak lives in Tehran and asked that her surname not be used. ""You should have seen the city today [June 15], for the past eight years you could smell oppression everywhere; but today, there was liberty, a small sense of freedom, people were genuinely smiling and loud music was no longer banned, you could feel that people were starting to believe again,"" she said. But with the Iranian election fading away in the real world, Mahmoudi and the campaign plan to use Zahra's virtual celebrity to continue to campaign against social and political inequalities for women; and call for democracy and reform in Iran -- an aspiration that this virtual character says she owes to the ""children of Iran and those we lost like Neda, Mehdi, and Sohrab."" ""Zahra exists for those of us that have nowhere else to turn, to give us a vote for what we believe in,"" said Mahmoudi.","""Zahra"" is a fictional character in an online graphic novel made after Iran's 2009 election .

"Renacimiento, Mexico (CNN) -- As raging floodwaters swept away half of his timber shack, Saturnino Medina climbed to the roof. He pointed Thursday to the place where river waters broke through a container wall and washed away his kitchen. Medina and his family have almost nothing left now, after the wind and rain of Manuel hit the town of Renacimiento, located about 20 km northeast of the resort city of Acapulco. Days after the storm made landfall as a tropical depression in the Mexican state of Guerrero, thousands of tourists are still trapped in Acapulco and thousands of families are struggling to recover. Medina and his family were left to eat eggs and tortillas donated by neighbors and drink expired cartons of juice they found in a nearby trash dumpster. So far, he said, they haven't gotten any government aid. ""The truth is, I don't even know what to tell you,"" he said. ""The government ignores us. They help everyone else, but they've forgotten about Renacimiento."" The town is one of many across Mexico ravaged by multiple storms that have been battering the country. Federal officials say at least 97 people were killed across Mexico by Manuel, which plowed into the country's Pacific coast, and Ingrid, which hit the Gulf coast. Rescue efforts continued throughout the country Thursday. In one Guerrero town ravaged by a mudslide, authorities said 68 people remained unaccounted for. An aerial survey revealed many more mudslides, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said, and there are additional reports of disappearances that authorities have not yet confirmed. In Renacimiento, one of the hardest-hit areas, Alma Rojano said neck-high floodwaters washed by her home. Days after the storm hit, bulldozers and cleanup crews finally arrived in the town on Thursday. In a press conference Thursday night, federal officials said that climate conditions had made it difficult to reach more remote parts of the country, but pledged that government aid was on the way. ""Right now we are facing a truly extraordinary condition,"" President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto said, noting that the extent of the heavy rains over such a large part of the country had reached ""historic"" proportions. Tourists stranded . Ana Benavides, a stranded American tourist in nearby Acapulco, tried to leave by car. She didn't get more than a mile before blocked roads stopped her. Then she waited for 12 hours in a line along with thousands of other stuck tourists hoping to get on a flight out. While more than 10,000 tourists had been evacuated in this way, there was no guarantee that Benavides would be one of the lucky ones to board a plane. Some people, in their desperation, slept in the line. Benavides kept her situation in perspective: ""You know, we're a lot better off than a lot of people,"" she said. Manuel left about 40,000 tourists stranded in Acapulco. As of Thursday, more than 10,000 were able to board military or commercial flights out of the storm-ravaged area. Authorities said they hope to reopen the highway leading out of Acapulco on Friday, which would allow for thousands more to leave and quicken the flow of food and other aid to the area. The worst of a deadly storm has passed, but tension and confusion remain as the extent of the damage continued to emerge. The weather in Acapulco has improved. And the storm -- Manuel -- weakened Thursday from a hurricane to a tropical storm. But it was still expected to produce 5 to 10 inches of rain over the northern state of Sinaloa, with some places getting as much as 15 inches, forecasters said. Ingrid batters Gulf coast . In addition to Manuel, those living on Mexico's Gulf Coast were recovering from the remnants of Hurricane Ingrid, and in the south, a storm system over the Yucatan Peninsula was likely to become a tropical cyclone. On the Gulf Coast, in the state of Veracruz, Ingrid and its remnants claimed 11 lives. About 32,000 people had to be evacuated from their homes. Residents there sent photos to CNN showing streets that looked like rivers, with the tops of cars sticking out of the floodwaters. Another major concern in the Gulf Coast was that the new storm system brewing in the south could bring more rain to the already saturated area. More than 1 million residents across Mexico have been affected in some way by the storms, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told reporters. 18 stranded in New Mexico 'ghost town' amid flooding . In violence-ravaged state, another devastating blow . In Guerrero state, the storms were yet another devastating blow to a part of the country already suffering from some of the country's fiercest drug-related violence. When government cleanup crews arrived in Renacimiento on Thursday, a security detail accompanied them. Two pickup trucks circled the area, packed with heavily armed police officers wearing bullet-proof jackets. A woman ran screaming out of her storm-battered home -- not because of the damage -- but because she learned her son had been kidnapped. Nearby, Paulina Bravo and Teodoro Medina were cleaning up storm damage. Their house was still intact, but floodwaters destroyed their stove, refrigerator and beds. ""Now, my husband and I take turns sleeping in this hammock,"" Bravo said. Two bags of bread, she said, are the only government aid she's received so far. Bravo and her husband shoveled mud out of their home, determined to clean up after the storm, whether anyone from the government helps them or not. In Spanish, the town's name -- Renacimiento -- means rebirth. Shasta Darlington reported from Renacimiento and Acapulco, Guerrero. CNN's Krupskaia Alis, Catherine E. Shoichet, Mariano Castillo and CNNMexico contributed to this report.","NEW: In one town, 68 people remain missing after a mudslide .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts mom said police went too far when they paid her and her 5-year-old daughter a visit for failing to return their library books on time. ""She's 5; she didn't understand,"" said Shannon Benoit of her daughter, Hailey. Police said Tuesday that an officer showed up last week at the Benoit's home in the town of Charlton to inform the family that the books were long overdue. Hailey -- who was standing beside her mom when the officer arrived -- then burst into tears. 'Is that policeman going to arrest me?'"" Benoit quoted her daughter to CNN affiliate WBZ-TV. ""I was scared,"" added Hailey. The books, titled ""How To Tie My Shoes"" and ""Eloise's Birthday,"" had been sitting on Hailey's bookshelf since April. But a Charlton Public Library spokeswoman said that it wasn't just Hailey's overdue books that prompted the police intervention. She also noted $100 worth of late fees for overdue audio books checked out by Hailey's father, Tony Benoit. ""I asked the chief... 'When does something borrowed become stolen?"" said Cheryl Hansen. ""'The chief said, 'When it's overdue!"""" Hansen said that despite a warning letter and library calls made to the family, the books had remained unreturned. ""We thought this would be a kinder way, a friendly reminder saying 'Hey can you bring this back,' rather than sending a summons,"" she added. Police Chief James A. Pervier said his officers have been asked by library personnel to make similar visits to at least 13 other Charlton households over library late fees. Officials say the police-backed crackdown has since inspired more prompt book returns among library patrons. ""We've gotten quite a bit back,"" said Hansen. ""Even some things that weren't overdue!"" Benoit told CNN that she has since returned the overdue books, making the return trip to the library shortly after the officer's visit.","Police stop by family's house to tell them to return their daughter's overdue library books .

"(CNN) -- Did Yasser Arafat die eight years ago of natural causes or was the 75-year-old Palestinian leader poisoned, as his widow believes? That's the question forensic investigators from at least three nations are trying to answer by testing samples taken from Arafat's body, which was exhumed Tuesday and reburied a short time later. Tests are being performed on those samples for the presence of polonium -- a toxic, radioactive element found on some of his personal belongings earlier this year. For five decades, Arafat was the most prominent face of Palestinian opposition to Israel, first as the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which carried out attacks against Israeli targets, and later as the head of the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, which runs the West Bank, says it is convinced Israel is behind any poisoning of Arafat. ""We had nothing to do with it,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""Those charges are ludicrous and it's conspiracy theories which, as you know, sometimes have legs of their own. But, as you know, there is no truth in it whatsoever."" French authorities -- responding to a request from his widow -- opened a murder inquiry into Arafat's death this year after high levels of polonium-210 were detected on Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and his keffiyeh, the trademark black-and-white headscarf he often wore. France opened the investigation partly because Arafat died there in 2004. While France is leading the investigation, forensic experts from Switzerland and Russia took their own samples for independent analysis. 'Proof in our hands' Arafat's widow, Suha, told CNN on Tuesday that she doesn't feel comfortable accusing a person or a country of poisoning her husband, but she wants the investigators to keep working. ""I will tell you everybody is accusing Israel,"" she told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""I can't just conclude without having all the proof in our hands."" Amanpour asked the widow whether she regrets turning down a chance to have her husband's body undergo an autopsy when he died. Suha said it never occurred to her to have one performed. ""Nobody asked me to do an autopsy,"" she said. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas subsequently approved the exhumation from Arafat's mausoleum in the Palestinian presidential compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah. But the presence of high levels of polonium-210 on his belongings does not mean Arafat was poisoned, according to FranÃ§ois Bochud, director of the Swiss institute that carried out the tests. Some details in Arafat's medical records are not consistent with polonium poisoning, he explained, and ""the only way to resolve this anomaly would be by testing the body."" So what is Polonium-210 and how does it work? Polonium-210 is not a radioactive substance that emits gamma particles, which can travel through walls at extremely high energies. Instead, as polonium-210 decays, it releases alpha particles, which can't even pass through a piece of paper. But alpha particles are still dangerous. They travel short distances and retain a high amount of energy. Bottom line: It may be very difficult to determine if Arafat was poisoned with the substance, but taking samples was less of a task. This week experts retrieved the samples from Arafat's body without disturbing the whole of him so officials would not have to do a military reburial as was planned, according to Tawfiq Tirawi, head of a Palestinian investigation committee. Palestinian leadership placed flowers at Arafat's mausoleum, Tirawi told reporters. Poisoning rumors . For Suha Arafat, that event was difficult to watch. ""I will tell you something very emotional today while I was seeing his, you know, reburial and his remains,"" she told Amanpour. ""I thought I would promise all my Palestinian people that his remains will go ... to Jerusalem, as he always wanted to be buried in the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem."" Arafat died at age 75 at a Paris military hospital after he suffered a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma. Palestinian officials said in the days before his death that Arafat had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems. Rumors of poisoning circulated at the time, but Palestinian officials denied them, and then-Foreign Minister Nabil Sha'ath said he ""totally"" ruled them out. Two weeks after Arafat's death, his nephew said medical records showed no cause of death. Nasser al-Kidwa, who was the Palestinian observer to the United Nations, said toxicology tests showed ""no known poison"" -- though he refused to exclude the possibility that poison caused his uncle's death. ""The suspicion that he was killed, that he was deliberately murdered, has been there all along and most Palestinians believe that,"" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee. ""I personally believed it because I was with him; I saw him; I saw the transformation and it certainly was unnatural."" Ashrawi said she had spoken with Arafat's doctors, who told her that they could not rule out the possibility that he had been poisoned. ""But we didn't have any kind of thread, any kind of evidence,"" she told CNN in July. Referring to the report that showed polonium-210 on some of his belongings, Ashrawi said it ""in many ways, tells us our suspicions are founded that there is sufficient evidence to say that he was killed, that he was assassinated using polonium."" Only a few countries, including the United States, Israel and Russia, have stocks of polonium-210, a fact that would limit the list of possible suspects, according to Cham Dallas, a professor and toxicologist at the University of Georgia's Institute for Health Management and Mass Destruction Defense. ""You would only use polonium if you were making a statement, not if you were trying to hide,"" he said. Someone trying to get away with murder would be better off using pharmaceutical agents, since a number of of them ""disappear in the body"" and cannot be identified later, he said. ""I can't figure out why they would use it, frankly,"" he said. ""There are so many really cool agents to kill people if you want to be secret and even if you want to make a statement."" Polonium-210 made headlines in 2006, when it was used to kill Alexander Litvinenko, a former KGB agent who came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. In a deathbed statement from a London hospital, Litvinenko blamed Russia's President Vladimir Putin, an accusation the Kremlin strongly denied. But it's hard to compare the cases of Arafat and Litvinenko, who was diagnosed when he was alive, Bochud said. Arafat's symptoms when he died were not entirely consistent with polonium poisoning, he said. ""For example, the bone marrow stayed in good shape until (the) death of Arafat. In other cases of polonium poisoning, there is a decaying of the bone marrow,"" the medical expert said. ""Another point, he did not lose his hair as would be expected in the case of polonium (poisoning)."" Scientists performed more than 50 measurements on the belongings between February and June, he said. Palestinians who view Arafat as a symbol of resistance are also quite emotional about the suspicion he was poisoned. Arafat won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, along with Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for their work on the Oslo accords in 1993. The Oslo agreement was perceived at the time as a breakthrough that could lead to an independent Palestinian state and a permanent peace with Israel.

"Washington (CNN) -- Senior Navy enlistees seeking credentials to train others on using nuclear reactors that power carriers and subs are under investigation for cheating on an exam that may have involved classified information, top military officials said Tuesday. The troubling disclosure comes just weeks after the Air Force alleged widespread cheating on a proficiency test by officers with oversight responsibilities for nuclear missiles. Both involved written exams. ""To say that I'm disappointed would be an understatement,"" Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations, said at a news conference. Staff at the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program in Charleston, South Carolina, allegedly shared information about the test on reactor operations among themselves, officials said of their findings so far. There is no indication students were involved. The allegations came to light after a sailor in the unit came forward to share his concerns about potential dishonesty on exams. Navy responds to allegations . About 30 naval engineering watch supervisors have been decertified, meaning they cannot carry out certain duties, according to a Navy official. Those cited had previously been certified on nuclear systems, gone to sea, returned to shore duty and had to be certified as instructors to stand watch at training reactors. Navy officials said staff must qualify to operate and instruct students on a training reactor. The last incident of this kind occurred in 2010 aboard a sub, Navy officials said. Adm. John Richardson, director of the propulsion program, said the investigation is ongoing but did not disclose what information may have been exchanged. ""But it's fair to say that these exams and the operation of the plants do involve classified information and that will be an active part of the investigation to fully understand that,"" he said. Navy officials stressed that the nuclear propulsion systems are not related to nuclear weapons. The Air Force scandal has swept up 92 officers at Malmstrom Air Force Base. That case involves a proficiency test. Some of those involved are accused of cheating on the test via text messaging last summer while others are accused of not speaking up about it. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James described hearing about a culture for perfection within that unit that created a climate of undue stress and fear. But Richardson saw no parallels with the Air Force on that issue. Air Force cheating scandal . ""With respect to the morale and the necessity to pass these exams in order to advance, that's not really a dimension of our program,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Selling smartphone accessories is all about being in the right place at the right time. When outfitting a shiny new mobile device, the vast majority of people pick up a new case and other add-ons the same day they buy the phone, or within the first three months. For Apple accessory makers, this pairing presents a problem: Apple doesn't publicly share device measurements ahead of time, so manufacturers have to either wait until a product announcement to start making their products, potentially missing out on sales, or take the more common route of using unofficial leaks and information from factories. The new iPhone 5 goes on sale this Friday, just nine days after being announced by Apple. The device is taller and thinner, and sports a brand new port that won't fit older charging cords or devices such as speakers. iPhone 5 pre-order shipping dates pushed back, likely due to demand . For consumers upgrading to the new iPhone, this means spending money to replace the obsolete cases, cords and speakers. For accessories makers, it means an opportunity for more sales. Smartphone accessories are a lucrative business, and iPhone owners are predictably big on pampering their devices. The iPhone accounts for $6 billion of the $20.8 billion global smartphone-accessories market that's forecast for 2012. The average smartphone owner spends $56 on add-ons per device. ""There are over a billion handsets shipped every single year, and every single one of them drives accessory purchase,"" said Michael Morgan, senior analyst for mobile devices at ABI Research. The major players all know the key to getting their products into customers' hands is already being on the shelves when they buy a new phone. For example, 75% of iPhones sold will have a case purchased for them at some point. Of all smartphone cases sold across brands, 38% are purchased at the same time as the phone, and 36% are purchased in the first three months, according to ABI. A select number of companies are lucky enough to be on the inside, privy to details directly from Apple before a major product announcement. They are briefed on specifications -- likely after signing hundreds of pages of non-disclosure agreements -- so they can start production on new compatible accessories in advance. Apple even has a special program called ""MFi"" for designers and manufacturers making accessories that use licensed components. They sometimes get access to specs in advance and can label their products as Apple approved. For this release, Apple teamed up with speaker company Bose, among other third-party manufacturers. Other accessories makers have to either wait or turn to back-channels. Leaks have suggested that factories in Asia that specialize in making iPhone and iPad accessories have dependable specs and mock-ups of the final Apple products months in advance. Hands on with the new iPhone 5 . These factories will create CAD files (a digital technical drawing) or detailed plastic molds of unannounced products, complete with cut outs and details where the buttons and ports are located. Designers can use these tools to create new products. Companies use this information to varying degrees in order to be prepared for a product launch. While the reliability of the leaks has increased since the first iPhone came out in 2007, they are not guaranteed, and some companies remain nervous about taking a chance on unofficial information. ""That's not the way that we operate,"" said Dave Gatto, CEO of Incase, a San Francisco-based maker of Apple-related accessories. ""We'll get product when it hits the store, we'll be in line with everyone else."" Incase didn't start production on new cases until immediately after Apple's announcement, Gatto said. However, the company did use information, such as the leaked phone specs in the tech press, to prepare as much as possible in advance so that cases would be in stores quickly. The company designed new cases for the taller shape, and even produced and photographed physical prototypes the month before Apple's event. For the iPhone 5, an advance team was sent to the factories in China, standing by to start production, and the entire company hopped on a Skype call to follow Apple's announcement live September 12. By that afternoon, a press release was sent out announcing the company's new iPhone 5 cases. It hopes to have products ready in three to four weeks. ""Soft goods"" like cases are easier to turn around, and the companies have had a lot of practice over the years. But for hardware makers, the new port was a challenge. iHome makes popular iPhone and iPad accessories such as clock radios and speakers. The company wouldn't say if it had any official information ahead of the iPhone announcement (on its site it says its products are MFi-compliant), but did acknowledge that it has been busy. ""When we anticipate a major product change, even months before an announcement is made, we brainstorm various options and even begin to expedite basic engineering modifications,"" Ezra Ashkenazi, CEO of iHome, said in an e-mail. The company usually takes 7 to 9 months to ship new products, but says this advance work shaves two to three months off that cycle. iHome plans to start selling new products in early 2013. Factories don't wait to snag a customer to start producing products, either. They will pre-design and even start production on accessories before Apple goes public with a new device. Then, they'll try to shop those goods around to big box retailers like Best Buy, Target and Walmart, as well as to individual brands that will buy up inventory and then add their own logo. Apple's secrets aren't so secret anymore, and that's O.K. Over the years, rumors and leaks about unreleased Apple products have become more common. Apple devices are created by a porous network of third-party factories and employees that even the strongest of non-disclosure agreements can't always completely control. Snippets of information travel between factories or even units of the same company. Most factories aren't in a monogamous relationship with Apple or the approved third-party vendors with access to advance specs, and may also make products for other companies. While Foxconn factories have received the most attention (largely for labor issues), that's just one in a large network of suppliers Apple uses. In its 2011 list of Apple suppliers, Apple named 97 companies it contracts to create raw materials and manufacture and assemble products. Many of those companies only handle one small detail, like providing the nuts and bolts that are used in iPhones. Others produce more accessories specifically for Apple, like Cosmosupplylab Ltd. did on the iPad's Smart Cover.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad heads to Pakistan and India this week to put the finishing touches on a controversial deal to build a pipeline that would deliver Iranian gas to both countries, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency says. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad waves as he arrives Monday in Islamabad, Pakistan. Ahmadinejad arrived in Islamabad on Monday for a four-hour visit with newly elected Prime Minister Reza Gilani and President Pervez Musharraf, according to Pakistan's information ministry. Later in the day, he heads to Sri Lanka before traveling to New Delhi late Tuesday for a short visit, according to Iran's state-run news agency IRNA. The pipeline, if built, would be about 2,700 kilometers (1,674 miles) long. Pakistan and India, both key U.S. allies, are under pressure from the United States not to sign any kind of agreement with Iran. Some observers have called the project ""the peace pipeline"" because of its perceived impact on reducing tension between India and Pakistan, nuclear neighbors that have fought three wars, two of them over the disputed Kashmir region.  Watch Ahmadinejad arrive in India » . The gas pipeline project, which has been in discussions for over a year, is aimed at supplying Iranian natural gas to Pakistan and India. The pipeline would run from Iran to India, cutting through Pakistan. According to Fars, Ahmadinejad's visit comes after Pakistani and Indian energy ministers signed an agreement last week, once they had resolved a major ""bone of contention"" regarding the route of the gas pipeline. ""Now that all sides have calmed down, President Ahmadinejad will discuss the 'Peace Pipeline' at the highest levels during his visit to the Sub-Continent,"" Fars said. Under the agreement, the pipeline will run through 1,100 kilometers (682 miles) of Iran, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) of Pakistan and 600 kilometers (372 miles) of India, according to Fars. ""The pipeline will be capable of daily transporting 150 million cubic meters of gas to Pakistan and India -- 90 million cubic meters will go to India and the rest will go to Pakistan,"" Fars said. ""The pipeline project was initially estimated to cost $4.5 billion, but the cost has been revised to around $7 billion."" The United States recently tried to scuttle the pipeline by offering India advanced nuclear technology to make up for the loss of Iranian gas. But Fars reported that India recently declared its readiness to participate in the discussions on the pipeline after more than a year. China -- Iran's largest trade partner followed by India -- has previously said that it would negotiate in India's place if New Delhi withdraws from the project, according to Fars. China borders Pakistan to the north. A top adviser to the Iranian president spoke on the eve of Ahmadinejad's visit about the importance of oil and gas when it comes to putting Western powers ""in their place,"" according to Fars. ""Oil and gas are two elements of power at the disposal of the Muslims,"" Gen. Yahya Safavi said Sunday, according to Fars. ""If it (the power) be viewed properly (with wisdom) and within the framework of the interests of Islam and Muslims, one can then put the hegemonic powers back in their place."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- As the toll of international sanctions on Iran continues to mount, Iran's new President Hassan Rouhani has signaled his government's interest in addressing the world's concerns over his nation's nuclear program, and easing the pain on the Iranian economy. Rouhani's recent statements, tweets and appointments have underscored a possible willingness to resolve the nuclear problem. He told NBC News Wednesday that Iran will never develop nuclear weapons. At the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York next week, Rouhani is expected to affirm his interest in resolving the issue. In another positive step, President Barack Obama and Rouhani have exchanged lettersâ€”the first direct communication at this level between the two countries in many, many years. Explaining that this does not yet mean there is a breakthrough, President Obama indicated that he expects negotiations to be difficult and take time. ""Negotiations with the Iranians is always difficult,"" Obama said to George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. ""I think this new president is not going to suddenly make it easy."" Indeed, there is little reason to necessarily believe that everything has suddenly changed for the better. After years of intransigence, many wonder whether Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who holds overwhelming authority, is ready to make honest concessions. Furthermore, it's not yet clear whether Iran understands that a mere change in rhetoric won't mean automatic sanctions relief. In fact, only its concrete actions to resolve the nuclear questions will lead to a meaningful relief of sanctions. And when they come, those actions may initially be incremental, negotiated to test the willingness of both sides to take confidence-building actions that will lead to more comprehensive progress. The United States should not dismiss Iran's rhetoric and its apparent litmus testing as insignificant. Though a deal will be difficult, as many negotiations are, it's not impossible to reach an agreement if Iran is willing to take the steps necessary. That, of course, is still a big ""if."" It's no secret among diplomats and experts what a final deal will probably look like: Iran will retain a small level of enrichment capability under a very strict regimen of inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which will also have ready access. So far, such a deal has never been in reach; the United States and its diplomatic partners still have a long way to go. Because of this, some would rather continue to fight for complete Iranian capitulation and zero ability to conduct nuclear activities of any sort, a result that does not allow the Iranian regime a chance to ""save face."" This ""all-or-nothing"" outcome is simply not realistically attainable by means short of a major military intervention. As a result, the United States should be exhausting all diplomatic opportunities to reach an agreement that best preserves its security and the security of the region, while allowing the Iranians a chance to reach a settlement they can live with. Congress has an important role in this delicate moment. Though the United States should remain skeptical of Iranian intentions, it should not turn down an opportunity that may be presenting itself. One of its biggest bargaining chips is the congressional sanctions, the presence of which, at this point, could be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to support a diplomatic solution. Congress needs to be flexible in its approach and refrain at this time from tacking on additional sanctions or authorizing military force if it is serious about giving diplomacy the room it needs to operate and not missing a possible opening. Ultimately, it won't be easy to resolve a decade's worth of issues over Iran's drive for a nuclear capability. But there is also no better time to put the Iranians to the test and see if they are truly willing to play ball and match their actions to their rhetoric on the diplomatic scene. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Terri S. Lodge and Matthew Wallin.","Terri Lodge, Matthew Wallin: Iran president Rouhani shows signs of wanting to resolve nuke issue .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Senate race in Wyoming has it all: A popular incumbent Republican facing a primary challenge, a GOP feud, a generational divide, and Dick Cheney, one of the most polarizing figures in politics. Liz Cheney met with reporters in Casper on Wednesday, one day after announcing her bid for the seat. It came on the same day that three-term Republican Sen. Mike Enzi said he would run for re-election. ""I'm focused on earning every vote I can, the way it ought to be done in Wyoming, which is one person at a time,"" Cheney said. Enzi says Wyoming voters will stick with him . Cheney, a former State Department official and Fox News contributor, is the eldest daughter of the former vice president, who served for a decade as the congressman from Wyoming. Like her father, Cheney is a very vocal critic of President Barack Obama. ""President Obama has launched a war on our Second Amendment rights. He has launched a war on our religious freedom. He has used the IRS to launch a war on our freedom of speech. He has used the EPA to launch a war on Wyoming's ranchers, farmers and energy industry,"" said Cheney in a statement announcing her bid. CNN Chief National Correspondent John King, who covered the Cheneys over the years, says Liz Cheney has been a very loyal aide to her father. Liz Cheney announces Senate run . ""Clearly she has his blessing or she wouldn't do it,"" King said. ""If her dad had turned to her and said 'Don't do this,' she wouldn't have done this. In her putting her neck out, in her offending Mike Enzi and everyone else in the Wyoming Republican party, so has her dad."" Enzi is a proven conservative but has been willing to try to accomplish bipartisan solutions in the Senate. While not directly criticizing him in her announcement, Cheney said, ""I am running because I know as a mother and as a patriot, we can no longer afford simply to go along to get along."" And the 46-year-old Cheney appears to be making Enzi's age an issue, saying, ""I believe it is necessary for a new generation of leaders to step up to the plate."" Enzi is 69. One veteran analyst of Senate races isn't sure the age argument will be effective. ""She is running against an incumbent from her own party who has a solidly conservative voting record and is well-liked by voters. Her theme seems to be Enzi's age, but I don't know that it will play that well,"" said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the non-partisan Cook Political Report. But the primary will highlight the ongoing struggle for the future of the GOP. ""This race now will be the highest-profile test of what's happening in the Republican Party, the struggle over whether you fight and compromise or do you fight and keep fighting. This race will capture huge national attention,"" King added. Enzi says he's not surprised he's being challenged. ""She's been traveling around Wyoming for a long time, so I'm not surprised. I'm only surprised in that she said if I ran she wouldn't. She announced 30 minutes after I more specifically stated my intention,"" Enzi told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash on Wednesday. And he pushed back on his age, telling Bash, ""I'm absolutely not too old to be a senator. I'm about the median age for this body. I'm in really good health, I'm on the committees that I want to be on. I have seniority."" And Enzi doesn't think his ability to work with Democrats is a liability, saying ""I've developed trust on both sides of the aisle, people trust me that what I say I'm going to do, I do."" On Tuesday Enzi told reporters that he wouldn't change his plans to run for a fourth term, but admitted to reporters that fundraising has ""always been a problem for me."" But he told Bash that people in Wyoming ""complain about long campaigns. It doesn't take them long to make up their mind. And it doesn't cost a lot of money to have them make up their mind."" Enzi appears to have the backing of the two other members of Wyoming's congressional delegation. ""I think that Mike has done an excellent job representing the people of Wyoming and I'm going to continue to work to support Mike Enzi, Sen. John Barrasso told CNN on Wednesday. ""I have a great deal of respect for the entire Cheney family, for the vice president, for Liz and for Lynn, but I think it's the wrong race at the wrong time,"" he said. Republican Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming ripped Cheney's decision as ""bad form"" and predicted she would lose in the GOP primary next year. ""I don't know that anybody can out-conservative Mike Enzi,"" Lummis told CNN Senior Congressional Producer Deirdre Walsh and other reporters outside the House chamber on Tuesday. The congresswoman, Wyoming's at-large representative, admitted Cheney had the upper hand in raising money, but said that wouldn't matter. ""She will outraise him by factors of 10 or more, and he will still win because Wyoming is grassroots, retail campaigning,"" she said. The National Republican Senatorial Committee was quick to say it stands firmly behind Enzi, the GOP incumbent. ""Our mission is to re-elect our incumbents and build a Republican majority,"" NRSC Communications Director Brad Dayspring told CNN. Cheney, who chairs a nonprofit on national security and education called Keep America Safe, had been rumored this year to be considering a Senate run. Early last week, former Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming told the New York Times that a potential Cheney primary challenge would bring about ""the destruction of the Republican Party of Wyoming,"" adding that, ""It's a disaster -- a divisive, ugly situation -- and all it does is open the door for the Democrats for 20 years."" Simpson had a different message after Cheney's announcement on Tuesday. ""I deeply care about them both,"" he said, according to the Casper Star Tribune. Cheney will come under attack for being a carpetbagger. She was born in Wisconsin and grew up in Virginia's D.C. suburbs before attending college in Colorado and law school in Illinois. She spent most of her career working in the nation's capital before moving to Wyoming last year. Cheney touted her family's longtime Wyoming roots in a speech in May and in her announcement Tuesday. He highlighted that her family ""first came here in 1852, in search of religious freedom,"" adding that her grandmother ""was raised in the Salt Creek oil field and grew up to become Natrona County's first female deputy sheriff."" Will the carpetbagger tag stick? There have already been comparisons to Hillary Clinton. In 2000 the first lady, who grew up in Illinois and lived for many years in Arkansas, successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in New York, but faced the carpetbagger attacks. ""What did Hillary Clinton have? She had national name identification. She had a giant fundraising network, she had a bunch of people willing to work for her and willing to fight and she ran a very effective campaign and she won,"" King recalled. As for Cheney, he said, ""She will have money. She has the name identification. Now the test is, since she's new to politics, can she run a campaign. Can she convince the people of Wyoming that she's right.""

"(CNN) -- Five police officers brutally kicked and beat an unconscious suspect after a high-speed chase through Birmingham, Alabama, in an incident caught on camera and discovered a year later. Video shows one black and four white officers beating and kicking unconscious man ejected from car. The five officers have been fired, Mayor Larry Langford said at a news conference Wednesday. An internal inquiry is continuing. The dashboard-cam footage, which officials believe was shot in January 2008, was aired for reporters Wednesday. It showed the end of a 100-mile-an-hour police chase of a van driven by Anthony Warren, suspected of illegal drug activity. Police had chased the van almost 50 miles, winding from downtown Birmingham to suburban Hoover. The video captured the van knocking down a police officer standing on a roadway, then turning up an interstate highway ramp, where it flipped over and rolled into a ditch. Warren was ejected from the van and stopped moving. The five officers -- one black, four white -- ruthlessly beat the suspect, who is black, the video shows.  Watch the tape that lead to the officers' dismissal » . A police mug shot taken five days after the beating was posted on the Web site of The Birmingham News. It shows a badly bruised man wearing a neck brace. Police Chief A.C. Roper told CNN that the video was brought to his attention in March by the district attorney's office, which stumbled upon the footage as it was preparing for Warren's trial. Warren was charged with attempted murder, but no trial took place because he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault. He is in prison serving a 20-year sentence. Roper said he was ""shocked"" to learn of the video and that it had been around for so long without his knowledge. In addition to a continuing internal investigation that could lead to disciplining supervisors, he said the Alabama Bureau of Investigation is considering criminal charges against the five officers. Langford said the incident brought back to mind days of segregation and police brutality toward blacks. ""The culture of the past was that police brutality was acceptable,"" Langford said. ""In Birmingham, Alabama, in the present day, it is not acceptable."" Langford said the five officers showed exceptional restraint in chasing the fleeing suspect and performed in exemplary fashion until the last scene caught on the video. The camera captured 11 seconds of the five officers beating Warren with their fists and batons. ""Those 11 seconds will not be tolerated,"" said Langford, who signed letters of termination for the five officers on Tuesday. ""Over 50 years of combined police experience gone over 11 seconds,"" he said.","Footage believed to have been shot in January 2008 after 50-mile chase .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps Bruno Mars really did win the Super Bowl. According to Billboard, the Grammy-winning singer is set to return to the charts after his halftime performance on Sunday. It reports that sales of his latest album, ""Unorthodox Jukebox,"" rose by 164% after Mars took to the Super Bowl stage with the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. The album was released in December 2012. Such an increase in sales is not rare or unexpected. Last year's halftime performer, Beyonce, reportedly saw a bump in sales of her ""4"" album by 123%. And Mars is not an unknown quantity, though some of Sunday's viewers may have just discovered him. In 2010, he won a Grammy for best male pop vocal performance for his song ""Just the Way You Are.""

The album may re-enter the top 10 when sales figures are released by Soundscan on Wednesday. This year's Super Bowl drew a record-breaking 111.5 million viewers. As is customary, Mars did not receive an appearance fee for his Super Bowl performance. Artists do it for the exposure, and that has clearly paid off for Mars. Zack O'Malley Greenburg from Forbes writes that the singer may see the most return in increased ticket prices and sales for his Moonshine Jungle tour. ""In 2013, the singer grossed $72.4 million on 84 shows; his average ticket price sits at about $66,"" O'Malley Greenburg writes.

"(CNN) -- Tech visionary Steve Jobs understood better than anyone the impulse to believe that technology can solve our most complex societal problems. ""Unfortunately it just ain't so,"" he said. ""We need to attack these things at the root, which is people and how much freedom we give people. ... I wish it was as simple as giving it over to the computer."" That's certainly true when it comes to education, particularly in impoverished communities. As a founder of two organizations that recruit top college graduates to expand educational opportunity, I've spent a lot of time examining what's at work in successful classrooms and schools over the past two decades. In every classroom where students are excelling against the odds, there's a teacher who's empowered her students to work hard to realize their potential. Whenever I ask the leaders of successful schools their secret, the answer is almost always the same: people, people, people. They are obsessed with recruiting and developing the best teams. Research confirms that great teachers change lives. Students with one highly effective elementary school teacher are more likely to go to college, less likely to become pregnant as teens and earn tens of thousands more over their lifetimes. Faced with the choice between giving every child in a school his or her own laptop or putting 30 of them in a classroom with one exceptional teacher, there's no question which is the better investment. So it's disappointing to see more and more people herald technology as an educational panacea while dismissing the indispensable role of people. In a recent article on this site, Richard Galant asked whether we'd be better off ditching teachers, giving kids computers and leaving them to their own devices to teach themselves and each other. The idea is based on the work of Sugata Mitra, an education professor who set up an experiment in India where he gave children in the slums access to a ""computer in the wall"" and found that without guidance, they were soon using it to learn on their own. Galant's piece could leave the impression that teachers are obsolete and that their main function is to enforce discipline and administer tests. (Instead of spending money on teachers, Mitra recruits cheerleading ""grannies,"" older women from the UK who offer the kids words of praise and encouragement via Skype.) The idea that computers can ever replace teachers and schools reveals a deep lack of understanding about the role leadership plays in student success. When Anam Palla started teaching ninth and 10th grades at an all-girls school in Pakistan, her students were performing four years behind grade level and many considered themselves nalaiq (incapable). She set a mission that each of her girls would gain the skills and self-confidence to become contributing members of society. ""My first task was to build a sense of responsibility in the girls towards their own learning and success, which would be achieved by collaborating with other members of the class and the community at large,"" she says. Today, here students are not only thriving academically, they are empowered and independent young women. Now, I'm no Luddite. Technology has enormous potential to address educational needs more efficiently, help teachers improve their performance and enrich and individualize student learning. Indeed, in places such as India that face massive underserved populations and a shortage of qualified teachers, it's hard to imagine making a dent without leveraging technology in a big way. But we must be wary of concluding that we should focus our energy on technology rather than people. Computers cannot create a culture of excellence and push students to meet high expectations. Computers cannot visit students' homes to get to know their families and engage them in their progress. Computers cannot raise money and organize college visits to show students who have never left their communities what they're working toward. Technology is a tool, not a silver bullet. And like all tools, it can be helpful or harmful depending on how we use them. Rocketship Education, a high-performing charter network that serves low-income students in California, uses technology to enhance -- not replace -- the work that teachers are doing. Students spend up to two hours a day in a computer learning lab mastering basic math and reading skills through exercises and puzzles, freeing up teachers to spend their time on advanced skills and concepts. The schools invest the money they save through computer learning back into teacher salaries and coaching. At Rocketship, technology strengthens the personal ties between students, parents and teachers that are the key to its success. Children growing up in poverty need all the support and nurturing from adults that they can get. If we want a real revolution in education, we should make an all-out effort to attract and keep our best people in our schools. Technology can be a powerful force in that effort when guided by leaders who understand what students and teachers need to do their best. We can't outsource the human connections at the heart of the learning experience. Transforming the lives and learning of our children will take more than machines. It will take the best of our human resources.

"(CNN) -- An Alabama man who says he was fired for exposing public corruption received broad support from the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday in a free-speech dispute testing workplace protections for government employees. In hour-long oral arguments, the justices dug into a case of whether such First Amendment rights extend to state workers who testify truthfully at trial, but are later punished by their employer. ""Government employees are often in the best position to know what ails the agencies for which they work,"" said Justice Elena Kagan. ""In other words, expecting that people will know things because they work in a place and that they can take what they know as a result of working"" in the public sphere, and say so when subpoenaed."" A ruling in favor of the man at the center of the legal fight, Edward Lane, could make it easier for prosecutors to pursue official public corruption allegations where the cooperation of government workers is often a key factor. In 2006, Lane was directing a state-funded training program to help at-risk youth, coordinated through Central Alabama Community College. An audit he performed found someone on the payroll was not showing up for work and had done virtually nothing for the program. But this was no ordinary employee: Sue Schmitz was also an Alabama state legislator. Lane says he tried to work with Schmitz to perform her job duties. But he alleged she threatened him, and said he was cautioned by colleagues not to confront someone with her political influence. Nevertheless, Lane fired her. The FBI stepped in and began a separate criminal investigation, looking at how Schmitz, 69, was able to secure the community relations job with the program. She was paid $177,251 from February 2003 to October 2006. Federal prosecutors charged the retired teacher with fraud. She was convicted, received a 30-month prison term, and was forced to resign from office. Lane was later terminated from his government job, prompting him to sue the college president. At arguments, Lane's lawyer, Tejinder Singh, told the justices that his client ""testified about events"" that he learned about at work. ""The testimony itself was not a part of his job responsibilities."" It amounted to someone speaking as ""a citizen on a matter of public concern."" But several justices questioned whether the law was clear at the time of the firing to hold the college president liable for damages. And some justices wondered whether a public official should enjoy broad job security when testifying in court. ""So what happens in a situation where a police officer gets on the stand and in testifying honestly admits to corruption, but does it in a slovenly way, comes to court dressed in a clown suit?"" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor. ""Could the employer fire him then?"" Yet it was the attorneys for the college presidents who received the toughest questioning. They said government workers do not deserve the ""full free speech rights"" enjoyed by others. ""That seems counterintuitive to me. Why do we put people at risk for telling the truth?"" asked Sotomayor again. ""To tell the truth about something? And I'm assuming if they lied, they could be fired."" Chief Justice John Roberts said Lane had no choice but to testify as ordered. ""What's he supposed to do? He says, 'gosh, if I answer, I'm going to lose my job, or could and if I don't, or answer falsely'"" he could in turn be prosecuted by the government, said Roberts. ""But you are suggesting he can be fired if he does it."" The Supreme Court has previously said such workers cannot sue over an adverse job action such as a firing or disciplinary action, when speaking on facts learned ""pursuant to their official duties."" They can only make such claims when they speak as a private citizen. But oral arguments revealed the court was likely to carve exceptions for employees compelled to testify under oath about matters of public concern. The case is Lane v. Franks (13-483). A ruling is expected by early summer.","Case involves man working at Alabama college who says he was fired for exposing corruption .

"(CNN) -- Cleanup efforts unfolded Monday in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, after torrential monsoon rain over the weekend killed dozens, cut power to 15 million and broke a 32-year record. Pakistanis push a stranded auto-rickshaw along a flooded street  in Karachi on Sunday. Officials combed the city looking for bodies. The health department confirmed 32 deaths and said it received reports of more.

For Pastis, who usually works several months in advance, the strips came together remarkably quickly. He and Watterson first got in touch April 11, the day Pastis had a strip that falsely portrayed him as the author of ""Calvin and Hobbes"" in order to get a woman in bed. Some time earlier, he had been told by a mutual friend, Washington Post cartoonist Nick Galifianakis, that Watterson had been wanting to get in touch. Watterson is a longtime ""Pearls"" fan, the ""Calvin and Hobbes"" cartoonist told The Washington Post. ""Several years ago, when Stephan did one of his strips that mocked his own drawing ability and mentioned my strip in comparison, I thought it might be funny for me to ghost 'Pearls' sometime, just to flip it all on its head,"" Watterson said. Watterson and Pastis finally exchanged e-mails and Watterson suggested doing something together. ""I got that e-mail on a Friday. I think I literally stood up at the couch,"" Pastis recalls. It may seem like an unlikely pairing. Pastis regularly features himself as a character in his strip and enjoys touring the country, promoting it and his ""Timmy Failure"" series of children's books. Watterson is known as reclusive and private; there's just one known picture of him in existence. Pastis would be the first to tell you that he's not the world's greatest artist, and his characters -- Rat, Pig, Goat and Zebra -- are drawn with blunt simplicity. Watterson is one of the finest draftsmen to ever pick up a pencil. And Watterson, Pastis learned, isn't the most tech-savvy artist. The ""Pearls"" cartoonist thought they could exchange work online, but Watterson wanted to use actual hand-delivered mail. ""I talked him out of that because I was so scared,"" says Pastis, noting that any Watterson drawings would be worth thousands. But electronic collaboration had its own challenges. ""He could not set the scanner to get rid of the pencil lines. He had trouble even putting (his work) on the scanner straight. He had trouble with e-mail attachments,"" he says. But Pastis reveled in the trade-offs. ""That part of it was funny. With anyone else it would be frustrating. With Bill, I cherished every e-mail."" Then came the matter of maintaining the secret. It wasn't easy, especially since Pastis was a finalist for the Reuben Award -- cartooning's highest honor -- this year. The group met in May for its annual honors, and it was all Pastis could do not to scream the news from the heavens. ""I'm in a room with 200 cartoonists. You know how hard it is not to say, 'Hey, Bill Watterson is drawing my strip'?"" he says. When Watterson's contributions started appearing on Wednesday, eagle-eyed readers may have recognized the style and lettering -- particularly in Thursday's strip, which was full of Martians and robots, ""Calvin"" favorites. But Pastis suspects many fans were thrown off by Friday's strip, which included two voluptuous women who looked like ""Archie's"" Betty and Veronica. The reaction to the news has been tremendous, says Pastis. His blog and the ""Pearls"" comics page each did 10 times their normal traffic. It was enough to blow out a server at Universal Uclick, his syndicator. Now that the Rat is out of the bag, the strips will be auctioned off. Indeed, a primary reason for Watterson's involvement was his activity with Team Cul de Sac, a charity co-founded by cartoonist Richard Thompson, who suffers from Parkinson's. And Watterson may not be as reclusive as his image suggests. Besides his work with ""Pearls"" and Team Cul de Sac, he's also given an interview to Mental Floss magazine. He may not be returning to daily fare, but it's not like he's turned into a hermit. In fact, after their long-distance collaboration -- which was done entirely through e-mail, without so much as even one phone call -- Pastis finally got to meet his hero last week in Washington when they went to visit Thompson. The pair spent hours talking about Charles Schulz -- a mutual influence -- the challenges of the comic strip business, and simply the wonders of humor. Watterson is ""quick to laugh,"" says Pastis. ""When you make him laugh, he really laughs."" And Pastis couldn't be happier. ""I'm still on Cloud 9,"" he says. ""I will never top this.""","""Calvin and Hobbes"" cartoonist Bill Watterson emerges in ""Pearls Before Swine""

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis has called for mutual respect between religions in a message addressed to Muslims as they prepare to celebrate Eid al-Fitr next week, at the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It is traditional for the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue to send a message of good wishes and a proposed theme for common reflection at this time. Opinion: How the 'Francis effect' could rescue the church . But Francis, who was elected to the papacy in March, said that he wanted to add the personal touch. ""This year, the first of my Pontificate, I have decided to sign this traditional message myself and to send it to you, dear friends, as an expression of esteem and friendship for all Muslims, especially those who are religious leaders,"" he writes. ""This year, the theme on which I would like to reflect with you and with all who will read this message is one that concerns both Muslims and Christians: Promoting Mutual Respect through Education."" Francis said his message should apply to everyone, with all people respecting the life, dignity and rights of each person. ""Regarding the education of Muslim and Christian youth, we have to bring up our young people to think and speak respectfully of other religions and their followers, and to avoid ridiculing or denigrating their convictions and practices,"" he said. What is Ramadan? Francis returned this week from a trip to Brazil for World Youth Day, during which he met many young Roman Catholics. In his message, the pope refers to a speech he gave to the Vatican diplomatic corps in March, in which he stressed the need for dialogue with Islam. With those words, he sought to ""emphasize once more the great importance of dialogue and cooperation among believers, in particular Christians and Muslims, and the need for it to be enhanced,"" he said. The message was sent out in multiple languages, including Arabic. Francis' predecessor, former pontiff Benedict XVI, angered many in the Muslim world when he gave a speech in 2006 in which he quoted a 14th-century Byzantine emperor who characterized some of the teachings of Islam's Prophet Mohammed as ""evil and inhuman"" and ""spread by the sword.""

"(CNN) -- Seeking to blunt a sharp backlash to recent privacy policy changes, Google has offered to share ""the real story"" about a system that compiles information about users based on their activity on all of Google's sites and products. This week, Google announced new privacy settings. They spell out the fact that the company collects and compiles data about its users based on their activity on its various sites -- from its search page to Gmail to YouTube to phones running its Android operating system. The announcement gave some privacy advocates cause for alarm, even though Google says the information is assembled to enhance user experience, such as better targeting ads that will be of interest to its customers. Perhaps most notably, eight members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, wrote a letter to Google CEO Larry Page asking for clarification about the changes. ""While Google suggests that the purpose of this shift in policy is to make the consumer experience simpler, we want to make sure it does not make protecting consumer privacy more complicated,"" reads the letter. The lawmakers also noted that because of Google's global reach, the change ""potentially touches billions of people worldwide."" It asks Google to share what kind of data it currently collects and explain how information collected under the newly announced system will be used. In a post on the company's public policy blog, Google's Betsy Masiello wrote that there have been misconceptions about the changes. ""A lot has been said about our new privacy policy,"" she wrote. ""Some have praised us for making our privacy policy easier to understand. Others have asked questions, including members of Congress, and that's understandable too."" Among the points that Masiello makes in the post: . _ Users don't have to be logged in to use many of Google's products, including search and YouTube. No data is collected when a user is not logged in. _ When logged in, users can edit or turn off their search histories, switch Gmail chat to ""off the record,"" use ""incognito mode"" on the Google Chrome browser or employ other of Google's privacy tools. _ Quite simply, Web users don't have to use all of Google's products. She noted that Google won't be collecting any more data about users than it was before. ""We're making things simpler and we're trying to be upfront about it. Period,"" she wrote. Not everyone was convinced. While noting that there are some advantages to having your information stored in one place, Brent Rose wrote for tech site Gizmodo that there are some scary aspects to it as well. ""There are certainly reasons to be concerned about keeping all of your eggs in one basket. It means there's a single point of failure, which makes me nervous,"" Rose wrote. ""The fact that you can't opt-out of shared search data, and that Google will know more about you than your wife? That's a little creepy.""","Google seeks to clarify its new privacy plan after backlash .

"(CNN) -- The mysterious burst of light in the sky and loud booms witnessed Sunday night by residents along the Mid-Atlantic coastline was likely caused by a Russian rocket booster re-entering the atmosphere, said an official at the U.S. Naval Observatory. A mysterious flash in the sky Sunday night may have been debris from the Soyuz spacecraft's booster. The exact cause of the flash that caused hundreds of people  to call the media, local authorities and the National Weather Service was still unknown Monday afternoon. But eyewitness accounts of the color, shape and timing of the light and sound had officials at the Naval Observatory confident of the phenomenon's cause: the re-entry of orbiting space junk from the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that blasted off last week from Kazakhstan. ""An object like this will have a pretty spectacular display when it enters the atmosphere,"" said U.S. Naval Observatory spokesman Geoff Chester. Monday morning after the incident, Chester said he traced the rocket booster's path and found it was hovering over Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, around the time people reported seeing the light. iReport.com: Did you see the mysterious flash? Sunday's mysterious flash and booms also could have been a fireball, a natural phenomenon that occurs when a rock about the size of a suitcase slams into the earth. Naval Observatory officials say that scenario is unlikely in this case, since the space junk was already orbiting in the area. Chester said the yellow, orange and iridescent green flashes reported by witnesses resemble both fireballs and burning space junk. ""The visual reports are consistent with either case,"" he said. ""But the fact that a Russian rocket booster was passing through that area of the sky at the same time, it's a pretty strong factor in my opinion to make that the culprit."" The timing of the light and sounds also indicates it was likely space debris. Chester said it usually takes up to a week for a rocket booster's orbit to decay. The Russian spaceship was launched last Thursday. The booming sounds were likely noises from the explosion, he said. There are no reports of damage, weather officials say. Fragments of the object likely landed in the Atlantic Ocean. The likelihood of space debris hitting one's home is pretty remote, Chester said, so residents don't have to worry. The light and sounds, which shook houses, occurred between 9:30 and 9:45 p.m. and could be seen and heard from southern Maryland to North Carolina, said Jeff Lewitsky, a forecaster for the National Weather Service Forecast office in Wakefield, Virginia. After receiving dozens of inquiries on Sunday night from concerned citizens, Lewitsky and his team analyzed the radar and satellite loops and determined the phenomenon wasn't caused by weather. Lewitsky said his office has not had residents report such a sighting in the past 20 years. Officials have ruled out another possibility: The light was not likely a solar wind or flare, which is a burst of energy that travels from the sun, said a spokeswoman for the Space Weather Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.","Naval Observatory traced path of Russian rocket booster at time of witness reports .

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho was precisely as we had remembered him. Provocative, outspoken, manipulative, supremely confident, and utterly compelling. The only thing lacking in the Portuguese's first campaign back in charge at Chelsea was the usual glut of trophies. But if you listened to the former Real Madrid and Inter coach opine on the English Premier League title race last season, his side was never in the running. Despite managing a club owned by Roman Abramovich, who is worth a reputed $10 billion, Mourinho decried his team as the ""little horse"" in the scurry for the finish line. This season, ominously, his tone is different. The acquisition of two big names from Spain -- Cesc Fabregas of Barcelona and Diego Coasta from La Liga champion Atletico Madrid -- has taken his squad onto a different plane, while the return of stalwart Didier Drogba adds an unashamedly sentimental sheen. ""We have the squad that we want to have,"" Mourinho told reporters on the eve of the new season. ""It is a squad for tomorrow, for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people."" Chelsea may have finished third last season, but Mourinho's tactical prowess was still in evidence. Not only did he propel the Londoners to home and away wins over eventual champion Manchester City, he did the same to Liverpool -- a morale-crushing 2-0 victory at Anfield in late April was the beginning of the end for the Reds' title aspirations. It was against the lesser lights Chelsea faltered, but with his squad now bolstered by yet more quality, Mourinho's charges won't be as generous this time around. Verdict: Surely, a third Premier League title under Mourinho awaits. MANCHESTER CITY . Champion twice in the past three seasons, City might have to play second fiddle to Mourinho and Chelsea in 2014-15. Last season's triumph was a mass of contradictions -- for large parts of the campaign big-spending City was considered favorite but became ultimately reliant on Liverpool's last-gasp stumble to claim top honors. Manuel Pellegrini's charges spent just 15 days at the top over the whole campaign; the irony of this season may well see it spend more time at the summit without finishing as top dog. The club's Chilean coach is a year older and wiser as to the travails of English football however, and it has lavished more cash on fleshing out a squad that already has more depth than an Olympic swimming pool. City has raided Portugal to prise Fernando and Eliaquim Mangala from Porto, while goalkeeper Willy Caballero and Bruno Zuculini have arrived from Spain. That quartet's lack of English experience has been offset to a degree by the arrival of two seasoned Premier League campaigners plucked from City's rivals. Frank Lampard, a three-time title winner, has joined on loan from City's subsidiary club New York City FC after being released by Chelsea, while France defender Bacary Sagna has signed from Arsenal. As ever, City's success will hinge on its twin titans: midfielder Yaya Toure, who has resolved to stay at the club despite threatening to leave after he received a modest birthday present; and prolific Argentina striker Sergio Aguero, who has signed a new five-year contract. Verdict: Close but no cigar as City settles for second best. MANCHESTER UNITED . This is where the waters become muddied. Can Louis van Gaal transform Manchester United into a serious title contender by sheer force of personality alone? The great Alex Ferguson was able to, propelling his team to title success in his final season despite notable deficiencies in his squad. But those holes remain -- not filled by David Moyes in his disastrous sole season in charge -- even if June's purchase of Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao in Spain will add some much-needed creativity in the middle of the park. Promising English left-back Luke Shaw has also been added for what many believe to be a vastly inflated sum, but the 19-year-old will miss the opening month through injury. For all its limitations, this is still a team that boasts a strike force as lethal as they come. Wayne Rooney, newly installed as Van Gaal's captain, needs 15 goals to move third on the Premier League's all-time scorers list. And Robin van Persie's four goals at the World Cup were crucial as Van Gaal led Netherlands to third place in Brazil. There are no European Champions League distractions for United after last season's malaise, finishing a lowly seventh, so the squad should stay fresh and hungry. Whatever happens, it won't be dull with Van Gaal around. Verdict: An up-and-down season to end in third place. ARSENAL . The Gunners have become masters of deception in recent years. Promising Premier League campaigns have frittered away and shots at silverware squandered. That is precisely what happened in the top flight last season. Arsenal spent 128 days atop the division in 2013-14 but suffered maulings at the hands of Chelsea and Liverpool as a familiar post-Christmas slump took hold. A spike as spring emerged helped usher in Champions League qualification for the 17th straight year but then came a watershed moment in May -- an FA Cup triumph. Victory over Hull City in England's premier knockout competition slaked a nine-year thirst for a trophy and eased the pressure on Arsene Wenger that had been steadily mounting throughout that time. A change of direction that began with the marquee signing of Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid this time last year has continued, with Â£66 million ($110m) spent ahead of the new campaign. The purchase of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona after his fine World Cup with Chile has convinced many fans the Gunners can stay in title contention as 2014-15 reaches its business end. In taking right-back Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle United, Wenger has replaced departing Frenchman Bacary Sagna with an equally competent compatriot. Colombia World Cup star David Ospina represents competition for Wojciech Szczesny in the race for the goalkeeper's jersey and teenage defender Calum Chambers -- who cost a reported $25 million from Southampton -- indulges Wenger's ""one for the future"" passion. Another couple of signings before the window shuts on September 1 could catapult the London side into the title reckoning, but a top-four finish should still be comfortable even without. Verdict: A fast start before a predictable fade to fourth place for the third successive season. LIVERPOOL . How do you replace Luis Suarez? The simple answer is you can't. The Uruguayan's move to Barcelona may have engendered an $128.5 million windfall, but he takes with him wistful memories of a luxuriant season that reaped 31 goals and 12 assists. Manager Brendan Rodgers has chosen to disseminate that cash liberally, rather than try to plug the gap with one marquee signing. That has one obvious advantage and one undeniable negative. Eight new arrivals means Liverpool's options are now rich and plentiful but, as Tottenham found out so painfully when trying to replace Gareth Bale last season, it is rare they all hit the ground running. Add to that a phalanx of extra games now that the Reds are in the European Champions League after an absence of four seasons, and repeating last year's push for the title seems unrealistic. The likes of Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren, both plucked from Southampton, have Premier League and World Cup experience while the likes of midfielder Emre Can and striker Divock Origi have huge potential -- though the latter, who scored Belgium's winner against Algeria at Brazil 2014, has been loaned back to French club Lille. Rodgers' renowned man-management skills will be tested as he and aging captain Steven Gerrard attempt to bed the new arrivals into the Liverpool way. Unless assimilation takes less time than expected, this season is destined to become one of transition for the Reds. Verdict: A fifth-place finish after a long winter of adjustment..

"(CNN) -- Mauricio Pochettino is the latest incumbent of Tottenham Hotspur's managerial hot seat. The London club have appointed the Argentinean after raiding fellow English Premier League outfit Southampton for his services. Pochettino guided Saints to their highest ever EPL finish last season and was credited with bringing through a talented clutch of youngsters at the club. The 42-year-old now has the task of guiding Spurs into the lucrative European Champions League, knowing failure could cost him his job. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy sacked two managers in less than six months -- first Andre Villas-Boas then Tim Sherwood -- for failing to deliver a top-four place. In an statement on the club's official website, Pochettino said: ""This is a club with tremendous history and prestige and I am honored to have been given this opportunity to be its Head Coach. ""There is an abundance of top-class talent at the club and I am looking forward to starting work with the squad. ""Tottenham Hotspur has a huge following across the world and I have great admiration for the passion the fans show for this team. ""We are determined to give the supporters the kind of attacking football and success that we are all looking to achieve."" Pochettino took over at Southampton in January 2013 with the club struggling at the foot of the Premier League and guided them to safety. This season he took them to their highest ever league placing -- eighth -- and helped develop a core of home grown talent including Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw, who are both expected to go to the World Cup with England. But expectations are much higher at Spurs, with a succession of managers being fired for not securing the top four berth that offers entry to Europe's money spinning Champions League. Harry Redknapp is the only manager in recent times to qualify for the competition, leading Spurs to the quarterfinals in 2010/11 before he was sacked in 2012. Andre Villas-Boas, the former Chelsea manager, finished fifth in his first season before being relieved of his duties in December last year with the club languishing in seventh. Tim Sherwood -- a former player at the club -- took over as caretaker but was sacked at the end of the season after Spurs finished sixth. Levy said in the club's statement: ""In Mauricio I believe we have a Head Coach who, with his high energy, attacking football, will embrace the style of play we associate with our club. ""He has a proven ability to develop each player as an individual, whilst building great team spirit and a winning mentality. We have a talented squad that Mauricio is excited to be coaching next season."" Coaches Jesús Pérez, Miguel D'Agostino and Toni Jiménez have also followed Pochettino to White Hart Lane, with Southampton's search for a new manager now under way. In a statement on the club's official website announcing Pochettino's resignation, chairman Ralph Krueger said: ""We will be looking for a manager that shares our values, our principles and our philosophy. ""A manager who can continue to grow the First Team and build on our strong foundation -- a foundation led by an ambitious vision and plan that continues to build on our world-class academy, our amazing 129-year heritage and our excellent staff, and rewards our loyal and passionate fan base.""

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- There are no immediate links between the 19 people arrested on suspicion of planning terror attacks on Malaysia's administrative capital, Putrajaya, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), police said Wednesday. ""These individuals, however, share a similar ideology with ISIS and other terrorist groups such as Boko Haram and Jemaah Islamiah. They come from a Salafi-Jihadist movement,"" the Asian country's counter terrorism deputy chief, Ayob Khan Pitchay Mydin, told CNN. Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiah (JI) was behind the 2002 Bali bombings, which left 202 people dead and other bombings in South East Asia, while Boko Haram is the Islamist militant group waging a campaign of terror in Nigeria. However, Malaysian police believe the individuals concerned were making their way to join ISIS in its war in Syria after investigating their travel plans. ""We know they planned to join ISIS through their travel itineraries,"" said Ayob Khan. The 19 suspects -- 17 men and two women, who were arrested in operations between April and July -- had planned flights to Istanbul, Turkey before going to Syria over land via Turkey's Hatay province, the counter terrorism specialist said. Seven people have already being charged in court for various terror-related activities. Bars targeted . During their investigations, police say they uncovered plans by the group to bomb bars and other alcohol-related establishments, including a brewery, around the city. ""They were also using Facebook to raise money for their activities under the guise of humanitarian efforts in the Middle East,"" said Ayob Khan. He declined to reveal how much money had already been raised, or to identify the group's name, as they are still investigating its links with other groups. In June, 26-year-old Ahmad Tarmimi Maliki became the first Malaysian suicide bomber linked to ISIS. The factory worker, who was behind an attack that killed more than 20 elite Iraqi soldiers at their base in al-Anbar in May, was identified after reports surfaced on an ISIS-linked website. His photograph was also featured.","Police: 19 people arrested on terrorism charges in Malaysia not linked to ISIS .

"(CNN) -- The King of Spain relinquished his crown yesterday. So did the country's football dynasty. Goals were scored aplenty, and one mighty underdog lifted its nation's spirits even in loss. Here's what we'll be talking about and looking forward to today at the World Cup: . 1. ENGLAND vs. URUGUAY . Third time's the charm: Second guessing is second nature for fans, but England's taken it to a whole another level. We swear they're overly obsessed over Wayne Rooney. (Somewhere David Beckham is going, ""Wayne, I know. Boy, do I know."") We're talking about a guy who's scored 39 goals for his country, but not a single one at a World Cup. And this is his third one. Uruguay should fare better than it did in its 1-3 loss to Costa Rica. Its star forward, Luis Suarez, recovering from knee surgery, is ready to play. It's not just that he can score -- and do so spectacularly -- it's the confidence that his presence will infuse in the team. 2. OTHER SHOWDOWNS . Lord of the dance: It sure would be nice to see Colombia score against the Ivory Coast -- just to enjoy another one of its goal celebrations. Imagine how the players would dance if they won this match and virtually assured their passage into the next round? Clean sweep: In the last match of the day, Greece plays Japan. Don't yawn. Greece, while far from dazzling, played much better in its opener than the final score reflected (A 3-0 loss to Colombia). Japan, too, was pretty good against the Ivory Coast until the Elephants nabbed two late goals. Fans of the Samurai Blue clean up after themselves in the stands. Here's hoping the team does so too on the field. 3. SPAIN'S OUSTER . Spanish inquisition: There's going to be an anguished inquest in Spain today. Its players came into the tournament singing ""We Are the Champions."" They leave red-faced, losing not just to the Netherlands 1-5 last week, but also to Chile 0-2. They lost to Chile -- a team that's never beaten them, EVER! Here's how hard the rain fell on Spain. In 2010, it conceded only two goals the entire tournament. In just two games this year, it swallowed seven! Chile, on the other hand, was still singing up a storm in Rio early this morning. Its team was a joy to watch: cohesive, clever, confident. 4. THE AUSSIE UNDERDOGS . Call and response: It was the soccer equivalent of that musical form. One team scored; the other equalized mere minutes later. And although Australia was the huge underdog to the Dutch behemoth yesterday, this was no Oranje rout. The Netherlands move on to the round of 16 after beating the Socceroos 3-2. But what we'll remember is the Aussies' never-say-die fight -- and Tim Cahill's thunderstruck volley. Sublime! 5. STADIUM SECURITY . Tear down this wall: At first, it seemed kind of humorous: ticketless fans marauding through a tunnel underneath the stadium looking for their dream destination -- seats at the World Cup. Then it turned into something like the running of the bulls. The fans knocked down temporary walls as they herded down the corridor, swarming past stunned journalists inside the Maracana stadium an hour before the Chile-Spain kickoff yesterday. Cops detained at least 85. JUST FOR KICKS . While you wait for the games to begin, here is some soccer-related stuff that's making waves this Thursday: . If not Ronaldo, then Eminem?: The Deuce is loose and ready to produce rhymes in times that strike and score, that you'll adore, that take their toll, until he reaches his goooooooooooooooal. Sorry, we'll leave the rapping to Clint Dempsey, aka The Deuce (his preferred uniform number), who according to The Wall Street Journal will release a new album after the Cup. It's not his first rap effort, as fans of the 2006 U.S. team will recall. And we shall call it Golfball: A game that combines the two. Why not? Soccer in a minion nutshell: Also known as haters gonna hate. .","England is hoping for a win -- and for Rooney to score .

"(CNN) -- The Humane Society of the United States released Thursday what it says is video showing gruesome images of many dead chickens -- and in some cases, mummified chicken carcasses -- at a farm in southeastern Pennsylvania. The animal protection organization says the video is from an undercover investigation it conducted at Kreider Farms in Manheim, Pennsylvania, in February and March. Kreider Farms, on its website, describes itself as ""a real working farm supplying fresh quality eggs, milk, drinks and premium batch-churned ice cream to select wholesalers and retail stores."" The video, played in a news conference, showed dead chickens in cramped cages surrounded by live chickens and eggs. Many of the birds appeared to be trapped either in cage wire or in automated feeding machinery. ""During the investigation, thousands of birds died of dehydration when there was a water system malfunction that people didn't notice for two or three days,"" said Paul Shapiro, vice president of the Humane Society of the United States. ""Hen's legs and wings and more were found stuck inside of the wires of the cages, trapping these animals, preventing them from gaining access to food or water. Some of the floors in these barns were so packed with dead flies that our investigator described the experience as similar to walking on top of Rice Krispies."" But Kreider Farms President and CEO Ron Kreider issued a statement disputing the Humane Society's claims. ""The allegations by HSUS are a gross distortion of Kreider Farms, our employees and the way we care for our birds,"" the statement read. ""There are still many unanswered questions regarding how and when this video was shot, edited and assembled."" The Humane Society is pushing for passage of a bill currently in the House of Representatives that it says would lead to a friendlier system of egg production. The bill is supported by the United Egg Producers, which represents farmers responsible for more than 80% of the country's egg production. Other influential food-industry organizations, however, are opposed to the legislation. The National Pork Producers Council, for example, issued a news release in January calling it a ""farm takeover bill,"" and saying ""it would set a 'dangerous precedent' for allowing the federal government to regulate on-farm production practices, including animal housing."" The bill calls for an increase in the size of chicken cages, with the aim of preventing cramped and unsanitary conditions in which chickens lay eggs. The law would be phased in over an extended period to give farms time to make the necessary changes. It is unclear when the House might take up the bill for consideration. Kreider said in his statement Kreider Farms supports such legislation and asserted that more than 80% of the chickens there are already housed in new, larger, state-of-the art facilities. Still, Shapiro said the conditions on farms such as Kreider's aren't acceptable and threaten the health of people. ""There is a direct connection many times between how we treat animals and problems that we cause for ourselves,"" he said. ""Oftentimes when we abuse farm animals, we're not doing ourselves any favors in the process. ""There's a clear case to be made, for example, that increasing the amount of birds who are cramming in together, giving them less and less space, increases the risk of salmonella infection. In fact, at Kreider Farms we saw they were testing positive for salmonella at this facility. And so it's important to recognize that, of course, the cruelty to animals by itself is extraordinarily problematic, but there's also a consumer safety aspect to this.""","The Humane Society shows video of dead chickens at an egg farm .

"(CNN) -- In San Diego County, officials are racing, literally, to save pets and livestock left behind by hundreds of thousands of residents fleeing the raging wildfires. Horses stand in a pen as fire threatens the Bonita neighborhood in San Diego, California. For the County of San Diego Department of Animal Services, it's nonstop work to save as many lives as possible, said Lt. Daniel Desousa. ""We're doing the best we can to keep ahead of the flames and pull the animals out,"" he said Tuesday. ""Are animals going to be killed? Yes. But we're doing the best we can."" With help from Los Angeles and the Humane Society of the United States, the county's 30 animal services officers have been answering calls from people who left their pets and livestock behind as well as those who have seen animals left in evacuated areas. Many people calling don't have enough trailers to get all of their horses to safety and need help, he said. ""I never knew we had so many horses here,"" Desousa said. ""And we're seeing even more this time because our fires are bigger and worse (than the 2003 fires that swept the area).""  Watch people staying with pets at refuge » . At a fairground in San Diego County, 2,000 horses are being boarded, but Desousa said it seems like horses are being housed everywhere -- even mall parking lots -- with their anxious owners standing next to them. ""If you have an open space, we'll put horses on it,"" he said. The Humane Society's Curtis Ransom is stationed at an emergency campground in San Diego County where people have taken refuge with their dogs, cats, horses and even goats. ""It's a whole different situation from Katrina; people are taking care of the animals,"" Ransom said. ""The message has gotten out. It's a horrible disaster, but as far as the facilities and the willingness to take in animals, I don't think there's any hesitation,"" he said. He said they have received invitations from shelters to take in pets -- they even have one place that could house an elephant, if needed -- and many of the evacuation areas are allowing people to bring their furry friends. Also, news stations are informing people about where they can take their animals if their neighborhood is evacuated, Ransom said. Desousa said the county has been so busy with the work, they don't have figures on how many animals they've saved and evacuated. One officer called to say there was a bird left in a house in the fire's path. He wanted to know if he should kick in the door to get the animal. Desousa told him that the door won't matter if the fire destroys the house. Save the bird, he told him. Other times, flames have been too close for officers to grab the animals, Desousa said. On the job for 19 years, Desousa said this is the worst series of wildfires he's seen. Even many of the officers themselves have been evacuated. Desousa has his three dogs, three cats, a tortoise and a snake in his office. He said when they were told to evacuate, they divvied up priorities. ""I ran home, grabbed the animals and my wife grabbed the family photos,"" he said. E-mail to a friend .","Animal services: ""We're doing the best we can to keep ahead of the flames""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday he was unaware of any disclosure of classified information from the scandal engulfing former CIA Director David Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, that could damage national security. ""I have no evidence at this point from what I've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security,"" Obama said in his first post-election news conference. Obama, addressing the ongoing controversy for the first time publicly, said Petraeus tendered his resignation because his actions ""did not meet the standards he felt were necessary as the director of the CIA."" The former four-star general admitted last Friday that he had had an extramarital affair with a woman who was later identified as a co-author of his biography. The FBI is also investigating Allen over his contacts with another woman whose complaints about anonymous, harassing e-mails led to the discovery of the Petraeus affair. When asked if he should have known about the investigation into his former CIA chief earlier, the president said he is ""withholding judgment"" because all of the information is not yet available. ""I'm going to wait and see ... how this whole process unfolded,"" Obama added. The scandal has threatened to complicate Obama's focus on critical negotiations with Congress over spending cuts and taxes. It has also raised questions surrounding the CIA's response to congressional inquiries into the September terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. On that matter, Obama offered a fierce defense of U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, who has come under scrutiny for public comments in the days following the attack in which she placed blame for it on a mob enraged by an anti-Muslim video. The president said Rice was speaking with the information provided by the intelligence community and has acted with ""skill, professionalism, toughness and grace."" In response to statements Wednesday from Sen. John McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said they would block a potential Rice nomination for a Cabinet position, Obama said if the lawmakers want to ""go after somebody, they should go after me. I'm happy to have that discussion with them."" ""For them to go after the U.N. ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received, and besmirch her reputation is outrageous,"" he said. On another pressing foreign policy issue, Obama said he was not ready to arm the Syrian opposition movement, saying that the nation needed to avoid indirectly providing weapons to groups or people who would seek to harm Americans or Israelis. The United States is supporting a new coalition of Syrian dissidents and is seeking to accelerate assistance in their effort to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to leave office. On budget matters at home, Obama opened the door to compromise regarding the impending fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts. The president said he was encouraged by recent comments from members of the Republican Party surrounding the need for more revenue from the wealthiest Americans as part of a plan to reduce the deficit. ""Both parties voted to set this deadline, and I believe both parties can make these decisions together ... in a balanced and responsible way,"" Obama said. Obama stood by his previous statements about tax rates. He called on House Republicans to agree to Senate-passed proposals that would extend current tax rates for those making $250,000 a year while allowing rates to return to higher levels for those making over that amount and insisted he would not accept a lower tax rate for the wealthiest 2% of Americans. His comments should not come as a surprise, he said, given his statements during the election. ""I've got one mandate to help middle class families and families working hard to get into the middle class,"" Obama said. He specifically referenced a letter he received from a man in Tennessee who said he did not vote for Obama. The voter said he was watching Obama's comments recently on CNN about the fiscal cliff and said his hope ""is that we can make progress in light of personal and party principles, special interest groups, and years of business as usual. We've got to work together and put our differences aside."" After reading from the letter, Obama added: ""I couldn't say it better myself. That's precisely what I intend to do."" The president is often criticized for not forging relationships with Congress, to the detriment of his agenda. On Wednesday he acknowledged that history and said he can ""always do better."" His relationships haven't ""always manifested itself in the kind of agreement I'd like to see between Democrats and Republicans,"" he said. Obama is set meet with major CEOs following his news conference, some of whom flexed their political muscle to defeat Democrats in elections last week. He is expected to find backing for some of the administration's positions ahead of negotiations with Congress on avoiding the fiscal cliff. Leaders of the largest companies have indicated they are holding back hiring and spending because they are worried about Washington gridlock over the fiscal cliff. The president sat down Tuesday with labor leaders and the heads of six independent groups involved in organizing grassroots support for progressive causes and told them that he intended to allow the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans while preserving them for middle-income earners, according to several people at that meeting. ""The president was very strong on saying there's going to be an end to the Bush tax cuts one way or another,"" said one participant who requested anonymity to discuss the off-the-record meeting. Obama is to meet with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at the White House on Friday. The president took on two other issues that he has said he will address during his second term: immigration and climate change. An increase in the Hispanic vote that helped him win battleground states, created an opening, Obama said, to pass comprehensive immigration reform, something he and members of Congress failed to pass during his first term. He expects a bill to be introduced soon after his inauguration in January, adding an agreement should address border security and pathways to citizenship for thousands of illegal immigrants if they go to college or serve in the military. Obama also reaffirmed his belief that ""climate change is real"" and is ""impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions."" He said it could be tackled if members of both political parties are prepared to make some ""tough political"" decisions. The last time Obama held a full-blown news conference at the White House, his first campaign rally was two months away and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum looked to have the upper hand over Mitt Romney in the GOP presidential primaries. To be sure, in some ways the political landscape has changed dramatically since Obama fielded questions from the White House press corps on March 6: He is now assured of four more years in the Oval Office and can claim fresh leverage in his dealings with Republicans over reaching a budget deal. But in many ways, the political environment closely mirrors what it looked like eight months ago: Republicans remain in control of the House of Representatives, the GOP leadership maintains it is opposed to any measure that will raise tax rates on the nation's top earners and the president's approval rating remains stubbornly stuck around a less-than impressive 50%. Moreover, with election-year politics having largely rendered Congress unproductive over the past year, many of the same issues remain at the forefront as they did the last time the president held a formal news conference -- namely the ballooning national debt, the tepid economic recovery, unrest in the Middle East and the specter of a nuclear Iran. To be fair, Obama has taken the national media's questions in other forums since his March news conference, most recently in late August when he made an unannounced stop at the regular White House briefing in the midst of the heated campaign and a week before the start of the Republican National Convention. But he only took four questions that day and the entire session lasted less than 30 minutes. Moreover, the president ran for re-election while largely ignoring White House reporters in favor of local outlets and entertainment shows. Pressed on why he wasn't taking more questions from national media outlets, Obama campaign aides said the president could reach more battleground voters via local news than through network television programs or national publications. Fiscal cliff headache for middle class . Those interviews were largely filled with predictable softball questions, though it should be noted that one Colorado news anchor drew wide praise for aggressively questioning the president over conflicting White House accounts in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack. The president also showed a preference for more light-hearted forms of media during the course of the campaign, granting interviews with comedians Jon Stewart and Jay Leno, daytime talk show ""The View,"" and MTV's Sway Calloway. Again, Obama aides stressed the president was likely to reach more undecided voters through these programs than traditional news shows. But critics, including some who are part of the very press corps Obama appeared to be ignoring, questioned whether the president was attempting to dodge more hard-edged questions. Indeed, White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked last week if the president's more or less avoidance of the White House press corps over the last eight months showed a ""certain amount of disdain"" for them. ""Absolutely not,"" Carney replied. ""Absolutely not. The president was out there campaigning for re-election and giving interviews daily to reporters ... from news organizations across the country, from regional newspapers and television stations, and answered a lot of tough questions.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Clashes broke out Friday between Palestinians and Israeli security forces after the funeral of a Palestinian teenager abducted and killed in Jerusalem this week. More than 60 people were injured in fighting in parts of Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Medical Relief Society, a group that said it was involved in evacuating injured Palestinians. It said the injuries mostly involved rubber bullets fired at the upper body and chest. Israeli police said 13 officers were slightly injured in the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Shuafat, where Palestinian protesters were throwing rocks at police, who responded by firing rubber bullets and tear gas. Police have said they are investigating whether the Palestinian youth's death was an act of retaliation for the killings of three Israeli teens, whose bodies were discovered Monday in a field in the West Bank. The killings of the Palestinian and Israeli teenagers have ratcheted up tensions in a region where peace talks fell apart earlier this year. Ahead of the Palestinian boy's funeral, Israeli police significantly stepped up security around Palestinian areas of the city, putting up checkpoints and shutting off access to the Shuafat neighborhood where the slain teen, Mohammad Abu Khedair, lived. Carried in by dozens of people, the 16-year-old's body was brought to a mosque there for the funeral. After the ceremony, his remains were taken by his family for burial in a nearby cemetery. The sound of sirens and gunfire filled the streets of the Palestinian suburb as fighting again erupted. A CNN team on the ground saw about 30 Israeli riot police firing rubber bullets, tear gas and stun grenades in the direction of Palestinian protesters, who were throwing stones and Molotov cocktails toward the police. CNN's Ben Wedeman was slightly injured when a rubber bullet hit him in the forehead Friday afternoon. He continued to report from the site after medics attended to him. The clashes went on for several hours until the mood calmed a little around 6 p.m. local time. The violence may pick up again later Friday evening after Muslims break their Ramadan fast. Well over 1,000 Palestinians gathered for the funeral despite strict Israeli security measures that have limited movement around Jerusalem, including in the Old City. The funeral coincided with the first Friday prayers held during the Ramadan period when emotions are often heightened. Violence first broke out after news of Abu Khedair's death Wednesday, and it also flared overnight in parts of the city and the West Bank. The Palestinian Red Crescent said 27 Palestinian youths were injured in the overnight unrest. It wasn't immediately clear if any Israelis were hurt. A Palestinian farmer is in critical condition after Israeli fire hit him on his farm east of Gaza, according to Palestinian medical sources in Gaza on Friday. Palestinian security sources said that four rockets were fired from the same location. Forced into car . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Thursday to find the perpetrators responsible for the boy's killing, an act he described as ""a despicable crime."" Israeli authorities are still trying to determine who killed Abu Khedair and why, Netanyahu said. Abu Khedair was heading from his home to a mosque for prayers around 4 a.m. Wednesday when three men forced him into a car and drove off, his father, Hussain Abu Khedair, said. The boy's body was found about an hour later in a forest in West Jerusalem. Israeli police have said they are looking into the possibility that his death was related to a family dispute as well as the alternative theory that it was a revenge killing. ""The investigation is continuing. We are still looking at the possibility to determine if we are talking about a criminal incident or a nationalistic incident,"" Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said. Arrests after Israelis kidnapped . Since the June 13 abduction of the Israeli teens -- Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel -- on their way home from school, Israel has arrested hundreds of activists from Hamas, the militant Islamic organization it blames for the kidnapping. Israeli forces have also destroyed the homes of the two main suspects it has identified in the Israeli teenagers' abduction. WAFA, the Palestinian state news agency, reported Wednesday that 15 Palestinians have been killed during that time. The figure includes six killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank, three in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, two dead of heart attacks after West Bank raids, plus the recently slain Palestinian teenager. Hamas has praised the kidnappings of the Israelis but denied that it was responsible for what happened. It warned that if Netanyahu ""brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him."" Rockets, airstrikes . This week's unrest comes as Israelis and Palestinians continue to trade blows over longstanding issues. There have been Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes. On Friday the Israeli air force struck three Hamas targets in southern Gaza, the IDF said in a statement. At least 14 rockets and mortars were fired from the Palestinian territory, according to the IDF. Ten of them hit Israeli territory while three were intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system and one landed in Palestinian territory, the IDF said. Opinion: Teens' killing hurts Israelis, bad for Palestinians . Opinion: Slain teens call for justice, not escalation . CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Jerusalem. Steve Almasy in Atlanta and Laura Smith-Spark in London reported and wrote.

"(CNN) -- The new version of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 7, was released September 18 to mostly positive reviews. It was the biggest change to iOS since it was introduced six years ago, overhauled to add a slate of new features and a more streamlined, flat, abstract look. But nobody's perfect, right? It's not unusual for new operating systems to have some glitches in their earliest days. Nobody's talking about anything cataclysmic this time, like the Apple Maps fiasco on iOS 6 that led CEO Tim Cook to issue a rare apology -- and which some say led to the ouster of Apple senior vice president Scott Forstall. But a couple of weeks into its existence, iOS 7 has prompted a handful of complaints from users. Here are five of the most frequently heard, along with tips for how to fix, or at least bypass, them. iMessage failing . Apple says it's aware of an issue that's causing texts sent through its iMessage app not to go through for some users. On various Apple-oriented message boards, iOS 7 users were complaining that they'd send a message which appeared to work fine, only to later see the dreaded red exclamation point that means it wasn't actually sent. ""We are aware of an issue that affects a fraction of a percent of our iMessage users, and we will have a fix available in an upcoming software update,"" Apple said in a statement e-mailed to media outlets. ""In the meantime, we encourage any users having problems to reference our troubleshooting documents or contact AppleCare to help resolve their issue. We apologize for any inconvenience this causes impacted users."" The fix? Until the update rolls out, some users say they've been able to get rid of the problem by turning their phone off and back on. Animation flu . Some folks say they're already sick of iOS 7. Literally. iPhone and iPad users, or at least a few of them, say they're getting symptoms similar to motion sickness while looking at iOS 7 animations. On the new system, images zoom in and out when users switch between apps. As TIME explains, the brain gets unsettled when the eyes try to focus on images that don't match up -- for example, when you're on a rocking ship or moving car and trying to read a stationary item, like a book. The fix? iOS 7 users can go to ""Settings,"" then ""General"" and then ""Accessibility."" Click on ""Reduce Motion"" to make the zooming go away. Battery drain . This one has been mostly reported by users of older phones like the iPhone 4S. Simply, they say iOS 7 seems to drain their batteries faster than iOS 6 did. One factor may be that iOS 7 expands the ability to run apps in the background while focusing on another task. The fix? Again, go to ""Settings"" and ""General,"" but then choose ""Background App Refresh."" From there, you can choose which apps you'll allow to run in the background and which you won't. There are also general battery-saving steps, like dimming your screen and making sure things like GPS and Bluetooth are switched off if you're not using them. Certain apps log you out . This one might take care of itself over time. When Apple updates its operating system, apps that rely on parts of it (like Camera) must update as well. Until they do, they sometimes kick users out. On Apple message boards, users were mentioning apps like Snapchat and Mailbox as frequent offenders. The fix? Some developers may have already tweaked their products, and other fixes are probably on the way. But if you're still having problems, you can go to ""Settings,"" ""General"" and ""Background App Refresh"" again. Turn off any apps you're having problems with. Lock screen bypass . This one has already been addressed in an iOS 7 update from Apple just days after the new operating system rolled out. For the first few days, iPhones and iPads apparently were vulnerable in one particular instance. If users were running the Camera app and had Control Center activated on their Lock screens, there were a few steps someone could take to unlock their phones. But the iOS 7.0.2 update, released on September 26, ""fixes bugs that could allow someone to bypass the Lock screen passcode,"" according to Apple. Are you encountering issues with iOS 7? If so, have you found a way to fix them? Let us know in the comments.","iMessage not working for some users of Apple's new mobile system .

"(CNN) -- My oh my Miley! Miley Cyrus did an in-your-face, look at me now, pornographic performance at the record industry's most public coming out party, the MTV video music awards. This was no accident. She did every porn star move in the book, and the only thing different was that there wasn't actual genital connection, and her seemingly sprayed on rubber undies and bra did cover her private parts. What was Miley thinking? You don't have to guess. She was probably thinking: ""I'm not that Miley Cyrus anymore and this ought to prove it."" It's shocking all right. But let's face it. A 20-year-old these days is unlikely to be a virgin and if she's in the fast lane (read: Hollywood, New York City and other big cities) she is not going to look innocent. Shocked at Miley? Have you noticed your average 15-year-old girl lately? She has her midriff bared, she's wearing her underwear for the world to see and her skirt may or may not cover her butt and crotch. Outraged parents: What was Miley thinking? It's hard to take it as parents. We know how young 15 really is. Hell, we know how young 20 is. My guess is after Miley has finished with her personally satisfying PR moment from this, she's going to tone it down eventually. But right now, this is her battle cry: I am a fully sexual, bad-assed vixen and live with it. How should we integrate this new human being with the little girl Disney promoted as wholesome and childlike? Maybe a better use of our time is to think about the models of sexuality that are in most rock groups and how we talk to our kids about them. The metaphors in the lyrics and bump and grind moves in the videos have been around for quite a while. So how do we tell our children that they can be young men and women without looking and acting, like rock performers? Well, this is a well-beaten drum I'm going to pound, but we have to talk to them about how that is show business, and that in real life, a little bit of subtlety goes a long way. That ultimately, in this turtle and hare story, the more discriminating, less crudely sexual person wins the girl or guy's love, and a lot of other good things in life. Miley upholds VMAs tradition . We can give the talk without having to link this performance to abstinence before marriage, or that sexuality per se is wrong or bad for you. The statistics will tell you that approach is, for most parents, a losing game. But research does tell us that parent's opinions and values really do matter on quite a number of sexual issues. We can take a middle road. Take this performance (and others) as a teachable moment and do what all reputable sex education courses tell us to do -- talk about your own values and why you have them and why they matter. While sexuality can be expressed in our dress and behavior, there are far better ways for young women to be attractive and appealing. It cannot be said that Miley made a wrong career choice: Look at the press coverage! But modeling porn-star appearance and performance is a dangerous choice for our young people. I don't think we are ever going to get our teenagers and young adults back in saddle shoes (except as a sly joke) but I do think we can show them that Miley Cyrus' act is a sexual cartoon and that they can put themselves together and act in a way that will make them far more popular and desirable in the long run than what they see in a MTV award show. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Miley Cyrus's performance at the MTV video music awards show stunned viewers .

"(CNN) -- For Hasif Nazri, the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 contained a tragic coincidence. Two friends from two different periods of his life -- both unknown to each other -- were on board the flight. But as time goes by, the 33-year-old Malaysian process engineer says hope is fading. ""I was shocked, really shocked to be honest, but now that shock is turning to sadness,"" he told CNN. ""Of course, I'm holding out some hope -- all we can do now is pray."" His former classmate, Mohd Sofuan Ibrahim, also 33 and Malaysian, was scheduled to report for duty at Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry branch office in Beijing -- even taking a Facebook photo before he boarded the plane. READ MORE: Still no sign of Flight 370 . ""We were at the same residential school and we shared the same dorm and stuck together in the dining hall,"" he said. ""He was a good, kind-hearted friend, very helpful, cheerful and definitely no wallflower. He was a very good speaker and teachers remembered him as a very good student."" Nazri then discovered another former classmate, 33-year-old Ch'ng Mei Ling, was also on board Flight 370. He said that Mei Ling, a Malaysian national who worked as a process engineer at Flexsys America LP, a manufacturer and supplier of chemicals for the rubber industry based in Ohio, would always be remembered as a ""very cheerful girl."" ""She was very adaptable -- we had a lot of course work that we had to do together and she was very easy to work with,"" he said. ""She was also very funny. As a Chinese person she used to like playing with the Malay language; her laugh was very infectious."" Desperate for information . In Mumbai, 23-year-old technology graduate Archit Joshi was also desperately seeking information about his classmate Swawand Kolekar who was listed aboard Flight 370. He said Kolekar's family were in Beijing and also desperate for information on their son. ""Swawand was very reserved but very, very intelligent,"" Joshi told CNN. ""He was a bit of a techno-freak and he made a lot of circuits and projects at engineering college. ""He didn't have many friends, he was a bit of a loner, but he had all the attributes a good friend should have."" In China, meanwhile, home to most of the 239 people on board, relatives of passengers were increasingly frustrated Monday as the agonizing wait for news continued. More than 100 people signed a hand-written petition demanding ""the truth"" from the airline by Sunday evening. They also urged the Chinese government to help them deal with Malaysian authorities. Zhang Guizhi, the aunt of passenger Li Yan, told CNN that she had arrived in Beijing from her native Henan province in central China and remained uncertain about how the airline would help her obtain a passport to travel to wherever the plane is found. She started crying when she mentioned her 31-year-old niece had traveled to Malaysia with her husband and four friends on vacation. ""Still no information and still waiting -- I'm not happy with the airline's arrangements so far,"" she said. A man who identified himself as the brother-in-law of passenger Ding Lijun said he had just arrived from Tianjin, approximately an hour south-east of Beijing. He teared up when he said Ding had been working in Malaysia as a construction worker for a year and was making his first trip home. Opinion: When passenger jets mysteriously disappear . Flights to Malaysia . In Kuala Lumpur, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, CEO of Malaysia Airlines, said the carrier was making arrangements to fly next of kin to the country's capital as the search for Flight 370 continues. ""We'll be accommodating them in hotels around Kuala Lumpur,"" he said. ""We have made an offer for two next of kin to be flown immediately."" Increasingly frustrated relatives in China, however, continued to demand more information. Some blamed the Chinese government, which they claimed had not come forward. ""I'm not going home until I know what happened,"" said the father of one of the passengers named as Yan Ling. ""We've lost loved ones and they need to answer our questions. When are you going to tell us and what are you going to do? We still don't know if they are alive or dead."" Grief counselors were on hand in Beijing and in Kuala Lumpur to assist relatives. ""We have dispatched about 15 volunteers to Beijing,"" said deputy CEO of the Buddhist group Tzu Chi, Sio Kee Hong. ""In Malaysia, we have mobilized about 60 people on a daily basis, 24 hours a day. We have volunteers providing care to the families. ""Those with frustrations, we will be with them physically (and) provide whatever assistance is required ... psychological support is the most important thing at this juncture.""

"(CNN) -- The SpaceX Dragon capsule remains on course for the International Space Station despite losing one of nine booster engines, but a satellite launched on the same rocket didn't reach its intended orbit, its operator said Monday. SpaceX launched the first commercial space cargo mission on Sunday night. But a minute and 19 seconds after the Falcon 9 booster lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, one of the nine Merlin engines that power the rocket ""lost pressure suddenly,"" the company disclosed Monday. The rocket ""did exactly what it was designed to do,"" as its flight computer made adjustments to keep the Dragon headed into the proper orbit. The unmanned capsule, which is carrying about 1,000 pounds of supplies for the space station, is scheduled to arrive at the orbital platform on Wednesday, SpaceX said. Opinion: SpaceX -- A pioneer in space and on Earth . However, the rocket also was carrying a satellite for the New Jersey-based communications company Orbcomm. The satellite separated properly from the second stage of the Falcon 9 -- but the engine trouble meant the satellite would not pass clear of a safety zone if it fired its own engine, leaving it in a lower orbit than planned, Orbcomm said in a statement issued Monday night. Engineers from Orbcomm and its partner on the project, Sierra Nevada Corporation, ""have been in contact with the satellite and are working to determine if and the extent to which the orbit can be raised to an operational orbit using the satellite's on-board propulsion system,"" the statement said. Neither SpaceX nor Orbcomm responded to request for comment about the satellite issue. California-based SpaceX said earlier that controllers are reviewing flight data in an effort to figure out what happened to the booster rocket, but initial readings indicate the No. 1 engine fairing broke apart under stress. In May: Dragon returns to Earth after 'grand slam' space mission . ""We know the engine did not explode, because we continued to receive data from it,"" the company said. But it said two of NASA's Saturn V boosters lost engines on two flights during the Apollo program, and the Falcon 9 ""is designed to handle an engine-out situation and still complete its mission."" The failure occurred second after the booster achieved supersonic speed and approached its moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure after liftoff. Video posted online by the company shows a flash as the rocket ascends, followed by what appears to be debris falling away from the accelerating craft. Sunday's launch was the first of a dozen freight runs that SpaceX is scheduled to make to the station under a contract with NASA, which plans to turn much of its focus toward exploring deep into the solar system. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden called it ""a critical event in space flight."" SpaceX, meanwhile, is looking beyond just cargo flights to developing a human-rated version of the Dragon that would carry astronauts to the ISS. It's one of three companies, along with Sierra Nevada and aerospace giant Boeing, that NASA has chosen to work on the project. And within the next few months, Orbital Sciences is expected to fly its own demonstration flight to the space station. Instead of using Cape Canaveral as its launch site, the company's rocket will take off from Wallops Island, off the coast of Virginia. Orbital has a nearly $2 billion contract with NASA for station resupply missions.","NEW: Communications company says its satellite didn't reach proper orbit .

"Soweto, South Africa (CNN) -- There are still bullet holes in the stained-glass windows of this church. They're a reminder, Tommy Zwane says, of the dark days before Nelson Mandela became his country's first democratically elected president. The Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Soweto was at the heart of the uprising against apartheid -- most famously on June 16, 1976, when young students rebelled against the education system and were fired upon by police. ""Things were difficult for everybody, for black people in this country. We used to run and come to this church to pray to God so that he could come and assist us, because we were in trouble at that time,"" Zwane said. ""There was no understanding between us and the government of South Africa."" On Sunday, people filled the church's pews for a very different reason -- to sing, pray and honor Mandela's legacy days after his death in a home nearby. Services at churches, synagogues and mosques throughout South Africa honored Mandela. The national day of remembrance is one of a string of events planned to say farewell to the iconic figure who helped South Africa break the practice of racial segregation and end white minority rule. A massive memorial service is scheduled for Tuesday in Johannesburg's FNB Stadium, which can hold 94,000 people. A state funeral will be held December 15 in Mandela's ancestral hometown of Qunu in the Eastern Cape province. At least 70 heads of state and 10 former heads of state have said they're coming to South Africa this week, government international relations spokesman Clayson Monyela said. From the United States, officials said, U.S. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will be accompanied by President Jimmy Carter, President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton and their wives. More than two dozen U.S. lawmakers are also scheduled to attend. South African President Jacob Zuma, who announced Mandela's death Thursday, used the revered leader's well-known clan name Sunday as he asked churchgoers to remember the former president's values. ""When I say we pray for the nation, (it) is that we should pray for us not to forget some of the values that Madiba stood for, that he fought for, that he sacrificed his life for,"" he said. ""He stood for freedom. He fought against those who oppressed others. He wanted everyone to be free."" In a suburb of Pretoria, parishioners said they were grateful for the man who saved them from revenge. ""His presence in our lives meant so much for the Afrikaaner people, allowed them to get rid of their guilt feelings and to participate in the journey that he invited us to join,"" Wilhelm Jordaan said. In Soweto, Kathy and Stewart Allen said they don't normally attend the Regina Mundi church. But they wanted to be there on Sunday. ""We believe that this church embodies all the history, and everything that he stood for,"" Kathy Allen said. Once again, Stewart Allen said, Mandela has brought the country together. CNN's Kim Norgaard and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report from Atlanta.","NEW: Official: 70 heads of state are coming to South Africa to honor Nelson Mandela .

"(CNN) -- After a couple of weather delays, NASA finally launched its moon research mission Saturday morning. Called GRAIL, the effort will study how the moon was formed. It will explore ""the structure of the lunar interior, from crust to core... to advance understanding of the thermal evolution of the moon,"" NASA said. Two lunar orbiters are aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The crafts -- GRAIL-A and GRAIL-B -- will eventually separate from the Delta rocket. GRAIL stands for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory. Once in orbit, the orbiters' speeds will increase when they pass over formations on the moon's surface, allowing scientists to measure those formations based on the distance between the two spacecraft. ""Trying to understand how the moon formed, and how it evolved over its history, is one of the things we're trying to address with the GRAIL mission,"" says Maria Zuber, principal investigator for GRAIL from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""But also, (we're) trying to understand how the moon is an example of how terrestrial planets in general have formed."" NASA says the mission is ""the first time students have a dedicated camera on board a planetary spacecraft. "" Teachers will be able to register their classes and allow their students to explore specific regions of the moon in detail through pictures taken by the spacecraft. Digital video imaging system called MoonKAM will offer middle-school students the opportunity to request photography of lunar targets for classroom study. Sally Ride, the first American woman to fly in space, heads the project.","GRAIL stands for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory .

"(CNN) -- Rescuers pulled stranded riders from a roller coaster at Six Flags America in Maryland on Sunday after the ride halted on the tracks. A train on the Joker's Jinx roller coaster stopped near the top of the 79-foot-tall ride, fire officials said. It took more than four hours to get all 24 passengers back on the ground. No one was injured, Six Flags spokeswoman Debbie Evans said. Video from CNN affiliate WJLA showed rescuers slowly helping passengers to safety, one by one. Hours after the rescue operation began, Prince George's County Fire Chief Marc Bashoor said all passengers were safe. He posted a series of photos of the dramatic rescue on Twitter. ""Firefighters have reached the 1st car by tower bucket - each of 6 cars will be emptied slowly,"" he wrote. ""Riders being strapped in place within each car, before cars passenger restraint can be released,"" he said minutes later. ""Then pulled 1 by 1 - 1st 2 people in bucket."" Volunteer firefighters tweeted a photo showing two aerial towers they were using to help passengers to safety. Officials don't know what caused the coaster to halt, Evans said. ""The ride has a sophisticated, computerized safety system that can cause such ride stoppages. While we are not yet sure what caused the stoppage, the ride performed as it is designed to,"" she said. On its website, Six Flags America says the ride normally lasts for just over a minute and reaches a speed of 60 mph. ""Without any pauses or braking, you'll blast through a cobra roll, a sidewinder loop, a corkscrew, and countless swift reversals in between,"" the website says. When the ride blasts to 60 mph in just over three seconds, the description says, ""that'll wipe that smirk off your face, as you are shot like a bullet into four inversions compressed into a half-mile pile of twisted steel."" Evans said Sunday that the Joker's Jinx would be shut down while officials determine what happened. ""The ride will remain closed until the park completes a thorough investigation and both the staff and ride manufacturer have determined the ride is safe for operation,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Thirty-five Nigerian policemen are missing following an insurgent attack Saturday on a police training school in one of the most volatile parts of the African nation, police said. A search-and-rescue effort has been launched after the third attack this month the Gwoza Training camp in Borno State, according to a statement posted online by the Nigeria Police Force. It was not immediately clear whether anyone had claimed responsibility. Afterward, the force's Inspector-General Suleiman Abba ordered that security be tightened around all police facilities in the country. It's not known what happened to the missing officers, though the police force statement did say there is a ""very promising prospect of locating them."" ""While enjoining all citizens to remain calm and join hands with the security forces in the collective fight against insurgency, the IGP restates his determination to work closely with other security agencies to stem the tide of terrorism in the country,"" added the police in their statement out of Abuja, Nigeria's capital. Nigeria has been beset by violence for some time, particularly in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. Much of it has blamed on the Islamist militant group Boko Haram -- whose name means ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike.","Police: Insurgents attack a police training school in Borno for the third time this month .

"New York (CNN) -- A federal judge ruled Tuesday that a New York gun law restricting assault weapons and large-capacity magazines was constitutional, but he threw out a provision prohibiting the loading of more than seven rounds of ammunition into a firearm. Judge William Skretny of U.S. District Court in Buffalo found that parts of the gun-control law -- known as the SAFE Act and enacted by Gov. Andrew Cuomo early in 2013 -- restricting assault weapons and large-capacity magazines did not violate the Second Amendment and met an important governmental interest in public safety. But the judge ruled that the seven-round limit on ammunition was unconstitutional and ""arbitrary,"" according to the decision. The law was passed in January 2013 after the mass shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school. Armed with a semi-automatic rifle, gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six school staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012, before taking his own life. Earlier, he killed his mother inside their home. The New York State Rifle & Pistol Association filed the lawsuit in March, challenging the law's constitutionality. The association did not immediately return CNN's message seeking comment.","New York judge upholds law restricting assault weapons and large-capacity magazines .

"(CNN) -- Marina Abramovic is fixing her deep brown eyes on me. She gently takes my hand and leads me across London's Serpentine Gallery's marble floor, to a window whose white blinds are obscuring the greenery of Hyde Park beyond. She places her hand reassuringly on my back and whispers: ""Ten minutes like this."" Frankly, if she had asked me to stay there forever, I would have probably agreed. I have been charmed by the self-styled grandmother of performance art. The legendary Serbian-born New York-based artist is in London for the biggest show of her career, and she is revealing a small glimpse of it to a room full of enchanted international journalists. Entitled 512 Hours, the exhibition will see Abramovic in residence at the Serpentine Gallery for 64 days, spending eight hours a day with no breaks trying to create art out of nothing. The museum walls have been stripped, and there are some folding chairs and beds which she may or may not use in storage, but essentially, Abramovic is relying purely on an exchange of energy with her audience. ""It took me 25 years to gather courage, concentration and knowledge to come to this"" the formidable artist says, clad in an almost monastic outfit of black high-neck shirt, long overcoat and dark trousers. ""It's difficult to say what I'm going to do because I don't know. What I do know is that in this piece I have to give not 100, but 120 per cent of myself, because only then I can create energy out of empty space."" If this seems like an audacious proposal, Abramovic has managed to do something similar with aplomb before. For her 2010 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, over 850,000 people queued day and night just to sit opposite her, many breaking down in tears when finally faced with her. Mesmerizing appeal . It's hard to think of another artist who can draw monumental crowds with such an airy concept, but after spending half an hour with Abramovic, you start to see the pull. Strikingly beautiful in the flesh and looking two decades younger than her 67 years, she exudes a mesmerizing mix of hypnotic energy, reassuring warmth and sharp wit. Even so, what makes people from all walks of life, as seen in New York, wait for hours just to be in her presence? ""Connection,"" says Julia Peyton-Jones, co-director of the Serpentine Gallery, who first invited Abramovic to stage a show after she won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 1997. ""When we grow older we lose that connection with other people, and Marina helps us regain it through her."" In a career spanning over 40 years, Abramovic has constantly challenged the notions of what art should be, using her body as an instrument, and sometimes risking her life in the process. She has lain inside a burning star of sawdust, had a crossbow pointed to her heart, and even allowed the audience to prod and cut her naked body as she lay motionless. ""Every performance has a concept, and when I set out the rules I stick to them no matter what, ""the artist told me over the phone when I interviewed her about the Marina Abramovic Institute, a space she is creating in Hudson, New York, for development and study of performance art. ""Even if in the end I don't survive, I don't care,"" she says. Iron willpower . This steely resolve could be attributed to her upbringing in post-World War II Belgrade, as the daughter of two national heroes ordained for bravery. Her family valued achievement above all, and household rules were strict: ""Until I was 29 years old and left home I had a curfew of 10 pm, so all my performances had to be done by that time. ""I think I inherited self-control and discipline from my parents, and the idea that your personal life isn't important, but that what you achieve matters,"" she explained in her thick Slavic accent, only slightly softened by the years she has spent abroad. However, her ascetic approach to her craft has not stopped her from being the darling of the celebrity art circuit. She has danced with Jay Z in his music video, counts James Franco and Lady Gaga as loyal fans and friends, and was named as one of Time Magazine's most influential people of 2014. These mainstream accolades have led some critics to accuse Abramovic of losing her avant-garde edge, a judgment that doesn't seem to faze her: ""I stepped out of an art context into a much larger context, but if anything, I have become more radical. At my age I should be having a nice retrospective, go on holidays, but instead, I decided to push myself like never before and create art out of nothing, it's not easy you know,"" she says laughing. It takes less than 10 minutes in her company to see that for Abramovic, art and life are one thing. Even the act of breaking up with her lover and collaborator of many years Ulay was a performance -- they both walked the Great Wall of China from opposite directions, meeting for one final embrace in the middle. Her unconventional lifestyle has left little place for other people in her world, but you get the sense that the way she lives is less of a choice and more of a necessity: ""I wake up every day with so many ideas, and the desire to create is as strong as the need to breathe. For me, art is my cause,"" the formidable artist tells me. For those who have hoped to snap a selfie with the grand dame at her Serpentine show, bitter disappointment awaits -- Abramovic is asking her audience to leave their gadgets at home: ""I don't want people to blog or Tweet it without experiencing it. The now is the only reality we have in our lives,"" she says. It seems that at a time when the pace of life threatens to engulf us, Marina Abramovic wants us to slow down and live in the present.

"(CNN) -- Police were on Tuesday investigating the death of model and TV personality Peaches Geldof, the 25-year-old daughter of Irish musician and Live Aid organizer Bob Geldof and TV presenter Paula Yates. Geldof, who was just 11 when her mother died, was found at her home in Wrotham, Kent, southeast of London, on Monday. Officers were called ""following a report of concern for the welfare of a woman,"" a force spokesman told the Press Association. In a statement Kent police said that a post-mortem examination would be carried out in the next few days. ""At this stage, the death is being treated as an unexplained and sudden death,"" Kent police said. ""Officers are working to establish the circumstances around the death."" Bob Geldof released a statement saying his family is ""beyond pain."" ""She was the wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us,"" the statement reads. ""Writing 'was' destroys me afresh. ""What a beautiful child. How is this possible that we will not see her again? How is that bearable? We loved her and will cherish her forever."" The mother of two was a prolific poster on Twitter. Her last message Sunday included a photo of her as a child with her mother, captioned ""Me and my mum."" ""My beloved wife Peaches was adored by myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up with their mother in their hearts every day,"" husband Tom Cohen said in a statement. ""We shall love her forever."" She hosted the show ""OMG! Totally Peaches"" on Britain's ITV channel starting in 2011. The live show was based on Geldof and a panel helping viewers find solutions to their problems. A host of celebrities paid tribute. TV mogul Simon Cowell tweeted his condolences: ""The few times I met Peaches she was a sweet, funny warm person. Much love to her family she has left behind."" CNN presenter Myleene Klass said: ""The news of beautiful Peaches is utterly devastating, God bless her babies. RIP mama xxx."" Geldof was the second daughter of Yates, who rose to fame in the 1980s as presenter of music show ""The Tube."" She died from an heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41. Yates had divorced Boomtown Rats singer Bob Geldof in 1996 after starting a relationship with INXS frontman Michael Hutchence. But the following year Hutchence committed suicide in a hotel room in Sydney, Australia, and in 1998 Yates lost custody of the three daughters she had with Geldof -- Peaches, Pixie and Fifi. Bob Geldof later adopted Yates and Hutchence's daughter Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily. Peaches Geldof married rock musician Max Drummey but split in 2009 after just six months.

"(CNN) -- It was a classic match on tennis' grandest stage -- Sabine Lisicki upended Agnieszka Radwanska 9-7 in the third set at Wimbledon last year to reach her first grand slam final. But instead of being asked about turning points, forehands or backhands, the first three questions posed to Radwanska in the post-match press conference seemed to focus on the handshake. The reason? Radwanska, a Pole, merely stuck out a hand and didn't look at Lisicki, the German with Polish roots. She was more preoccupied with getting to her chair and off Centre Court. It reeked of bad sportsmanship, hardly a fitting farewell given the battle that had unfolded for nearly two-and-half hours. ""What could I do, just be there and dance?"" Radwanska said. ""I didn't feel like it at that point."" The handshake took up much of the post-match buzz, with tennis legend Martina Navratilova and retired grand slam champion Lindsay Davenport heavily criticizing the usually adored Radwanska. ""I couldn't believe it,"" Navratilova said in her role as a pundit for the BBC. ""I have never not looked my opponent in the eye after a match."" Brad Gilbert, the former top-five player and ex coach of Andre Agassi, Andy Murray and Andy Roddick, added in an interview with CNN: ""That was definitely two people, two taxis."" Tennis fans, journalists and even players will tell you they keep an eye on the handshake, especially when something contentious happens during the match. The handshake is mostly picked up by cameras -- and when it's not viewers aren't happy. In team sports such as football and American football, post-game handshakes and high fives don't command as much attention. ""We viewers invest two, three or more hours following the highs and lows of the two individuals involved,"" Tom Tebbutt, a longtime Canadian tennis journalist and broadcaster, wrote in his blog for Tennis Canada last year. ""The handshake, and the walk up to the handshake, is an integral part of a tennis match. It's the joy of victory and the agony of defeat, it's all the emotions of the competitors summed up in a final ritual gesture. And we want to see it all -- uninterrupted."" The handshake isn't mandatory but it's extremely rare for players not to partake in the ritual. One such occasion happened two years ago at the Australian Open, when 2010 Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych snubbed Spaniard Nicolas Almagro. Berdych felt Almagro purposely struck him with a forehand, a claim the latter denied. Berdych was loudly booed when he left the court. Marion Bartoli, the 2013 Wimbledon champion, refused to shake hands with French compatriot Virginie Razzano at Eastbourne in 2009 after Razzano accused her of gamesmanship. Murray told CNN the lack of a handshake in the Berdych-Almagro tie made for entertainment. Some would say what happened between Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic and Berdych's fellow Czech, Radek Stepanek, in the Davis Cup in 2012 could be classified as entertainment, too. Tipsarevic claimed Stepanek gave him the middle finger during the handshake. Most of the time Murray's handshake doesn't waiver. ""When you're on court, it's a confrontation, a battle in a way,"" said Murray. ""During certain matches players will earn your respect regardless of whether it's Roger (Federer), who is a great player, or someone that's ranked lower; if they play a great match against you or it's a young player that you think is really good."" Last year at the Australian Open, Federer appeared to swear at Murray during a five-set defeat but the Scot didn't think of not shaking hands. (Imagine the boos that would have rained down then.) ""There are certain things that happen in matches that when the match is done it doesn't necessarily influence how you feel about that person,"" said Murray. ""Things in the heat of the moment, you understand that things can be said. ""Sometimes it's literally two minutes for you to cool down after something like that happens. Sometimes it can take weeks or months before that relationship is resolved. ""I've not really had a problem with anyone once I'd finished the match."" Wayne Ferreira, twice a grand slam semifinalist and the man who held the record for most consecutive majors played in the Open Era prior to Federer, liked to send a message with his handshake. ""Win or lose, I gave the guy the hardest handshake I could,"" the retired South African told CNN. ""If I lost I gave him a hard handshake to tell him I'd be back the next time and if I won, to show him I was strong and played well. ""So for me I think it's important to show some strength in your handshake. If you go up and you've lost and you put a bad effort in the handshake it shows bad character."" The International Tennis Hall of Fame couldn't shed light on the origin of tennis handshakes. But it's known for certain that over the years, the type of handshake has changed, going from the traditional shake to the arm-wrestle or cup. ""There were a few handshakes early on but now it has just gone to the cups,"" Mahesh Bhupathi, a former doubles No. 1 whose 19-year career comes to an end at Wimbledon, told CNN. ""I think the cup is a little more personal. ""Before you would cup with your friends and do the handshake with the guys you're not that friendly with. Now it's just the cup all around."" Where did the 'cup' come from? Pam Shriver, a top-three player in both singles and doubles as part of a career that spanned the 1970s, 80s and 90s, recalled that Argentina's Gabriela Sabatini was among the first female players to employ the ""arm-wrestle"" shake. Now, players even hug at the net, with Novak Djokovic seemingly a particular fan of the hug. He once swapped shirts with an opponent football style -- Ivan Ljubicic -- post match at the net. ""The game is getting so much more physical,"" said tennis historian and journalist Joel Drucker. ""It could be headed for more hugs."" Shriver and Navratilova give the edge to the men when it comes to the better handshakes. ""We had plenty of cold handshakes in our day, men and women,"" said Shriver. ""In fact I think women led by Chrissie (Evert) and Martina may have done it better than the Johnny (McEnroe), Jimmy (Connors) and Ivan (Lendl) era. Today the men are leading the way in genuine sportsmanship. All the top men set a great example."" But the cold handshakes -- and the chatter they create -- probably won't ever disappear.","Handshakes in tennis captivate onlookers, especially when it's a contentious one .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A 40-year-old man accused of killing one and wounding five in a shooting at a business where he once worked was charged Friday with first-degree murder, police said. ""I'm just going through a tough time right now, I'm sorry,"" the 40-year-old suspect who had recently declared bankruptcy allegedly told police as he was taken into custody. Authorities identified the suspect as Jason Rodriguez, a former employee of Reynolds Smith & Hills, whose offices are located in the 16-story Gateway Center building. The incident began at 11:44 a.m., when Rodriguez entered the business' eighth-floor reception area, said Lt. Louis Tanzi, violent crimes section commander for the Orlando Police Department. ""He produced a handgun and started shooting in the reception area and continued shooting in the entire office area until he left,"" he told reporters. According to the charging affidavit, the fatality occurred when Rodriguez entered the suite, pulled a handgun from a holster under his shirt and shot twice at an employee who was standing near the receptionist's desk. He then entered a common work area ""firing multiple rounds and causing injuries to several other employees,"" it says, citing a witness. During the incident, Rodriguez ""was recognized by numerous former co-workers,"" it says. He then left in a car, described by witnesses as a small, silver compact vehicle, the affidavit says. Police went to his residence where they found a 2001 four-door silver Hyundai, it says. As police were disabling the car, Rodriguez appeared at the window of the residence, his hands in the air, and surrendered without incident, the affidavit says. Asked by a reporter why he allegedly committed the crime, Rodriguez, escorted by police, said, ""They left me to rot."" Paraded in front of reporters outside the police station, he said, ""Innocent."" Tanzi said he was ""very comfortable"" that authorities have the right man. ""We're positive; we have eyewitnesses who have identified him,"" he said, adding that Rodriguez will be facing other charges as well. Tanzi said other employees of the architectural and engineering firm where the attack occurred have described Rodriguez as a ""disgruntled former employee."" A company spokesman said Rodriguez had been let go from the company two years ago for ""performance issues."" Ken Jacobson, the chief financial officer and chief legal counsel for Reynolds, Smith & Hills, said that Rodriguez was hired as an ""engineer one,"" which he described as a ""beginning engineer."" ""His work performance was pretty deficient from the start,"" he said. ""We tried to work with his performance for 11 months and when he didn't improve, we let him go in June of 2007."" The company hadn't heard from him since -- until Friday's outburst, he said. ""So we can't make any sense of this,"" he said. The affidavit describes apparently conflicting reasons for his departure. Rodriguez told a detective that he had resigned from the company after five years there to get a better job, it says. But it adds, ""Rodriguez stated that people at RS&H, the Orlando Office, harassed him and threw him out for no reason at all, making it look like incompetency."" He told police that, after a year and a half of unemployment, he found work at a Subway Restaurant, but was not given enough hours so he filed for unemployment, according to the affidavit. ""Rodriguez felt the people at RS&H were hindering his efforts to obtain unemployment benefits,"" it adds. ""Rodriguez stated he was expecting an unemployment check but it did not come as expected. Rodriguez stated he felt he was forced into a situation where he could no longer provide for his family."" Tanzi said police recovered a firearm and had received ""limited cooperation"" from the suspect. The five wounded victims are all in stable condition, he said. iReport: See emergency crews on the scene in Orlando . Asked about the building's security system, he said it was typical of the city's office buildings with a security officer in the front and surveillance cameras. ""It's nothing elaborate,"" he said. Public records indicate that Rodriguez filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy last May and that the case was discharged in September. Four of the victims were being treated at Orlando Regional Medical Center, and one had gone into surgery, spokeswoman Katie Dagenais said. The fifth victim was at Florida Hospital, the hospital said.

"(CNN) -- The deficit and debt are major concerns for swing voters -- and President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney have very different visions of how to deal with it. That's why it was significant to see 80 CEOs of major American companies sign a letter this past week committing to press for a balanced bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit and debt no matter which candidate is elected president on November 6. The words ""balanced"" and ""bipartisan"" are key here -- because the CEOs understand that this problem is too big to be solved by tax hikes or spending cuts alone. We can't simply tax or cut our way out of this problem. Instead, the CEOs backed the outlines of the Bowles-Simpson commission, which attracted bipartisan support with its plan to cut spending, rein in entitlements and increase tax revenue through lower rates while closing loopholes and deductions. Their vision is also consistent with the plan proposed by the Gang of Six senators who came up with their own formula along the same broad outlines -- cut spending, bending the entitlement cost curve and raise tax revenue. Conservative and liberal senators running the ideological spectrum from Tom Coburn to Dick Durbin have managed to agree on this outline, buoyed by the heroic efforts of centrists like Mark Warner and Lamar Alexander, in addition to the bipartisan duo of Bowles and Simpson themselves. These individuals worked with the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and their Fix the Debt project to corral the CEOs' support. The CEOs in question include prominent Romney donors like AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, whose company gave a $4 million donation to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's conservative 501-C6 organization, which has already put more than $15 million into this election. What's surprising is that the CEOs' commitment to a balanced bipartisan plan puts them much closer to Obama's deficit reduction plan than to Mitt Romney's. That's because it also dovetails with the outlines of the Grand Bargain negotiated by Obama and House Speaker John Boehner in the summer of 2011, only to have negotiations fall apart. Mitt Romney has repeatedly and specifically said that he will not consider any plan that raises any increased tax revenue to pay down the deficit and the debt. During the Republican primaries, he famously joined with his competitors in raising his hand to say that he would reject even a 10-to-1 deal splitting spending cuts with tax revenue increases. The Bowles-Simpson plan was based on an even less generous 3-to-1 split (though of course, still weighted decidedly in favor of spending cuts). This is not an academic difference. It goes to the heart of what kind of deficit reduction can be realistically achieved as a matter of both politics and math. A plan that does not include any new revenues is not practical in terms of achieving the larger goal. ""When you talk about a $16 trillion debt, I don't see how you can avoid addressing both sides"" -- both spending cuts and revenue increases -- said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, sensibly. An imbalanced and ideologically pure solution without any revenue increases would be DOA with Democrats in the Senate. We all know the special-interest stumbling blocks -- liberal activists don't want to see entitlement reforms. They bitterly attacked Bowles-Simpson as ""the cat food commission."" Conservative activists and special interests refuse to consider any new tax revenue. But the truth is that we need both to find a sustainable solution to our deficit and debt problem. To pretend otherwise is a hyper-partisan fantasy. Romney's vice presidential nominee, Paul Ryan, is regarded as a serious deficit hawk, and he at least had the courage to put numbers to a budget plan he put forward in Congress. But his plan does not include any new tax revenue or cuts in defense spending -- which is why it does not balance the budget for three decades. And when Paul Ryan served on the Bowles-Simpson Commission, he shamefully refused to support its recommendations, along with his fellow Republican congressmen Dave Camp and Jeb Hensarling. Hensarling later went on to co-helm the failed super committee, which led to the $1.2 trillion in blunt sequestration cuts that now loom as part of the year-end ""fiscal cliff."" And while we're analyzing deficit reduction plans, in addition to a 20% across the board additional tax cut, the Romney budget also calls for increasing military spending to 4% of GDP, translating to an additional $2 trillion in federal spending over 10 years, which would erase all the stated cuts he has so far put forward on his campaign website. This aspect of Romney's plan is so politically driven and math-illiterate that Paul Ryan doesn't even like to acknowledge it on the campaign trail. Moreover, it's worth remembering that the politically convenient model of huge tax cuts and higher spending pursued by President George W. Bush and embraced by Republicans during his administration, turned Clinton-era surpluses into deficits. There's no question that Obama deserves a lot of criticism for not backing the Bowles-Simpson plan. His proposals have not been submitted as specific legislation and he failed to lead on entitlement reform, despite saying he knows it needs to be done. Congress has not passed a budget under his watch. Moreover, his attempts to boost the economy during the Great Recession with the stimulus package contributed to the growth of deficits and debt under his watch. That's why Romney clearly leads in the polls on this issue. But compared to European countries that opted for more severe austerity measures, America's economy is looking pretty good these days, featuring comparative stability, growth and reduced unemployment, no matter how slow. Bottom line, the CEOs' responsible call for a balanced bipartisan plan to reduce the U.S. deficit and the debt does not remotely look like what Romney has proposed to do as president. It does look a lot like the plans put forward by the Bowles-Simpson Commission, the Gang of Six, and outlines of the Grand Bargain, which Obama has said he would put forward again. It may sound counterintuitive, but according to the outlines established by the CEOs, Obama's reelection would actually be better for achieving long-term deficit reduction -- because he is the only candidate who has put forward a balanced bipartisan plan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: 80 U.S. CEOs signed letter seeking balanced, partisan plan to tame debt .
He says Mitt Romney has refused to consider a plan that includes revenue increases .
Avlon says the $16 trillion debt is too big to be tackled through spending cuts alone .

"(CNN) -- Russia's top diplomat chided the United Nations on Tuesday for rescinding an invitation to Iran to participate in talks aimed at ending the Syrian civil war, a move that raised questions about whether any agreement could be reached at the peace conference. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov put the blame squarely on U.N. members calling for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, saying those nations had forced the United Nations to un-invite Iran -- a leading Syrian ally -- to the talks in Switzerland. Lavrov called it a mistake, but ""not a catastrophe,"" adding that Russia and others will push for balanced talks between those representing al-Assad and the rebels. He pointed out that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, among others, recognized publicly that Iran is an important player in resolving the Syrian conflict. Could Syria 'torture photos' be a game-changer for peace talks? The topic was key in one-on-one talks between Lavrov and Kerry on Tuesday. The two met behind closed doors at the Fairmont Le Montreux Palace on the shores of Lake Geneva. That meeting was followed by another that included Kerry, Lavrov, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the U.N. special envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi. They all agreed on the significance of having representatives of the regime and the rebels at the negotiating table, according to a senior State Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The four also agreed on the importance of ""beginning the long process of negotiating a transitional governing body by mutual consent,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. Kerry also briefly joined a meeting between senior U.S. officials and representatives of the Syrian opposition coalition, according to the official. The peace talks also were front and center in a telephone call between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. The two discussed preparations for the talks, according to a statement released by the White House. A preliminary international session is scheduled for Wednesday in Montreux, with talks between the Syrian government and opposition delegations slated to begin Friday in Geneva. According to breaking news banners on Syrian state-run television, the plane transporting the Syrian government delegation to the peace talks was prevented from refueling at Athens International Airport in Greece after landing there Tuesday, despite having the necessary permits. Later, state TV said the government's delegation had landed in Geneva. Gruesome Syria photos may prove torture by Assad regime . 'Lack of courage' The last-minute invitation to Iran had threatened to derail the talks after the main Syrian opposition group and the United States opposed it. Louay Safi, a spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, said Iran's attendance would have been ""a deal breaker."" He told CNN that Ban ""did the right thing"" by withdrawing Iran's invitation. Iran, meanwhile, had already announced that it wouldn't be attending the peace conference because it would not tolerate any preconditions for joining the talks -- including acceptance of the framework laid out in a previous conference which foresees a transitional government. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the talks cannot be taken seriously without Iran. ""The thing that has happened with the withdrawal of the invitation to Iran, I believe that's unacceptable,"" Medvedev said in an exclusive interview to air Wednesday on CNN's Amanpour. ""Can someone think the Syrian problem can be seriously discussed without the Iranian factor and their account of it?"" Lavrov said Monday that Iran's absence from the list of countries invited to the talks would make the conference ""resemble something profane,"" according to Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Moscow has been a longstanding ally of the Syrian government. And Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Iran's state-run Fars News agency that he considered the situation to be unworthy of Ban. ""What disappoints us most is the lack of courage to state the real reason for the withdrawal of the invitation,"" he is quoted as saying, adding that the United Nations laid the fault at the door of Iranian officials. ""It is obvious that the United States and certain other groups who have the blood of the Syrian people on their hands have put pressure on Mr. Ban Ki-moon and forced him into doing this, and he had to justify his action."" Zarif said Ban had consulted with him several times and that Iran had made clear it would not accept any preconditions for the talks, and that it would ""consider any statement to the contrary by the Secretary-General as being false."" Iran out of peace conference on Syria . 'Deeply disappointed' Ban arrived in Switzerland on Tuesday. His spokesman, Martin Nesirky, told reporters Monday that Ban, who issued the invitation Sunday, believed he had Iran's assurance that it accepted the original Geneva declaration. ""The secretary-general is deeply disappointed by Iranian public statements today that are not at all consistent with that stated commitment,"" Nesirky said. The declaration ""remains the internationally agreed framework for ending the crisis,"" he said -- and without Iran's acceptance of it, this week's conference ""will proceed without Iran's participation,"" he added. 4 things to know about Syria . The goal of the talks is to set up a transitional government to help end the violence that has wracked the country. The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the revolt against al-Assad's government began in 2011. The first round of peace talks -- known as the Geneva I communiquÃ© -- calls for a transitional government and eventual free elections as part of a political settlement to end the war. Al-Assad has called for the conference to include a focus on ""fighting terrorism"" in Syria. Throughout the civil war, Syria has blamed violence on ""terrorists."" In a meeting with Syria's delegates to the talks, al-Assad directed them to preserve their nation's sovereignty by ""preventing and rejecting any foreign interference no matter its form and context,"" Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, reported Monday. Al-Assad also said no political solution could be reached without the agreement of the Syrian people and ""first and foremost the complete cessation of terrorism"" and its support by other countries, the news agency said. Syrian opposition votes to attend Geneva 2 peace talks . Outside backing . Western intelligence officials believe Iran has provided fighters, intelligence and communications to support al-Assad. In addition, fighters from the Iran-backed Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah have seen combat in Syria on the side of the government. Most outside support for rebel forces has come from the Persian Gulf monarchies of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. U.S. aid has been limited largely to nonlethal assistance such as communications gear and medical equipment, and American officials have struggled with how to back opposition groups without providing weapons to those linked to Islamic militants.

"(CNN) -- A delegation of painters and calligraphers, a group of Buddhists returning from a religious gathering in Kuala Lumpur, a three-generation family, nine senior travelers and five toddlers. Most of the 227 passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 were Chinese, according to the airline's flight manifest. The 12 missing crew members on the flight that disappeared early Saturday were Malaysian. Other passengers were from India, Indonesia, Australia, the United States, France, New Zealand, Ukraine, Canada, Russia and the Netherlands, the airline said. The airline's list showed the passengers hailed from 14 countries, but later it was learned that two people named on the manifest -- an Austrian and an Italian -- whose passports had been stolen were not aboard the plane. The plane was carrying five children under 5 years old, the airline said. On Saturday, Texas-based Freescale Semiconductor confirmed that 20 employees were passengers on Flight 370. Twelve are from Malaysia and eight from China, the company said. ""At present, we are solely focused on our employees and their families,"" Gregg Lowe, Freescale's president and CEO, said in the statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this tragic event."" First officer was transitioning to 777-200s . Later, the company tweeted: ""Your thoughtful words and prayers for Freescale families and friends affected by MH370 give comfort."" The company was making counselors available with around-the-clock support for employees affected by the tragedy, the statement said. The 154 passengers from China (including Taiwan) included a group of painters and calligraphers and Buddhists returning from a religious gathering, Chinese state media reported. Relatives of the Chinese citizens aboard gathered Saturday at a hotel complex in the Lido district of Beijing as a crowd of reporters gathered outside. ""My son was only 40 years old,"" one woman wailed as she was led inside. ""My son, my son. What am I going to do?"" Agonized families await answers . Family members were kept in a hotel conference room, where media outlets had no access. Most of the family members have so far refused to talk to reporters. An Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman said a man listed on the airline's manifest is safe and was never aboard the aircraft. The Austrian national's passport was stolen two years ago, Austrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Weiss said. Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Aldo Amati also said no one from his country was on the plane, even though an Italian was on the manifest. Malaysian officials said they were aware of reports the Italian's passport had been stolen, but had not confirmed that. U.S. nationals on the plane's manifest were identified by the airline as Philip Wood, 51; Nicole Meng, 4; and Yan Zhang, 2. A senior U.S. State Department official confirmed Saturday that three U.S. citizens were aboard the aircraft. Embassy officials were trying to determine whether additional U.S. citizens were on the flight. ""We extend our deepest condolences to the loved ones of those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""Officials from the U.S. Embassies in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing are in contact with the individuals' families. Out of respect for them, we are not providing additional information at this time."" Among them is Philip Wood, who graduated from Oklahoma Christian University in 1985 according to school spokeswoman Risa Forrester. He earned a bachelor of science degree, concentrating in math and computer science, and belonged to the Delta Gamma Sigma service organization, Forrester said. On Oklahoma Christian's Facebook page, one woman lamented the ""heartbreaking news"" while a man remembered Wood as ""gentle, kind, had great taste in music and was a wonderful artist.""

"(CNN) -- Beyonce isn't just one of the world's most influential people. She's also the world's most powerful celebrity, according to Forbes magazine. The publication has released its annual Celebrity 100 list and has named Queen Bey to the top spot. When you consider the year she's had, there's little reason to wonder why. After giving what many viewed as a virtually flawless performance at the 2013 Super Bowl Halftime Show, Beyonce hasn't paused, embarking on a grand global tour while also readying the release of her self-titled visual album, ""Beyonce."" When that disc arrived to fans' pleasant surprise in December 2013, the singer notched her fifth No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, and sparked a platinum hit with the lead single, ""Drunk in Love."" (Monica Lewinsky referenced the record when talking about her past with former President Bill Clinton.) And yet, as Forbes notes, Beyonce's empire isn't limited to the music business. While she's setting out on joint tours with her husband -- they're currently crossing the country with their ""On the Run"" trek -- Beyonce's also managing her clothing company, line of perfumes, and collaborations with brands like Pepsi and H&M. All told, Forbes estimates that Beyonce earned roughly $115 million between June 2013 and June 2014. By comparison, her husband made an estimated $60 million, enough to put him in sixth place behind Oprah Winfrey (No. 4 at $82 million) and Ellen DeGeneres (No. 5, at $70 million). So who's the person standing directly in Beyonce's shadow? That would be basketball star LeBron James, who arrived at No. 2 on Forbes' Celebrity 100 list, having made an estimated $72 million as of June 2014.","Forbes magazine names Beyonce the world's most powerful celebrity .

"(CNN) -- He was lauded and ridiculed. He broke down barriers and built them around himself. He soared to heights unimaginable with his music, and he made the ignominious front page of gutter tabloids worldwide. Michael Jackson broke down musical and cultural barriers his entire life. For Michael Jackson, the spotlight was always present, and the rest of the world followed. With ""Billie Jean"" and ""Beat It"" -- the latter with Eddie Van Halen's scorching guitar solo -- he was almost single-handedly responsible for getting videos by African-American artists on MTV and helped revitalize the moribund Top 40 format in the early 1980s. ""Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of color way before Tiger Woods, way before Oprah Winfrey, way before Barack Obama,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a friend. ""Michael did with music what they later did in sports, and in politics and in television. No controversy will erase the historic impact."" In Depth: Michael Jackson special report . ""Thriller,"" a 14-minute video extravaganza directed by John Landis, paved the way for the elaborate music videos to follow -- including Jackson's ""Scream,"" recorded with sister Janet in 1995, which cost a reported $7 million and may be the most expensive video ever.  Audio slide show: Michael Jackson and his music » . His incredible dance talent, a modern twist on the Motown moves he witnessed as a child, led to a heightened focus on choreography in pop music videos and stage shows. His 1982 album ""Thriller"" smashed records. It was No. 1 for 37 weeks and, at its peak, sold a million copies a week. To date, it has sold nearly 50 million copies worldwide. The achievement set a high bar for Jackson; when his 1995 greatest-hits CD, ""HIStory,"" sold 7 million copies, it was considered a relative failure. Jackson was also a fashion icon, his heavily zippered leather jackets a de rigueur 1980s fashion accessory, his single, spangled glove beyond compare. On the down side, Jackson also led in making pop stars the subject of the paparazzi and tabloids in a way, perhaps, equaled only by such icons as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and the pre-""Sgt. Pepper"" Beatles. Rumors abounded, from his pets to his sleeping habits to his cosmetic surgery, all fodder for the press. After stories arose of possible child molestation, he never got back in the media's good graces; he was treated as a traveling circus. Watch reaction to his death . From the time he was a child, it was obvious Michael Jackson was something special. In 1966, when he was 8, he joined his brothers in the band his father put together and started singing lead with brother Jermaine. Though Motown Records was the top label of the 1960s, inventing what it called ""the Sound of Young America,"" by 1969 -- when Jackson and his brothers in the Jackson 5 first hit the charts -- the label was finding itself out of step with the psychedelic and hard-soul sounds of the times.  Watch reaction from Motown » . Enter the quintet from Gary, Indiana. Motown signed the group in 1968 and poured its all into the Jackson 5's first single, ""I Want You Back"" -- the writing and production team were credited as ""The Corporation"" -- and Jackson's imploring, dramatic vocal rocked America. The song hit No. 1 in January 1970, and was followed by three more No. 1s in quick succession. Thanks to their squeaky-clean image, the Jackson 5 became teen idols, unusual for a group of African-American youngsters. Michael Jackson's face appeared on the covers of teen magazines; the band even became the subject of an animated Saturday-morning TV show, another first for an African-American group. But it was in the 1980s, when Jackson became a worldwide phenomenon, that his impact really began to be felt. He was much imitated, from his hair to his clothes to his dance moves. The music was superbly crafted pop, produced by Quincy Jones and often written by Jackson himself. Even rock critics approved; the album ""Thriller"" earned an A from the picky Robert Christgau, among others.  Watch a clip from ""Thriller"" » . There came a moment, around that time, when pop music went into a Jackson era. ""Thriller"" had nine songs; seven of them became singles. Jackson teamed with Lionel Richie to write the fundraising song ""We Are the World""; it was his presence, as much as that of Richie, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder, that propelled the song to No. 1. Jackson reteamed with his brothers for an album, ""Destiny,"" and accompanying tour. It was the hottest tour of the year, despite complaints about sales practices. (Partly because of the controversy, Jackson announced publicly he was donating all his money from the tour to charity.) He was a role model. At the peak of his fame, there were reports of a humbly dressed Jackson ringing doorbells as part of his Jehovah's Witness faith. Though Jackson's image eventually became sullied by the molestation allegations and stories of eccentricity, there was never any doubt about his entertainment legacy. ""Thriller"" and ""Bad"" are still among the top sellers of all time. His fluid dance moves and stage presence set standards that rising stars -- often compared to Jackson -- struggle to equal. ""Of all the thousands of entertainers I have worked with, Michael was the most outstanding. Many have tried and will try to copy him, but his talent will never be matched. He was truly one-of-a-kind,"" said Dick Clark, who would know.  Watch reaction from another musical legend, Cher » . And then there's the music, from the early, explosive joy of the Jackson 5 hits to the elegant ballads, down-and-dirty grooves and ecstatic dance hits of his solo years. ""The Love You Save,"" ""Billie Jean,"" ""Beat It,"" ""Bad"" -- they are pop music boiled down to its best essence, with a good beat, an engrossing melody and even, sometimes, a message of love and fellowship. It's enough to take a listener to the moon.","Michael Jackson was a towering figure in entertainment .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United States vetoed Friday a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have declared Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said that while the United States agrees about ""the folly and illegitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity, we think it unwise for this council to attempt to resolve the core issues that divide Israelis and Palestinians."" The veto is the first to be used under the Obama administration. Ambassador Riyad Mansour, the permanent observer of Palestine to the United Nations, objected to the veto in a statement following the vote. ""The proper message that should have been sent by the Security Council to Israel, the occupying power, is that its contempt of international law and the international community will no longer be tolerated,"" he said. ""We fear, however, that the message sent today may be one that only encourages further Israeli intransigence and impunity. This must be remedied."" Rice noted conversations in recent days between U.S. and Palestinian leaders in an attempt to compromise on the issue of Israeli settlements. ""In recent days, we offered a constructive alternative course that we believe would have allowed the council to act unanimously to support the pursuit of peace,"" she said. ""We regret that this effort was not successful and thus is no longer viable."" Israel praised the veto, saying in a statement that the decision ""contributes to the resumption of the diplomatic process and (it) regrets that the other Security Council members have refrained from making the same contribution."" U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday called Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the resolution and speak about alternatives to a Security Council vote, according to a diplomatic source. Among the options that had been floated, American and Palestinian officials said, was the issuance of a Security Council presidential statement, which is weaker than an actual resolution. Obama told Abbas that if he didn't withdraw the resolution, it would put the United States in an awkward position and that U.S.-Palestinian relations would suffer as a result, the source said. ""Well, there were attempts at persuasion, (but) let me put it politely: We are even more persuaded by the rights of the Palestinian people,"" said Hanan Ashrawi, a veteran Palestinian legislator and Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee member. ""We are more committed to international law and to the requirements of peace, and all these require that settlement activity should stop and that the Security Council should take a resolution condemning all settlement activities as being illegal and as being in direct contradiction of the requirement of peace."" The PLO met Friday and decided to move forward with the vote, the diplomatic source said, adding that Abbas felt that at a time when so many leaders are either being toppled or facing massive protests, it would make him look weak if he opted for an alternative course. The Palestinian territories have not had the kinds of demonstrations seen in many Arab countries, but the Fatah leaders of the Palestinian Authority have been under criticism since Al-Jazeera published secret papers claiming to reveal that Palestinian officials were prepared to make wide-ranging concessions in negotiations with Israel. The Obama administration has been critical of Israeli settlement construction but has not gone as far as to call it ""illegal."" Rice reaffirmed the U.S. stance Friday, saying after the vote that Friday's veto should not be ""misunderstood to mean we support settlement activity."" ""On the contrary, we reject in the strongest terms the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlement activity,"" she said. Since the breakdown of American-brokered talks with Israel in September over the issue of settlements, the Palestinian Authority has been pursuing a policy aimed at unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state by September based on borders from 1967 and in recent months has won recognition from a number of South American countries. The United States and Israel oppose the unilateral efforts, insisting that all issues in the conflict must be dealt with through direct negotiations. Following the vote, Israel joined the United States in once again calling for direct negotiations. ""Only thus, and not through seizing the Security Council, will it be possible to advance the peace process so as to benefit both parties and to serve the cause of peace and security throughout the region,"" said a statement released by Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee also praised the veto, saying the action prevented ""another one-sided, anti-Israeli resolution from being enacted by the U.N. Security Council.""

"(CNN) -- Well, it was big. The Michael Jackson memorial service, where daughter Paris spoke briefly, was a big draw on TV and online. The biggest ever? Probably not. Tuesday's memorial service for Michael Jackson was expected to set some high marks for viewership -- and it did. But, based on information gathered by various meter-readers, it was no moon landing or Princess Diana funeral -- events whose audiences, by some reckonings, pushed 1 billion viewers. In the United States, the Jackson memorial aired during the late morning and afternoon, when most people are working. Nielsen, the television ratings service, said that 31.1 million watched: not as many as the Obama inauguration (38 million) but more than the 2009 ""American Idol"" finale (28.8 million). In all or in part, the program was aired on 19 U.S. television networks. In Europe, where the show aired in prime time, the memorial service also did well. The BBC reported that 5.2 million people watched the show on the network BBC2, and 2 million more watched on the British networks Five and Sky News. The service also aired on channels in Germany, France, Australia and Japan, testifying to the King of Pop's worldwide reach. But it was the Internet where the Jackson memorial really hit the heights. Global Web traffic ranged from 19 percent to 33 percent above normal during the event, according to Internet monitoring firm Akamai Technologies. CNN.com reported 9.7 million live video streams between midnight and 5 p.m. PT, as well as 81 million page views, according to internal data. Yahoo News had 5 million live video streams, according to the publication Media Life. The publication also reported that FoxNews.com and MSNBC.com combined for 6.4 million video streams. Anecdotally, Jackson also fared well. Jackson-related topics were highly ranked on Twitter, Google Trends and Alexa. Facebook, which partnered with CNN.com to let friends and family share commentary during the service, reported 800,000 status updates by 1 million users. The Obama inauguration, by contrast, had 600,000 status updates during the event, though there were 1.5 million for the day of the inauguration, according to TechCrunch. Jackson does outrank the president as the most popular person on Facebook, with 7.7 million fans, versus 6.4 million for Obama. In Los Angeles, the Jackson memorial proved to be less of a draw than locals had hoped -- or feared. Though the city staffed the area around the Staples Center, where the memorial was held, with 3,000 police officers -- 1,000 more than had been on hand for the Los Angeles Lakers' victory parade -- the crowd without tickets may have numbered in the thousands, according to unofficial estimates, and not the hundreds of thousands that had been feared. Even inside the memorial, which was held at the Staples Center and the adjacent Nokia Theatre, not every seat of the 20,000 available appeared to be taken, according to CNN observations. The Jackson memorial also drew hundreds of fans, respectively, to gatherings in New York's Times Square, Detroit's Motown Historical Museum, London's O2 Arena and a Tokyo Tower Records store. Jackson is still reigning on the music charts. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the singer had the two best-selling albums in the United States last week -- ""Thriller"" and ""Number Ones"" -- and 13 of the top 20 catalog albums. On iTunes, he has four of the top 10 songs on iTunes and four of the top 10 albums. Finally, where there's a big event, there's at least a little money to be made off the spectacle. At the Staples Center on Tuesday, vendors sold Michael Jackson T-shirts, artwork, decals and even beverages. For the real spectacle, though, one must turn to eBay, where there were at least 50,000 Michael Jackson-related items up for auction as of Wednesday afternoon. Among them: 1984 Topps trading cards ($15.50), official memorial service programs (from $2.99 to at least $10,000, some with wristbands and tickets) and even Web domain names -- one of which, MichaelJacksonForestLawnCemetery.com, can be yours for $650,000. The Jackson magic may have been dominant Tuesday, but someone is obviously expecting it to continue for quite some time longer.","Michael Jackson memorial watched by 31.1 million in U.S.

"(CNN) -- Ten years after the fall of Saddam Hussein, Iraq remains ""enmeshed in a grim cycle of human rights abuses,"" Amnesty International said in a report Monday. ""Many Iraqis today enjoy greater freedoms than they did under his Ba'athist regime, but the fundamental human rights gains that should have been achieved during the past decade have signally failed to materialize,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Middle East and North Africa deputy director at Amnesty International. Attacks on civilians, the torture of detainees and unfair trials permeate the country, Amnesty International said. The report said government forces commit torture with impunity, especially against those arrested on suspicion of carrying out terrorism acts. There was no immediate reaction from the Iraqi government. Methods of torture . Methods of torture reported by detainees include electric shocks; including to the genitals; partial suffocation with a bag placed tightly over the head; beatings while suspended in contorted positions; and the deprivation of food, water and sleep, Amnesty said. ""Detainees have alleged that they were tortured to force them to 'confess' to serious crimes or to incriminate others while held in these conditions,"" the group said. ""Many have repudiated their confessions at trial only to see the courts admit them as evidence of their guilt, without investigating their torture allegations, sentencing them to long term imprisonment or death."" 129 hangings . Such death sentences contribute to one of the highest execution rates in the world, Amnesty said. Last year, 129 Iraqi prisoners were hanged. ""Death sentences and executions are being used on a horrendous scale,"" Sahraoui said. ""It is particularly abhorrent that many prisoners have been sentenced to death after unfair trials and on the basis of confessions they say they were forced to make under torture."" Amnesty International opposes the death penalty worldwide. Sectarian strife . Sectarian strife also continues to plague the country, where Shiite Muslims dominate the central government. Thousands of demonstrators in Sunni-dominated areas have protested the arbitrary detention and abuse of detainees, Amnesty said. The protesters also denounced what they say is government discrimination against the Sunni population. Sunni armed groups, meanwhile, continue to attack not only government targets but also Shiite civilians, including religious pilgrims, the group said. Last month, Iraq's top judicial committee accused Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi's security detail of carrying out 150 attacks against security forces and civilians between 2005 and 2011. Al-Hashimi denied those allegations, saying they are politically motivated. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion in Iraq. The country has struggled to define itself, even after U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq at the end of 2011. Violence has dropped dramatically But insurgent attacks against civilians and security forces persist. Many areas are still smoldering with sectarian tension and political infighting.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Nearly 3,900 people, including about 540 children, are believed to have died from the H1N1 flu in the first six months of the epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. The figure is a sharp increase from previous counts of laboratory-confirmed cases. But Dr. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the estimate gives a ""more accurate picture"" of the scale of the pandemic. The figure was based on a detailed analysis of data from several dozen districts around the country, she said. The method used to calculate the mortality figures is similar to that used to produce estimates of ordinary seasonal flu deaths, which are believed to number about 36,000 a year. An estimated 22 million people in the United States have contracted the virus, commonly known as swine flu, resulting in about 98,000 hospitalizations through October 17, Schuchat said. Among children under 18, about 8 million are believed to have been sickened, 36,000 have been hospitalized and 540 have died, a much higher number than the 129 laboratory-confirmed child deaths the CDC reported November 6. About 12 million adults up to age 64 had been reported ill, with 53,000 hospitalizations in that age group and 2,900 deaths. People over age 65 accounted for 2 million illnesses, 9,000 hospitalizations and 440 deaths, Schuchat said. The prevalence of flu cases is higher than at any time since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, she said, but the death rate is ""nowhere near the severity of the 1918 pandemic."" Schuchat said 41.6 million doses of H1N1 vaccine are now available, up from 38 million last week, but ""not as much as we'd hoped to have by today."" She told reporters last week that about 8 million new doses were expected this week. The Department of Health and Human Services has ordered 75 million doses of swine flu vaccine for delivery by year's end, and the CDC had predicted that 40 million doses would be available by the end of October. Production delays have hampered agency plans, and the lag has led to criticism of the program. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday found Americans are starting to lose confidence in the government's ability to prevent a nationwide epidemic, though a narrow majority continue to say that the government and private industry will eventually produce enough of the vaccine to inoculate everyone who wants it.","About 540 children are among the 3,900 H1N1 flu deaths, the CDC said .

"(CNN) -- New Zealanders Danica and Paul Weeks are no strangers to disaster. The couple's eldest son, Lincoln, was born in the midst of an earthquake in Christchurch in 2010. Just over three years later, in December 2013, they were in a car accident after moving to Australia. So when Paul left for a mining job in Mongolia earlier this month, the couple took precautions, Danica says. Paul couldn't wear his wedding ring on the mine site so he left it, and his watch, at home with instructions to pass them on to his two sons, ""should anything happen"" to him. On his way to Mongolia, Paul traveled on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. As she speaks to CNN's Piers Morgan on Thursday, Danica grips her husband's wedding ring while fighting back tears. It's been five days since MH370 vanished, but with little information about the plane's whereabouts the wait feels like an eternity. ""That's the toughest part every day -- waking up and looking on the news and seeing that there's nothing; and there are no calls from Malaysia to say 'we've found something,'"" Weeks says. ""He was the most amazing husband and the most amazing father. He spent so much time with his kids,"" she says. Approximately 5,000 miles away, at a hotel near the Beijing Capital International Airport, Hu Xianquan waits anxiously for news of her husband, Mao Tugui. The couple last spoke on March 2 when Mao, a painter, was about to board a flight to Malaysia to attend an exhibition of his work. For Hu, like many families of those on board Flight 370, grief is quickly turning to frustration. There has been no word of her husband for days and confusing reports about the search and rescue mission are only making the wait more agonizing. ""No one really updates us,"" she says. Questions and answers . While many Chinese relatives of passengers on board Flight 370 began traveling to Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, Hu and her daughter decided to stay in Beijing, concerned that the language barrier would only make it more difficult to understand what was happening. Malaysia Airlines offered to transfer Chinese and Indian relatives of missing passengers to Kuala Lumpur for ""better care and comfort,"" but some have declined. ""I don't see the point in going to Kuala Lumpur and seeing the same information,"" K. S. Narendran tells CNN from India. His wife Chandrika Sharma was on the flight. ""It's better to stay in Chennai where I'm surrounded by family and friends."" Sharma, the executive secretary of the International Collective in Support of Fishworkers, had been on her way to Mongolia for a conference of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. Her husband says he's received little direct assistance or information from authorities about the search operation and relies on press conferences and news reports, but ""that has thus far amounted to nothing."" See more of our coverage on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 . Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak has appealed to relatives to be patient. ""The families involved have to understand that this is something unexpected. The families must understand more efforts have been made with all our capabilities,"" he said Wednesday. More than half the passengers on board Flight 370 were Chinese. Martial arts expert and stunt man Ju Kun was among them. The 35-year-old, whose film credits include ""The Grandmaster"" and ""The Forbidden Kingdom,"" was set to begin filming a new Netflix series ""Marco Polo"" in the coming weeks. Netflix and its production partner The Weinstein Company said in a statement that they were deeply saddened by the news. ""Ju Kun, who was on board, was an integral part of our production team and a tremendous talent. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time,"" the statement said. Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi posted a tribute to Ju on her Weibo account: ""He is a sincere, kind and hardworking man."" Like many of those on board Flight 370, Ju's social media account has been flooded with comments from strangers, many praying for his safe return. Around the world, communities have gathered to pray for the missing and offer comfort to their loved ones. On Monday, Malaysians sang songs and lit paper lanterns at a candlelight vigil in Kuala Lumpur. Crowdsourcing the search . In nearby Petaling Jaya, members of the St. Francis Xavier Church have been holding special prayer sessions for Patrick Francis Gomes, an in-flight supervisor who was on board the flight. ""It's still difficult for us to come to terms with what has happen. I can only say that my father is a quiet person but also can be a joker,"" his daughter Nikki Gomes told CNN. ""He is very dedicated to his job and took his responsibilities very seriously as all crew members would."" Malaysia Airlines will retire flight codes MH370 and MH371 as a mark of respect to the passengers and crew, the company said in a statement Thursday. Many have turned to digital platforms to offer comforting words, and tribute sites have been created for the flight's captain and crew. A Facebook profile thought to be that of Pouria Nour Mohammadi, an 18-year-old Iranian who used a stolen passport to board the plane, has scores of messages of support from strangers. ""I don't know you but I pray that you are safe somewhere in this world,"" writes one user. ""May you and the other passengers and crew on Malaysian flight 370, be found safe and may your journey continue to find yourself safe in your mothers [sic] arms again."" Back in China, Huang Lu, a teacher at an elementary school in Guizhou province, waits for word of her friend, Huang Yi. The 30-year-old works for the technology firm Freescale in the company's Tianjin office. She was on the plane with 19 other colleagues when it disappeared. The women have been friends since they were teenagers. ""She's kind, lively and a good person to talk with,"" Huang Lu said. The pair kept in touch online. Yi, who has a five-year old daughter named Yuanyuan, would often talk to Huang Lu about family and raising children. ""I've been waiting, worried since I heard the news. I hope to see a miracle. Yi, please come back, Yuanyuan needs you,"" she said. INTERACTIVE: What happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370? Dayu Zhang and Serena Dong reported from Beijing; Sophie Brown wrote from Hong Kong.

"Moscow (CNN) -- As the Bolshoi Ballet's artistic director Sergei Filin entered the security code of his Moscow apartment, a masked assailant tossed sulfuric acid onto his face, temporarily blinding him and leaving him with severe burns. A Russian police investigation led to the arrests of three people: an alleged assailant, a getaway driver and a Bolshoi dancer who they say had a ""hostile relationship"" with Filin and confessed to ordering the January attack. Investigators say they've solved the case and the company's traumatized dancers are getting on with their jobs of rehearsing and staging productions. But this world famous institution is still very much in a state of crisis. It's being torn apart from within as two men battle fiercely to control it. The opponents are very different people. Anatoly Iksanov is a long-serving bureaucrat. He's been general director of the Bolshoi Theater for more than 12 years. Nikolai Tsiskaridze is one of the Bolshoi's principal dancers and a superstar of the ballet world. Tsiskaridze says he is fighting for his job and the future of the Bolshoi. The bitterness between these men became very public in January after the acid attack on Filin. Police investigating the attack always suspected the attack was connected to his work. It's no secret that Tsiskaridze and Filin do not get along and Tsiskaridze was interviewed. But another dancer -- Pavel Dmitrichenko -- was arrested. Read more: Russia's Bolshoi Ballet director may lose sight after acid attack . Dmitrichenko has confessed to organizing the attack but says Filin was only supposed to be beaten and that he was shocked when he heard about the acid. Iksanov, the general director, says the attack is the result of a lawless atmosphere within the dance company he says has been created by Tsiskaridze. But Tsiskaridze says Iksanov has been trying to get rid of him ever since he criticized the Bolshoi Theater's $760 million renovation. He says as one of the theater's most famous artists he has been able to speak without restraint and that if he were to be fired no-one in the theater would have a voice. ""It means evil will completely win."" Read more: Bolshoi Ballet 'villain' arrested in director's acid attack . Tsiskaridze says there has been an attempt to create a public perception that he was somehow involved in the criminal case, despite investigators not linking him to the attack. ""Three days after the tragedy, the general director himself suddenly made a statement claiming that I allegedly had nothing to do with all this -- just so that my name would be sounded,"" he said. Tsiskaridze says other dancers were asked to sign a letter against him and that his students are punished by being overlooked for important parts. The dancer appeared in court Friday in an attempt to have two official employment warnings overturned. He had received them for giving two media interviews without the theater's permission. His lawyer, Svetlana Volodina, confirmed to CNN that the court overturned one of the warnings but ruled that the other should stay in place. She said they would appeal after reading the full written judgment. Read more: Bolshoi prima ballerina's grace under pressure . Speaking to CNN ahead of the hearing, Tsiskaridze said the Bolshoi was not ""a secret organization"" and that he was entitled to his opinion -- which is that President Vladimir Putin should step in to settle the dispute -- and fire Iksanov. Tsiskaridze says he's ready to take up the job of director general himself, if he's asked. ""The president himself should get involved because the president is the face of the country. This is a flagship of Russian art. A bureaucrat with no musical education cannot be allowed to get even with a dancer,"" he said. ""This is primarily causing enormous damage to the reputation of the country."" However, Iksanov dismisses Tsiskaridze's allegations and says he's not ready to leave the Bolshoi. ""If Tsiskaridze thinks he can help the theater that's his personal matter. I don't think he can -- because you need a few more qualities than just scandal and fame."" Both men are said to have support from different factions within the government, but so far President Putin hasn't declared any view on the rivalries, which are steadily tearing away at the credibility of one of Russia's most iconic international brands.","An attack on Bolshoi Theater's artistic director has put the institution in the spotlight .

"CNN -- Singer Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson ""kind of drifted apart,"" but there was ""no big bust-up"" after Jackson bought the Beatles song catalog, McCartney told David Letterman Wednesday. Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson in 1983. McCartney said Jackson will be missed. McCartney appeared on ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" to talk about his forthcoming concert at New York's Citi Field, the Beatles' 1964 appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" -- taped in the same theater -- and his relationship with Jackson. McCartney said the pair ""fell apart"" after Jackson secured rights to the Beatles catalog in 1985. Jackson outbid McCartney -- paying $47.5 million for it -- and then sold it to Sony Music for $95 million in 1995 while maintaining a 50 percent controlling interest. The relationship fizzled when McCartney asked for ""a raise"" from Jackson, to which Jackson -- in McCartney's word -- ""blanked"" the former Beatle and said, ""That's just business, Paul,"" McCartney said. ""We've never kind of got to it, and I thought 'hmmm,' so we kind of drifted apart,"" said McCartney. ""There was no big bust-up."" ""He was a lovely man, massively talented, and we miss him,"" McCartney said. McCartney and Jackson collaborated on the songs ""Say Say Say"" and ""The Girl is Mine,"" both released in the early 1980s. McCartney's appearance on Letterman marked the first time he'd returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater for a broadcast network show since the Beatles made their stateside debut there in 1964.

"(CNN) -- The number of undocumented children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border by themselves has ""increased substantially,"" causing the Department of Homeland Security to declare a ""crisis"" and open a temporary emergency shelter for the youths, a spokeswoman said Monday. In the past two weeks, more than 1,000 children were apprehended while illegally crossing the border, officials said, straining facilities for Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services. The majority of the minors were apprehended at the border in South Texas, near McAllen. They primarily traveled from Central America, including Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, according to Marsha Catron, a spokeswoman for Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. More than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles are expected to cross in 2014, said Chris Cabrera, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council in the Rio Grande Valley, a U.S. Border Patrol workers' union. ""We are seeing numbers that we've never seen before in this part of the country,"" Cabrera said. ""Yesterday, we had 60 minors in one station alone. You're talking kids from 17 years old, on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old, traveling by themselves."" Last year, roughly 10% of people caught by Border Patrol agents were minors, according to a Border Patrol official. ""Secretary Johnson is sending additional staff to South Texas to coordinate DHS and interagency efforts to meet the immediate needs of the migrants, including medical care ... and to address other processing and enforcement concerns,"" Catron said. Part of the plan under the ""Level 4 condition of readiness"" is an emergency shelter that opened over the weekend at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and can accommodate up to 1,000 children, officials said. The law prohibits Homeland Security from immediately deporting the children if they are not from Canada or Mexico. Instead, the children are turned over to Health and Human Services supervision ""within 72 hours of DHS taking them into custody,"" an official said. ""Most of the time, they're getting released to relatives in the U.S.,"" Cabrera said. ""There's nowhere to put them, so they're released on their own recognizance and have a pending court date. I'd say between 95 and 97% of adults or youths don't show up for court,"" he said. Although children crossing the border alone has long been an issue, the recent spike could be attributed to better weather or an increase in poor economic conditions in their home countries, officials said. Others simply want to be reunited with their parents, who may have left them with relatives in their native countries. Children make the arduous trek from Central America across Mexico by train or with the help of smugglers called ""coyotes,"" officials said. Most often, the youths from Mexico and Central America try to cross the border in the Rio Grande Valley because it is the southernmost point of the United States for them to cross. ""People that live north have no idea what's going on down here, and if they did, they would be appalled by what the government is letting happen,"" Cabrera said. ""It's resources. I understand we're in a fiscal crunch nationwide, but this is not a problem that we can fix for free. I know the official line is that we're at 70% apprehension, but it's really more like 30%. There's a strain on manpower,"" he added. The deadliest trip in America? Perilous desert trek can end in deportation or death .

"(CNN) -- A friend of accused Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is expected to plead guilty Thursday to charges in connection with removing a backpack and computer from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the Boston Marathon bombing. Dias Kadyrbayev will be changing his plea in a federal courtroom Thursday, his lawyer, Robert Stahl, told CNN, adding that he'll have more to say after the hearing. The charges stem from actions after bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. Three people were killed and more than 200 were injured. Kadyrbayev is charged with four counts including obstructing justice and conspiracy for allegedly throwing Tsarnaev's backpack into a dumpster after discovering it contained fireworks with gunpowder, and removing a jar of Vaseline and a computer thumb drive. The backpack was later recovered at a landfill by investigators. Kadrybayev, a Kazakh national, also allegedly took Tsarnaev's computer to his off-campus apartment, where the FBI later seized it. In July, Kadyrbayev's roommate Azamat Tazhayakov was convicted of conspiracy and obstruction charges in the same case and has filed an appeal. He faces up to 25 years in prison at his sentencing in October. In that case, prosecutors told jurors Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers -- Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev: ""i think they got his brother,"" hours before the public knew their names or their relationship to one another. The friends recognized the Tsarnaev brothers after authorities released video and still photos asking for the public's helping finding the two men in the aftermath of the bombings, prosecutors said. Kadyrbayev told his friends that he believed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ""used the Vaseline 'to make bombs,' or words to that effect,"" an indictment against him reads. The government said Tsarnaev texted Kadyrbayev after the bombings and told him he could go to his dorm room and take what he wanted. Kadyrbayev showed that text to Tazhayakov, the government alleged.

"(CNN) -- The White House is sending three officials to Michael Brown's funeral Monday, including one who attended high school with his mother. Brown,18, was fatally shot on August 9 by officer Darren Wilson while walking down the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. His death sparked days of violent protests in the St. Louis suburb. In the past three days, things have calmed down, and the town is slowly coming back to life. The officials attending the funeral are Broderick Johnson, who leads the White House's My Brother's Keeper Task Force. He'll be joined by Marlon Marshall, a St. Louis native who attended high school with Brown's mother, and Heather Foster. Both Marshall and Foster are part of the White House Office of Public Engagement. Brown will be eulogized at the Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis. Race tensions . Two weeks after the shooting sparked violent protests, the mood turned more tranquil Saturday with smaller crowds and lots of music. Gone were police in riot gear glaring at defiant protesters. The tear gas, rubber bullets and Molotov cocktails were nowhere to be seen, either. In their place were clusters of officers, hanging around businesses, chatting with one another. Race has been at the forefront of the tensions; Brown was African-American and the officer who shot him is white. St. Louis authorities released details of the racial and gender makeup of the grand jury, which started hearing testimony on Wednesday. It comprises six white men, three white women, two black women and one black man, said Paul Fox, the administrator for the St. Louis County Circuit Court. St. Louis County is 70% white and 24% black, according to last year's estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau. Crucial grand jury . Unlike a jury in a criminal case, which convicts someone if jurors are convinced of guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt,"" a grand jury decides whether there is ""probable cause."" They decide whether to charge someone with a crime based on testimony and evidence presented in the absence of a judge. In Missouri, they don't have to be in unanimous agreement to press such an indictment, as long as nine of the 12 agree on a charge. The federal government is conducting a separate investigation. FBI agents interviewed more than 200 people as part of the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights investigation, according to law enforcement sources. The federal probe must prove there was an element of ""racial hostility"" in the shooting. That's a higher standard than the one before the St. Louis County grand jury. The 12 members of the grand jury are crucial. They may be the first to reach a decision on whether the case will be defined as a murder charge, a lesser charge or no charge at all.","One of the White House officials attended high school with Brown's mother .

"(CNN) -- The United States is likely to remain the leading world power in 2030 but won't hold the kind of sway it did in the past century, according to a new study by the U.S. intelligence community. Washington will most likely hold its status as ""first among equals"" two decades from now, buoyed not only by military strength but by economic and diplomatic power. That's one of the conclusions of ""Alternative Worlds,"" released Monday by the National Intelligence Council. China and other rising powers may be ""ambivalent and even resentful"" of American leadership, but they're more interested in holding positions of influence in organizations such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund than assuming that role, the report found. ""Nevertheless, with the rapid rise of other countries, the 'unipolar moment' is over, and 'Pax Americana' -- the era of American ascendancy in international politics that began in 1945 -- is fast winding down,"" the report states. Monday's 166-page report is the fifth in the ""Global Trends 2030"" series by the council, an arm of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It doesn't make specific predictions, but says that the world is at a ""critical juncture"" in which technology is advancing, competition for resources is growing and a middle class is emerging in countries around the world. ""Our effort is to encourage decision makers -- whether in government or outside -- to think and plan for the long term so that negative futures do not occur and positive ones have a better chance of unfolding,"" council Chairman Christopher Kojm wrote in the report's preface. The report lays out a series of possible futures, both optimistic and pessimistic, from a world in which globalization has stalled and the risk of war has gone up to one in which collaboration between Washington and Beijing produces a rapid increase in worldwide prosperity. Technological advances will give individuals more freedom, but also have the potential to provide small groups with the kind of destructive capabilities now available only to nations. ""With more widespread access to lethal and destructive technologies, individuals who are experts in such key areas as cyber systems might sell their services to the highest bidder,"" Kojm said during a briefing on the report. ""Terrorists might focus less on mass casualties and more on causing widespread economic and financial disruptions."" Economic power is likely to shift away from the United States and Europe to China, India and Southeast Asian countries, and Africa will see an urban boom as people move to cities at a faster rate, the report concludes. But those developments will add pressure to deal with environmental issues such as more frequent or severe droughts and the projected rise in sea levels due to a warming climate. ""Under most scenarios -- except the most dire -- significant strides in reducing extreme poverty will be achieved by 2030,"" the report notes. The numbers of people living in poverty is likely to drop sharply in East and South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, with sub-Saharan Africa lagging behind. Kojm said, ""economic growth, the rise of the global middle class, greater educational obtainment and better health care mean -- for the first time in human history -- the majority of the world's population will no longer be impoverished."" But perhaps the biggest question mark in the report is the Middle East. The region ""will be a very different place"" in 2030, the authors conclude. ""But the possibilities run a wide gamut from fragile growth and development to chronic instability and potential regional conflicts."" The youth boom that has driven the Arab Spring revolts will give way to an aging population, while shifts in energy consumption may force oil-rich Middle Eastern economies to find new sources of income. The growth of middle classes will increase demand for political and social change, but that could be a mixed blessing: ""Historically, the rise of middle classes has led to populism and dictatorships as well as pressures for greater democracy,"" the authors noted. Meanwhile, that global growth ""disguises growing pressures on the middle class in Western economies,"" including international competition for higher-skilled jobs. The growing middle class will also increase demand for water and food by more than 35% over the next couple of decades the report indicates. Advancements in key technologies such as genetically modified crops, precision agriculture and water irrigation techniques should for the most part prevent scarcity. An increase in the earning power, education and political clout of women ""will be a key driver of success for many countries,"" with gender gaps closing fastest in East Asia and Latin America, the report found. And India is likely to be in the same position in 2030 that China is today, it concludes. ""India's rate of economic growth is likely to rise while China's slows,"" the authors found. China's 8%-10% growth ""will probably be a distant memory by 2030,"" it notes. And India's economic advantage over regional nuclear rival Pakistan is likely to grow, roughly doubling the comparative size of its economy. CNN's Pam Benson contributed to this report.","The U.S. will remain the top global power, but no more ""Pax Americana,"" a new report finds .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer, the seven-time Wimbledon champion, suffered one of the most staggering defeats in the history of the tournament after being beaten by Ukraine's 116th ranked Sergiy Stakhovsky. The 27-year-old fought back from losing the opening set 7-6 before winning 7-6 7-5 7-5 to mark the greatest triumph of his career and end Federer's record of making 36 consecutive grand slam quarterfinals. ""Right now I can definitely tell my grandkids, I kicked the butt of Roger Federer,"" Stakhovsky told reporters following his sensational victory. Stakhovsky, who reached a career high of 31 back in 2010, held his nerve in the fourth set tiebreak to see off the defending champion and 17-time grand slam winner. Federer was just one of seven former World No.1 players to lose their second round ties Wednesday -- although his demise was by far the most dramatic. ""I'm very disappointed,"" Federer told reporters. ""Losing at Wimbledon always has been that way, will never change. So I've just got to get over this one. Some finals haven't hurt this much, that's for sure. ""It's always a disappointment losing any match around the world, and particularly here. I've had some great moments here, but also some tougher ones."" Federer's defeat leaves Novak Djokovic as the only man in the draw to have won the tournament and also leaves the draw wide open for Britain's Andy Murray, who progressed to the third round with ease. ""I struggled maybe on the big points this time around again, like I have for some time this season,"" Federer said of his clash with Stakhovsky. ""It was tricky. But credit to him for closing it out under enormous pressure. He was better in the more important points today than I was. ""I thought I had my opportunities, had the foot in the door. When I had the chance, I couldn't do it. It's very frustrating, very disappointing. ""I'm going to accept it and move forward from here. I have no choice."" Federer will now drop out of the top four for the first time since he won Wimbledon in 2003 and could fall as low as No.6 should Tomas Berdych win this year's title. But for Stakhovksy, the contrast in emotions could hardly be any greater. Watched by his wife Anfisa Bulgakova, he produced the performance of his life on the court which Federer has virtually owned over the past decade. ""I'm still in disbelief that that happened,"" Stakhovsky told the BBC. ""I was playing the best tennis I have ever played, I am incredibly happy. When you play Roger Federer it's like you're playing two players. You play him the player and him the ego. I couldn't play any better today. It was a fantastic day for me."" Federer's exit is his earliest at Wimbledon since losing in the opening round to Mario Ancic in 2002 and his earliest at a grand slam since being beaten by Luis Horna at the French Open in 2003. It is also the earliest defeat suffered by a defending champion since 2002 winner Lleyton Hewitt was beaten by Ivo Karlovic in the first round the following year. Federer's loss means Murray will fancy his chances of making the final for the second year in succession. The World No.2, who defeated Yen-Hsun Lu 6-3 6-3 7-5, will now play Spain's Tommy Robredo in the third round. But despite Rafael Nadal, Federer and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga all falling by the wayside, Murray is refusing to look too far ahead. ""There's top players still left in the tournament, and there's a lot of young guys as well coming through, guys like (Ernests) Gulbis, (Jerzy) Janowicz.,"" he told reporters. ""Those sort of players are starting to break through and play more consistently. ""I'll just concentrate on my next match. I'm playing a tough player, a very experienced guy. I'll worry about that match."" Robredo, who overcame Nicolas Mahut in four sets, says he will treat himself to cake and ice cream before turning his attention to the home favorite. ""I have to congratulate myself because today I did a great job,"" he told reporters. ""So I'm going to play Andy in two days. Now I prefer to enjoy it, to relax, to go have a great dinner because I deserve it, with a chocolate cake with ice cream. Then tomorrow is going to be a long day to think about Andy."" Elsewhere, former champion Hewitt was ousted in by Dustin Brown 6-4 6-4 6-7 6-2, while there were also wins for Spain's Nicolas Almagro, Austria's Jurgen Melzer and Argentina's Juan Monaco. Frenchman Tsonga was forced to pull out of his tie with Latvia's Ernests Gulbis after complaining of injury, while Radek Stepanek and Marin Cilic were also big name casualties.","Seven-time winner Roger Federer beaten in second round .

"New York (CNN) -- Some family members of people killed in the September 11, 2001, terror attacks announced Thursday that they have requested the names and addresses of other survivors as part of an effort to stop the city from placing unidentified remains in a repository in a museum under construction at ground zero. A spokesman for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said flatly that providing the names ""is not something we will do."" The 17 family members filed a Freedom of Information Law request so they can notify other families and seek their input. They say they and other families were never notified or consulted about the plan, which they consider part of a commercial operation to lure tourists. ""These are our beloved remains, our sons, our daughters, our siblings and spouses,"" Rosemary Cain said. Her son, George Cain, was a New York City firefighter killed on 9/11. ""We have the right to decide where they will spend eternity."" More than half of the families of the 2,749 victims of the World Trade Center attacks never received any remains of their loved ones. Many others were able to bury only partial remains. More than 9,000 body parts are still unidentified and have been stored in temporary structures maintained by the New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The current plan calls for the remains to be housed in an underground repository, behind a wall in the museum, and adjacent to a memorial gallery filled with pictures and artifacts of the victims. The museum, which is under construction, is located beneath the footprints of the two World Trade Center towers. The repository will be controlled by the medical examiner's office, which will continue to have access to the remains in the hope that, as DNA technology progresses, more positive identifications can be made. The National September 11 Memorial and Museum disputes the claims that families were never notified about the plans, and says it was the express wish of many families that their loved ones' remains return to the bedrock at ground zero. ""Families have been part of a robust process through which they were consulted during public and private meetings with officials, as well as offered opportunities for public comment,"" according to a statement from the organization. ""And they have repeatedly stated it is essential the remains return to the sacred bedrock of the site."" Feedback from those meetings also led to the creation of a private space, open only to families, near the repository. And families will also be able to make individual appointments to visit the repository after hours, according to the 9/11 Memorial organization. In response to the FOIL request, a spokesman for Bloomberg said, ""Many family members would rightly be outraged if the city made their personal information, including home addresses, public, and of course that is not something we will do."" Additional FOIL requests were also sent to the mayor's community affairs unit, the medical examiner and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Retired Deputy Chief Jim Riches, who lost his firefighter son Jimmy Riches on 9/11 and is part of the group that filed the FOIL request, said he always knew the remains would come back to ground zero. ""But we were told it was going to be separate and distinct from the museum and visitor's center,"" he said, adding that what he envisioned was more akin to the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, that would be above ground and distinct from the museum. Like the other family members he joined at the Thursday press conference near ground zero, Riches said he never received any notification about the decision with regard to the remains. In a recent opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal, family members who are also board members of the museum foundation said it was decided that an underground repository was better than an above-ground tomb. ""The latter structure would be a constant magnet for disrespectful public displays and demonstrations ... and would be impossible to secure around the clock,"" they wrote. Riches dismissed the notion that an above-ground tomb could not be protected. Attorney Norman Siegel, who filed the FOIL request on behalf of the families, said he has seen ""not a single letter ...that was addressed to the families notifying them of the plan and asking them for their input regarding the plan."" In contrast, Rosaleen Tallon, who lost her firefighter brother Sean Patrick Tallon on 9/11, said she had received letters from the 9/11 Memorial regarding other matters, such as confirming the correct spelling of her brother's name and informing her of location of the name on the above-ground memorial. ""Surely a letter should have been sent out on letterhead from the 9/11 Memorial and Museum and the City of New York telling us, at the very least, what they were doing with our loved ones' remains,"" she said.","Freedom of Information Law request filed seeking names, addresses of 9/11 families .

"London (CNN) -- Pierre Omidyar, founder of online auction site eBay, said Wednesday he is teaming up with journalist Glenn Greenwald, who has led reporting on secret U.S. surveillance programs, to create a new online mass media venture. Greenwald announced late Tuesday that he was quitting The Guardian for ""a once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity"" but said he was not ready to give more details. Now Omidyar has confirmed to CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he is behind the new media venture, which includes Greenwald and others -- and that he will personally fund it. Greenwald has been at the forefront of a series of high-profile reports based on leaks from former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Journalist Jeremy Scahill and documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras will also be joining the venture, Omidyar said. Greenwald has been working with Poitras, based in Berlin, on NSA-related stories. Scahill is the author of the New York Times best-seller ""Blackwater: The Rise of the World's Most Powerful Mercenary Army."" NSA leaker Snowden deserves a Nobel Prize, his father says . Greenwald, who lives in Brazil, said Tuesday that it had not been easy to leave The Guardian, but that he could not turn down the ""momentous new venture."" ""My partnership with the Guardian has been extremely fruitful and fulfilling: I have high regard for the editors and journalists with whom I worked and am incredibly proud of what we achieved,"" he said. ""The decision to leave was not an easy one, but I was presented with a once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity that no journalist could possibly decline. "" Former CIA analyst: Edward Snowden is 'at peace with his decisions' The Guardian's Jennifer Lindauer said Greenwald was a ""remarkable journalist"" and that it had been ""fantastic"" to work with him. ""Our work together over the last year has demonstrated the crucial role that responsible investigative journalism can play in holding those in power to account,"" she said. ""We are of course disappointed by Glenn's decision to move on, but can appreciate the attraction of the new role he has been offered. We wish him all the best."" U.K. government and press collide in bullying of reporter's partner . 'Enormous damage' The Guardian has come under fire in recent days from figures in the UK intelligence community who suggest its reporting has undermined efforts to keep the country safe in the face of terror threats. Both Greenwald and The Guardian have accused UK authorities of using heavy-handed tactics to try to silence legitimate reporting. Greenwald's partner, David Miranda, was detained for hours by UK authorities at London's Heathrow Airport in mid-August, as he was changing planes en route to the couple's Rio de Janeiro home. Items including a laptop, a hard drive and USB memory sticks were confiscated from him and are the subject of a legal challenge. Greenwald said the episode was designed to deter him and other investigative journalists from using classified information and digging into stories critical of the British and allied governments -- but vowed to continue regardless. Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger described meetings with UK government officials who demanded the newspaper hand over the Snowden material or destroy it. Who is Edward Snowden? The files leaked by Snowden contain at least 58,000 highly classified UK intelligence documents, authorities have said. A week ago, the head of Britain's MI5 security service, Andrew Parker, used his first public speech to say that reporting on the work of Britain's intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters, risks handing over vital information to terrorists. ""It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques,"" he said. ""Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm."" Miranda afraid during questioning . Parker did not name The Guardian or Snowden in his comments but said that the information gleaned about terrorists and ""the detail of the capabilities we use against them"" was what gave intelligence services their ""margin of advantage"" -- a margin, he said, that is now ""under attack."" A former head of GCHQ and adviser to 10 Downing Street, Sir David Omand, also last week said in an interview with The Times of London that leaks by Snowden of intelligence documents represent ""the most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever."" However, in an editorial for The Guardian published Monday, a former director of UK public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, argued that Parker had used ""foolish self-serving rhetoric"" to argue against greater transparency by security agencies. Reporting based on Snowden's leaks has also caused diplomatic tensions for the United States with both Brazil and Mexico. Data seized from Greenwald's partner risks security, UK says . Glenn Greenwald's partner David Miranda wins partial court victory .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Los Angeles Coroner's chief investigator revisited the office of Michael Jackson's dermatologist Wednesday, even though the coroner announced last week his ""thorough and comprehensive"" report was completed. Dr. Arnold Klein denied in a CNN interview last month that he had given Jackson dangerous drugs. ""We wanted some additional information, and they provided it,"" Ed Winter said as he emerged 90 minutes after entering Dr. Arnold Klein's Beverly Hills, California, dermatology clinic. Winter, who also visited Klein's office on July 14, said the doctor's staff and lawyers cooperated with his requests. Garo Ghazarian, one of Klein's two lawyers on the scene, said the doctor did not meet with Winter. ""They had inquiries born out of information they wanted to corroborate,"" Ghazarian said. Ghazarian said he was added to Klein's legal team ""to take a look and see if there's any cause for concern in light of media reports"" that investigators were considering criminal charges against him. ""I have seen no cause for concern on behalf of my client, Dr. Arnold Klein,"" Ghazarian said. The coroner's office said more than a week ago that a ""thorough and comprehensive"" report into the death of Michael Jackson is complete, but police have requested that the report not be released yet because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The coroner's office said it would abide by the request that ""the cause and manner of death remain confidential,"" and referred all questions to the Los Angeles Police Department. Winter would not say what prompted the coroner's office to revisit its conclusions. Jackson's June 25 death is also the focus of an investigation by Los Angeles police, the state attorney general's office and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Klein, who treated Jackson for decades, denied in a CNN interview last month that he had given Jackson dangerous drugs. ""If you took all the pills I gave him in the last year at once, it wouldn't do anything to you,"" he told CNN's Larry King. Jackson visited Klein's office several times in the weeks before his death, including one visit just three days before. Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician who is under investigation, said in a video posted online Tuesday that he has ""faith the truth will prevail."" Murray, who was with Jackson when he died, recorded the one-minute video in Houston, Texas, last Wednesday and it posted on YouTube Tuesday, the spokeswoman for his lawyer said. ""I have done all I could do,"" Murray said. ""I told the truth, and I have faith the truth will prevail.""  Watch Conrad Murray say, ""Don't worry ... I'll be fine"" » . Murray, a cardiologist, owned and operated two medical clinics -- in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Houston -- but he took a full-time job as Jackson's personal doctor in May, as the pop singer prepared for his comeback concerts scheduled to start in July. Investigators have searched Murray's home and clinics for evidence related to the anesthetic propofol, according to documents filed in court. A source close to the investigation told CNN it's believed Murray administered the drug, also known by the brand name Diprivan, to Jackson within 24 hours of his death. Ed Chernoff, Murray's lawyer, said it was only after Murray moved to Los Angeles in May 2009 that ""he realized that Michael Jackson had some very unusual problems."" Chernoff, in comments published in the Los Angeles Times and confirmed by his spokeswoman, said that when Murray took the job, his client did not know what drugs Jackson might have been taking or whether he was addicted. Murray did not conduct drug tests on Jackson and had no way of knowing, other than from Jackson's words, if he was taking other drugs, Chernoff's spokeswoman, Miranda Sevcik, told CNN. One of the warrants used in searches of Murray's home and clinics implied that police suspect Jackson was a drug addict. Chernoff has refused to confirm or deny whether Murray administered propofol to Jackson, although he denied ""unequivocally"" that Murray gave Jackson painkillers. A former prosecutor who has also defended doctors in medical malpractice cases involving anesthesia said prosecutors would face ""a very, very severe uphill battle"" when charging a doctor with manslaughter. ""You have to prove gross recklessness in the prescription of drugs,"" Paul Callan told CNN. ""That's really hard with a doctor because doctors are always prescribing drugs; patients occasionally die from them. That's not criminal conduct. But here, you have to show that this doctor should've known Jackson was an addict and that he could've died from these drugs.""","""We wanted some additional information,"" chief investigator  Ed Winter said .

"(CNN) -- The Taliban said Monday it was behind a suicide bombing in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore that killed 13 people and wounded 113 others. Azam Tariq, spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said the attack was in response to U.S. aggression against Muslims around the world. ""I am proud to accept the responsibility of the Lahore suicide blast,"" Tariq wrote in a text message to CNN. ""We will follow U.S. and its allies all over the world, even if they are in Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore, Afghanistan or in U.S."" Seven of the dead were security personnel, and two were a mother and daughter on their way to school, Lahore government official Khalid Ranjha said. He said 81 people were at nearby hospitals. Government officials earlier reported 11 people were dead and more than 60 were injured, with many in critical condition. Officials warned the death toll could rise. The bombing was in an affluent part of Model Town in Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city. The suicide bomber targeted the Special Investigation Agency, a provincial law-enforcement agency that investigates high-value detainees. It is where suspected militants have been interrogated, said Khusro Pervez, a senior government official in Lahore. In a separate development, three suspected militants were killed Monday night when a suspected U.S. drone fired five missiles at a compound in Pakistan's tribal region, two Pakistani intelligence officials said. The compound was in the town of Miranshah in North Waziristan, one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region bordering Afghanistan, officials said. The officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media. CNN's Reza Sayah and journalists Nasir Dawar and Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Pakistani Taliban said attack was response to U.S. aggression against Muslims .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)  -- The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed at least 13 people and injured dozens in the northwest part of the country Saturday, authorities said. The attack at a security checkpoint in the city of Saidu Sharif injured 37, according to Ibrahim Khan, a police official in the Swat District, where the military launched an offensive against the Taliban last year. The city is near Mingora, the largest city in the district. Khan said the suicide attacker, who was dropped off on a rickshaw, approached a checkpoint manned by police and military personnel. Security personnel opened fire when the attacker refused to stop. Moments later, the attacker detonated explosives. Azam Tariq, a spokesman for the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, told CNN by phone that his organization takes responsibility for the deadly blasts in Lahore on Friday and the attack Saturday. The Saturday blast comes a day after a twin suicide bombing on a military convoy in Lahore killed 44 people and injured nearly 100 others. Assailants targeted military convoys, approaching on foot and detonating their explosives 15 to 20 seconds apart, Punjab Law Minister Rana Sana Ullah said. Five of the dead were Pakistani soldiers, he said. ""Pakistan has become a colony of Blackwater,"" Tariq said, referring to the company now known as Xe Services that provided security to U.S. officials in Iraq. ""The government of Pakistan has become puppet of U.S,"" he added. Tariq warned that failure to halt operations against the Taliban will lead to more attacks. ""Our 2,000 suicide bombers, who have already spread across the country, will act against security personnel and government installations,"" Tariq said. Tariq said the attacks on both days were a retaliation for the killing of innocent ""Mujahedeen"" by Pakistani government under the orders of the United States. A Pakistani crackdown on militants has resulted in the arrests of top Taliban. After the twin bombings Friday, a series of low-level blasts occurred in succession in the Iqbal Town area of the city that night. Three people were injured in the blasts and damage was minimal, Lahore Police said. Earlier this week, gunmen entered a North West Frontier Province compound of the humanitarian agency World Vision, threw grenades, opened fire on the staff inside and detonated a homemade bomb before leaving, according to a World Vision statement.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Asia's affluent middle classes have long been eager to enroll their kids in the West's elite schools but now they no longer need to travel as far to do so. Some of the most notable names in British and North American education are establishing campuses across Asia as they seek to tap into the region's multi-billion dollar international school market. On Monday, Winston Churchill's alma mater, Harrow, opened its doors to 750 students in Hong Kong. The 500-year old British fee-paying school already has outposts in Bangkok and Beijing. Last week, some 350 children began their schooling at Marlborough College in Malaysia. The $50,000-a year boarding school in the rural British county of Wiltshire boasts Kate Middleton as a former pupil. Other prominent schools targeting Asia include Wellington College and Dulwich College in China, Branksome Hall in and Dwight School in South Korea, Epsom College in Malaysia, and Haileybury in Kazakhstan. According to ISC Research, international schools are no longer the preserve of expatriate kids. Around 80% of pupils come from the wealthy local population seeking an English-language education. This compares with 20% three decades ago. ""International schools are now big business and there are many well-funded groups buying and building schools,"" ISC said. ""The proportion of schools run for profit is increasing significantly."" Asia dominates the market, with 53% of all international schools. ""Based on fee income alone, the present value of the market is Â£18.9 billion ($30 billion). Within 10 years we predict that to increase to Â£30 billion,"" said Nicholas Brummitt, ISC Research's managing director. Governments in Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea have been actively promoting themselves as education hubs. Bob Pick, master of Marlborough College Malaysia, said the school would appeal to those who wanted to experience a UK education but remain close to home and family. He also said that Marlborough offered a ""holistic approach"" to education. ""Our curriculum inculcates in pupils an appreciation of the arts, sports and the natural environment, as well as social responsibility and moral values,"" he said. Fees are not cheap but long waiting lists for international schools in places like Hong Kong and Singapore suggest that demand is strong. At Harrow International School in Hong Kong annual fees go up to HK$160,000 ($21,000). Parents or their employers also have to make a payment of between HK$600,000 ($77,000) to HK$3 million ($385,000) to secure a place. In Hong Kong, an influx of expatriate workers in recent years, combined with international schools' growing popularity among locals, has lead to a severe shortage of places. Many parents put their child's name on waiting lists at birth and business groups have warned the situation is deterring companies from hiring expatriate staff with school-aged children. The Hong Kong government extended a HK$273 million interest-free construction loan to Harrow but critics said the move was too generous and more support should have been given to local schools.","Prominent names in British and North American education open schools in Asia .

"(CNN) -- Lynne Cheney has spent decades studying and admiring the nation's fourth president, James Madison. Her new book, ""James Madison: A Life Reconsidered"" is a labor of political admiration that began five years ago and culminated in a historical journey in which Madison, the father of the Constitution, also becomes a prophet of productive conservatism. She considers his impact generally under-appreciated but incredibly profound. Cheney hopes her book will complete the record on Madison's important role in the Republican Party â€”as well as on his personal demeanor and political vision. ""We talked about his being reserved and reticent. And his friends thought that it was going to damage his political career, but it didn't. He had such gifts. And they came shining through, his amazing intellect, his political skill, that when you combine with modesty, he became an evermore admirable figure,"" she told CNN. Her personal journey . In a wide-ranging interview, Cheney also spoke about her own personal political journey â€” as a second lady, historian and mother â€” and the impact of the public feud last year between her daughters over the issue of same-sex marriage. The family, she now says, is a ""happy family."" She considers Madison the prophet of small government. He pushed for a strong central government early in his political career when he served in the early House of Representatives, but he started having some doubts. ""Madison began to worry about too strong a government,"" Cheney told CNN. He founded the nation's first political party. ""That political party led to an era of partisanship in the 1790's that's the equal of anything we have today,"" she said. When asked if that partisanship was worse or better today than when the government first began, she recounted how mean the politics of the 18th and early 19th centuries were. ""Alexander Hamilton was revealed as an adulterer in the pages of the newspaper. Dolley Madison (James Madison's wife) was attacked. ... So, it was every bit as vicious, I think, as today is. And Madison was really responsible for it by starting this Labor Party."" Does she think this politics of personal destruction is a terrible thing? ""Madison wouldn't have thought so."" When asked about her views, she responded, ""I don't think so either. ... Its what happens when you have free and open debate."" Controversial politics . Cheney is no stranger to controversial politics. Her husband, Dick Cheney, was a House GOP backbencher before becoming a member of the majority leadership and vice president. He became a chief defender of the Iraq War and the controversial terrorism interrogation policies on terror detainees used by the George W. Bush administration in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. ""I'd like to take some of the edge off it, trust me. You know, I've been through this,"" she said. The most recent trial by fire occurred when her family had to confront fallout from her daughter Liz's bid for a U.S. Senate seat from Wyoming. After Liz reiterated her opposition to same-sex marriage, her sister, Mary, who is gay and married, lashed out. ""Liz, this isn't just an issue on which we disagree. You're just wrong - and on the wrong side of history,"" Mary wrote on Facebook. Dick and Lynne Cheney felt the need to issue a statement to try to calm the tensions. How does a parent deal with all of that? ""My underlying philosophy is that you should try to keep family matters within the family. And I think it was, you know, unfortunate that happened,"" Lynne Cheney told CNN. ""It's hard to have two wonderful daughters who see things differently. ... The disadvantage is that it becomes a public dispute. And I just don't wanna do anything to continue that trend. It's not good for family generally to do that, and I don't think it's good for ours."" She said the advice she would give other families who are going through these types of issues is to ""just love your kids. ... I love them unconditionally. I can't think of a greater gift that any parent can give a child."" About her position on same-sex marriage, she said, ""I think Dick actually had the classic formulation. He said, 'Freedom means freedom for everyone.' I think that's a principle we can all agree on,"" she said. 'A happy family' When asked if there had been a reconciliation between her daughters she responded, ""We're a happy family."" Dick and Lynne Cheney now spend a majority of their time in Wyoming, not in Washington. But they both are still very much into politics -- of all centuries. ""Madison was the man who said we're a government of laws, not men. (President Barack) Obama seems to be showing us that we can be a government of man and not laws. So it is ... how can you evaluate the two of them in the same breath? I can't see it,"" she said. While the former vice president has been very vocal in his opposition to some of Obama's policies, especially national security, former President George W. Bush has vowed not to comment publicly on policy matters or his successor. Asked why the former President has decided not to engage, Mrs. Cheney said ""I have no idea. But he seems to be content and happy and I look forward to seeing him and Mrs. Bush next week."" Do the Cheneys and Bushes keep in touch? ""Well, I'm going to be at the Bush Library -- talking about James Madison."" Jeb and Hillary . As for some of those who may run for President in 2016, she said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush would make a ""great contribution"" if he ran. ""He has to sort that out. It is so hard to run for President that -- you know, you have to be sure in your own heart and that's what you wanna do. And he'll figure that out,"" she said. She was more sure about Hillary Clinton. ""I in fact don't even understand what the debate is about - will she or won't she. She's running."" She added, ""you know she was defeated in this 2008 election in the primary. And we didn't see that coming. So I'm not sure I could, I could predict that one for you."" For their part Dick and Lynne Cheney are getting ready to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. Asked if they miss being at the center of the political universe, she said, ""That was a great time and a time that both of us enjoyed. But it's, you know, it's one stage of your life and you move on to another one. We're in our Western years now.""

"London (CNN) -- Janet Jackson is opening up for the first time about a duet with her brother that she's reviving two years after his death. Jackson took to the stage in London on Thursday and performed their 1995 song Scream as video of Michael Jackson played and his voice filled Royal Albert Hall. The reworked duet follows in the footsteps of jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole and his daughter, Natalie Cole. In 1991 she turned her father's famous 1961 recording ""Unforgettable"" into a father-daughter duet. Janet Jackson said she did the original duet at the request of her brother years ago. ""I was on the Rhythm Nation tour and Mike actually asked me to do a song with him and I told him no. I didn't want to do it. I felt I hadn't come into my own and I hadn't fully made a name for myself ... and I didn't want to ride anyone's coattails,"" she said. ""And I remember being in the Janet Tour a few good years later and he asked me again if I would do a song with him. And I felt, at that point, I'd carved my own little niche in this world of music and I felt okay, I can do this now and that's how it came about."" Jackson said that performing the song alongside her brother again isn't difficult. ""It feels great -- just listening to and hearing his voice,"" she said, adding that on stage she finds herself, ""remembering the experience of recording it."" Jackson declined to comment to the press on the two-year mark of her brother's death, instead taking to social media this week with a simple message on Twitter on the June 25 anniversary: ""I miss you, I love you."" Jackson wraps up the European leg of her tour this week then heads to North America, Australia and Africa.","Jackson performs virtual duet on stage in London .

Researchers using carbon dating techniques at Khirbat en-Nahas in southern Jordan discovered that copper production took place there around the time King Solomon is said to have ruled the Israelites. The research findings were reported in this week's issue of the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which came out Monday. King Solomon is known in the Old Testament for his wisdom and wealth and for building the First Temple in Jerusalem. The fabled mines entered popular culture in 1885 with the publication in Great Britain of the bestselling ""King Solomon's Mines"" by Sir H. Rider Haggard. In the book, adventurers in search of the mines find gold, diamonds and ivory. Since then, the mines have been the the subject of several films. Yet their possible location -- and whether they exist at all -- remains cloaked in mystery. Thomas Levy of the University of California San Diego, who led the research, said carbon dating placed copper production at Khirbat en-Nahas (Arabic for 'Ruins of copper"") in the 10th century -- in line with the biblical narrative of Solomon's rule. ""We can't believe everything ancient writings tell us,"" Levy said in a university statement. ""But this research represents a confluence between the archaeological and scientific data and the Bible."" Khirbat en-Nahas is an arid region south of the Dead Sea, in Jordan's Faynan district. The Old Testament identifies the area with the Kingdom of Edom. As early as the 1930s, archaeologists linked the site to the Edomite kingdom, but some of those claims were dismissed in subsequent years. ""Now ... we have evidence that complex societies were indeed active in 10th and 9th centuries BCE and that brings us back to the debate about the historicity of the Hebrew Bible narratives related to this period,"" Levy said.","Desert site in Jordan may contain the ruins of the fabled King Solomon's mines .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Three North Korean doctors serving at a hospital in Nigeria's northern Yobe state were killed early Sunday morning, police said. There were mixed reports initially on where the victims were from, but the police chief of Yobe told CNN they were North Korean physicians assisting at Potiskum General Hospital as part of a government agreement. The government in Pyongyang has not confirmed that the victims were North Korean nationals. Authorities say 10 suspects are under arrest. ""At this point we cannot say if they are Boko Haram, hired killers or common criminals, but we have cordoned off the area and are in the process of interrogating them,"" Commissioner Sanusi Rufa'i said. Boko Haram is an Islamist militant group that has carried out scores of attacks across the north over the years. The group, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden,"" has referred to itself as the Nigerian Taliban. It seeks to overthrow the government and replace it with a regime based on Islamic law. Sunday's predawn slayings came on the heels of another deadly attack against medical workers. On Friday, nine health workers who were administering polio vaccinations were killed in Kano, the biggest city in northern Nigeria. The victims, eight women and one man, were working for a government program established to vaccinate people across Nigeria.","The doctors were assisting a local hospital, police chief says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A group of Latino farmers is scheduled to return to federal court Thursday to argue that the government has discriminated against them in providing loans, disaster relief and other financial aid. Farmer John Carillo says he was turned down for a USDA loan because of discrimination. The suit, known as the Garcia case, alleges Latino farmers were denied financial aid from 1981 to 2000 that white farmers were able to get. ""The discrimination we're talking about has been well-documented,"" said attorney Stephen Hill, who represents the Latino farmers. The farmers filed the discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2000 and sought class-action status, meaning that all the individual complaints and suits could be heard as one. A judge denied class-action status, leaving 81 complaints to be settled individually in several states. The class could have included 20,000 farmers, the government said in court.  Watch some Latino farmers tell their stories » . A hearing in the case was initially was scheduled for Tuesday, but was postponed for two days -- and could be delayed even longer. Hill has filed a motion asking the federal court to postpone the hearing pending a ruling from the Supreme Court on the class-action issue, or until November 23, whichever is later. The Justice Department, which is representing the Agriculture Department, has opposed class-action status, saying each case ""should be handled on its individual merits."" The Justice Department also is not interested in settling the case, government attorney Lisa Ann Olson told a federal district court judge in an August hearing. ""It is not in the interests of the United States to do so,"" Olson said. ""To settle at this point would be picking a number out of thin air."" The farmers say if they are forced to fight the government individually, many families will not be able to afford the legal battle and their discrimination cases may never be heard. Thursday's hearing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is being held to determine whether any progress has been made in the case and to set a schedule and a mechanism for how to get the cases resolved, U.S. District Judge James Robertson said at the August hearing. The Latino farmers note that African-Americans who filed an identical discrimination lawsuit against the government in 1997 were granted class-action status and have been awarded about $1 billion in settlements to 15,000 farmers. The farmers also point out that former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman testified before Congress in 1997 that the USDA had a long history of discrimination. Glickman served as agriculture secretary from 1995 to 2001. ""Good people lost their farmland not because of bad weather, bad crops, but because of the color of their skin,"" Glickman told lawmakers. Farmer John Carillo says he's one of those people. His father built a thriving family business in Salinas, California, that included acres of chili and tomato fields, a packing house and a cooler for production. It's all gone now. Carillo said he applied for a USDA loan after devastating floods in 1995 but was denied. ""Our American dream was to have the whole family work together and to succeed as a Hispanic farming company,"" he told CNN. CNN correspondent Thelma Gutierrez contributed to this report.","Latino farmers say they were refused USDA aid that was available to white farmers .

"(CNN) -- Two words are nowhere to be found in the pages of text that spell out a new interim nuclear deal with Iran: Saeed Abedini. Now some supporters of the American pastor, who's been detained in Iran for more than a year, are accusing U.S. officials of betraying Abedini by signing off on an agreement that doesn't get him out of prison. ""We were across the table from the Iranians, and we did not bring home Americans. To me that's a tragedy and that's outrageous,"" said Jay Sekulow, the chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, which represents Abedini's family in the United States. While analysts debated the nuclear agreement's pros and cons, Abedini's wife, Naghmeh, said she was trying to comfort her two young children. ""It's very painful,"" she told CNN's ""The Lead"" on Monday. ""My kids were crying this morning, saying, 'God, don't let Daddy die. Bring him home.' "" Abedini, a 33-year-old U.S. citizen of Iranian birth, was sentenced to eight years in prison earlier this year, accused of attempting to undermine the Iranian government and endangering national security by establishing home churches. At the time, an Iranian state news agency said he would soon be released on bail -- but Abedini's family says he remains behind bars in a dangerous prison, wrongfully imprisoned because of his Christian faith. Family members who visited him in prison recently said his health had deteriorated, Naghmeah Abedini said. And U.S. officials should do more to push for his release, she said. ""I expect them to speak out and say, 'We asked for his release, and this is horrible what has happened,' "" she said. ""And he's not going to survive even a few months in that prison."" U.S. President Barack Obama pushed for the release of Abedini and two other detained Americans -- Robert Levinson and Amir Hekmati -- when he spoke on the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in September. It was the only issue other than Iran's nuclear program that Obama brought up, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said. ""He asked for Rouhani's assistance in freeing them and allowing them to return to the United States, and Rouhani said that he would look into it,"" Blinken said. Asked why Abedini's fate wasn't part of the interim nuclear deal with Iran, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the Geneva talks ""focused exclusively on nuclear issues."" White House officials told CNN that negotiations for Abedini and other detained Americans in Iran are ongoing. ""We've been repeatedly clear that we're calling on Iran to release them,"" Blinken said. ""The president' raised it, we will continue to raise it, and we hope to see them return home."" One analyst told CNN Monday that focusing on nuclear policy was the right approach for the talks. ""In any negotiation, you've got to decide how much you're going to try to accomplish, and just tackling all the dimensions of the nuclear agreement is ambition enough,"" said Richard Haas, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. But Naghmeah Abedini and her attorney argued that officials could have done more, making the Americans' release a precondition for any sanctions relief. ""It is disheartening and discouraging that fighting for religious freedom and wrongful imprisonment of a U.S. citizen is no longer a priority for a country that was founded on such values,"" she said in a written statement to CNN. Saeed Abedini converted to Christianity from Islam and then became a pastor, living in Boise, Idaho. He regularly made trips to Iran and was working on a government-approved orphanage when he was arrested last year, his family said. He was on a bus crossing from Turkey into Iran last summer when immigration officials took away his passport. He was later put under house arrest. Authorities took him to the notorious Evin prison in September 2012 while he awaited trial. In January a judge from the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Court sentenced him to eight years in prison. On a Facebook page dedicated to pushing for Abedini's freedom, dozens of supporters criticized the nuclear deal and said they were praying for the pastor's release. ""It's so senseless that our government would betray an American citizen like this ... especially under these unique circumstances. ... They had the opportunity,"" Gina Lewis Morrison wrote. Abedini's wife said Monday that she won't stop fighting for her husband's freedom. She told ""The Lead"" that she had a message for her husband. ""Hang in there. I'm spending every waking moment working to get you out,"" she said. ""The kids and I miss you and we're proud of you for standing up for what you believe and your values."" CNN's John Berman, Wolf Blitzer, Jamie Crawford and Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","NEW: Administration officials: Push for Saeed Abedini's release will continue .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sanctions will be placed on 13 people and three companies ""for their involvement in the A.Q. Khan nuclear proliferation network,"" the U.S. State Department said Monday. A.Q. Khan was the brains behind Pakistan's nuclear bomb. Khan, a Pakistani scientist, operated an international black market in nuclear material to a number of states with a history of poor relations with the United States. He was arrested in February 2004 and eventually pardoned by former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. The sanctions, which follow a U.S. review of the network, ""will help prevent future proliferation-related activities by these private entities, provide a warning to other would-be proliferators, and demonstrate our ongoing commitment to using all available tools to address proliferation-related activities."" The department notes that Khan spearheaded an ""extensive international network for the proliferation of nuclear equipment and know-how that provided one-stop shopping for countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons."" Iran and Libya received centrifuge components, centrifuges, and designs from Khan and his associates, and the United States believes the network ""provided centrifuge designs, equipment, and technology to North Korea."" The department said Khan ""provided Libya with nuclear weapon designs."" The department added that Pakistan, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland and Malaysia are among the governments that have worked with the U.S. ""to investigate and shut down the network."" ""Many of Dr. Khan's associates are either in custody, being prosecuted, or have been convicted of crimes,"" it said. ""While we believe the A.Q. Khan network is no longer operating, countries should remain vigilant to ensure that Khan network associates, or others seeking to pursue similar proliferation activities, will not become a future source for sensitive nuclear information or equipment.""","U.S.: Khan headed international network for proliferation of nuclear equipment .

"Washington (CNN) -- Which one of these doesn't fit? More jobs, a record stock market, wars ending and dismal poll numbers. All apply to Barack Obama's presidency as it passes the 2,000-day mark, raising questions about the viability of what used to be known as conventional political wisdom. A strengthening economy and robust stock market traditionally mean general public satisfaction with government. Bringing soldiers home from war zones has always boosted presidential popularity. Not this time with this President. A CNN compilation of recent national polls indicates only 41% of Americans approve of Obama's handling of the job, down 6 percentage points from a year ago and matching the low of the past 12 months. Why the disconnect? A convergence of factors -- uneven economic growth, government crises both real and exaggerated, foreign policy problems, hyper-partisan Washington politics now on election-year steroids -- helps explain it. Obama to Republicans: 'So sue me' Here's a closer look at some of the issues involved: . 1) Jobs, but not for everyone . Another strong jobs report Thursday added to growing evidence that U.S. economy has hit its full stride after the recession Obama inherited when he took office in January 2009. A White House statement noted the 288,000 jobs created in June contributed to the strongest start to a year since 1999 and the best six-month period overall since 2006. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.1%, well below the almost 10% level in the immediate aftermath of the recession as well as the more than 7% level when Obama's presidency began. In addition, the job growth last month spread across the economy instead of coming mostly from low-paying sectors such as food and drink, as occurred previously, said CNN Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans. However, Romans noted that a low labor force participation rate showed many people ""have simply just left the labor market."" Those out of the labor market for more than a year still have trouble finding jobs, so little has changed for them, she said, adding: ""It's not all unicorns and rainbows."" Obama himself alluded to the sweet-and-sour economic situation on Thursday, touting the positive report but adding that ""there are still folks out there who are struggling."" ""My hope is that the American people look at today's news and understand that, in fact, we are making strides,"" he said. 2) Who benefits from a strong stock market? The jobs report that exceeded expectations of analysts sent the stock market to record heights, with the Dow crossing 17,000 for the first time. However, happiness on Wall Street doesn't translate directly to satisfaction on Main Street, noted CNN Business Correspondent Alison Kosik. ""Only about half of Americans invest in stocks,"" so the gains don't matter to a lot of people, Kosik said, adding that the stock market ""isn't the economy."" In fact, the soaring exchanges sow resentment among non-investors who blame Wall Street greed for the near collapse of 2008 that contributed to the recession. As a Democrat, Obama stands to benefit less from a healthy stock market than a Republican president from the party more traditionally tied to the banking-investment sector. 3) Wars ending, sort of . Obama campaigned twice on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wars started by his predecessor, and he is on track to fulfill that promise. He withdrew U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011, and almost all American forces will be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016 -- and his presidency -- under his plan. However, myriad issues cloud the return home of the troops. The lightning advance by Sunni militants through northern Iraq threatens renewed civil war and partition, raising fears of a jihadist-controlled safe haven for terrorists threatening U.S. interests. That is the exact scenario the wars were supposed to end, and critics have accused Obama of allowing gains made in Iraq to get erased after pulling out U.S. forces. The Obama administration blames Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki for his country's collapse, saying the Shiite leader rejected an agreement to keep U.S. forces in the country and marginalized Sunni and Kurd populations in Iraq. Now Obama is sending U.S. forces back to Iraq, by the hundreds so far, to bolster security and advise Iraqi forces. The label of military advisers evokes memories of how the Vietnam War started. Another problem involves chronic and sometimes deadly delays faced by returning war veterans seeking health care from the Veterans Affairs Department. The crisis reported by CNN since November already has brought the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, various investigations and a White House report that essentially said the entire department needed an overhaul. 4) Governing woes . The VA crisis follows other problems in the Obama administration, such as the dysfunctional website for his signature health care reforms, IRS political targeting of groups seeking tax-exempt status and the 2012 terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. As expected, congressional Republicans have mounted a series of investigations, some necessary and others intended to wring as much political capital out of the controversies as possible heading up to the November elections and beyond. They also adopted obstructionist tactics after getting overrun by Democratic majorities in Obama's first term on transformative legislation such as the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reforms. The result: a gridlocked Congress of political one-upmanship, and a President who appears to have thrown up his hands in disgust by promising to act on his own as much as he can. ""We can make even more progress if Congress is willing to work with my administration and to set politics aside, at least occasionally,"" Obama said of Thursday's job report. No polling fireworks for Obama or Congress this July 4th . Republicans responded in kind, with House Speaker John Boehner saying that ""in order for us to make real progress, the President must do more than criticize."" ""There's no shortage of common ground where he can push his party's leaders in the Senate to work with us,"" Boehner said in a swipe at legislative intransigence by Senate Democrats. ""Until he provides that leadership, he is simply part of the problem."" If any solace for Obama, polls show the public dislikes Congress more than him, with the CNN compilation of recent surveys showing 14% approval for the legislators. By seeking to blame Republicans and declaring his intent to govern by regulation instead of legislation, Obama turns off voters who want to see the President engaged and trying, said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University. ""He sort of looks like a kid on the playground who's hiding, saying, 'Forget it, I'm not playing with you guys anymore,'"" Schiller told CNN, adding that ""even though it can be explained, the concept of a president giving up doesn't sit well with people."" Obama is the same guy who won re-election in 2012, she said, but now he comes off as powerless ""when the truth is the executive branch structure is enormously powerful."" ""The less Congress does, the more power the executive gets,"" Schiller observed. 5) ""Nattering nabobs of negativism"" Speechwriter William Safire came up with that phrase for former Vice President Spiro Agnew to complain about a liberal-leaning mainstream media during the Nixon administration. Now Obama faces the resulting backlash -- a vitriolic right-wing media machine that feeds and enhances Republican attack politics. From talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh to Fox News to the rest of an industry spawned in the past two-plus decades, the conservative messaging reflects the deep ideological divide in the country. Obama has provided fodder to his detractors, getting cited for ""Lie of the Year"" in 2013 by PolitiFact.com for his oft-repeated, erroneous declaration that his health care reforms meant ""if you like your health care plan, you can keep it."" Schiller credited the political right with ""persuading people who do benefit from the federal government that they don't"" as part of the conservative effort to shrink the government's size and cost. ""Democrats have failed miserably to counter that,"" she said. Now, 45% of the public automatically opposes Obama, America's first African-American president, ""no matter what,"" she said, ""whether racism or ideology or both.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- They were entrusted with gold. The Beatles, shown here in 1964, left behind a wealth of material, which was carefully handled by EMI's engineers. When the Beatles' longtime record label, EMI, decided to remaster the Beatles' music, they gave the raw material to a handful of men. Among them were EMI engineers Allan Rouse, the project coordinator, and Sean Magee. Rouse, in particular, was familiar with the tapes. He was the person who had copied them from their original analog form to digital as a safety backup in 1991. He's since worked on the Beatles projects ""Live at the BBC,"" ""The Beatles Anthology"" and ""Let It Be ... Naked."" CNN's Jim Boulden was given the chance to sit down with Rouse and Magee. The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview. For the complete interview -- including some technical details -- click here (.pdf file -- requires Adobe Acrobat) CNN: Why was this project taken and why so long? Rouse: It was started 4 1/2 years ago and it has taken over that period of time about a year to do the whole thing. On average about two weeks per album. Explore a timeline of the Beatles over the decades . CNN: What does this allow you to do that you couldn't have done to these songs before? Rouse: When they were originally transferred to CD in 1986, digital technology was in its infancy and the gap of 22 years has allowed for a great increase in that technology. So the transfers are far superior now and that was before we actually did any work to them. In addition to that, we had decided that we wanted to remove or improve technical faults within the recordings that could have been a bad edit, a dropout, vocal sibilance, vocal pops. Things that were directly related to the technical recording rather than the human recordings, so in other words we haven't taken out breaths or little coughs or squeaky chairs or Ringo's occasional squeaky bassdrum pedal. CNN: Tell us about the process? And that is where you came in [Sean]. Magee: The first part of the process is choosing what equipment you are going to use to do the image and the transfers. ... And then after choosing ... everything was transferred track by track into protocols, making sure the tape heads were nice and clean and the tape speed was constantly monitored, so the best possible transfer could happen. Then Guy Massey, who did all the transfers, went in with the restoration engineer -- a guy named Simon Gibson -- they then looked at all the various ticks, pops, sibilance and sorted all that out. ... That now becomes your master tape and that's when we started, really. CNN: Each [song] had its own challenges? Magee: Absolutely. CNN: What were the differences? Would it take a week on a song, six months on a song? Magee: More likely four or five hours on a song. On average we took about two weeks per album. But sometimes it might be three or four hours on a song, it might be 10 minutes on a song. CNN: How much involvement was there from the Beatles themselves? Rouse: They weren't involved in the process. Obviously they have to sign off on it. So when we finished it, we provided them with a copy of every album. But the process was over such a long period of time and it would be very complicated to have involved them anyway. I'd like to think they have some trust in us because we've done numerous other jobs for Apple. CNN: And you haven't heard back and that is good news? Rouse: Basically, if the phone doesn't ring, that is good news, yes. CNN: There always will be people who say ... you are messing with something in the original -- . Rouse: Playing with the crown jewels. CNN: There probably will be a critic out there that will complain. Rouse: Yes. CNN: But you are clearly pleased with your outcome? Rouse: Yes, I think, actually before we even started work on them, by doing an [equalization] ... they actually sounded better and I think quite frankly, probably the closest they have sounded to the original masters, than they have done ever before. CNN: Anything surprise you by going through this whole process? Rouse: Probably the only surprise is that when I started buying the vinyl in the '60s, I bought stereo, so I had never heard mono, and to be honest with you it was actually quite a fascinating experience to sit and listen to, particularly ""Sgt. Pepper"" in mono. I mean, up until ""Sgt. Pepper"" and beyond, up to the White Album in fact, the monos were considered to be the real masters in the sense that in the '60s Britain wasn't up to speed, we hadn't quite got to stereo. The only people who really had stereo in those days were people who could afford it and invariably that meant they were listening to classical music or middle-of-the-road music. ... To suddenly hear the monos, I don¹t think, in fact, I had listened to the mono ""Sgt. Pepper"" in all the years I have been doing Beatles work. Until this particular time. CNN: The press release says you took out bad edits. I didn't know there would have been bad edits in the original Beatles. Rouse: There wasn't many to be honest, I mean it was just an issue that we could deal with now. There were a few songs where they had created it over two takes and they wanted to use a part of one take and a part of another, and sometimes the edit wasn't as good as it could be. In some cases we couldn't do anything about it, But if we could we would try and smooth it over so it wasn't so obvious. CNN: Did you achieve [what you were going for]? Rouse: I think that's up to other people to judge, isn't it. ... It was a team effort. And I think that was the most important thing, one person wasn¹t involved in just doing the one thing. In fact it would have been ... CNN: Awful? Rouse: ... it would have been unfair. CNN: Was there a time pressure as well? Rouse: No there was no time pressure. There was a possibility of them coming out sooner, but we were way up anyway by that point. That got extended. I think that when EMI put the press release out, we all did a double take and thought, ""Oh my God, they're coming out now. We can¹t do anything about it now. Should we go back and start again?"" There was some fear and trepidation at that point. Realizing that after four years not quite knowing when they were gonna come out, to suddenly be told ""That's it, no more time lads.

"(CNN) -- A massive gust of wind brought down a stage at the Indiana State Fair on Saturday night, killing at least four and injuring 24, officials said. Authorities said they feared more casualties.

"(CNN) -- In rolling out its Galaxy Gear on Wednesday, Samsung effectively launched the smartwatch wars, becoming the biggest player in an emerging gadget market that could soon see Apple, Google and others join the fray. ""Today, Samsung reinvents a centuries-old product,"" Samsung research director Pranav Mistry said at a launch event in Berlin. ""I can proudly say Galaxy Gear is a design statement, an engineering marvel and something that really redefines tomorrow."" So, no false modesty here. But, what did everyone else have to say? Tech bloggers' first impressions of the watch, which will go on sale in late September in much of the world and in October in the United States and Japan, were predictably less grandiose than that. Many complimented the Gear as a significant step forward in mobile technology with a host of interesting features and the potential for even more. But its $299 price tag was a concern for many, as were worries that sluggish responses on some apps will turn out to be a persistent problem, not a case of opening-day jitters. Others complained the watch must be synced with a Galaxy phone or tablet to get the most out of its functionality. We've rounded up some thoughts from folks who got an early look at the connected watch, which will compete against rival devices from Pebble, Sony and other makers. Keep in mind that many of them had limited time with the device and some will publish more in-depth reviews later. Consumer Reports . ""We like what we saw in a brief meeting with Samsung, though the Galaxy Gear had several shortcomings, such as no direct support (yet) for Facebook or Twitter and a display that stays on only briefly with each press of the power button,"" reviewer Mike Gikas wrote after a short hands-on with the device. The full Consumer Reports review will come later. ""The Galaxy Gear ... appears to be one of the most useful devices to adorn the wrist since the wristwatch. But its expected initial high price could limit its appeal to early adopters with deep pockets."" The Verge . ""The Galaxy Gear, Samsung's latest foray into the smartwatch category, is now official and it's quite unlike anything you've seen before,"" wrote Vlad Savov. ""Yes, it's a smartphone accessory that can pick up notifications, control music playback, and keep time with a rich variety of watch faces, but Samsung takes it a few steps further by integrating a 1.9-megapixel camera, a speaker, and two microphones â€” allowing you to shoot short 720p movies and even conduct phone calls with the Galaxy Gear ... . ""Most of all, however, I find it hard to justify spending the $299 asking price on an accessory like the Galaxy Gear. It's too dependent on its parent device for functionality â€” which will cost you a fair amount too â€” and, like all other smartwatches, fails to truly live up to the ''smart' part of its name."" TechCrunch . In a piece titled ""Your turn, Apple,"" Matt Burns wrote he's intrigued, even though Samsung tends to release imperfect products, then improve them. ""The Galaxy Gear watch seems to hit most checkboxes. The watch's design is fashion-forward without being completely nerdy. It's available in a wide range of colors. And it packs a good amount of tech including a camera into a modest-sized frame. The screen is attractive. It's open to applications and there's even a camera in the wrist band, because why not.

"Editor's note: Robert Menendez is the junior senator from New Jersey and the author of a new book, ""Growing American Roots: Why Our Nation Will Thrive As Our Largest Minority Flourishes."" Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, says that in the U.S., Latinos are no longer on the outside looking in. Across America, the Latino population is growing, and it is now the largest minority group in the country. Latino voices are being heard, and their economic impact is being felt in the marketplace, which is good for the whole of the nation. Contrary to what may be a popular belief, most Latinos in America today are U.S. citizens. Many barely live above the poverty line, but many others have entered the ranks of the middle class and are contributing mightily to the culture as well as the economy. Latinos are no longer on the outside looking in. They are at the table, making a difference. On every major issue before Congress and every major issue before the courts, Latinos, in larger and larger numbers, are engaged in the debate. Our nation will thrive as our largest minority flourishes. It's important to remember that, particularly in tough times such as these. Latinos have many role models, and now we have one more: Justice Sonia Sotomayor on the United States Supreme Court. Sotomayor and I grew up at the same time in similar circumstances. She was raised in public housing in the Bronx. I was raised poor, in a tenement building in Union City, New Jersey, the son of Cuban immigrants. My mother was a seamstress; my father an itinerant carpenter. I was the first in my family to go to college. I never dreamed that one day, I would be elected as one of 100 United States senators in a country of 300 million people, and be able to cast my vote in favor of the confirmation of an eminently qualified Hispanic judge who lived across the river from that old tenement in Union City. It was a proud moment for me, one I will always remember as a highlight of my time in the Senate. One day, a new generation of young Latinos will follow in the footsteps of Sotomayor and other pioneering public servants. They will build on the successes of our community, contribute to strengthening our economy and leave their mark on the community and on our nation. Being at the heart of the debate, part of the greater American community, is nothing new for Latinos in this nation. In my new book, I write that it is incumbent on us, as Latinos, to remind ourselves and the rest of America about our long presence here and the contribution we have made -- and about how the success of the Latino community is important for the success of the entire country. Latino patriots have served and fought in every war. They are artists, dancers, singers, poets and journalists, teachers and scientists. More and more Latinos are becoming entrepreneurs and businesspeople, contributing to the wealth and economic well-being of the nation. But they have also been characteristically humble, and have not spoken enough about their accomplishments and the contributions they have already made to the fabric of this nation. From the earliest days of the republic -- indeed well before the Revolution -- Latinos have been an integral part of the establishment of this country. All Americans should have access to that history. In politics alone, Latinos have played a larger role than most realize. Technically, the first Latino in Congress was Jose Marion Hernandez, who served briefly from 1822 to 1823 as a delegate from Florida before it became a state in 1845. Romualdo Pacheco of California won by one vote in 1876 to become the first Hispanic member of the United States Congress. The first Hispanic senator was Octaviano Larrazolo of New Mexico, who served for a short time in 1928 before resigning because of ill health. There have been three Latino Nobel Prize winners from the United States and 11 Latino astronauts, and the list goes on. We need to enhance the teaching of the story of Hispanic life in America which will, in the end, shed more light than heat on the immigration debate taking place across this nation. Latinos themselves need to fully understand and appreciate their accomplishments, but also to understand, as a community, where we have fallen short. Millions of Latinos are graduating into the middle class. More Latino children are going to colleges and universities than ever before. Latinos are increasingly serving in public office and in key areas of the economy. But, at the same time, despite this progress in education, too many Latino children are dropping out of school. Too many families are struggling to make ends meet. And too many Latinos suffer from a lack of adequate health care. These are the realities, some we can justifiably be proud of. Others we must honestly confront and address if we are to succeed together as a nation, achieve our full potential and bring the next generation along. Growing roots in America means recognizing our past, acting now and preparing the road for those new generations who will follow. It means engaging in sweeping efforts to improve education for Latinos and all American children, including specific programs to bring along those who have fallen behind in school through no fault of their own. It means comprehensive health care, elder care and economic opportunity -- the same rights that all Americans want and deserve. We must engage and encourage young Hispanics to enter public service, to be part of the debate, to be at the table and be part of the solution. We must instill in them a sense of history and a belief that it is our duty and obligation to give something back to the community to build a better, stronger nation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Menendez.","Robert Menendez: Latinos are now are at the political table, making a difference .

"(CNN) -- In recent weeks, a series of CNN articles have appeared purporting to get to the bottom of male infidelity. ""Men More Likely to Cheat on Women With Bigger Paychecks,"" one headline informs us; yet in the body of the article we are told that the opposite is true as well: ""A man who makes significantly more money than his girlfriend or wife is also more likely to cheat."" It's a bit bewildering, keeping track of all the things that could cause a man to be unfaithful. Earn too much and he might cheat, but earn too little and he might cheat then, too. Association is not the same as causality, but news outlets have latched on to this anyway as the reason actress Sandra Bullock was betrayed; high-and-low-earning ladies everywhere had better beware. This article and others like it that surface in the media every so often amount to something of a cottage industry in the justification of male infidelity. Scratch the surface of any of them and you get a phenomenon of male entitlement that is oddly abetted by some women. For example, if you thought that the man himself had anything to do with it, former ""sugarbabe"" and mistress Holly Hill explains otherwise in an article that ran a few weeks ago: ""Men are hardwired to betray women on the long-term."" In this view, man is but a victim of faulty ""wiring"" -- although the wires evidently worked well enough to fund her ""sugarbabe"" business. But the real eye-opener was psychologist Christopher Ryan's CNN.com essay, ""Monogamy unnatural for our sexy species."" Before reading this, I hadn't realized that I could have a ""central, respected role"" as part of a ""harem of women"" and that marriage was all a ruse to make the ""human female [into] just another possession for men to accumulate and defend, along with his house, slaves and asses."" I have already notified my husband that I am onto him, and that he may no longer defend nor accumulate me for ""pair bonding."" Curiously, accumulating large numbers of other women poses no problem, according to Ryan. For on account of ""women's pendulous breasts"" -- and the vast evolutionary forces that have produced them -- he suggests it's ""utterly natural"" for men to cheat, or to exhibit ""nonpossessive, gregarious sexuality."" We are, he points out, ""the most sexual species on earth."" At first I was confused about why this sexuality can only be expressed via multiple partners, but then I got to the part about the ""Bonobos [who] famously enjoy frequent group sex that leaves everyone relaxed and conflict-free."" And who, really, can argue with that? All I ask, as a woman, is for consistency. When we turn to the bonobos to be our guides, let's not be quite so selective about the take-home message. Let us try to examine every species more thoroughly. For example: true, women have ""pendulous breasts,"" but hey, men have pendulous ears, and what could those possibly be for? Any serious evolutionary scholar can plainly see that the human male is designed to be listening to women at all times. That's why their ears are larger. Ryan claims that, since the male organ is ""the longest [and] thickest,"" we cannot deny the evidence that ""prehistoric promiscuity"" is part of our primate inheritance. Yet this fascinating investigation is cut short. If we continue traveling further upwards, we discover that a man's arms are also generally longer and thicker than a woman's. From a strictly scientific standpoint, here we see a strong indication that a man is evolutionarily adapted to give out more back rubs than he gets. Sure, today an individual man can refuse a request for a massage, but when the next wave of natural selection works its magic, he may find that his massage-phobic genes are out of the running. Once at the Toronto Zoo, my family witnessed a male orangutan picking nits off his baby's hair, while the female lolled about peacefully, grooming herself under a tree. Can there be any clearer precedent, from an evolutionary perspective, for men to scrape the dinner plates while women get manicures? Another time on YouTube, I saw a female gorilla munching on stinging nettles, even though they seemed to bother her. It was a humbling, yet powerful directive for me to go shopping even though I couldn't really afford a new outfit. Ladies, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. It is time to stop arguing with evolutionary theorists when they use bonobo behavior to justify their own low standards. Why should men have a monopoly on the totally arbitrary selection of chimp behavior that renders their own predilections normative under the guise of scientific observation? I am picking up my pad of paper, I am ready to take notes and I am headed for the zoo. Do the gorillas speak to you, too? If they don't, simply write to let me know what behavior of yours you'd like to rationalize, and I am confident that working together as a scientific team, we can find a gorilla somewhere out there doing that very thing with a vengeance. Let's face it -- the new ""science"" of infidelity is just not very scientific. It certainly provides a convenient ""out"" to deny personal responsibility, but anyone who buys this ""science"" is missing out on the best parts of being human: the freedom that comes from self-control and the intimacy that can only come with commitment. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Wendy Shalit.","Wendy Shalit says recent articles spin evolutionary theories to justify infidelity .
One says men more likely to cheat on breadwinner wives, but also on low-earning wives .
Another claims men ""hardwired"" to cheat, she says; a third says infidelity natural, as with apes .
Shalit: Infidelity ""science"" a convenient excuse; men's better selves have self-control ."
"(CNN) -- In a picture posted on Facebook, a man in a white shirt holds his daughter in his arms. She holds an Israeli flag. The caption reads: ""Iranians we will never bomb your country. We ♥ you."" A response on the same page: An Iranian tells the story of being forced to walk over an Israeli flag every day when entering his school. Years of being taught to hate the Israeli flag had an effect, he says. But ""after seeing your daughter holding the flag, I do not feel that way anymore, and I am so happy. Now: I love that blue, I love that star, I love that flag."" The man in the white shirt is Israeli graphic designer Ronny Edry. With his wife, Michal Tamir, and their students at a small graphic design school, they've started an Internet meme. And slowly, but steadily, Israelis are expressing their hopes for peace, and Iranians are responding in kind. While it's surprising and moving to see these unfamiliar images, it's also tempting to dismiss Edry's project as the latest example of ""slacktivism,"" activism that's as simple as a mouse click, with little or no effect in the real world. After all, it's probably unrealistic to believe that Invisible Children's ""Kony 2012"" online campaign, viewed by more than one hundred million people on YouTube, will bring a Ugandan warlord to justice. So it's at least as unrealistic to believe that Israeli and Iranian leaders, both playing to their political bases with threats of war, will be swayed by these images. That casual dismissal may be too simple and too cynical. One of the more unexpected outcomes of Invisible Children's campaign to bring Joseph Kony to justice was the response of Ugandans via social media. Upset that the Kony 2012 video misrepresented the situation in her country, Ugandan blogger and journalist Rosabell Kagumire posted her own video to YouTube. And 500,000 views later, she found herself appearing on CNN, explaining the importance of focusing on the path toward stability in northern Uganda and not on arresting a single warlord. Kagumire felt that Invisible Children didn't represent her voice and used social media to make herself heard. Edry, and the participants in Israel ♥ Iran, are making the point that their governments don't speak on their behalf when they threaten war. Through social media, they can challenge an official narrative and make clear that neither Israel nor Iran is a monolith. It's worth noting that while most of the Israeli images feature photos of people looking into the camera, few Iranian images do. One features a black and white photo of an Iranian diplomat who rescued 4,000 French Jews from the Holocaust. Another showcases a Jewish shrine in Iran. Iranians know that expressing solidarity with Israelis online could lead to harassment or arrest and are finding ways to reach out -- often making clear that their sympathies are with ""the Israeli people"" instead of the state of Israel -- without putting themselves at undue risk. Will an effort like Israel ♥ Iran force either the Netanyahu or Ahmedinejad government to listen to the voices of dissenting citizens? No. Will it complicate the dialogue occurring in each country? Perhaps. It offers evidence that not all Israeli citizens see Iran as an implacable enemy, and it replaces the faces of leaders with the faces of ordinary people. A path toward war for Israel involves seeing Ahmedinejad as a madman; a path toward peace starts with seeing Israelis and Iranians as real people. What do movements such as Israel ♥ Iran mean for governments and their diplomats? It's harder to speak for a nation when citizens of that nation can demand publicly to speak for themselves. Corporations struggle to respond to customers who complain about poor service on their Facebook pages and Twitter feeds. Nonprofit organizations such as Invisible Children find themselves confronting online criticism from the people they claim to represent. Diplomats may find themselves one voice of many, complemented and contradicted by the voices of citizen diplomats such as Edry and Tamir. Expecting a series of images on the Internet to change the path of the Israeli-Iranian relationship is too much weight to put onto a simple gesture. But it's a worthy hope, and Israel ♥ Iran is a sign of things to come. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ethan Zuckerman.","Ethan Zuckerman: Israelis' Facebook page reaching out to Iran drew big response .
He says it's tempting to dismiss impact, but social media efforts produce unexpected outcomes .
He says one effect is replacing faces of leaders in conflict with faces of ordinary human beings .

"(CNN) -- Have you ever been in a heated debate with someone and said this? ""It doesn't matter how big your telescope/towed array is, if you are 100nm away you can't amplify a signal that was attenuated to zero level before it reached 10nm. It doesn't matter that there is a 'natural water telescope' named convergence zone - it would amplify sounds and you would hear even very weak signals of low or medium frequency."" Not so much? Then you're probably not an aviation geek. (By the way, CNN doesn't know what the heck that quote actually means, so if you know, leave your translation in the comments section!) ""Avgeeks,"" as they affectionately call themselves, have been around for years, but recently their passion has had a mainstream platform as the world continues to be fascinated with the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Some avgeeks are not just talking about the missing plane -- they are trying to unravel what happened to it. ""The aviation geek movement is having a moment,"" said David Parker Brown, the editor-in-chief of AirlineReporter.com, a site he founded in 2008. With a day job in higher education, the 33-year-old started the site as a passion project, in part to remind complaining air travelers that flying is incredible. ""I fly sometimes for work and I have my times when I'm not really happy about things,"" he said. ""But then I remind myself how lucky we are to be able to go from one side of the world to the other with relative ease."" Based in Seattle, AirlineReporter.com has writers located around the globe, all proudly part of the avgeek community. Though some are industry professionals, others are simply dazzled by the poetics of air travel and the machines that make it possible. Many talk dreamily about their first air travel experience, as kids lingering near the cockpit, curious about who had the authority and know-how to get such a massive thing off the ground. They savor their miniature preheated meals as if they were served at a Michelin-starred restaurant. They always get the window seat. Flying is magic to them. Planes are miracles, they're time machines. ""Come on,"" an avgeek will tell you. ""You can get on a flight from Miami, Florida, and about 16 hours later step off and be in Tokyo, Japan! Isn't that amazing!?"" Since MH370 disappeared more than a month ago with 239 passengers and crew members aboard, avgeeks have been chatting online about the mystery. On one of the most popular sites, airliners.net, posters speculate about what might have happened, some employing complex ""Good Will Hunting""-style calculations. Moderators remind everyone to be nice and to ""please keep science fiction theories and content related to past/current movies or possible future movie rights out of these threads."" The son of a pilot, Brown said that he is sad for what appears to be the tragedy of Flight 370, but pleased to see so much news coverage and avgeek chatter about air travel. ""I really don't know what happened. No one does. But I like that it's energized people to ask questions and to learn more about the avgeek world."" Plane spotting . One corner of avgeek culture involves the practice of plane spotting, even camping out together to watch for planes as they take off and land. Spotters note a plane's unique details, photograph it and post the pics online. A few months before the Malaysia plane disappeared, one of these plane spotters, Gunnar Kullenberg, took a photo of a Boeing 777-200 at the Los Angeles airport. He was shocked when he realized he'd captured an image of the plane -- the same one that flew Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 -- after he matched registration numbers. About four years ago, 31-year-old high school librarian Ana Peso received a camera as a gift and wanted to practice shooting. She ended up at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Capturing the same shot over and over seemed like a fantastic way to train her eye, and Peso became artistically inspired by the abstract quality of airline logos. She also noticed that focusing her camera skyward had a relaxing, almost meditative, effect on her. Peso isn't interested in learning how to fly, but still, she marvels at the mechanics of flight. ""I've also come to appreciate technology so much more -- it's so cool,"" she said. ""It's amazing to me that these enormous Boeing 747s with four engines fly."" As for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Peso won't venture a guess about what happened. ""To me,"" she said, ""it's a human tragedy first."" Flight club . But there are plenty of aviation geeks who want to analyze what might have happened. The Professional Pilots Rumour Network -- PPRuNe for short -- attracts diehards with seemingly robust technical expertise. A sample of a post is at the top of this story. Unfortunately, the first rule of PPRuNe is you don't talk to reporters about PPRuNe, according to a webmaster calling himself Rob who politely declined an interview request. The site has been running for more than 18 years, he said, without advertising or press releases. PPRuNe has every imaginable conversation thread about aviation, from insider career news to threads connecting expat pilots and other industry professionals. There's a group called ""Freight Dogs"" and one for helicopter pilots called ""Rotorheads."" Flying far above the other threads, with 15 million views, is the one dedicated to analyzing the Malaysia Airlines plane mystery. The first post in the thread appears to have been made shortly after the plane went missing on March 8. It winds for pages through various theories far too technical to summarize here. The most recent posts discuss the possible origin and nature of the latest pings searchers have heard in the southern Indian Ocean, where authorities say the plane crashed. A network of theories . To author, outdoor adventurer and aviation expert Jeff Wise, those highly technical posts on sites like PPRuNe are the most intriguing part of the hunt for Malaysia Flight 370. Flight enthusiasts are trying to reverse engineer some of the conclusions, working backward from theories put forth by authorities in order to pinpoint precisely where the wreckage is, he said. ""These people online who are so passionate and skilled are trying to recreate the original data set so that we the public can try out different routes and make our own decisions,"" said Wise. ""It's very exciting what has started to happen in online forums. It's not just people geeking out. They are moving the ball forward in the search."" Wise, 47, grew up outside Boston, and his father worked in the aviation industry. Posters of planes decorated his bedroom walls. As an adventure writer he spent time in bush planes. ""I got a bug,"" he said. ""I find myself having dreams about it. Once you've gone that far, you're in for life."" But the disappearance of Flight 370 has brought the discussion to the mainstream. When Boston police investigating a broken window at Wise's home discovered he had recently been on CNN talking about the missing plane, they peppered him with questions -- about the plane. ""The cops turn to me and ask, 'Well, what do you think happened?' And we spent 30 minutes talking about what might have happened."" Former commercial airline pilot Scott Miller said more people are interested in talking to him about his lifelong passion. His flight technology students at Sacramento City College are fascinated with the Malaysia Airlines incident. While he's teaching them practical lessons, there's no doubt all the reasons he loves flying shine through in his class. ""No matter what is going on on the group, when you're up in the air, all that matters is how you're going to get yourself to your destination. I love that focus,"" he said. ""You're dealing with challenges that come up in the flight. My friends ask me: 'Isn't it boring to fly the same routes?' No, the weather, the passengers, the flight conditions -- it's always different. I'm always so excited by that!"" Miller said he's excited by a new generation of aviation geeks who are using social media to connect and learn. Born this way . The Twitterverse has been an incredible tool for aviation geeks, according to Ben Granucci, a contributor at NYCAviation.com, a worldwide aerospace news, resource and consulting organization. ""I can find news on something that's happened -- like an airline's first flight -- just seconds after it happens."" On Twitter, #avgeek is a popular hashtag. Conversations online among flight fans, he said, are nearly always polite. ""No matter where people are from -- age, race, gender, sexual orientation -- we have this thing in common and we can talk about it all day long. ""There's just something that draws us."" Granucci took a moment when asked why flying stokes his imagination. ""That's a tough one,"" he answered. ""I was born this way. I've had my eyes in the sky for as long as I can remember. It just always fascinated me that there were things up there and people in them. When I was a kid I would hear a plane and run to the window. When I was in the backyard and heard one overhead, I'd look up. Sorry to be cliche, but it wasn't something that I wanted. It was something that found me."" CNN's Rose Arce contributed to this story.","Some aviation geeks have been trying to solve the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 .

"(CNN) -- Security forces under Hamas rule have tortured Gaza prisoners during the group's five years of rule, a new report said Wednesday. The Human Rights Watch report also documents ""serious abuses"" in Gaza's criminal justice system, such as arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions and unfair trials in the Palestinian territory of Gaza since the Hamas political movement took control in 2007. ""After five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights, and grants impunity to abusive security services,"" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director for Human Rights Watch, said in an online posting Wednesday. ""Hamas should stop the kinds of abuses that Egyptians, Syrians, and others in the region have risked their lives to bring to an end."" Read more: Opinion: Hamas at a crossroads . In a bullet-point statement on its website, Hamas' Interior Ministry disputed the report's accuracy and called it biased and political. Titled ""Abusive System: Criminal Justice in Gaza,"" the 43-page report said ""there is ample evidence that Hamas security services are torturing people in custody with impunity and denying prisoners their rights."" The group said Hamas has executed at least three men ""convicted on the basis of 'confessions' apparently obtained under torture."" Human Rights Watch says the rivalry between the Palestinian movements of Hamas and of Fatah, which prevails in the West Bank, ""remains a significant factor"" behind many of the alleged Hamas detainee abuses . The group said the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority ""arrests and detains Palestinians arbitrarily, including Hamas members or sympathizers, and similarly subjects detainees to torture and abuse."" Read more: Can rival Palestinian factions reach unity deal? Human Rights Watch's findings are also consistent with increasing reports of abuse by security forces in Gaza against detainees accused of nonpolitical crimes, including people accused of drug offenses and fraud. Some of the cases documented have been ""against people detained on suspicion of collaborating with Israel or the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. Collaboration is a serious crime under Palestinian law, but suspicion of collaboration does not justify torture or other abuse."" Abdel Karim Shrair, for example, was charged with collaborating with Israel, the report said. His family and lawyer said he was tortured. But the group said military courts didn't ""adequately address Shrair's claims of torture."" Last year, a firing squad executed Shrair. According to the report, ""his mother said that Hamas authorities had prohibited the family from burying him, and that police beat her when she tried to hold his body during the interment."" ""There is ample evidence that Hamas security services are torturing people in custody with impunity and denying prisoners their rights,"" Stork said. ""The Gaza authorities should stop ignoring the abuse and ensure that the justice system respects Palestinians' rights."" Islam Shawran, a spokesman for Hamas' Interior Ministry, said Hamas gave Human Rights Watch all of the information it requested, but was surprised that it wasn't taken into consideration. And why, he asks, is the reporting about incidents from 2007 and 2008 now being released? ""It is obvious because it is a cover for the Zionist occupation. Also this report did not discuss the basic human needs of the Gaza people by discussing the Israeli siege on the Gaza Strip and did not indicate to any of the violations committed by the Israeli Zionist enemy to our Palestinian prisoners inside the Israeli jails and prisons,"" he said. CNN's Kareem Khadder in Jerusalem contributed to this report.","Intra-Palestinian rivalry is a ""significant factor' behind abuses, report says .

Sixteen other soldiers were wounded in the attack, government officials said. Eight more rebels died in a counterattack by Turkish forces, the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported.

"New York (CNN) -- A 35-year-old New York man has been charged with hate crimes in connection with seven ""knockout"" assaults, including attacks on two elderly women and a mother walking with her daughter, police said Saturday. Barry Baldwin, a Brooklyn resident, was charged with six counts of assault as a hate crime, six counts of aggravated harassment as a hate crime, and other crimes for a spate of attacks between November 9 and December 27 in predominantly Jewish sections of Brooklyn, police said. Possible 'knockout' game victim: 'The whole group of kids laughed' On November 9, Baldwin allegedly punched a 78-year-old woman who was pushing a stroller -- apparently as part of the ""knockout"" assault game, where people try to knock a random stranger unconscious with a single blow. The victim was knocked to the ground. FBI agent quotes Texas man bragging about 'knockout' On December 7, he allegedly struck again, punching a 20-year-old woman in the back of the head in Brooklyn. Between December 21 and December 27, Baldwin allegedly assaulted five more women, including a 33-year-old woman who was walking with her young daughter and another 78-year-old woman. After the attack on the woman walking with her 7-year-old daughter in the Midwood section of Brooklyn, police released a sketch of the suspect. The mother was punched in the back of the head and knocked down, police said. She sustained minor injuries to her knees and hands. The suspect fled on foot. Police keep close eye on reports of disturbing 'knocking' game . Baldwin was arrested December 29 by hate crimes detectives canvassing the neighborhoods where the previous attacks occurred, police said.

"San Diego (CNN) -- The latest person to accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment is a great-grandmother. Peggy Shannon, 67, who works at the Senior Citizens Service Desk in San Diego City Hall, allegedly faced ""continuous inappropriate sexual advances by the mayor while trying to do her job,"" according to the office of her attorney, Gloria Allred. Shannon said the mayor kissed her and once asked ""me if I thought he could go eight hours in one night."" ""Every day that I went to work, I had butterflies in my stomach because I did not know what was going to happen the next time the mayor came by my desk,"" Shannon told reporters Thursday. ""I have three sons, four grandsons and two great grandsons. As our mayor, you should be -- but are not -- a role model for any of them,"" she said. Later, Shannon spoke to CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live,"" and called for the mayor's resignation. ""I can forgive anybody but he needs to step down,"" she said. ""People are surprised that as a great-grandmother that this happened to me -- so it could happen to anybody else."" Shannon is the 16th woman to come forward with such allegations, according to CNN affiliate KFMB. Filner's office has not responded to multiple CNN requests for comment on the allegations. As the list grows, city officials said Thursday that Filner might be booted from office later this month over a different, but related issue: money. Hooters blackballs San Diego mayor . 'Inappropriate movement on my body' A local attorney became the 15th accuser against Filner, speaking to KFMB this week. Kathryn Vaughn told the station that after her husband walked away at a public event 10 years ago, Filner ""made an inappropriate movement on my body."" Filner, 70, was elected mayor of the eighth-largest American city in 2012, after 10 terms in Congress. His accusers range from a singer at a campaign fundraiser to his former communications director, who called him unfit for office. He has rebuffed calls to resign from all nine City Council members and from fellow Democrats, including California's two U.S. senators. He now faces a recall effort that is trying to gather more than 100,000 signatures needed to put his future up to a new vote, though some political observers doubt organizers can succeed. In July, Filner acknowledged that he ""failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me"" and that he was ""embarrassed"" by his actions. But he also said he would be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts"" and he would not resign. Out of rehab, but locked out of office . Mayor could be booted over money . Now, investigators are also looking into possible financial impropriety -- including questionable charges at the Westgate Hotel, where Filner allegedly took women. The San Diego's City Attorney's Office told CNN Thursday that it had found the charges were inappropriate. Filner's attorney and the mayor's office did not respond to CNN's requests for comment Thursday. The city attorney's office said a rarely used section of the city charter, Section 108, dating back to 1931, would allow for Filner to be removed from office -- without a recall -- over unauthorized payments from the city treasury. The city council plans to vote August 28 on whether to invoke that section. If it does, it would then ask a court to boot Filner from office. Did Mayor Filner target victims of military sexual assault? Kevin Faulconer, a Republican who sits on the council's audit committee, raised questions about other charges as well. He alleged that Filner charged hundreds of dollars in personal expenses and threatened the city's credit by failing to pay the bill. The mayor's city credit card was stopped in July, Faulconer's office said. ""Mayor Filner's continued abuse of power knows no bounds,"" the councilman said in a statement. ""Based on this new evidence, I am broadening the scope of my Audit Committee hearing to investigate how Mayor Filner was able to circumvent credit card rules and how to prevent negative effects on the City's credit rating as a result of one person's misuse of taxpayer dollars.""

"(CNN) -- The secrecy surrounding ""Man of Steel,"" due June 14, is pretty extraordinary, but composer Hans Zimmer was able to give CNN a glimpse of what to expect when we caught up with him this week regarding the score he did for ""The Bible."" Asked if the two projects had anything in common, since both involve a savior figure (Jesus, Kal-el) sent by his father to Earth, Zimmer laughed and said, ""Yes. Yes is the answer. Once you see Superman, you'll see how close you are with your question."" ""Both stories are passions,"" Zimmer continued, ""about a struggle to do the right thing. For Superman, it was a really simple question for me. What does it take to become a good man? To be good? And what does that mean in our more and more complex society? Do any of these values still resonate with us?"" Zimmer said he came to this understanding about director Zack Snyder's take on Superman (which reboots the series, instead of coming in at a later point a la ""Superman Returns"") because he was questioning how he would score the film and not remind audiences of John Williams' iconic fanfare theme. ""Look, that was daunting,"" Zimmer confessed. ""Seriously. He's the greatest film composer out there, without a doubt, and it happens to be one of his iconic pieces of music, so I spent three months just procrastinating and not even getting a start on the thing, because I was so intimidated: 'Oh my God, I'm following in John Williams' footsteps.'"" His way around this, he said, was to look at the Superman story in a ""very different way."" ""I kept thinking of the story as, What if you are extraordinary, and your entire ambition is to join humanity? To become human? What does it mean to become human? What does it mean to be an outsider who really wants to join the human race?"" ""Man of Steel,"" which replaces Brandon Routh with Henry Cavill, is the origin story of Superman, starting with a young Clark Kent discovering that he has extraordinary powers and is not from planet Earth. As he grows up, he learns where he came from and what he was sent to this planet to do, as he becomes a symbol of hope for humanity. The film also stars Russell Crowe as Jor-el (Kal-el's birth father on Krypton), Diane Lane and Kevin Costner as Martha and Jonathan Kent (his adoptive parents), Michael Shannon as General Zod (so expect some trouble there), Laurence Fishburne as Daily Planet editor Perry White, and Amy Adams as reporter/love interest Lois Lane. (""She's fun and sassy, in control, getting into trouble, and always looking for a headline!"" Adams enthused earlier). While it remains to be confirmed, the latest rumor is that Mackenzie Gray is playing Lex Luthor, although he doesn't appear in the trailer. Coming off three Dark Knight films directed by Christopher Nolan (""Batman Begins,"" ""The Dark Knight,"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises""), Zimmer also didn't want to do ""another really dark"" superhero movie. ""Everything's tinged with irony and sarcasm and bitterness and darkness these days,"" he said. But this Superman is something lighter, he said, ""celebrating everything that was good and fine about America,"" such as small towns ""where people don't lock their doors, neighbors get together, and families are families."" ""What was important for Superman was the simple fact that none of us pay much attention to the Midwest,"" Zimmer said. ""I know America mainly by the big cities, but if you go into the Midwest, there is a people there and there is a country there. And I thought it was important that the decent folk, simple folk be the heart of the story, and a character who is guileless, who isn't complicated in the sort of flawed way our Dark Knight is, and isn't political in any way. He's just striving to become a better part of humanity."" This perspective on Superman, the German-born composer said, is something that he came by in part because he's a foreigner. ""I think partly what we foreigners are good at is looking at America, not in a judgmental way, but wide-eyed, and seeing the things you take for granted and presenting them in a new way,"" he added. ""Like for 'Thelma and Louise' and the Grand Canyon, most American kids wouldn't want to go there for their holiday, but to us it's a magical, magnificent place."" Sonically, this treatment of America comes across via a grouping of pedal steel guitars (instead of the usual string section), banging titanium and steel sculptures, and organizing ""a who's who of drummers"" in a 12-member drum circle, including Jason Bonham, Sheila E. and Pharrell Williams. ""The great thing about Superman is that everybody loves Superman,"" Zimmer said with a laugh. ""It's very easy making the call and saying, 'Hey, can you come?' I remember phoning Pharrell and him saying, 'I'm right in the middle of producing the Beyonce album in Miami.' 'Jason Bonham's in Miami, and he's getting on a plane!' Next morning, there's Pharrell, looking a little bleary-eyed."" As a producer on ""Man of Steel,"" Nolan, who also collaborated on the story, initially acted as a sounding board for some of Zimmer's ideas (""getting rid of my demons,"" as he put it) but soon stepped aside so he wouldn't be ""a mistress in the mix"" between Zimmer and director Zack Snyder, especially since Zimmer's involvement in the whole project stemmed from a misunderstanding in the first place. ""A journalist asked me (at an 'Inception' party) if I was going to do Superman, and I hadn't even heard of it, so I went, 'Absolutely no way,'"" Zimmer said. ""Somehow in the noise of that party, that got misconstrued as 'Absolutely Hans is doing it.' It was all over the Internet that I was doing Superman, and I'd never even met Zack! So I phoned him up, 'I'm really sorry, this wasn't my doing, this is a misunderstanding.' And he said, 'Oh! It's great that you phoned. Maybe we should meet and talk.'"" So they did, and Nolan urged Zimmer to sign up. ""I remember him going, 'Of course you can do it. What's the big deal? I did Batman.' And I said, 'Excuse me, you went to Warner Bros. with an idea of how you were going to do Batman, and you're saying I'm supposed to do Superman, but I don't have the idea in my head.' I have to sneak up on it!"" And with Snyder, now he has.","Composer Hans Zimmer scored the upcoming Superman movie, ""Man of Steel.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The recent visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington primarily focused on Iran's nuclear program -- a long way from previous meetings that had, more often than not, focused on Israeli-Palestinian relations. There is little talk about a peace process these days. The Arab Awakening, as it's known in the region, was initially greeted with hope and optimism by Palestinians but has since given way to diminished hopes for a negotiated two-state solution. For Palestinians watching today's U.S.-Israeli dynamic from the sidelines, their disappointment with U.S. President Barack Obama following his speech on Sunday to pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC is palpable. In that speech, Obama reiterated U.S. support for the Jewish state as it faces of concerns about Iran. ""I have heard the comments among Palestinians about whether President Obama is President of Israel or President of the United States ... I found his language during his AIPAC speech as demeaning and dangerous,"" said veteran Palestinian politician Hanan Ashrawi, before adding that the U.S. President was, in her view, shielding Israel in a personal way. The continued building of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, combined with moribund U.S.-backed peace talks, has resulted in Palestinian political strategy becoming about survival and dependence. ""The Palestinians have lost the initiative,"" says Dr. Mahdi Abdul-Hadia, head of the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs (PASSIA), a Palestinian research and analysis center in Jerusalem. ""For the first time Palestinians are depending on external factors [to make progress]."" To that end, they have been following several tracks: the recent Jordanian-sponsored talks with Israel; reconciliation efforts sponsored by Egypt between the Palestinian political factions Hamas and Fatah; aid and reconstruction efforts by the Gulf states; and focusing on Iranian influence on Hamas. Hanan Ashrawi agreed: ""The Palestinians cannot deliver freedom on our own and we are not going to go back to the armed struggle suddenly, but at the same time you want to maintain global support for Palestinians and self determination and human rights."" The Arab Spring has prompted Hamas in Gaza to change course too. It has begun moving tentatively toward a more political form of Islam. ""Hamas is for the first time is saying civil state, democratic state, pluralistic state and this is a revolution in their thinking,"" said Dr. Mahdi. As a result -- and to the extreme annoyance of Israel and the United States -- divisions between Gaza-based Hamas, which is viewed as a terrorist organization by those countries, and the West Bank-based Fatah are being papered over amid attempts to form a unity government. ""It's difficult to say whether Hamas and Fatah can work together but if we set up a system where pluralism and differences of opinion can be expressed peacefully, they should be able to work together,"" said Dr. Ashrawi. And in a significant break with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Hamas in Gaza recently announced support for the Syrian people in their uprising. In doing so, Hamas distanced itself not only from Syria, but from Iran -- Syria's staunch ally and Hamas's key financial backer -- and more closely aligned itself with its ideological bedfellows in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood-- a group that made major headway in Egyptian elections following the revolution there. Regional changes may have given a new impetus to Hamas and Fatah on the reconciliation front, but as Dr. Ashrawi puts it, recent meetings between the two groups in Egypt show that while they are trying to work together, ""like all political parties self interest comes into play."" In the absence of any progress towards either statehood or reconciliation, Palestinian objectives have become primarily focused on the short term: buying time to prevent a total breakdown in communication and trying to prevent a breakout of violence among Palestinians-- and with Israelis.","'Arab Awakening' initially greeted with hope and optimism by Palestinians .

"(CNN) -- Thailand's new military ruler has added a personal touch to his junta's post-coup charm offensive, penning the lyrics to a patriotic ballad vowing to ""return happiness"" to the country. Performed by the Royal Thai Army band, the song, ""Return Happiness to Thailand,"" has so far racked up more than 200,000 views on YouTube since it was released on Friday. It is played regularly on Thai radio and television and has featured at the military's goodwill concerts around the country. Colonel Krisada Sarika, head of the Royal Thai Army band, was quoted in Thai media as saying Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha had rattled off the lyrics, in his own handwriting, in about an hour. The song includes the couplet: ""Let us be the ones who step in before it is too late / To bring back love, how long will it take?"" Since the May 22 coup d'etat, the country's 12th in 82 years, Thailand's junta has embarked on an unprecedented PR campaign to win hearts and minds in a divided country. The National Council for Peace and Order, as the regime calls itself, has held public festivals featuring mini-skirted dancers, free haircuts, petting zoos and stands where the attendees can take ""selfies"" with soldiers. On Sunday, the regime is promising free tickets to screenings of a patriotic movie across the country. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science professor at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, said the PR campaign was far more intense than those following previous coups. ""Earlier coups did not require as much PR campaigning because public expectations and media tools of scrutiny at home and abroad were less pervasive and powerful,"" he said. The campaign has been conducted under the banner of ""happiness."" On Friday, Prayuth delivered the first of a planned weekly TV and radio broadcast, ""Returning Happiness to the People,"" in which he repeatedly struck on the concept while outlining his junta's vision. ""We need to solve many issues; from administration to the budget system, corruption, and even the starting point of democracy itself -- the election. Parliamentary dictatorship has to be removed. All these have caused conflict and unhappiness among Thai people,"" he said, in comments questioning whether Thailand was ready for democracy. ""We intend to return happiness to everyone living in Thailand."" WATCH: Thai protesters reference Hunger Games movies . But the cheery overtures have been accompanied by an unrelenting crackdown on dissent, with hundreds of people rounded up, including academics, journalists, activists and politicians. The junta has urged government officials to identify potential troublemakers among their colleagues, and issued warnings about liking dissenting posts on social media or flashing the three-fingered anti-coup salute co-opted from the Hunger Games films. Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a Thai associate professor of Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University, described the happiness campaign as a ""gimmick,"" and a ""very crude form of populism"" that was unlikely to work. ""I don't think the majority of Thais will buy into this happiness project, because there is nothing to be happy about when your basic human rights have been taken away, when you cannot even express how you feel in public peacefully,"" he said. ""The reality is they're continuing to hunt down and harass people. Happiness versus a climate of fear -- it doesn't go together."" Thitinan said he believed the campaigning might help the regime, but only in the short-term. ""Initially, the hearts-and-minds campaigns will seem to hold promise because of the complete dominance of the new regime and the lack of alternatives,"" he said. ""But it would be surprising if these superficial and manufactured approaches succeed in resolving such deep-seated conflicts that have built up over many years.""

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- Bodies lie scattered in a rural field in the southern Philippines, some unearthed from a shallow grave hastily dug by the gunmen who seized the group of men and women just a day earlier. By Tuesday, search teams had found a total of 46 bodies, and it was still unclear if there were more victims from Monday's massacre. The target was a group that included the female relatives of Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao province in May. Mangudadatu said he had received threats which he believed were from allies of the incumbent governor Andal Ampatuan -- that he would be kidnapped if he filed the candidate papers himself. Instead, his wife, sister, and the group of journalists accompanying them were kidnapped and brutally killed, possibly tortured, raped and beheaded, according to local media reports. A local police commander described the grisly search operation near an isolated village, telling reporters from ABS-CBN News that 17 bodies were pulled from a single grave. ""They were piled on top of each other,"" Chief Superintendent Josefino Cataluna said. ""It looked as if they were buried hurriedly."" Those killed included at least 12 journalists, according to the press freedom organization, Reporters Without Borders, making Monday the deadliest single day for journalists anywhere in the world. It was also the worst politically motivated violence in the Philippines' recent history. Witnesses, local officials and analysts have blamed the attacks on Ampatuan, who has controlled the area for a decade and is a long-time ally of Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Ampatuan, who is known locally as a warlord, reportedly commands a private army of nearly 500 men. Philippine military officials also said Monday that the gunmen who carried out the attack were loyal to Ampatuan. Neither Ampatuan nor any of his advisers has commented on the slaying allegations. ""It's not hard to determine the motive,"" according to Philippine analyst Kenneth E. Bauzon. ""How dare this [Mangudadatu] challenge him when he knows that the governor is a position that is presumably reserved for [the Ampatuan] family."" Ampatuan reportedly wanted one of his sons to succeed him as governor of Maguindanao when he stepped down next year, according to ABS-CBN. A government construction vehicle was found at the site of the hastily dug mass grave, fueling the belief that Ampatuan or his allies had a role in the massacre. Both the Ampatuan and Mangudadatu clans have agreed to participate in the government's investigation into the killings, according to Arroyo's adviser on the Mindanao region, Jesus Dureza, who spoke to the Philippine media on Tuesday. Neither Ampatuan nor his advisers have spoken publicly about the widespread allegations, and that is most likely because he is ""weighing his options,"" Bauzon said. Now, the region is bracing for a backlash of possible reprisal killings. The Philippine government has placed Maguindanao and its surrounding regions under a state of emergency and survivors of Monday's massacre have entered a government witness protection program, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. Arroyo has sent top level government officials to Maguindanao to ""personally oversee military action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts,"" she said Tuesday. ""No effort has been spared to bring justice to the victims and hold the perpetrators accountable to the full limit of the law,"" she said. Long-running family disputes in the southern Philippines have spilled innocent blood before. Such blood feuds are known by the indigenous term, ""rido."" But Monday's massacre has broader implications, Bauzon said. ""I think that this is a culmination for many years of impunity on the part of any family or group for that matter because this has been tolerated by the Arroyo administration,"" said Bauzon, a political science associate professor at Saint Joseph's College in New York, who is from Mindanao and has authored several books on the region and its politics. ""So when the administration looks the other way when journalists report on military abuses [or] when the administration looks the other way when church workers are assassinated, when environmental workers are assassinated or abducted, you know, this [massacre] is just one or two steps away [from that]."" The killings could further damage the political reputation of Arroyo, whose administration has already been scarred by allegations of a tainted election in 2004 and criticism over her response to the recent typhoons to strike the country. ""It's a test as to what how far the Arroyo administration will go to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators,"" Bauzon said. Arroyo's term ends in May 2010, and she cannot seek re-election although there has been speculation that she could seek another political office. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the Philippines, a predominantly Christian country. Negotiations between one of those armed groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and the Philippine government broke down last year after the country's Supreme Court blocked a proposed peace deal that would have increased the size and scope of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Arroyo's government exercises little control in the region and is blamed by her critics for helping legitimize many of the armed groups that operate freely in Mindanao, including those loyal to the governor, Ampatuan. Arroyo issued an executive order in July 2006 that allowed local officials and Philippine National Police to deputize volunteer watchmen, known as barangay tanods, to fight against insurgent groups in the southern regions. This order has been blamed for allowing local politicians to convert their private militias into legal security forces. The strong clan rivalries and the armed groups that support each clan may make it impossible for Arroyo to rout out those behind Monday's mass killing, according to Bauzon. ""The dynasty is strongly entrenched and for her to disband private armies by this warlord overnight is too much of a task,"" he said. ""The Americans were not able to do it in half a century and all she can do is set her sights low by really going after the most visible of the perpetrators.""

"(CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration fired 28 of its employees -- in addition to three who resigned or retired -- following a probe that revealed bags were allowed onto planes at Hawaii's Honolulu International Airport without being properly screened, the agency said Sunday. Another 15 people were suspended, the TSA reported in a statement. The moves come after the agency ""completed the adjudication process"" it had announced in June, months after the allegations first surfaced. All those terminated or suspended ""have the right to appeal the decision,"" according to the TSA. The firing is believed to be one of, if not the biggest, such action in the agency's history, with officials previously stating that it underscores they will not tolerate employees who compromise security. In March, Honolulu's KITV 4 News reported that TSA officers assigned to a morning shift regularly allowed checked bags to be loaded onto flights on nine daily departures without being screened for explosives. Sources told the TV station that such lapses occurred for as long as four months and involved thousands of checked bags. CNN confirmed the investigation. TSA officers are required to screen 100% of all checked bags before they are stored in the cargo holds of passenger aircraft. In June, agency officials said they did not know exactly how many bags were allowed onto flights without being inspected but said the lapse took place during the last four months of 2010. The TSA said after it became aware of the problem, it took steps to ensure that every bag is properly screened at the airport. A TSA official said in June that in addition to rank-and-file screeners and some supervisors, the airport's federal security director and assistant federal security director for screening had also received letters proposing that they lose their jobs. ""TSA holds its workforce to the highest ethical standards, and we will not tolerate employees who in any way compromise the security of the traveling public,"" TSA Administrator John Pistole said then in a statement. The TSA said it uses closed-circuit TV, random inspections, covert tests and peer and management oversight to check on the integrity of the system.","Besides those fired, three people under investigation resigned or retired, the TSA said .

"(CNN) -- Militants with the Islamist group al-Shabaab stormed Somalia's presidential palace in Mogadishu on Tuesday, firing their way onto the grounds after a car bomb blasted the gate, authorities said. Somali and African Union troops exchanged heavy gunfire with the militants and thwarted the attack, a senior Somali security official said. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was not harmed and Somalia's government praised the troops. ""Fortunately, the prompt actions of the Somali National Army, assisted by AMISOM forces (African Union Mission in Somalia), quickly halted the attack,"" said government spokesman Mustafa Duhulow. Three attackers were killed and one was captured, he said. ""Bomb disposal personnel have rendered safe a number of devices, including a suicide vest that one attacker was wearing that had failed to detonate,"" Dhulow said. Al-Shabaab said it was behind the raid, one of several recent Mogadishu attacks for which the al Qaeda-linked group has claimed responsibility as it presses its campaign to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state. Earlier, al-Shabaab spokesman Abdulaziz Abu Musab claimed the group's militants had captured the offices of the President and the prime minister. ""Terrorists can make as many claims and threats on the internet as they want,"" Mohamud said from his office. ""The attack failed."" U.S. condemns attack . The U.S. State Department issued a statement condemning the attack and praising AMISOM troops, which get U.S. support. ""Incidents such as this further demonstrate that insecurity in Mogadishu persists, including very real threats from al-Shabaab,"" the statement said. The incident comes after several high-profile attacks in the capital, including a car bombing -- claimed by al-Shabaab -- that killed at least six people at the Parliament building on Saturday. On Thursday, gunmen killed one Somali lawmaker and wounded another in a drive-by shooting in Mogadishu, the third assassination of a Parliament member claimed by al-Shabaab this year. Al-Shabaab, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. The two groups effectively merged in 2012, according to CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. The group aims to establish Islamic rule in Somalia, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries, as well. It allegedly carried out a mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, in September that left at 67 people dead.

"(CNN) -- A spokesman for the Kenya Defense Forces has identified four terrorists who took part in the deadly Nairobi mall attack last month. They are: Khattab al-Kene, an American Somali; Abu Baara al-Sudani, from Sudan; Omar Nabhan, from Kenya; and a man identified only as Umayr. It was not clear what Khattab al-Kene's name may have been in the United States. The four died when the part of the mall they were in collapsed, Maj. Emmanuel Chirchir said. The charred bodies of the four are undergoing DNA verification, Chirchir said. Zain Verjee: I cant' get image of Westgate bodies out of my mind . Kenya's Counter-Terrorism Office said Nabhan was related to former senior Al Qaeda in Somalia operative, Saleh Ali Nabhan, who was killed in a U.S. strike in southern Somalia in 2009. Both men were from Mombasa, Kenya. Saleh Ali Nabhan was killed when U.S. special operations forces used a helicopter to fire on his car in September 2009. He was believed to be connected to the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was also believed to be behind the coordinated 2002 attack on an Israeli-owned hotel in Mombasa, and a failed attempt to shoot down an Israeli charter flying from Mombasa to Tel Aviv. Throughout the four-day attack at the Westgate mall, it was unclear how many perpetrators were involved. On Day Two, Kenyan authorities said between 10 and 15 attackers were involved. The Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Sources within the group said as many as three attackers were from the United States, two were from Somalia, and the others were one each from Canada, Finland, Kenya and the United Kingdom. Kenya's Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed told PBS ""NewsHour"" that the attackers came from Kenya, the UK and the U.S. ""The Americans, from the information we have, are young men, about between maybe 18 and 19."" They are of Somali origin, but lived in Minnesota or other parts of the United States, she said, adding that underlines ""the global nature of this war that we're fighting."" On Day Four, as the operation wound down, Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said five terrorists were killed by Kenyan forces. Eleven others were in custody, he said, suspected of links to the attacks. It's not over, Somali terrorists say .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Atlanta's public school system was told Tuesday it has until September 30 to make progress on a series of recommendations or risk its high schools' losing their accreditation, a fate that would affect the college hopes of many of the system's graduates. The probation placed on the system's high schools stems from complaints that conflicts between members had severely hampered the school board's ability to govern effectively, according to a statement from AdvancEd, the world's largest school accrediting agency and the parent company of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. ""This is designed to improve the school system,"" Mark Elgart, president and CEO of AdvancED, said at a news conference Tuesday. ""The (school) board and the system have a choice here: They can choose to proactively take actions designed to improve it, building on these actions we have outlined, or they can fight it."" Members of Atlanta Public Schools Board of Education met in a special session Tuesday afternoon to review the report, and will vote next week to formally accept it, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Elgart will be at next week's meeting to answer board members' questions, the newspaper said. The action is a ""grave moment in our history, but one that we must resolve,"" board member Reuben McDaniel told CNN affiliate WXIA. AdvancED conducted a special review looking into -- among other things -- a leadership shakeup initiated by the school board last summer. The board changed its policy to allow a simple majority vote to change the chair and vice chair positions, despite outside legal advice that such a policy change would be illegal. Ultimately, a lawsuit was filed challenging the move. CNN education contributor Steve Perry asks how Atlanta schools' cheating scandal could affect students. The special review also found that the board circumvented its own procurement policies in approving a contract for a communications vendor, and that the ""fallout"" from the friction on the board had become a distraction to staff. According to AdvancED, the steps the school system must take to show progress include: developing a plan to effectively communicate is mission to staff and other ""stakeholders;"" hiring a trained mediator to work with board members to resolve issues; ensuring that board policies -- ""especially those related to ethics and chain of command"" -- are understood and followed; and coming up with a plan for selecting a superintendent that ""demonstrates integrity throughout the process."" Atlanta Public Schools, which has 47,000 students, is the second large school system to have schools placed on probation, and the second in the metro area, according to Jennifer Oliver, vice president for communications for the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Schools in Clayton County, south of Atlanta, lost their accreditation in 2008 and are approaching the end of a two-year probation. In an e-mail response to a question from CNN, Oliver cautioned that Atlanta's public high schools ""are still accredited, and it's too early to speculate on about whether (the schools) will lose their accreditation."" However, she said, a loss of accreditation could mean that ""graduating seniors may be limited in scholarships and college admissions if a program requires students to come from an accredited institution and/or uses accreditation of the high school as part of the criteria for evaluating students."" The school system, which had won national awards for closing academic gaps in recent years, was rocked last year by allegations of cheating on standardized tests given to elementary and middle school students. An independent commission found that employees at 12 schools had violated testing protocols, the Journal-Constitution reported in June 2010. Because AdvancED only accredits Atlanta's public high schools, it isn't involved in the test-cheating investigation. ""However,"" Oliver said, ""how the board addresses the results of the investigation as leaders of the school system will be of interest to (AdvancED) in regards to the Accreditation Standard of Governance and Leadership, which they are currently not meeting."" CNN's Cameron Tankersley contributed to this report.","Accrediting agency on Tuesday announced probationary status for Atlanta public high schools .

"(CNN) -- The winners of the world's largest design prize have been revealed -- with miniature computers, food-saving paper, and a birthing simulator among those taking home a share of the INDEX: Award 2013. Judges at Thursday's award ceremony in HelsingÃ¸r, Denmark announced the five victors, plus the winner of the People's Choice Award -- as voted for by readers of CNN.com -- with glow-in-the-dark road concept Smart Highway taking the popular prize. The â‚¬500,000 award recognizes design innovations that address the large-scale challenges the world faces. INDEX's panel of judges deliberated over five categories of award -- Body, Home, Work, Play and Community -- aimed at rewarding design that improves lives across many different spheres. More from INDEX 2013: Exclusive coverage of this year's award for Design to Improve Life . Taking home the Play category award on the night was the most recognizable of this year's winners: the credit card-sized computer Raspberry Pi earned judges' praise for the scope of its ambition. The $25 Pi was originally designed to teach coding skills to children, but has already found an incredible range of applications: from flying into space and snapping sky-high photographs, to controlling the temperature of a craft brewery. The judges said that the objectives of the microcomputer echo INDEX's own goal of improving everyday life. ""If we want the young generation to design the future, we need to make them computer-literate,"" the jury said, adding that Raspberry Pi holds the power to make this a reality. This year's Home Award-winner Fresh Paper may be less well-known -- but could soon be having as strong an impact on lives around the world, judges believe. The square sheet of paper makes use of the natural bacteria- and fungus-inhibiting properties of spices like fenugreek to keep fruit and vegetable produce fresh for two to four times as long. Judges praised its simple design-based response to ""one of the world's largest challenges."" The affordable Fresh Paper requires no instruction or special skills to use but the jury believed it could play an important role in cutting the estimated 25% of the world's food supply lost to spoilage. More from INDEX 2013: Designs for when disaster strikes . From a strong field in the Body category -- which also included a syringe that prevents unsafe injections and a wearable robot that allows paralyzed people to walk -- judges picked the Natalie Collection. The collection comprises a trio of small devices which aim to confront the terrifying statistic of 3000 daily neonatal deaths worldwide, with judges hailing the success the device has already achieved . The collection's two simulators -- one replicating a newborn baby, the other a birthing mother -- aim to educate midwives to prevent neonatal asphyxia, while a specially-developed suction device empowers them to overcome some of the most common breathing obstructions in newborns. The widespread benefits of the devices can already be seen, as judges explained: ""More than 100,000 thousand midwives and birth helpers in 54 countries have been trained using the Natalie Collection, applying their new-found knowledge to save lives by as much as 47%."" More from INDEX 2013: A day in the life of the future city . In the Community category, the jury made the unprecedented decision of selecting two winners -- electing to forgo a Work Award in 2013. The Community Awards recognized INDEX's home city of Copenhagen for its ambitious plans to equip itself against the threat of climate change, in addition to Roosegard's Smart Highway -- which became INDEX: Award's first double-winner, having scooped the People's Choice honor on the same night. Copenhagen's Climate Adaptation Plan aims to prepare the city to face the environmental challenges of the future and avoid the widespread devastation seen when Hurricane Sandy hit the USA's coastal cities. Judges praised the Danish capital for taking the lead in addressing ""the most pressing immediate challenge for successful urban life in this century"" and spearheading the pursuit of ""a vibrant and resilient habitat for the 21st century."" Before picking up both a People's Choice and Community category award, Smart Highway inventor Daan Roosegaarde told CNN: ""I'm not so much interested in design -- I'm more interested in reforming things."" His wide-ranging concepts for reforms to our highways caught the attention of the jury of design professionals, as well as a public tired of unchanging gray streets and judges. Among his revolutionary ideas were streetlights that produce their own electricity, road lanes that charge electric cars, glow-in-the-dark road markings, and icy road warnings that appear in the cold. The INDEX judges applauded Roosegaard and lauded his reinvention of the ""dumb"" roads of the past into intelligent, safe, communicating highways for the future.","The winners of the biennial INDEX: Award 2013 were announced Thursday .

"New York (CNN) -- Traveling down New York's Fifth Avenue, 4-year-old Joseph Mezzapesa sees his favorite store, Build-A-Bear Workshop, from the back seat of the family's SUV. His face lights up. But before he can even ask, his mother answers quickly. ""We can't go in,"" she says. ""Too many people in there."" Stores aren't the only places off limits for Joseph. So are movie theaters, malls, schools and playgrounds. ""We live in isolation pretty much from November until May because of the sickness that Joseph has,"" says his mom, Donna Mezzapesa, as the family drives to a Manhattan hospital for Joseph's monthly treatment. That sickness is opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS), an extremely rare neurological disorder that can affect his motor skills and cause rapid, involuntary eye movements. Joseph developed the illness when he was about 1, as a result of having low-stage neuroblastoma cancer. His cancer is now in remission, but the OMS treatment leaves his immune system so fragile that even the slightest exposure to germs can be detrimental. ""If Joseph gets sick, even a simple cold could cause his OMS symptoms to come out,"" his mother said. ""His immune system attacks his brain, thinking that he still has neuroblastoma cancer. That's why we have to try to keep him away from anyone with illnesses."" For much of his childhood, Joseph has rarely ventured beyond his home or played with other kids. His only friend and playmate was his healthy twin sister, Alexa. All that changed last year, however, when his parents enrolled him and his sister at the Morgan Center, a preschool program in Hicksville, New York. The Morgan Center was created especially for children who are undergoing treatment for cancer and have a suppressed immune system. Alexa was enrolled so she wouldn't bring home germs from a different preschool. ""They love it because they get to be around other kids, which they're not used to,"" Donna Mezzapesa said. Battling a life-threatening disease is tough at any age, but it can be especially difficult for young children who have to be kept in isolation. Nancy Zuch learned this firsthand after her daughter, Morgan, was diagnosed with cancer at age 2. ""It was horrible that she had leukemia,"" said Zuch, 46. ""It made it worse for us that she couldn't socialize. So not only was she at the hospital and dealing with the side effects, but also she couldn't have that normal part of her childhood."" Morgan, now 13 and cancer-free, remembers the pain and the needles, but also that she couldn't go to preschool. ""The only friend I had was my brother,"" she said. Zuch was so concerned with Morgan's isolation and lack of social development that she hired a play therapist to teach Morgan some of the things that most kids take for granted, like playing, sharing and taking turns. One day at the hospital, Zuch noticed there was a play area for young cancer patients where Morgan was able to play with another child. ""I thought, 'Well, this is OK because this child also has a minimal world of exposures, also cannot be around other children due to a suppressed immune system,' "" Zuch said. ""It was safe for them to play together."" By the time Zuch got home that day, she had a clear idea for what would eventually become the Morgan Center. ""We need to start a program for children with cancer,"" she told her husband, ""so there can be a place where they can go and socialize and have friends and learn and play."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . The Zuchs opened the Morgan Center in September 2003, just a few months after their daughter was deemed cancer-free. It has since provided a free preschool experience for more than 150 children. On the surface, the Morgan Center might look like any other preschool: colorful toys, shelves lined with books, walls adorned with educational posters, children gleefully engrossed in activities. But it's different in many ways. Because of the children's delicate immune systems, they are required to sanitize their hands throughout the day. They also have individualized supply boxes with their own crayons, glues and Play-Doh. They never share supplies, and all items are meticulously cleaned by teachers after each use. ""Exposure to a simple childhood cold or illness can become life-threatening to these children,"" said Zuch, who also teaches at the school. Three times a week, students learn to read, sing and create arts and crafts. On Fridays, they have show-and-tell. There are parties during the holidays. And a few times a year, there are organized field trips. ""It's wonderful to see my daughter be like a normal kid,"" said Jennifer Tibaldi, one of the students' mothers. Zuch says the Morgan Center is the only program of its kind in America. It is funded entirely by private donations and fundraisers, and the students are referred by local cancer hospitals. Because there is no medical staff on site, the students' parents remain on the premises during the day. But this has also created a wonderful opportunity for parents that Zuch did not envision when she started the program. ""The parents have formed friendships,"" she said. ""They have also formed support groups. They understand what each other is going through, and over the course of the years, the Morgan Center has become so much more than what we even intended it to be."" For many parents, that support and socialization has made a remarkable difference and provided a much-needed break from hospitals and isolation. ""This is the only place where you can gather parents that have this common bond of cancer,"" Tibaldi said. ""You know what it's like that your kids are on steroids. You know what chemo does to your kids. It's just a wonderful place to gather and have a cup of coffee and talk about things that are difficult to talk about with people who just don't know what you're going through."" The program has been so successful that a second center on Long Island is in the works, and Zuch has been approached to replicate the model in other states. ""Part of me relives Morgan going through treatment (with) every new child that I meet and every parent that's telling me their story,"" Zuch said. ""But to see the smiles on their faces and (to see the children) reclaiming their childhood, that feeling is such a joy that it's indescribable."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- A Florida pastor who canceled plans for his congregation to burn Qurans on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks had the right to follow through with his intentions, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said Wednesday. In an interview Wednesday on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" the associate justice compared the act of burning Islam's holy book to setting the American on flag on fire when asked whether the Rev. Terry Jones had the right to carry out the controversial plan. ""We protect expression that we hate,"" he said. ""When you have a country of 300 million different people who think different things, it is helpful. It is helpful to tell everyone, 'You can think what you want.'"" Breyer, who served in the Army, acknowledged that witnessing an American flag being burned during the Vietnam War era triggered ""a physical reaction of repulsion"" in him. But, he added, free speech applies equally to popular and unpopular statements. ""It's so often I hear people say -- and particularly in college students -- 'Well, that's just so terrible what he's saying.' I say, 'Oh, you think that free speech is only for people who don't say things that are terrible?'"" he said. Breyer, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, also discussed his new book, ""Making our Democracy Work,"" which he said is intended as a lesson on how the court works for a generation of people who haven't had the same education in civics that he did. Yet he said he was not bothered by a poll that found two-thirds of respondents couldn't name a single Supreme Court justice, and recalled a similar poll a few years back that there were more people who could name the Three Stooges than three Supreme Court Justices. ""I say that's fine, if they don't know my name. What isn't fine at all is they can't name the three branches of government,"" he said. ""Then we're in trouble."" Reflecting on difficult cases from his 16 years on the court, Breyer recalled two cases that found him in the minority. Bush v. Gore was ""stressful"" at the time, he said, due to its magnitude and the short length of time the justices had to decide it. ""A lot turned on the outcome, we feared or thought. And what I did, like the others, is the job of the court. ... decide and control your stress. And keep yourself under control."" He also recalled tests of public school affirmative action plans in Seattle, Washington, and Louisville, Kentucky, where local officials sought to use race as a criterion to grant white students admission to the schools to integrate them. ""I thought yes, let local cities work it out for themselves. The court ruled it was contrary to the Constitution, the Equal Protection Clause,"" he said. Does Breyer ever prejudge when he hears a case? ""Yes. A lot,"" he told King. ""Think of how you make decisions. What is it to be open-minded? It isn't to be a blank slate,"" he said. ""You start with something. But if your mind is open, you're open to being persuaded to the contrary.""","Breyer says free speech applies equally to popular and unpopular statements .

"(CNN) -- With Sen. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign officially over, she is focusing on making sure her supporters back Sen. Barack Obama's bid. Sen. Hillary Clinton suspended her presidential campaign on Saturday. Throughout the primary season, Clinton and Obama expressed confidence the Democrats would unify once a nominee emerged. As Clinton closed her campaign Saturday, she urged the cheering crowd of thousands to support Obama in his run for the White House, saying she and supporters should ""take our energy, our passion and our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama ... I ask all of you to join me in working as hard for Barack Obama as you have for me."" Her endorsement was met with a scattering of boos and thumbs downs from the crowd at the National Building Museum in Washington.  Watch Clinton urge voters to back Obama » . In a CNN poll released Friday, 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for Obama, but 17 percent said they would vote for McCain and 22 percent, said they would not vote at all if Clinton were not the nominee.  Watch how Clinton's speech might impact voters » . The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 7.5 percentage points. The poll was conducted after Obama clinched the Democratic nomination Tuesday. Clinton has vowed to do whatever she could ""to ensure that Democrats take the White House back and defeat John McCain."" Concern about the division in the party arose because Clinton and Obama appealed to such different segments of the electorate. Clinton did well with working-class voters and the elderly. Obama rallied the support of affluent, well-educated voters, African-Americans and the younger generation. Some of Clinton's top supporters say the best way to get the New York senator's 18 million voters behind Obama is by putting Clinton on the ticket. Democrats appear to like an Obama-Clinton ticket. A CNN poll released Friday suggested that nearly half of those voting Democrats, 54 percent, would support a joint ticket, but 43 percent would oppose it. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. ""I've looked at every other possible candidate. No one brings to a ticket what Hillary brings,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" But not everyone is behind the idea of a joint ticket. Former President Jimmy Carter said that would be ""the worst mistake that could be made."" ""That would just accumulate the negative aspects of both candidates,"" Carter told The Guardian, a London newspaper, saying that both candidates' vulnerabilities could overshadow the ticket if the two team up. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on a ""joint ticket"" Feinstein said she thinks Obama needs to reach out to the Clinton supporters ""using Sen. Clinton's help."" ""He needs to reassure them as to what he would do in the agenda for change, because the comparisons with McCain are very stark. Certainly with respect to the economy, extending unemployment insurance, building infrastructure,"" she said. Obama and Clinton met in Feinstein's Washington home on Thursday.  They spoke alone for about an hour, in a move seen as the first step in healing the rifts in the party. Feinstein said she chatted with Clinton before Obama arrived. ""She expressed to me the depth of her concern and caring, the fact that she had 18 million who put their hopes and dreams in her ability to create new opportunities for people. She wants to continue that. She recognizes that it's over, and I think every instinct in Hillary Clinton is to help,"" she said. The main page on Obama's Web site has been updated with a message that says, ""Thank you Senator Clinton,"" and links to a form where visitors can send a message to her. Clinton's Web site now urges visitors to ""support Senator Obama today."" CNN analyst Gloria Borger said Clinton must speak to the female voters who supported her, ""many of whom are so angry about this race."" ""She really has to tell women why Barack Obama is the best candidate for president,"" Borger said. ""She has to go a long way to try [to] get rid of that anger."" CNN senior political producer Sasha Johnson said Clinton's speech was a ""first step"" in making inroads to persuade her supporters to back Obama, but she said it's too early to tell what the effect will be. ""I would argue that most of the people in that room want a Democratic president and will come around, and those that still aren't sure yet will probably come around, but again, I think some won't. This was a hard primary for Democrats,"" she said. Shortly after the speech, Obama released a statement praising Clinton's presidential run. ""Obviously, I am thrilled and honored to have Sen. Clinton's support. But more than that, I honor her today for the valiant and historic campaign she has run. She shattered barriers on behalf of my daughters and women everywhere, who now know that there are no limits to their dreams. And she inspired millions with her strength, courage and unyielding commitment to the cause of working Americans.""","Some of Clinton's 18 million voters are hesitant to back Obama .

"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida (CNN)  -- NASA said Friday it was going to take immediate action after a report raised safety questions about astronauts drinking before flying missions. NASA allegedly gave the OK to a drunken astronaut to fly on the shuttle, but liftoff was delayed. The space agency said astronauts flew drunk at on at least two occasions, despite warnings from doctors and colleagues that they posed a flight risk. As a result, NASA deputy administrator Shana Dale said new procedures would be put in place immediately, including an internal review and a no-alcohol policy for 12-hours before all missions. With the next space shuttle mission just two weeks away, Dale said NASA has ""already had discussions with the crew commander of next shuttle mission and its flight surgeon.""  Officials have communicated ""the allegations in the report and NASA's expectations of alcohol use and getting into a spacecraft.""  Watch Dale discuss the troubling report » . Dale said the goal was to insure that the flight surgeon and crew commander know that they are ""expected and they are empowered to raise any flight safety issues that they have."" The report was prompted by the arrest of former astronaut Lisa Nowak, who was accused in February of the attempted kidnapping of a romantic rival. According to the report, released earlier Friday, interviews with flight surgeons and astronauts ""identified some episodes of heavy use of alcohol by astronauts in the immediate preflight period."" Dale said the agency would act immediately on reports of alcohol use, conduct an internal safety review and then ""recommend corrective actions."" NASA takes the report's recommendation for an astronaut code of conduct ""very seriously,"" Dale said. The committee report offered no specifics about the drinking episodes and said no attempt was made to confirm information given in interviews. ""Until we have more information, NASA cannot determine the veracity of these claims,"" the report said. However, Air Force Col. Dr. Richard E. Bachmann, head of NASA's Astronaut Health Care System revealed a few more details of the claims Friday. ""There were two incidents described to us in more detail as more representative of a larger concern,"" said Bachmann. ""One of those incidents involved both the shuttle and the T-38 [NASA jet aircraft] the second incident involved the Soyuz-ISS."" Russian Soyuz spacecraft are used to ferry crew members to and from the international space station. ""There were still two incidents but they were structured such so that they involved all three operations,"" Bachman said, explaining that an astronaut was preparing to launch in a shuttle, but when the mission was delayed, the astronaut was to fly in the T-38. Panelists looked into NASA's medical and psychological screening process and addressed other behavioral issues. ""Preparation for exploration class space flight requires NASA to focus much more attention on human behavior,"" said the report. ""Alcohol is freely used in crew quarters,"" the report said. ""Two specific instances were described where astronauts had been so intoxicated prior to flight that flight surgeons and/or fellow astronauts raised concerns to local on-scene leadership regarding flight safety. However, the individuals were still permitted to fly."" The panel said certification of astronauts for flight duty has no method to detect drinking episodes. It also recommended NASA develop a code of conduct for astronauts. ""In general, astronauts are highly motivated to fly,"" the report stated. ""Opportunities to fly in space are scarce and decreasing. The criteria for flight selection and how they are applied are unknown to the astronauts. Medical and behavioral health issues are perceived as having high potential for use to eliminate astronauts from mission assignment."" The drinking allegations shocked former astronauts and came as NASA deals with the apparent sabotage of a computer bound for the orbiting international space station. Earlier two former shuttle astronauts told CNN that the drinking allegations, if true, would be ""mind-boggling."" One of the astronauts said he was not aware of anyone ""unduly using alcohol prior to launch."" The other said ""not a chance,"" and added that he would have ""thrown the person off the crew."" The astronauts asked that they not be named because of the sensitive nature of the allegations. Former NASA flight surgeon Jonathan Clark told CNN he'd never heard such reports in the past, although he said he had seen crew allowed to fly while ""extremely tired"" from ""pre-mission fatigue."" ""Many of them took sleeping pills to try get some normal sleep state, and there were times when crew were groggy."" He said there are traditional pre-flight celebrations and toasting with crew members and their families, ""but the times I've been involved ... there was beer and wine but there wasn't any heavy drinking."" Clark said he attended many such events as a flight surgeon or as an astronaut spouse. Clark's wife Laurel Clark was killed along with six other astronauts in the 2003 Columbia disaster. NASA's next scheduled space shuttle mission is August 7, for the crew of the orbiter Endeavour. A NASA spokesman said an internal investigation has been launched into the sabotage of the computer and said it would be repaired and ready for next month's liftoff. The computer problem surfaced, NASA said, when a subcontractor who supplied the computer notified NASA. Workers checked the computer and found it was intentionally damaged. The computer is to be installed aboard the station's U.S. laboratory to monitor sensors on the facility's truss, NASA said. It was not designed to be part of any command and control or navigation functions, he said. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A tropical depression that is likely to become a tropical storm by Sunday has areas of the islands of the Bahamas on guard. The Bahamian government issued a tropical storm warning Saturday evening for portions of the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos. CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Gray said Saturday the storm is a bit ""ragged"" but over the next day or so is likely to organize and strengthen. According to the U.S. National Hurricane Center forecast track, the storm is likely to stay just east of the United States' Atlantic coast. However, Gray said any sort of deviation from the forecast path later this week could result in high surf and rip currents in areas along the U.S. coast.","Tropical depression is likely to become a tropical storm by Sunday .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- An Israeli Cabinet member said the Jewish state ""will attack"" Iran if it doesn't halt its efforts to develop nuclear weaponry, according to a newspaper report Friday. Shaul Mofaz is Israel's main liaison with the United States on strategic issues. ""If Iran continues its program to develop nuclear weapons, we will attack it,"" Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz told Yediot Ahronot, Israel's largest mass-circulation daily. ""The window of opportunity has closed. The sanctions are not effective. There will be no alternative but to attack Iran in order to stop the Iranian nuclear program."" Mofaz's threat is one of the most explicit made against the Islamic Republic of Iran by a member of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's Cabinet. The threat is not without precedent. In 1981, Israeli warplanes destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor being built by Saddam Hussein's regime. Israel also is reported to have targeted a Syrian reactor in September. It also has significant political resonance in Israel amid talk that Mofaz has begun jockeying to replace Olmert, who is embroiled in a corruption probe, as the ruling Kadima Party's leader and prime minister. At least one Cabinet member, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, has called for Olmert to step down. Mofaz, Israel's transport and road safety minister, is the main Israeli liaison with the United States on strategic issues, and his views on security have great import. He was born in Iran in 1948 and is a former defense minister, former armed forces chief and a member of Israel's Security Cabinet. Mofaz was reiterating a prevailing view among Kadima officials and other Israeli politicians that international sanctions targeting Iran and its nuclear program aren't working. The West believes Iran's aim is to build nuclear weapons, while Iran says it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Asked how he responds to the harsh statements of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Rome that Israel should be wiped off the map, Mofaz said: ""He will disappear before Israel does."" Yediot Ahronot on Friday published excerpts of an interview with Mofaz that is to appear in the paper's Sunday holiday edition. The Jewish holiday of Shavuot is ushered in that evening. Mofaz's remarks come a couple of days after Olmert said at a pro-Israeli conference in the United States that the ""Iranian threat must be stopped by all possible means."" ""Israel and the United States have long understood the acute danger embodied in a nuclear Iran, and are working closely in a concerted, coordinated effort to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear. Israel will not tolerate the possibility of a nuclear Iran, and neither should any other country in the free world,"" Olmert said to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee convention. In April, Israeli Infrastructure Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said that ""an Iranian attack will lead to a harsh retaliation by Israel, which will lead to the destruction of the Iranian nation."" CNN's Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","International sanctions on Iran not effective, minister tells newspaper .

"(CNN) -- What has caused the Israelis to strike so hard inside Gaza? Israel's Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor told me Israel felt compelled to respond to what it sees as relentless Palestinian rocket attacks into Southern Israel which terrify civilians and force schools and business closures. But the view from Gaza is very different. Palestinians there say that what the Israeli military calls surgical strikes routinely kill civilians and they are cut off from the world with a total land, air and sea blockade. FAQ: What is Hamas? Is this a serious escalation of the Israel/Palestinian conflict or just another skirmish? This is the most serious Israeli offensive on Gaza since early 2009, when an Israeli military ground war killed up to 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. The question now is whether this will remain a contained incident or if this will turn into something bigger. Israel's military says preparations are being made for a ground offensive, should the need for one arise. The coming days will determine how serious this incident is. iReport: Photos and video from inside the protests in Israel . Already, we are seeing signs that this Gaza offensive is causing regional rifts. Egypt, which brokered a recent ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel, was so angry at the offensive it has recalled its ambassador to Israel. Opinion: New dangers in familiar Gaza violence . Is there a danger that this will spill into wider turmoil? Regionally, the Middle East is looking more and more unstable by the week. The tragic Syrian civil war is spilling over into Lebanon, the occupied Golan Heights, Jordan and Turkey. Israel is concerned about Iran's nuclear program and the possibility that it will strike Iranian nuclear facilities are adding to those tensions. And now Egypt is signaling displeasure with Israel's Gaza offensive. Will that test its treaties with the Jewish state? There are many moving parts to keep an eye on. Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe . What does it mean for the stalled Middle East peace process? The moribund Middle East peace process is now suffering another setback. Remember, there's an election next January and some have accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of launching this offensive in order to benefit politically from appearing to take tough action against Hamas. There are no signs that peace talks between Israel and the Fatah government in the West Bank or any element of Hamas' leadership is looking likely on any level.","Israel says its attack was in response to Hamas rocket attacks .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Seventh graders at Ron Clark Academy became an overnight sensation during the presidential election when their YouTube performance of ""You Can Vote However You Like"" catapulted them to online stardom. ""The higher the expectations, the higher the results,"" says Ron Clark, seen here with his students. Now, their creative and scholastic talents have proved the students to be more than just ""one hit wonders."" Academy students showcased their poetry and writings for CNN's documentary ""Black in America 2,"" hosted by Soledad O'Brien. Cultivating student creativity is just one of the goals of academy founder Ron Clark, an enigmatic educator known for his unconventional teaching methods. Under his strict tutelage, students at Ron Clark -- who are predominantly African-American -- are expected to excel in all subjects and maintain a high standard of respect for their peers and teachers. ""I'm teaching an eighth-grade curriculum to fifth-graders,"" says Clark. ""Some people say my expectations of the kids, academically, is too high, but the higher the expectations, the higher the results.""  Watch Clark's students perform their original poetry » . But with high academic expectations come an equally high quotient for fun. It's become one of Clark's trademarks: singing and dancing to popular rap and R&B songs during class to get the kids engaged. ""My first day at Ron Clark Academy, I thought all the teachers were psychopaths,"" says seventh-grader Jai Springs. ""I thought Ron Clark was going crazy. He was up in front of the kids on desks, he was dancing. ... I never saw a teacher get up on a desk and dance. But now I'm used to it, so I get up on the desk and dance too,"" says Jai. Clark, formerly a schoolteacher from North Carolina, founded the academy with money he earned from his book titled The Essential 55, which detail Clark's 55 golden rules for success -- in and out of the classroom. Clark was invited to be a guest on the Oprah Winfrey show after winning Disney Teacher of the Year Award in 2001. Oprah believed so much in the well-mannered Southern school teacher from South Carolina that she encouraged him to write the book. Later she promoted The Essential 55 on her show, prompting it's ascension to New York Times bestseller list. Together with co-founder Kim Bearden, Clark transformed a decaying factory in a rough part of Atlanta, Georgia, into a state-of-the-art educational model for middle schools across the country. See newsmakers and iReporters on race, challenges, solutions for black America . Soon after the school opened its doors in 2008, a Christmas package from Winfrey arrived for Clark in the form of a $365,000 grant, or ""a thousand dollars for each day of the year,"" as Oprah referred to it in the letter. Then came the elections, with a tight presidential race between Sens. Barack Obama of Illinois and John McCain of Arizona. Inspired by rapper T.I.'s hit song ""Whatever You Like,"" Clark's seventh grade class penned their own lyrics and dance moves. The students' performance carried a message: Cast your ballot because you support a candidate's policies rather than just his skin color. When they perform the song, half the seventh grade class touts the virtues of GOP's McCain while the other half root for Democrat Obama: ""Obama on the left. McCain on the right. We can talk politics all night. And you can vote however you like."" The students ""can talk politics with the best of them,"" says Clark. Video clips of the kids performing have garnered over 15 million hits on YouTube. ""We got lots of media attention. But when the media arrived to the school they realized the song is not the story, it's the kids,"" says Clark. One of Clark's credos is teaching a ""global curriculum"" with a heavy emphasis on current events. Himself an avid world traveler, Clark believes it's essential for his students to travel to other countries to develop an understanding and appreciation of the world in which they live. Through Delta's corporate sponsorship of the school, administrators have been able to send all 100 of their fifth to eighth grade students abroad before they graduate. ""I'm not nearly as shy as I used to be,"" says seventh-grader Chi Chi Kasarachi after her first year at the academy. ""My knowledge of the world has improved, I know more about what's going on in other countries and I'm more curious about things. ... I'm just hungry for knowledge,"" says Chi Chi. In fact, the students at Ron Clark Academy are better versed in current events and politics than many adults. ""I never thought I'd be interested in watching the news,"" says seventh-grader Osei Avril. ""Now I find it interesting because I have learned the stories behind the news,"" he says. Osei -- who pronounces Iranian President Ahmadinajad's name perfectly -- says he's interested in learning about world issues such as the Iranian elections, the Taliban in Pakistan, and the Palestinian- Israeli conflict. ""At the beginning,"" says Clark, ""the kids will say something like 'I've been to East Point [a suburb of South Atlanta]. After a few years they've been to Kenya, Japan, or South Africa, or England. ... They've become very comfortable with understanding the country and understanding themselves."" But it's not just the travel or even the singing and dancing to rap music that make the school so special, say the students. It's the academy teachers' creative ways of instilling education, solid values, and a passion for learning. ""They want you to pass the people at the top,"" says Jai. ""To be at the top nonstop, be at your fullest, to be creative, to think out of the box."" But school isn't all fun and games, she says. Clark is a strict disciplinarian that expects -- and enforces -- model behavior from all of the students. ""I love Mr. Clark with all my heart, he's like a father to me,"" says Chi Chi. ""He might fuss a lot, but I know he's doing it for our own good.""","Ron Clark Academy students' '08 YouTube rap performance got millions of hits .

"(CNN) -- It's a grass-roots protest movement composed of the newly politicized and people distrustful of hierarchy. So how is it possible to be an illegitimate Tea Party member? Ask Republicans in Nevada. Some are accusing Jon Scott Ashjian, a new Tea Party candidate running for U.S. Senate, of being a fake. The allegation? He was put in the race by agents of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to siphon votes from the GOP. ""No doubt about it,"" says Danny Tarkanian, one of the many Republican Senate candidates hoping to challenge Reid in November. ""Nobody in the Tea Party knows who he is. He didn't know any of the principles of the Tea Party,"" Tarkanian tells CNN. Tarkanian even accuses ""Harry Reid's staff, campaign, whatever"" of picking Ashjian because he's Armenian, as is Tarkanian. He explains, ""They know the Armenians are very close, they'll vote for each other."" As for Reid, an aide dismisses the accusations. As does Reid, who says he's never met Ashjian or ""anyone in his family."" Reid tells CNN, ""I think there are too many conspiratorialists in the world today. This is a free country."" Sue Lowden, the Republican front-runner in the Senate primary, according to recent polls, is the former Nevada Republican Party chair and seems to be the Republicans' best hope of unseating Reid in November. Or at least she did, until Ashjian got into the race. Lowden says she's been very active with Tea Party groups in Nevada. ""I am a Tea Party voter, absolutely."" Which is why she says she finds it ""a little strange"" that Ashjian is emerging now. ""I don't know who this person is. He's never been involved with anything that I'm aware of in this state."" She doesn't know if he's a spoiler. ""We'll find out for sure,"" she promises, adding, ""I've never seen him at one of our Tea Parties, by the way."" It's clear why Lowden and Tarkanian would be concerned. A recent poll conducted for the Las Vegas Review-Journal indicates Lowden and Tarkanian each beating Reid in one-on-one hypothetical general election matchups. But add a Tea Party candidate to the ballot, and that siphons off enough conservative votes to give Reid a narrow victory. According to the survey, Reid would grab 36 percent of the vote, the Republican candidate 32 percent and the Tea Party candidate 18 percent in a possible three-way showdown. So the conspiracy theories abound from Tea Party activists and worried Republicans: Ashjian's never attended Tea Party rallies; he hasn't coordinated with local organizers; the secretary of his Tea Party of Nevada, Barry Levinson, is a registered Democrat. Levinson said, ""I vote the person, not the party"" and calls the accusations ""political garbage."" But to critics, it's all proof that Ashjian is, in the words of Nevada Tea Party activist and blogger Ned Barrett, running a ""false flag operation."" Jon Scott Ashjian seems to find the fuss amusing. New to the political scene, he personally gave CNN directions to his house for an interview that his wife, daughter and bulldog attended. He said it was the first time he'd spoken with the national media. Ashjian, who helped form the Tea Party of Nevada just to run for this seat, said that he'd never take marching orders from the Democrats or Reid. ""I have never met Harry Reid, do not agree at all with any of his political values,"" Ashjian said, adding that he's not the kind of guy ""who would follow or be told what to do."" He says he's fielded endless calls from Republicans trying to strong-arm him to leave the race, and he resents it: ""I don't think Republicans own the Tea Party,"" Ashjian said. ""In fact, I know they don't in Nevada, because I do. That's what's really got them in an uproar."" He said he's been told that he's not welcome on the bus when the Tea Party rolls into Nevada. Ashjian says he got into the race because ""we are patriots that want change. We're normal people that want to make a difference."" First, he plans to make a campaign Web site. A spokesman for Tea Party Express, a national Tea Party group that is encouraging efforts to defeat Reid at the ballot box in November, says it does not view Ashjian as a serious candidate. They say he's not speaking at either of their two rallies in Nevada on March 27, when they kick off their third Tea Party cross-country caravan with events in Searchlight (Reid's hometown) and Las Vegas, but they say he's welcome to attend. Tea Party Express also says it is not endorsing any candidate in the Nevada GOP Senate primary.","Some say Jon Scott Ashjian, a new Tea Party candidate running for Senate, is a fake .

"(CNN) -- Music manager Allen Klein, whose clients included the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, died Saturday after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer's disease, his publicist said. Klein was 77. The son of Jewish immigrants from Hungary, Klein founded his firm Allen Klein & Co. in the late 1950s before the label evolved into ABKCO Music & Records in New York. The independent label holds the copyrights to music by the Rolling Stones, Sam Cooke, the Animals, the Kinks, Chubby Checker, Bobby Womack and hundreds of others. Klein represented dozens of artists, including Sam Cooke, the Animals, Bobby Darin and Herman's Hermits. He changed the music industry when he represented Sam Cooke in negotiations with RCA, winning the artist control of his own master recordings. Known for a tenacious and often blunt style in negotiations, Klein's greatest coups were inking contracts with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, though both relationships ended in legal battles. ABKCO built up a catalog of copyrights to more than 2,000 songs, including much of the Stones' 1960s catalog. Klein retained ownership of those titles even after splitting with the Stones. In 1969, John Lennon persuaded the other Beatles that Klein should take over the group's business affairs, but Paul McCartney resisted the move and some music historians say the appointment hastened the Beatles' split. Lennon later fell out with Klein, who was thought to be the target of the former Beatle's 1974 song ""Steel and Glass."" Defending his tough style, Klein told Playboy magazine in 1971: ""The music business is about 99 percent no-talent losers who can't stand a winner in their midst."" In 1971, Klein worked with George Harrison to organize the ""Concert for Bangladesh"" at Madison Square Garden, one of the first major benefit concerts of the rock era. Ringo Starr was among the all-stars who performed at the concert. Late in his career, Klein agreed to license a sample of a Rolling Stones song to the British group the Verve for their hit single ""Bittersweet Symphony."" But after the song was released, ABKCO successfully argued in court that the Verve had used too much of the sample and won 100 percent of the song's royalties. Klein is survived by his wife Betty, their three children and four grandchildren. Services will be held in New York on Tuesday.","Allen Klein, who inked contracts for dozens of musicians, dies at age 77 .

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. Much has been made of people who live beyond their means. When you see a neighbor bring home a fancy new car, you can't help but wonder how she can afford it on her salary. However, you can't assume you know how much she (or anybody) makes unless you've seen her tax returns. Searching the heavens for stars, planets or black holes can pay very well. Plenty of people earn surprising paychecks -- some higher and others lower than you expect. For this reason we've put together a list of jobs and their unexpected salaries. It's good information to know just to satisfy your curiosity (or nosiness). Plus, the next time you're job hunting, use the list as a reminder not to make a snap judgment about any job before you do your research. Court reporters . What they do: Court reporters transcribe court proceedings, meetings, speeches and other events where verbatim documentation is necessary. Any time someone says ""Strike that from the record,"" court reporters are the ones writing that record. Surprising salary: $59,970*. You might not have thought typing could earn you so much money, but once you realize court reporters can't miss a word -- often in fast-talking situations -- it makes more sense. Elementary school principals . What they do: Elementary school principals ensure that students are meeting education requirements by communicating with other administrators, evaluating teachers, monitoring the curriculum and interacting with parents on a regular basis. Surprising salary: $79,310. Careers in education, particularly those not at the college level, are notorious for being underpaid. Principals, however, earn significantly higher salaries than you might expect, sometimes as much as forty percent more than an elementary school teacher. Paramedics . What they do: Paramedics respond to emergency situations and attempt to provide the necessary medical care, whether it involves transporting participants to a hospital or treating them on the scene. Surprising salary: $27,070. Seeing as paramedics have high stress jobs that require them to be on call and ready to save lives at a moment's notice, you might expect their mean annual salary to be higher. Astronomers . What they do: Astronomers use their physics and math skills to study the universe and its origin, which includes galaxies, solar systems and the planets within. They use this research to analyze and solve problems dealing with satellites and space travel. Surprising salary: $95,740. Though maybe it shouldn't be all that surprising considering a doctorate is the standard level of education and there are only 1,700 astronomers in the U.S. Fashion designers . What they do: Fashion designers design and create new clothes and other fashion accessories to be sold to the public in retail stores. Depending on whether they work for their own label or for someone else's, they might set new trends or follow existing ones. Surprising salary: $69,270. Aspiring fashion designers are warned that few people can be the next Marc Jacobs, with runway shows at Fashion Week, actresses wearing their dresses at awards shows and millions in the bank -- but the less famous fashion designers, which include those working for retail chains, are earning more than you probably thought. *Mean annual salary information based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

"London (CNN) -- Two works by British artist Damien Hirst worth $54,000 have been stolen from a London gallery. The pieces -- prints of colored spots, signed by Hirst -- were taken from the Exhibitionist Gallery in Notting Hill in the early hours of Monday morning. Detective Sergeant Jon Lightfoot, of London's Metropolitan Police, said the thief appeared to have ""specifically targeted"" the stolen works. Other pieces hanging in the gallery were left untouched. The suspect broke in by forcing open the front doors, before taking ""Oleoylsarcosine"" and ""Pyronin Y"" off the wall and driving away with them in a dark-colored hatchback. ""The items would have been visible in the back of the car and we are appealing for any witnesses or anyone with information to please come forward,"" Lightfoot said in a statement. ""Oleoylsarcosine"" was created in 2008; it measures 67cm by 89 cm and is worth $29,480 (£18,000). ""Pyronin Y"", which dates from 2005, measures 103cm by 116cm, and is worth $24,565 (£15,000). Both pictures are part of Hirst's extensive series of spot paintings, rows of randomly-colored dots on a white background, the majority of which are painted by Hirst's assistants, under his direction. Hirst, 48, rose to fame in the 1990s as one of the Young British Artists (or YBAs), along with Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume and Jake and Dinos Chapman. The group, many of whose members met while studying at London's Goldsmiths university, was championed by art collector Charles Saatchi.","Two signed works by British artist Damien Hirst stolen from gallery in London .

"London (CNN) -- Children's entertainer Rolf Harris was sentenced Friday to five years and nine months in prison for a string of indecent assaults against women and girls. The 84-year-old was found guilty Monday in a London court of 12 charges of sexually abusing women and girls. The offenses that Harris committed against four women took place as far back as 1970. The Australian-born musician and artist, who painted a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II for the British monarch's 80th birthday in 2006, had been charged under Operation Yewtree, which is investigating allegations of decades of abuse by public figures, including the late TV entertainer Jimmy Savile. Dozens more women who said they had been abused by Harris, including several in Australia, alerted police during the trial, Britain's Press Association news agency said. Sentencing Harris at Southwark Crown Court, the judge, Nigel Sweeney, said there were several aggravating factors. ""You took advantage of the trust placed in you, because of your celebrity status, to commit the offenses,"" he said. ""In every case the age gap between you and your victim was a very considerable one. You clearly got a thrill from committing the offenses whilst others were present or nearby. Whilst such others did not realize what you were doing, their presence added to the ordeal of your victims."" The abuse ""had a significant adverse effect"" on the victims, he said, while Harris has shown no remorse at all for his crimes. Harris will likely serve half his sentence in prison before being released on probation. The brother of the entertainer's youngest victim spoke of his sister's ordeal in a statement read on his behalf outside court. He also thanked police for their efforts to bring Harris to justice. ""My sister has had only eight years of her life without this incident going round in her head, and that was her first eight,"" he said. ""After these cameras have been dismantled and the media circus has rolled on to another town, it will still be with her as it will with the other girls."" Victims' courage praised . Speaking outside court after the sentencing, Detective Mick Orchard told reporters: ""The court has today heard about the impact these crimes have had on those involved. Once again I would like to thank all the victims for their courage in coming forward."" The Crown Prosecution Service's Jenny Hopkins said after the verdict that Harris had ""used his status and position as a world famous children's entertainer to sexually assault young girls over a period spanning 18 years."" She added that ""each victim, unknown to the others, described a similar pattern of behavior -- that of a man acting without fear of the consequences."" Harris was once one of Britain's best-loved children's entertainers. He had a string of hits in the 1960s, including ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport,"" ""Jake the Peg"" and ""Two Little Boys."" He had a decades-long television career at the BBC and received several honors, including the Order of the British Empire. CNN's Brooke Bowman, Lindsay Isaac and Peter Wilkinson contributed to this report.","NEW: Brother of youngest victim says his sister still lives with the consequences of abuse .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian authorities killed the suspected mastermind behind the deadly 2002 Bali bombings, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said on Wednesday. Yudhoyono announced the death of terrorist Dulmatin while speaking with reporters during a visit to Australia. The Bali bombings killed 202 people. ""I can announce to you that, after a successful police raid against the terrorists hiding out in Jakarta yesterday, we can confirm that one of those that was killed was Mr. Dulmatin, one of the top southeast Asian terrorists that we have been looking for,"" Yudhoyono said. Dulmatin, one of Indonesia's most wanted terrorists, had several aliases, including Joko Pitoyo. He was an electronics specialist who trained in al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and had a $10 million bounty on his head, according to the U.S. State Department. He was a senior member of the al Qaeda-linked terror network Jemaah Islamiyah. Indonesian media had been reporting that Dulmatin was killed in a shootout in Pamulang, Banten province, on Tuesday. The raid was linked to ongoing security sweeps in Aceh province in northern Sumatra. Police have arrested 15 suspected militants, and one has been killed. Three police officers have died in the raids. Aceh Governor Irwandi Yusuf said that, for a year now, he has known about a militant training camp in the province. He said militants were seeking to establish camps similar to those run by Jemaah Islamiyah in the the southern Philippines. The group has a stated goal of creating an idealized Islamic state comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the southern Philippines and southern Thailand, according to GlobalSecurity.org, a public policy Web site that provides background on defense issues. Yusuf told reporters that militants chose Aceh because it is a predominantly Muslim province that imposes shariah, or Islamic, law and because a rebellion -- the Free Aceh Movement -- had taken root there. Indonesia's current anti-terrorism efforts come just days before President Barack Obama's planned visit to the world's most-populous Muslim nation.","NEW: Indonesian President Yudhoyono announces death during Australia visit .
