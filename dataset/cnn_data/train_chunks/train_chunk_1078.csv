"Two British brothers were attacked by a knife-wielding holidaymaker in a row over sunbeds at a five-star hotel in Turkey. Danny and Ben Slade, from Ashford, Surrey, were left needing hospital treatment after the incident during a family break at the Isis Hotel and Spa. The row broke out after they reserved sunbeds at the hotel in the popular tourist resort of Bodrum. Scroll down for video . Luxury hotel: The attack happened at the Isis Hotel and Spa in Bodrum, Turkey . Moments before the attack, the man shouted at brothers Ben, 22, and Danny, 26, and girlfriend Lauren Anshaw, 24, who were on a break with their parents Daniel, 50, and Mary, 49. Ben told the man to take two of the sunbeds as he was causing such a disturbance – and his father alerted the hotel security. The attacker then returned with a knife, stabbing Ben in the arms and legs – before Danny jumped in to save him, and got stabbed in the chest. The man screamed ‘I'm killing you’ in front of horrified sunbathers and children. Ben had to undergo life-saving surgery for wounds to his arms, legs and feet, and Danny narrowly escaped death as the knife missed his heart and lungs by just 2cm. Quick-thinking Danny leaped in the hotel pool to escape, while Ben hid in a bush. Popular holiday resort: The incident took place when the brothers were on holiday at the resort with their family . Ben said: ‘I had laid down on the sunbed after the guy walked off when I heard my brother's girlfriend screaming my name. ‘I opened my eyes and looked up and saw this knife glinting in the light. ‘I had never been in any situation like that in my life. ‘I then fell over another sunbed and he stabbed me in the leg. While this was going on he was telling me “I'm killing you”. ‘My brother saved my life without a doubt. I got stabbed five times.’ Architect Danny said: ‘It was like being in a horror film. I feel lucky to be alive.’ The family has now returned home, where Mary said: ‘We had a right time of it, it's just something you would never expect to happen.’ ‘Seeing my children like that was just my worst nightmare. I just went into shock. ‘I saw Danny first of all, there was blood everywhere. He told me “I think he's killed Ben”. It was terrible. ‘It's going to stay with us for the rest of our lives.’ The Isis Hotel and Spa declined to comment and a man was arrested and bailed by local police.","Ben and Danny Slade were on holiday in Bodrum with their family .

"Russian president Vladimir Putin chose to stay away from an outpouring of public adoration and celebration by spending his 62nd birthday in the remote Siberian wilderness. For a man who has hugged a polar bear, flown with migrating cranes and shot a tiger with a tranquiliser gun, Putin celebrated his latest birthday unusually quietly. For the first time in years, he took the day off and retreated to the remote forested taiga in Siberia - some 300-400 kilometres (185-250 miles) from the nearest populated area - for a private celebration. However, despite him shying away from any public celebrations, thousands of people up and down the country chose to honour is birthday with an array of festivities. Scroll down for video .

Here Russia's beloved president is depicted battling Western nations disguised as serpents and monsters . Despite nationals celebrations, Putin chose to spend his birthday in a remote part of the Siberian Taiga forest . Nationalist Russians snapped up Vladimir Putin T-shirts, before attending a number of choreographed shows of support staged across the country in honour of the long-serving statesman. In Moscow, a bizarre one-day exhibition dubbed the '12 Labours of Putin' was held, in which the president was depicted as Hercules - battling Western nations disguised as serpents and monsters or taming an ox bearing the symbol of Crimea, the Ukrainian region annexed by Russia in March. In Putin's hometown of St Petersburg, wide-eyed children dressed mostly in white sang 'Happy birthday, President of Russia' 'His life is like a hundred milestones crucial for our country,' the children, part of a singing group called HITryushki, sang in a school classroom with a map of Russia on the wall. At one point, footage shot of their performance spanned from above to show the children standing in the form of a heart. A humorous banner was also unfurled from a Moscow bridge showing U.S. President Barack Obama wearing a T-shirt wishing Putin a happy birthday. In Grozny, the capital of the restive republic of Chechnya, thousands carried a 650-yard Russian flag through the streets alongside an equally massive Chechen flag. Others dressed in the red, white and blue of the Russian tricolor walked through the streets as an enormous human flag, many of them holding portraits of the Russian leader over their heads. Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's president, who also celebrated his birthday this week, wrote on his official Instagram account that there were 100,000 participants.

Putin's always-high ratings have skyrocketed this year as he responded to a pro-European coup in Ukraine by seizing Crimea, and reacted defiantly to Western sanctions. His approval rating remains at 86 percent according to the independent Levada Center, which conducted a poll in September with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percent. The support comes despite serious problems for Russia's economy, with Moscow's central bank today forced to prop up the beleaguered rouble. As the Russian economy shuddered due to Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis, £1.1 billion was thrown at keeping the currency afloat over two days, reported Bloomberg. The IMF gave a strong warning over the Russian economy saying growth would sink to 0.2 per cent for 2014, with a bleak outlook for next year, while analysts warned the rouble was under 'permanent pressure' and inflation was rising. The currency has lost 14 per cent against the US dollar in three months. Muscovites Jana and Albina (R) pose with Vladimir Putin t-shirts outside the GUM department store in Moscow .

Nevertheless, souvenirs decorated with Putin's face have become best-sellers on Red Square, while Russian designers have made him the theme of pricey T-shirts and sweaters. Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, congratulated Putin on his birthday and said his tenure in office had become 'an integral part of national history.' However, as the value of the ruble sinks under pressure from sanctions, some online commentators were less enthusiastic. 'The dollar is 40 (rubles), the Euro is 50 (rubles), and Putin is 62,' was one joke that spread across the web.","Russian president chose to spend his special day in the Siberian wilderness .

"An old Etonian who spent more than £11.5million on a seaside village revealed today that he bought the 728-acre estate after feeling a sense of ‘freedom and an independence’ there. Nicholas Johnston - a friend of Prime Minister David Cameron - managed to convince his wife Linda that he should buy Bantham in Devon after she initially thought it was a ‘hare-brained mad scheme’. He fought off a rival bid from the National Trust to buy the estate - which features a golf course, shop, beach and about 20 homes - and hopes his children will one day take it on as a lifelong project. Old Etonian: Father-of-three Nicholas Johnston (left) managed to convince his wife Linda that he should buy Bantham (right) in Devon after she initially thought it was a 'hare-brained mad scheme' Mr Johnston, 42, who is father to a nine-year-old daughter and twin boys aged seven, said the village is ‘blissful’ - and hopes his children can be part of it ‘for potentially the rest of their lives as well’. He told Sunday Telegraph journalist Edward Malnick: ‘I think there’s a freedom of being able to run around, a freedom of self-expression, a freedom of being in the water, which is wonderful for them.’ Mr Johnston believes he is a good fit for a new owner, adding: ‘I think that the public here, the tenants here, the employees here will benefit from having direct access to a specific owner. ‘The danger of the National Trust, or any other body like them, is that it does just become a museum curator’s situation and it is the man from Bristol with a clipboard.’ 'Blissful': Mr Johnston, who is father to a daughter and twin boys, spent more than £11.5million on the estate . Picturesque: The estate includes ownership of Bantham beach, various properties in and around the village of Bantham, and is responsible for managing the Bantham harbour facilities . Mr Johnston, whose family already control the Great Tew Estate in Oxfordshire, said that his winning bid was ‘well in excess’ of the £11.5million guide price. He had originally visited it in May while his children were away with his wife, after spotting that it was on sale. She was originally sceptical, but changed her mind when seeing it for herself, he said. Mr Johnston hosts the annual Cornbury music festival at the Great Tew Estate, regularly attended by Mr Cameron and nicknamed 'Poshstock' for its moneyed attendees. Until last month the identity of the Bantham estate's new owner had been shrouded in secrecy, with the sellers only speaking to deny rumours the buyer was a Russian oligarch or an investment firm. The previous owner was Evans Estates, a . family-owned company formed by the descendants of Lieutenant Commander . Charles Evans who began buying up Bantham in 1918.

"Five pedestrians and one cyclist have been knocked over and killed on roads where councils have turned off street lights . Switching off street lights to save money has contributed to at least six deaths in five years, the AA has warned. Five pedestrians and one cyclist have been knocked over and killed on roads where councils turned off the lights, according to the motoring group. It said accident investigators at the inquests ruled drivers had little or no chance of avoiding the collisions on unlit streets with speed limits of 40mph or higher. And it  predicted the problem would ‘get worse’ as councils continued to black out lights. Road safety campaigners have long warned of the dangers of unlit streets as councils continue to dim or turn off their lights to make savings and meet climate change targets. The AA said some town halls were failing to ‘recognise the dangers’. In one of the most alarming cases, a coroner blasted a council over its trial of switching off street lights following the death of a 76-year-old widow. Margaret Beeson was hit by a car on the A40 between Gerrards Cross and Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, in the early evening of January 21, 2009. The inquest exonerated driver Phillip Galligan, who was travelling below the speed limit, as the darkness meant he had ‘no chance at all’ of avoiding her. In another case, father-of-five Dr John Bendor-Samuel, 81, died after being hit by a car while crossing the road in Studley Green, Buckinghamshire, on January 6, 2011. Collision investigators told his inquest the vehicle appeared to be travelling within the speed limit. Police said street lighting, which had been turned off along the 40mph stretch of road by Buckinghamshire County Council as part of a cost-cutting exercise, could have saved his life. AA president Edmund King said: ‘There is growing evidence that cost savings from councils turning off street lights are being paid for with lives. Inquests point to a particular danger on roads with speed limits of 40mph or higher. ‘For that reason, drivers have no choice . but to slow down and switch to full beam on faster town roads where . late-night street lighting used to make roads and streets safer places . to travel. ‘Many of these inquests clear the drivers of blame, which means these tragic deaths are accidents waiting to happen. With many more councils switching off their street lights for at least part of the night, the tragedy will just get worse. The AA said drivers had little or no chance of avoiding collisions on unlit streets and predicted problem would 'get worse' as council cut back on street lights to save money . ‘At what point will the Government take action or help councils to finance the switch to energy-saving street lights: 10, 15, 20 inquests later?’ The AA investigation followed research in . April which showed there were fewer accident reductions between 2007 . and 2012 on 40mph roads where street lights had been switched off. Last year, a survey found that a third of councils have switched off street lights to save money, while nearly half are making streets darker by dimming bulbs. The Campaign to Protect Rural England found that of 71 local authorities which responded, 23 switched off street lights - typically between midnight and 5am - and 32 dimmed lights. Councils were mainly motivated by a desire to save energy and money, with the reduction of light pollution ‘an additional benefit’. Bradford council is running a dimming scheme designed to save £400,000 a year and reduce power consumption by 25 per cent. Essex County Council expects to save £1million per year by introducing a part-night lighting scheme. A Local Government Association spokesman . said: ‘Councils always consider the safety implications before turning . off street lights, monitor subsequent safety statistics and act if . presented with evidence of a public safety risk.’","AA said drivers had little or no chance of avoiding collisions on unlit streets .

"This picture of a banged-up Ferrari Enzo is enough to make any car lover shed a tear. The rare million-dollar vehicle was involved in a crash in Stamford, Connecticut on Monday when a mechanic took the sports car out for a ride and spun out of control. The car's owner, 71-year-old mattress company mogul Michael Fux, had placed the prized car in the care of Greenwich dealership Miller Motorcars. Abused: A rare Ferrari Enzo was badly damaged in a Monday morning crash in Stamford, Connecticut. A technician was driving the vehicle at the time . Crashed: Ferrari technician Leonardo Garcia, 40, was driving the rare car owned by 71-year-old mattress mogul Michael Fux. Aston Martin technician Daniel Palchik, 31, was also in the vehicle at the time of the crash . The man driving the Ferrari has been identified as technician Leonardo Garcia, 40, was was accompanied by Aston Martin technician Daniel Palchik, 31, for the ride. Garcia lost control of the 650-horsepower car while traveling up the northbound entrance of Interstate 95 around 8:45am, causing the car to fishtail. The car spun across three lanes before hitting a bridge wall and smashing into the center divider, heavily damaging the right side of the car. Private investigator John Michael Hoda was driving southbound when he saw the accident, and told MailOnline he was the first to respond to the scene. He says he pulled both Garcia and Palchik out of the 'totalled' vehicle to safety and that neither were wearing seat belts. Private investigator John Hoda was driving on the other side of the road and was the first to respond to the crash. He took this image, which shows a man sitting on the side of the road and wearing a Miller Motorcars shirt . Garcia suffered a minor cut while Palchik was unhurt . Neither the dealership or owner have commented on the crash, but Fux is no doubt mourning the loss of the car. He told Bed Times Magazine, a trade publication serving the sleep products industry, that he is a 'car freak' and dreamed of owning rare vehicles since he was a little boy growing up poor in Cuba. When he struck his fortune founding mattress company Sleep Innovations, Fux started collecting like mad and last year owned 129 vehicles including 25 Ferraris, 12 Porches, 11 Aston Martins and six Rolls-Royces. The Ferrario Enzo is a special edition sports car named after the Italian motor company's founder, and only 400 were made. But it's not Fux's most valuable car. He also owns a Ferrari FXX, one of only 30 in the world, as well as the first-ever bespoke Rolls-Royce Ghost . He houses the collection in a 30,000-square foot garage at his Milford, NJ home named 'Horse Power Farm'. Fux hopes to build a museum to house the collection, with admission benefiting the Miami Children's Hospital.

"High street banks are using Wonga-style bullying letters to chase customers for payments. Barclays, Lloyds, Halifax, RBS and HSBC are among firms who have sent customers letters that look like they are from outside firms when they are not. The letters appear to be designed to put pressure on customers by making them believe requests for debt repayments have been passed on to third parties. Barclays confirmed it has been using the name Mercers Debt Collection for Barclaycard debts but it said it dropped the pretence of using a different name earlier this year and the change came into effect this week . Energy giant Scottish Power and Anglian Water, which supplies families in the East of England, are also using the letters. A major row erupted last week when it was revealed that payday loan giant Wonga had made up the names of two firms to harass people who were behind on loan repayments. The firm was ordered by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to pay £2.6million in compensation to the 45,000 people affected. The City of London police are investigating whether Wonga has broken one of several laws, ranging from the Theft Act to the Administration of Justice Act, which covers the harassment of debtors. It later emerged the Student Loan Company was using the same tactic to chase graduates for their student loans, and it can now be revealed that the threatening tactics go well beyond the ‘legal loan sharks’ such as Wonga, with a string of household names using the controversial ploy. Barclays has been using the name Mercers Debt Collections, while Lloyds, which is part-owned by the taxpayer, has used Sechiari, Clarke and Mitchell Solicitors, which is actually its in-house legal department. Its subsidiary, Halifax Bank of Scotland, has used the name Blair, Oliver & Scott to chase debts. Payday loan giant Wonga made up the names of firms to harass people who were behind on repayments and was ordered by the Financial Conduct Authority to pay £2.6million in compensation to the 45,000 affected . Anglian Water created a brand called Frontier Debt Collections to pressure people into paying up. One customer targeted in 2010 said: ‘I felt angry and deceived by Anglian Water when I discovered that it was actually them and not a debt collector. ‘I was appalled at the lies they were prepared to tell to deceive me and try to add immense worry to an already stressful situation.’ MPs and consumer groups last night said it was ‘dishonest’ for banks and utility firms to be ‘distressing and intimidating’ their customers. Consumer Action Group founder Marc Gander said: ‘These are dishonest tactics, however they are widely used, even by so-called reputable companies. ‘This is not just about Wonga. All the companies that employ these tactics, whether it is the Student Loans Company, the banks or utility companies, should face equal scrutiny and equal sanctions. ‘Action needs to be taken.’ Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy added: ‘It is dishonest of lenders to disguise letters chasing people for money as being from third parties. 'People who are heavily in debt are under immense financial strain and need to know where to go for help, not be harassed by bogus companies exerting undue pressure and in some cases charging them for it.’ All the companies identified by the Daily Mail insist that while they have used third-party names, any letters sent to consumers made clear who they were owned by. Barclays confirmed it has been using the name Mercers Debt Collection for Barclaycard debts. But it said it dropped the pretence of using a different name earlier this year and the change came into effect this week. Lloyds Bank confirmed it has been using the name Sechiari, Clarke and Mitchell Solicitors as a pseudonym for its in-house legal department since at least 2011, but has decided to phase the name out. 'All the companies that employ these . tactics should face equal scrutiny and equal sanctions' - Marc Gander, Consumer Action Group . Scottish Power created the name Sterling Collections. The company said: ‘Sterling Collections is a part of Scottish Power’s debt recovery process. All customer communications referencing Sterling Collections clearly state “Sterling Collections is a trading name of Scottish Power Energy Retail Ltd”.’ Last night, Labour MP Stella Creasy said: ‘These letters seem to have been designed to frighten people into thinking that they are further along in the debt process than they are. 'At best, they are not being transparent, and at the worst they are being downright deceptive. It’s disgraceful.’ The Solicitors Regulatory Authority said it was looking into several complaints about the tactic. The watchdog’s executive director, Richard Collins, told the Law Society Gazette: ‘We will shortly be issuing guidance for in-house solicitors on our existing requirement that publicity must not be misleading.’","Barclays, Lloyds, Halifax, RBS and HSBC among firms which sent letters .

"Record numbers of accidents are being caused by drivers illegally speaking or texting on hand-held mobile phones. Crashes in which mobiles have been a contributory factor have soared by 21 per cent in just three years. In the year to 2013 alone, fatalities in which mobiles played a part rose by five – from 17 to 22, an increase of nearly a third (29.4 per cent). Record numbers of accidents are being caused by drivers illegally speaking or texting on hand-held mobile phones (file picture) Accidents involving mobiles rose from 378 in 2012 to a high of 422 last year – up 11.6 per cent. The rise bucks the trend of a drop in the overall accident rate, prompting demands from the RAC for a crackdown on texting or making hand-held calls at the wheel. RAC chief engineer David Bizley said the trend of rising numbers of accidents involving mobile phones being used at the wheel will only be reversed when it becomes ‘as unacceptable as drink-driving’. He said: ‘We are ... calling on the police to enforce the current laws on the use of hand-held phones while driving more effectively. ‘This must be supported by a high-profile, government-funded road safety campaign that makes using a hand-held mobile phone at the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink driving. Mr Bizley said: ‘A report by the Transport Research Laboratory in June this year demonstrated that talking on a hand-held phone while driving causes a 46 per cent reduction in reaction speeds, compared to 13 per cent for drivers drinking to the legal limit. This is extremely compelling and puts into perspective the dangers of using a phone while driving.’ He added: ‘We feel there is currently a high level of acceptability which is something both this government, and the next administration that takes over in May 2015, needs to address as a matter of urgency if we are to prevent the number of accidents continuing to rise.’ Motorists caught using a mobile behind the wheel can be punished with three penalty points and a £100 fine . The figures come from the Department for Transport’s analysis of contributing factors to accidents. The number where a mobile was used by the driver rose from 349 in 2010 to 422 in 2013 – up 21 per cent. The RAC Report on Motoring 2014 found that more than a third (34 per cent) of drivers say they worry about other motorists being distracted by their hand-held mobile phones while behind the wheel. Their report also found three quarters  of motorists report regularly observing other people chatting on their hand-held mobile phones while driving. However, just eight per cent of motorists admit to doing it themselves, says the RAC report: ‘This suggests that the underlying issue is the social acceptability of using a mobile phone at the wheel’. Using a hand-held mobile at the wheel has been illegal for a decade and is punishable with three penalty points and a £100 fine. Ministers say they are considering increasing penalties further.","Crashes involving a mobile have risen by 20 per cent in the last three years .

A man drives his large blue convertible down a seafront road in Cannes while walkers stop and stare at the vehicle . Wealthy families from Dubai and Kuwait have reportedly had their cars delivered to the Carlton hotel in Cannes where many spend their holidays in the summer months . The vehicles are tailor made special versions of famous models from car makers like Ferarri, Lamborghini and Bentley - and are certainly turning heads in the resort. The owners seem trusting enough to leave their luxury vehicles parked up on the side of the road while tourists walk past in amazement. The vehicles include an X-Bow, a McLaren, a number of Lamborghinis  and Ferraris of differing colours, parked up alongside luxury hotels and restaurants in the French Riviera destination. Many of the the vehicles parked up in Cannes are tailor made special versions of famous models from a series of high-end luxury car makers . Glamorous: Sightings of luxury supercars, owned by mega-rich Arab famililes, have become common place in Cannes in France . A large white Bentley with tinted windows is parked up on a street in Cannes, France.  A similar influx of cars has been reported in parts of London . Luxury: A number of Kuwaiti-registered vehicles are in Cannes where their wealthy owners are spending their summer holidays away from the searing temperatures at home in the Middle East . Gridlock: A driver and his passenger in a black Ferrari stop to admire a red version of the famous make of car while tourists point out the vehicles and traffic builds up on the road behind . It is becoming increasingly common for super-rich Arab families to have their vehicles delivered to glamorous locations around the world, including Cannes - especially during the summer months . The flashy supercars brought over to Cannes by Middle Eastern playboys that they have been pictured clogging up many of the parking spaces on the waterfront . The pictures come days after similar cars were reported on the streets of Knightsbridge in London as rich Qataris, Saudis, Emiratis and Kuwaitis move to Britain to escape the Middle East's baking mid-summer months. But the growing number of sports cars around the wealthy Knightsbridge district is causing some local residents to worry about breaches of parking rules and potential dangerous driving. The most outrageous car to make the trip over this time around is the six-wheeled Mercedes G63 AMG, an enormous £370,000 off-roader. A 220mph Pagani Huayra, worth more than £1 million, has also attracted attention from tourists and passersby. There is also a gold Range Rover, various Rolls-Royces, Lamborghinis and Ferraris, numerous Bugatti Veyrons and a 1970s Datsun. The rich Arabs stay in the best hotels and empty their wallets in London's most expensive shops, but they also cause problems with their unique supercars. Snazzy: A red Ferrari with blacked out windows is left by the side of the road. Many of the vehicles brought over by superr wealthy Arab tourists are tailor made special versions of famous models . Star attraction: Passers-by stop to admire a chrome-coloured Lamborghini parked in front of another luxury-looking vehicle . A white and blue version of the same make of Lamborghini are parked up in front of the upmarket Carlton Restaurant in Cannes . Residents in affluent Knightsbridge have complained they are behaving in an anti-social manner, revving the cars and treating the exclusive area as their personal racetrack. Panda Morgan-Thomas, a management consultant, said: 'I am not angry. I am just exhausted. After a relatively calm three years the last few days have seen the return of supercars to Knightsbridge. 'They are again racing down Sloane Street from late afternoons until 3 or 4 in the morning. We honestly thought we had made progress but it seems as though local residents are in for another sleepless August.' A queue of extravagant vehicles were parked around Harrods yesterday including a £400,000 Mercedes  AMG, a £1million Pagani Huayra and a £300,000 Rolls Royce . A Dubai-registered £1million Bugatti, parked on double yellow lines in front of a modified Rolls-Royce, attracted the attention of a traffic warden yesterday . A Qatari-owned £200,000 Ferrari 458 in front of a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador. The cars are attracting gangs of camera-wielding youths, dubbed the 'Carparazzi' A £400,000 six-wheeled Mercedes G63 AMG, similar to one which featured on Top Gear, is among the most outrageous to have been shipped across . The cars owners compete with each other to see who can carry out the most outlandish modifications, with this £150,000 Maserati Gran Turismo given a silver bonnet . The wealthy holidaymakers, predominantly from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, arrived in London around a week ago following the end of Ramadan. A number of the supercars have been spotted with parking tickets while others have been driving around with incorrect registration plates. But despite residents dreading 'The Season', there is one group of people salivating at the supercars and leaping to the defence of the drivers - the Carparazzi. When the wealthy Arabs arrive in London, car enthusiasts show up with their cameras to film and photographer the million-pound motors. This £50,000-plus Ferrari 456 Italia has been given a spider wrap by its Qatari owner, who was keen to show it off on the streets of central London yesterday . A gold and black Saudi-owned Bugatti Veyron - which can sell for up to £1million - was parked in a street in Kensington yesterday, causing many to stop and take photos . This heavily-modified gold Range Rover - estimated to be worth more than £150,000 - has attracted attention after its owner parked it outside the Wellesley hotel . Paul Wallace, who runs the YouTube channel Supercars of London, played down their bad behaviour. He said: 'August always proves to be the best time of year for petrolheads to see their dream machines on the road. 'Having seen the change in driving styles and cars, I still can't believe the police presence and residents kicking up a fuss. For four weeks out of 52, these super-wealthy individuals come and pump millions of pounds into the UK economy. 'Not only that, they fulfil many car fan's dream by bringing super rare Bugatti Veyrons, or special edition Paganis. I feel sorry for these guys coming here with their expensive toys as they get harassed by police.' The limited edition Mercedes - which have a starting price of £370,000 - were originally engineered for the Australian Army but have become popular with Arabs as they are one of the few vehicles which can be driven safely off-road through the desert dunes . A blue and white Saudi-owned Rolls Royce, estimated at £300,000, attracts attention of pedestrians after its owner parked it outside the bay in Knightsbridge yesterday . It's not just modern sports cars that are being brought over, this classic UAE registered Datsun 240 GL was spotted on London's Sloane Street yesterday . As word got around that London's richest tourists were showing off their cars near Harrods yesterday, this £180,000 Lamborghini Huracan was soon seen driving past . He added: 'I have been filming all summer and rarely see them drive more than 25 per cent throttle, or make any noise at all. 'I don't see why the residents of Knightsbridge don't use this influx in foreign cars as an excuse to go on holiday and escape one of the busiest, loudest cities in the world for a couple of weeks of the year.' Previous summers have seen expensive cars clamped outside department store Harrods, towed for being uninsured and locals complain about being kept awake by revving engines. Westminster council has revealed the parking fines handed out to cars registered in the United Arab Emirates have nearly doubled in the last three years. A Saudi-registered Pagani Huayra, which has a starting price of around £1million, was spotted parked next to an expensive hotel in the area . A pink-tinged £350,000 Rolls Royce with Saudi number plate was seen driving through west London yesterday as part of the now-annual influx of Arab-owned cars . A Qatari millionaire has brought this £70,000 Mercedes AMG with him for his holiday in Britain and parked the machine outside Harrods yesterday . Cars from the Middle-Eastern country were given a whopping £57,060-worth of fines last year, up from just £31,780 in 2011/12. Fears have been raised that drivers feel they can flout the rules either because they can easily afford the penalties, or because they know they'll be able to move home and ignore the fines. A Westminster City Council spokesman said: 'We do all we can to ensure that all outstanding fines are paid – whatever the nationality of the driver. 'However, when cars aren't registered in this country, it is sometimes extremely difficult to track people down. 'We already work with an agency to help recover money owed by European drivers and we're currently exploring other avenues that might further our success. The start and end point here is that every driver who parks in Westminster is subject to the same laws.' A policeman approaches a modified £100,000 Range Rover, registered in Saudi Arabia, amid locals' concerns about breaches of parking rules and road safety . The expensive machines have been spotted in a full range of colours, with this Mercedes CLS - starting price £82,000 - parked on Chelsea's Sloane Street yesterday .

"Oops!  A learner driver smashed through a front wall and into a house in Netley, Hampshire, after losing control on a tight corner . A learner driver who lost control on a tight corner was lucky to escape injury when she ploughed her car through a wall and into a house. The motorist, a woman in her thirties, was driving with a passenger when she smashed her black Hyundai Getz, which had an L-plate on the back, into a house in the village of Netley, near Southampton. The car destroyed a garden wall and smashed a large hole in the front of the terraced property, which was empty at the time, and both the driver and her male companion walked away unhurt. Paramedics were called and assessed the pair, while emergency services cordoned off part of the road and the car was taken away on a truck. One neighbour told how he heard a loud thump at around 1.30pm on Saturday. James Myles, 63, said: 'I came round and saw the car buried in there and the couple in it were just getting out. 'I was relieved nobody was hurt. They were very lucky and it was lucky there was nobody inside.' Mr Myles, who said the junction was a difficult one to navigate because of on-road parking, said he gave the couple a cup of tea to calm them down as they sat on the wall after the smash. Neighbour Duncan Matthews, 36, was doing building work on his house when he was alerted to the crash. He said: 'I just heard a humongous thud and my wife and I both looked at each other and my wife said ""What was that?"". 'There were 50 people out there within two minutes. It just looked awful.' Sgt Alex Banks of Hedge End police said they would be making further inquiries to try to establish what happened. The female householder returned to her house later but did not want to comment.

"Confusing: The sign which has led Westminster Council to pay back more than 5,000 parking fines . A council which dished out parking fines worth up to £665,000 to 'confused' drivers for more than two years has agreed to pay them back. Westminster City Council issued 5,121 fines at an eye-watering £130 each to people parked in special 'dual use' bays, which became taxi ranks overnight. But it was claimed some drivers had no idea they had done anything wrong - because they had to examine two different signs to work out the rules. The move is the latest in a series of mass refunds by councils, some of which admitted their signs did not comply with the law. Last year Hertfordshire County Council bowed to local pressure and paid back 35,000 fines, worth more than £1 million, to motorists who had driven into a bus lane in Hemel Hempstead. The year before, about 20,000 fines handed out by controversial 'spy cars' mounted with CCTV - which punish drivers parking on double yellow lines or next to school gates - were repaid in the London Borough of Richmond because a parking crusader discovered they were not properly certificated. And earlier this year, it was claimed more than 300,000 fines issued in bays suspended for building work were invalid, because councils had not obtained formal permission from the Department for Transport. Communities secretary Eric Pickles has ramped up a campaign against over-zealous parking measures. In September he said CCTV cars were 'illegal' and should be scrapped. And he said in August: ‘Anti-car measures are driving motorists into the arms of internet retailers and out-of-town superstores. Trying to find somewhere to park is an obstacle course in too many of our towns, cities and seaside resorts.’ The parking spaces which have been awarded the refund were in affluent central London. Jermyn Street is home to the upmarket department store Fortnum & Mason, while Conduit Street, Mayfair, is the base for fashion designer Vivienne Westwood. Fines were also handed out in Oxendon Street, two roads from the capital's Leicester Square. The council fined drivers in some of Britain's most affluent areas, including outside Fortnum & Mason . Jermyn Street, central London, was one of the streets on which the fines were handed out . The parking tickets were handed out from May 2011 until a few days ago, when the signs were corrected. A Westminster Council spokesman said it expected the total value of the 5,121 fines would come to £278,000. If all the tickets were paid at the full rate of £130, they would have come to £665,000. Fines reduce to £65 if paid within a fortnight. But the amount expected to be paid back is less - because many of those appealing will need to contact the council individually. Drivers will need to prove they paid to park, either with their original reference number or with proof of payment. That means anyone who paid with cash may be out of luck. The spokesman said: 'The council will get in touch with anyone whose contact details they have. Anyone else who paid a fine should give what information they have and the council will try and find their ticket and payment on the system.' Fines were also handed out in Oxendon Street, two roads from the capital's Leicester Square . The spokesman added: 'There are many circumstances in which it is claimed that Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) issued by the council were wrongly issued or are invalid. 'It is not the council’s normal policy to make refunds of PCNs once they have been paid, since there is a statutory mechanism for challenging and appealing against PCNs. 'The circumstances in which PCNs were issued in dual use bays are regarded by the council as so special as to justify an exception to its normal policy.' Conduit Street, Mayfair, is the base for fashion designer Vivienne Westwood . It is not the first time Westminster's parking regime has made headlines. In September its traffic wardens were revealed to be the most fine-happy in the country, handing out 1,269 penalties a day, according to figures obtained by the insurance firm LV=. Cabinet member for parking Cllr Nickie Aiken said: 'Dual-use bays are all about maximising the space at the kerbside in the city to enable fair and easy parking for everyone. 'However, we accept that the parking signs in these streets could have given rise to confusion among motorists and so we are making a one-off exception – it is the right thing to do. We have now also replaced signs as a result.'","Westminster City Council issued 5,121 fines of up to £130 each to people .

"Tired of arduously making your own cocktail when you get home after a hard day of work? Then you might want to invest in Yura, a concept from Ukrainian design student Herman Haydin that will make your drink and then fly it to you. The robot drone bartender cap apparently make a healthy cocktail, tea or coffee with accurate numbers of calories for your body. Ukrainian design student Herman Haydin has revealed his idea for flying robot bartenders (shown). Called Yura the concept is part of the 2014 Electrolux Design Lab contest. The flying drones would be capable of making hot and cold drinks and then serving them . The ambitious design is just one among dozens of finalists in the Electrolux Design Lab competition that also includes robot fish that clean your clothes and free-floating fridge bubbles. Instant cleaning glove . This glove disintegrates any stain or dirt from fabrics with a ‘simple’ combination of nanotechnology, ultrasound and water. Air globe . Make the air and temperature in your house mimic that in another location such as Miami. Pure towel . Device that cleans your towel using ultraviolet rays and a high speed dryer fan. Nanopack . This is a packaging system that turns leftover food into cubes for easy storage. Petollar . Mobile device follows your pet and cleans up after them to help people overcome allergies. ‘The main idea in the Yura concept is making custom cocktails or fresh juices for you,’ says Harmin, from the Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture. The drone can be filled with liquid and then would be capable of pouring them in cups of different sizes: 0.25, 0.33 or 0.5 litres (8.5, 11.2 and 17.6 ounces). Once a drink is poured on a flat surface the robot picks the beverage up and flies it to you. Yura, named after a ‘fine barman’ at Harmin’s university, would be in the form of a Parrot AR.Drone. Water and other liquids stored on the robot would be temperature-controlled, so it could be heated or cooled as needed. A logo on the side of the robot would show you how much liquid is inside and also its temperature. The ‘smart brain’ of the robot, which is Wi-Fi enabled, could respond to voice commands. And Yura could also to tell you the number of calories, carbohydrates, fats and proteins in your drink. Yura, named after a 'fine barman' at Harmin's university, would be in the form of a Parrot A.R. Drone. Somewhat unnervingly, the robot will also come and find you and wake you up with a drink in the morning, if you desire, as it is supposedly capable of tracking people down . 'Here you can see the family of tomorrow,' says Haydin. 'They have their own Yura droids. Robots are making fresh juices for them.' The robot would be capable of making hot and cold drinks, while a logo on the side would tell you the state of the liquid inside . Harmin even claims the ambitious design would be self-recharging. ‘The accumulator is a kinetic system that uses kinetic energy of droid,’ he says. ‘So you don't carry about his energy. He is working like luxury Japanese watches.’ Somewhat unnervingly, the robot will also come and find you and wake you up with a drink in the morning, if you desire, as it is supposedly capable of tracking people down. Yura is one of many innovative design concepts in the Electrolux Design Lab competition, the winner of which will receive £4,000 ($6,800) and a 6-month internship at an Electrolux global design centre. Of the many other designs one, called Pecera, is a tank that contains robot fish. When clothes are put inside the tank the fish will apparently eat dirt on the clothes and clean them. Another bizarre concept is the U-Bubble, a floating refrigerator that you can store food inside. It uses magnetic forces to float, with the ceiling being the magnetic force provider, and the bubbles can be controlled by a smartphone for you to open them and access the food.

LG has revealed a working roll-up TV that is also transparent when not in use. The Ultra HD screen uses a special film instead of plastic as backing to allow screen to be rolled into a tight tube for transport. LG Display used high molecular substance-based polyimide film as the backplane of the flexible panel instead of conventional plastic to achieve the maximum curvature radius. The polyimide film also helped reduce the thickness of the panel to significantly improve its flexibility. As for the transparent OLED panel, it boasts 30 percent transmittance, which was achieved by adopting the company’s transparent pixel design technology. The . flexible OLED panel has a high-definition class resolution of 1200 X 810 . with almost 1 million mega-pixels. The panel can be rolled up to a radius of 3cm without affecting the function of the display. This proves that LG Display can bring rollable TVs of more than 50 inches to the market in the future, the firm said. 'LG Display pioneered the OLED TV market and is now leading the next-generation applied OLED technology,' said In-Byung Kang, Senior Vice President and Head of the R&D Center at LG Display. 'We are confident that by 2017, we will successfully develop an Ultra HD flexible and transparent OLED panel of more than 60 inches, which will have transmittance of more than 40 percent and a curvature radius of 100R, thereby leading the future display market.'

"Drivers are being urged by campaigners to turn off their mobile phones or put them in the boot of their cars while driving. At the beginning of Road Safety Week, charity Brake, supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), are also asks everyone to refuse to speak to on the phone to drivers. Police are also launching a crackdown on drivers using phones this week, according to reports. Drivers are being urged by campaigners to turn off their mobile phones while in their cars (stock picture) Brake, along with Specsavers and Romex, a . mobile workforce management solutions company, revealed survey results . showing that 575,000 UK drivers have points on their licence for using . phones at the wheel or being otherwise distracted. Of these, 6.5 per . cent have six points or more. Meanwhile, 62 per cent of children aged between the ages of seven and 11 report being driven by someone talking on the phone and 79 per cent have seen drivers on mobile phones outside their school or home. According to The Times, drivers talking on the phone were to blame for 548 casualties last year - 17 of which were fatal. Brake also highlighted research showing 98 per cent of drivers are unable to divide their time without it affecting performance and that mobile phone use at the wheel as well as eating, drinking and smoking are all proven to increase the risk of a crash. Police are also launching a crackdown on drivers using phones this week, according to reports . Brake deputy chief executive Julie Townsend said: ‘We're living in an age when being constantly connected is the norm. More and more of us have smartphones, and find it hard to switch off, even for a minute. ‘While there are enormous benefits to this new technology, it's also posing dangerous temptations to drivers to divert their concentration away from the critical task at hand, often putting our most vulnerable road users in danger. ‘Many people who wouldn't dream of drink-driving are succumbing to using their phone and other distractions while driving, oblivious that the effect can be similar and the consequences just as horrific.’","At beginning of Road Safety Week, charity Brake calls on people not to speak on the phone to drivers .

"A bag that sounds an alarm if thieves try to tamper with it has been created to solve the age-old problem of where to keep your valuables while at the beach. Lynn and Martin Mulholland, from West Yorkshire, came up with the idea for Clam Bag when their belongings were stolen during a holiday to Spain. The special hold-all has been created with a cord running through the zip which can be attached to a deckchair, sun lounger or seaside umbrella. Safety first: The locked bag is secured around a beach chair with a wire - and sounds an alarm if it's touched . Lynn and Martin Mulholland came up with the idea for Clam Bag when their belongings were stolen while on holiday to Spain . The only way the zip and cord can be untied is by tapping in a personalised combination code, similar to that found on a padlock or briefcase. The bag also has a high-tech alarm system so that if someone attempts to move it from where it is left, a piercing alarm will ring out and alert the owner to the thief. The clever device is perfect for gadgets like smartphones and tablets and essentials like money and keys.

Housewife Lynn, 40, said: ‘My husband and I were on holiday in Spain and we were having lunch when someone took my bag without me realising. ‘It had our passports, money, and credit cards inside and it was an absolute nightmare. ‘When someone steals something from you it's awful, even if it's just 20 or 30 euros, you can't relax and worry it will happen again.

"British space tourists could be blasting off from the UK’s own commercial ‘spaceport’ in four years’ time under ambitious Government plans being launched this week. And Scotland is the favourite to open up the ‘final frontier’ and host the new base – provided the Scots do not vote for independence later this year. Six of the eight potential locations to be unveiled on Tuesday are north of the border, The Mail on Sunday understands. Britain's first commercial spaceport could be based in any one of these eight locations, and would act as a hub for flights by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and XCOR Space Expeditions . At a special event at the Farnborough Air Show this week, Ministers will press ahead with plans to create what they claim will be the first ‘commercial’ spaceport outside the US. The complex, which could act as a European hub for commercial space flights planned by Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic and XCOR Space Expeditions, should be up and running by 2018. That means tourists could be flying into space from the UK in just four years’ time – as long as they can afford tickets which will cost tens of thousands of pounds. The Mail on Sunday has learned that all but two of the possible sites – Newquay in Cornwall and Llanbedr airfield in North Wales – are in Scotland. They include RAF Kinloss on the Moray Firth, Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, and Glasgow Prestwick. New figures show that the space industry employs 34,000 people and contributes £11billion to economy . Sources said the need for the base to be ‘remote’ and secure meant there was more chance it would be on a Scottish site. Last night, Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander, MP for Inverness, talked up the chances of Scotland leading the UK drive to open up ‘the final frontier of commercial space travel’. He said: ‘Scotland has a proud association with space exploration. We celebrated Neil Armstrong’s Scottish ancestry when he became the first man on the moon and only last week an amazing Scottish company was responsible for building the UK Space Agency’s first satellite.’ But sources also privately made clear it was ‘highly unlikely’ the spaceport would ever be built in Scotland if it voted for independence in September’s referendum. One said: ‘An independent Scotland would be free to bid for this sort of thing but I doubt it would have the resources to do it.’ No figure for the cost of the new spaceport has yet been given by UK officials. But the base, which will also act as a launchpad for commercial satellites, could mirror the existing £122million facility in New Mexico, USA, which boasts 10,225 sq metres of hangar space as well as a mission control complex. Last night, UK officials said the space sector already made a ‘remarkable contribution’ to the British economy, with new figures showing it was worth £11billion and employed 34,000 people. They unveiled plans for the country to capture 10 per cent of the global space market by 2030. Business Secretary Vince Cable, who is unveiling the spaceport bid along with the UK Space Agency, hailed the space sector as a point of pride for Britain. Mr Cable said: ‘This week we will announce the next steps for this country’s space race, outlining how we will take one giant leap towards establishing the first British spaceport by 2018 – making the UK the place for space.’ Last night, Virgin Galactic and XCOR welcomed the plan. XCOR president Andrew Nelson, whose firm plans to offer space flights at about £58,000 a time, said: ‘It would be great if we could fly from the UK. ‘Britons are very adventurous –you guys have been the first to do many things.’ A spokesman for Virgin Galactic said it was interested in ‘operating outside of the US at some point’ but was currently ‘focused on beginning commercial operations at Spaceport America in New Mexico’.","Ministers pressing ahead with plans to build first spaceport in Britain .

"China's ban on BBC show Sherlock hasn't stopped it becoming a huge hit on the internet, it was reported today.

Big hit in China: Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes in the hit BBC show Sherlock, which was banned by censors in a crackdown aimed at sexual content . A source in China told the Sunday Mirror: 'Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s older brother, is a dodgy government official and that’s probably too close to home for the Communist Party of China. 'Chinese dramas are dull compared to UK ones. That’s why they’re so popular and people watch them over the internet.'

Earlier this month UK TV bosses flew to China to discuss the ­distribution of other British shows. Broadcasters in China have had strict regulations about showing Western content, but until recently the rules were not as strict for online streaming sites.

"Supermarkets have announced fuel-price cuts ahead of the August bank holiday getaway. Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco are all reducing the cost of their petrol by up to 2p a litre, with diesel going down by 1p a litre. In Asda’s case, this will take the price of its petrol to no more than 124.7p a litre, with diesel at 128.7p for diesel - its lowest prices since January 2011. The move by three of the biggest supermarkets will bring some relief for drivers who have seen pump prices inch up in recent weeks . The average UK price of petrol was 129.71p a litre, with diesel at 133.74p - its lowest since mid-February 2011, yesterday according to the AA. Unlike Asda, other supermarkets are not implementing a national cap so prices could vary regionally. Morrison's is one of the few that hasn't promised a reduction, with a spokesman saying the supermarket will 'be evaluating' prices to 'remain competitive'. An AA spokesman said: 'We have seen competitive independent retailers east of London selling petrol as low as 125.9p a litre recently.' RAC fuel spokesman Pete Williams said: 'We’ve been calling for petrol and diesel prices to fall for some time following the decrease in wholesale prices and so this is a welcome move by the supermarkets. 'We would expect to see other retailers to follow in the coming days giving consumers a great opportunity to fuel up ahead of the bank holiday.' Asda, which claims to offer the cheapest fuel all year round, said released a statement crediting the strength of the pound for the slash in prices. The cost of filling up has almost doubled in a decade, with average prices of around 80p per litre in July 2004 . A spokesman said: 'We’re giving our customers and holiday makers the opportunity to fill up their cars with some of the cheapest fuel prices in the market for years, putting much needed cash back in their pockets as the summer holidays begin. 'A full tank of fuel now costs £5 less than last summer and our national price cap benefits everyone across the country, meaning that no-one filling up at Asda will be forced to pay a premium for their fuel because of where they live.'","Supermarkets all to cut prices ahead of busy weekend .

"A seaside ice cream shop is celebrating 85 years in business - despite serving only one flavour to customers since it opened in 1928. A family code of honour has seen Notarianni's parlour in Blackpool serving homemade Italian vanilla through four generations - even turning down sums of up to £1million offered by corporate agents for the secret family recipe.

'There is an old saying, if something ain't broke don't fix it and it's true,' says Luca, 21, who runs the parlour with father Michael, 55. 'The recipe for our vanilla ice cream has been with with the family for generations and we would never disclose it to anyone else. 'We do have people coming in trying to buy it off us for anything up to a million pounds but we would never sell it for any price.

'There are . only three of us alive who know the recipe, myself, my dad Michael and . my grandad Guissippe. It's so good that it's not even written down. 'We joke to customers that we have to travel on separate airplanes in case anything happens and the recipe gets lost.' Luigi died in 1972 aged 78 and it passed the business onto his daughter Luigina and her husband Guisseppe Vetesse in 1972.

"Rapist footballer Ched Evans is considering quitting the game and pursuing a new career as a painter decorator after being snubbed by two clubs, it has been claimed. The former Wales international was jailed for five years after a jury unanimously agreed he raped a drunk woman in a hotel in Rhyl, north Wales. Evans was released after serving half his sentence but is struggling to find a new club because of the furore over his crime and his lack of contrition. Rapist footballer Ched Evans (pictured left and right) is considering quitting the game and becoming a painter decorator after being snubbed by two clubs, it has been reported . Now reports have emerged that he is considering ditching the game altogether and setting up his own business. He completed a decorating course while he was in jail and now wants to make use of his new skills, the Daily Star reports. Evans continues to protest his innocence and has lodged an appeal with the Criminal Case Review Commission. The newspaper quotes a source as saying: 'His earnings used to top £20,000 a week at Sheffield United and now he is scrambling around looking for a club in the lower divisions. 'An outfit like Tranmere would pay about £2,000 a week - and even they don't want him. 'He is thinking he might be better off giving up on football and building a business.' Evans was initially given permission by former club Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players’ union, the Professional Footballers Association. Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds. A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated.

Just days ago Tranmere Rovers chairman Mark Palios claimed he had turned down an approach from associates of the 25-year-old about the possibility of him playing for the League Two club, which is facing a relegation dog fight. Ched Evans' loyal fiancee Natasha Massey has stood by him and is running the campaign to have his conviction overturned. Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for.

"The ABC has confirmed that one of its employees was asked to delete a tactless tweet referring to the Sydney siege, that was posted as the event continued to unfold. Geoff Hutchison, a Perth radio presenter, took to Twitter at about 7:11pm on Monday to mock the media's coverage of the event. 'COMING UP on our #sydneysiege special EXCLUSIVE Bertie Beetle speaks of his fears. 'I could be next,' says compound chocolate icon,' Mr Hutchison wrote. Bertie Beetle is the name of an Australian chocolate bar made by Nestle. The ABC has confirmed they asked Geoff Hutchison, a Perth radio presenter, to remove an offensive Tweet that was posted during the Sydney siege . A statement from the ABC released on Tuesday, confirmed that the company's management had requested Mr Hutchison to delete the tweet 'soon after it was posted'. The insensitive post Mr Hutchison wrote on Twitter . 'The tweet contained the views of the individual and are not endorsed by the ABC,' the statement said. 'He is currently on leave but when contacted by ABC to question the appropriateness of the tweet, Geoff suggested he was commenting on the nature of the media coverage. 'Subsequent to the discussion, Geoff chose to take it down.' 'Geoff has expressed his regret that the tweet may have caused any undue concern or upset.' The ABC 720 morning host tweeted constantly throughout the siege as more information came through, mostly criticising media coverage of the event and social media users for spreading unconfirmed rumours. 'Breaking News - no new development on #sydneysiege. We go live to the scene. Reporter, what can you tell us? Nothing. More soon,' an earlier tweet from Mr Hutchison read. The tasteless tweet comes only a few weeks after the ABC was forced to apologise for another controversial tweet regarding the status of cricketer Phillip Hughes, as he was rushed from the Sydney Cricket Ground after just being hit by a bouncer. Mr Hutchison tweeted constantly throughout the siege as more information came through, mostly criticising media coverage of the event and social media users for spreading unconfirmed rumours . It comes only a few weeks after the ABC was forced to apologise for another controversial tweet regarding the status of cricketer Phillip Hughes, as he was rushed from the Sydney Cricket Ground after just being hit . It read: 'Cricket NSW could not confirm if Phil Hughes was alive when he left the SCG,' leading to an uproar from social media users at the premature and unclear tweet. 'The tweet was a mistake. It was meant for internal use, but someone mistakenly tweeted the information,' an ABC spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia at the time. 'As soon as we noticed, it was taken down and we posted an apology. We do apologise for the tweet.' Mr Hutchison is well-known for his controversial social media comments. In 2010, he deleted his entire Twitter account after posting a series of offensive Tweets during an appearance by Tony Abbott on ABC's QandA program. Pop stars, comedians and Kevin Rudd's daughter are among critics of Rupert Murdoch (above) for his tweet about the Sydney hostage crisis . The above tweet prompted an angry response for failing to mention the siege victims . One of these tweets was: 'Tony, why are you frightened of intercourse with Julia? Is it because we will be watching and measuring?' However Mr Hutchison was not the only person to be criticised for a tweet during the siege in Sydney, with Rupert Murdoch prompting a flood of angry responses from people for choosing to brag about his newspaper rather than mentioning the victims. 'AUST gets wake-call with Sydney terror. Only Daily Telegraph caught the bloody outcome at 2.00 am. Congrats,' Murdoch's tweet said.","Geoff Hutchison, a Perth radio presenter, posted the tweet during the siege .

"Sugenth Jeyakumar, 14, died after being injured during a tackle in a PE lesson football game at Whitmore High School in Harrow, north London . A 14-year-old schoolboy has died after making a sliding tackle in a football match during a school PE lesson. Sugenth Jeyakumar was playing with classmates when he slid in for a tackle on the astroturf pitch at Whitmore High School in Harrow, north west London. The teenager, who was in Year 10 at the school, was taken to Northwick Park Hospital following the incident last Tuesday but died from his injuries soon after. It is believed he suffered a severe knock to the chest, causing internal bleeding which led to his death. The coroner has been informed and an inquest is due to take place next year. Tributes have now been paid to the youngster, who has been described as a 'great lad' and an 'amazing friend, caring brother and loving son'. A Facebook group in tribute to the teenager says: 'May you rest in peace - you're now in a better place. Much love.' Jack Dowling, a friend of Sugenth, wrote on the social media site: 'RIP brother I miss u man we will never forget u miss u sitting in rmt history and business gone but never forgotten always loved miss u bro. (sic)' Schoolfriend George Rance also wrote: 'R.I.P - everyones thoughts are with your family and friends.' Vitushan Lulu Krishnamohan added: 'Truly a great lad. Doesn't deserve to have his life taken. R.I.P.' And Colin Gall said: 'RIP sad news. Lovely guy gone too young.' Meanwhile, a friend on Twitter, writing under the name Nikita, wrote: 'RIP Sugenth you will be missed by everyone can't believe you're already gone. Hope you're looking down on everyone and smiling.' And another, under the name Holly, said: 'Boy in the year above me died today on the football pitch - RIP Sugenth you will be missed.' Sue Hammond, headteacher of Whitmore High School, said Sugenth had a 'great future ahead of him'. Tributes have described Sugenth (pictured during a school art lesson) as a 'great lad' and an 'amazing friend, caring brother and loving son'. He died from severe injuries at London's Northwick Park Hospital last week . The teenager had been playing football on astroturf at Whitmore High School in Harrow, north west London, when he was injured making a slide tackle. He later died from his injuries, believed to be internal bleeding . She said: 'This young man represented the best in all of us: caring and helpful, bright and hardworking, liked by everyone and with a great future ahead of him. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this very sad time.' The full-size football pitch was opened two years ago and the school is partners with Watford FC, which provides training for PE students at the school. David Perry, leader of Harrow Council, said the authority was liaising with the school to provide consular assistance. He said: 'Our thoughts and condolences are with the family following this tragic accident. 'Harrow Council are doing all we can to support the school community at this difficult time.'

"A flood of sex abuse victims are expected to come forward in the wake of a new lawsuit filed against Michael Jackson, the MailOnline has learned. James Safechuck, 36, is suing the Jackson estate claiming he was abused by the King of Pop after the two appeared together in a 1988 Pepsi ad when he was aged 10. James claims the pop star went on to molest him for years up until the age of 14. He has added his name to a previous suit filed last year by 31-year-old Wade Robson, an Australian former-choreographer who claims Jackson sexually abused him at a young age. Scroll down for video . Victim: James Safechuck, now 36, has come forward to claim sex abuse. A source close to his legal team say it could prompt a 'flood' a similar complaints against Jackson's estate . Today: Safechuck, pictured in London with Jackson in 1988, claims he suffered abuse from age 10 to 14 after the star befriended him while filming a Pepsi commercial . Sources have revealed to MailOnline that his legal team believe his case is so strong that it will likely inspire ‘dozens’ more victims of abuse to come forward and share their accounts of the singer. One source close to James’ lawyer said: ‘We think that James’ case might well prompt a flood of other victims to come forward. The idea that some people take years and years to come to terms with this kind of abuse is very typical. 'We believe that James coming forward will inspire others to do the same. There could be dozens more victims of Michael Jackson out there.’ The lawsuit filed last week remains sealed, but it’s believed James, a computer programmer who is married with two children and lives in Van Nuys, California, met Jackson when the pair starred in the Pepsi commercial. James was acting the part of a young boy who sneaks into the singer's dressing room during a concert and eventually meets his idol. During 1988, the year the commercial was shot, James followed Jackson around the world - attending concerts in Paris, Los Angeles, and London. He was also photographed with the star attending a Pepsi conference in Hawaii and seeing the premiere of The Phantom of the Opera musical on Broadway along with Liza Minelli. Haunted: Safechuck now works as a computer programmer in Southern California and has since married and went on to have two kids of his own.The two pictured in red above in Hawaii . Child actor: Safechuck was just 10 years old when he was cast to star in a Pepsi commercial with Jackson. He plays a boy who sneaks into Jackson's dressing room in the middle of a concert . Caught: At the end of the commercial, Safechuck meets his idol when Jackson returns to the dressing room . Jackson even treated James to a shopping spree at F.A.O. Schwarz toy store on that New York trip. A sex abuse victims’ group also believes James’ account could give many more victims the courage to finally come forward. David Clohessy, Executive Director of SNAP, the Survivors' Network of those Abused by Priests, told MailOnline: ‘Given Michael Jackson’s popularity and prominence, now victim James Safechuck has come forward, there certainly could be a flood of other victims coming out. ‘We hope that this brave man’s courage will inspire many others to come forward. There could be dozens and dozens and we hope they start to speak up. ‘Some will blast Jackson's latest accuser for his timing. That's wrong. If kids are to be safe from predators, adults must welcome – indeed, be grateful for – abuse reports no matter when they happen.' He added: ‘We hope every single person who saw, suspected or suffered child sex crimes by Jackson will find the courage to step forward.’ Jackson went on trial in 2005 accused of molesting 13-year-old cancer survivor Gavin Arvizo at his Neverland ranch two years earlier and James featured in the trial. Prosecutors gathered testimony from several Neverland Ranch workers who said they feared James was an abuse victim. Several workers say he was a frequent guest and an estate manager testified that he saw Jackson standing in a Jacuzzi with his hands 'down the front of Jimmy's underpants and was manipulating the boy's genitalia'. A maid at the ranch said she saw the two in bed together, nude from the waist up, on two different occasions. Roadie: Safechuck traveled attended many international shows with Jackson. Seen above in Paris in 1988 . Witness: One Neverland Ranch maid said in 2005 that she saw Jackson and Safechuck naked from the waist up in bed together on two different occasions . But James never co-operated with prosecutors -  he changed his mind when he became a father and underwent therapy. Because of his change of heart, a judge ruled that the allegations wouldn't be included in the trial. Jackson was later acquitted of all charges. Yesterday the MailOnline visited James’ family home in a smart suburb of Van Nuys and spoke to his wife, . She would only say: ‘James is not in. He is not doing this for the money, that’s not what this is about.’ James' lawyer Maryann Marzano, a partner at Gradstein & Marzano in LA, said in a statement: 'If there is still any question about the predatory nature of Michael Jackson’s so-called ""friendships"" with young boys, it should be laid to rest by the indisputable facts of what Michael did to James Safechuck. 'Those facts are set forth in the Complaint that James Safechuck filed in L.A. Superior Court last Friday, May 9, 2014.' The attorney for Jackson's estate, Howard Weitzman, has called the claims 'false and scurrilous'.","James Safechuck, 36, is suing Jackson .

"In a stunning clash of two branches of the U.S. federal government, a Texas congressman told Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday that he should be 'in jail' instead of answering questions in a Capitol Hill hearing. Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold refused to ask Holder – the hearing's sole witness – any questions, instead slamming him for defying congressional document subpoenas and ignoring a criminal contempt citation the House of Representatives lodged against him nearly two years ago. 'I'm committed to maintaining the constitutional balance of power and the authority that this legislative branch has,' Farenthold said, 'and I just don’t think it’s appropriate that Mr. Holder be here.' 'If an American citizen had not complied with one of the Justice Department’s subpoenas, they would be in jail and not sitting here in front of me testifying.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Attorney General Eric Holder defended his record before the House Judiciary Committee, fending off barbs about how the DOJ has blocked Congressional investigations into the deadly Operation Fast and Furious fiasco . Texas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold refused to ask Holder any questions, suggesting that the Attorney General should be 'in jail' for contempt of Congress . Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed in 2010 with a gun that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and explosives -- a DOJ agency -- sent across the Mexican border in a flawed scheme to track drug kingpins . His point made, Farenthold gave the balance of his allotted five minutes to South Carolina GOp Rep. Trey Gowdy. The House voted in 2012 to hold Holder in civil and criminal contempt following the Justice Department's longstanding refusal to turn over documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. That program was a scandal-plagued gun-running exercise that put illicit weapons in the hands of hundreds of Mexican nationals tied to drug cartels, beginning in 2009. The government has said it intended to track the guns, but it couldnt recover more than 1,300 of them. Brian Terry, a U.S. Border Patrol agent, was killed in December 2010 with one of those weapons. Other Fast and Furious guns have been tied to the deaths of about 200 Mexican citizens. Earlier in Tuesday's House Judiciary Committee hearing, Holder snapped at another Texas congressman, Louie Gohmert, who upbraided him over his failure to produce everything Congress had subpoenaed. 'Sir, I've read you what your . department promised, and it is inadequate,' Gohmert lectured. 'And I . realize that contempt is not a big deal to our attorney general, but it . is important that we have proper oversight.' 'You don’t want to go there, buddy,' Holder warned the congressman. 'You don’t want to go there, okay?' Hours earlier Texas GOP Rep. Louis Gohmert slammed Holder, saying a congressional vote of contempt is apparently 'not a big deal to our attorney general' When Gohmert brought up the 2012 congressional criminal contempt citation against Holder, the attorney general snapped: 'You don't want to go there, buddy!' Most of the guns trafficked into Mexico in the flawed 'Fast and Furious' program wound up in the hands of drug lords and their henchmen, and some were used to commit murders -- on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border . Gohmert, a former Texas district court judge, fired back. 'Sir, we’ve been trying to get to the bottom of Fast and Furious where people died, where at least a couple hundred Mexicans died,' he said. 'And we can’t get the information to get to the bottom of that, so I don’t need lectures from you about contempt, because it is very difficult to deal with asking questions.' 'And I don’t need lectures from you either,' Holder sniped. Holder spent more than two hours defending his record as attorney general amid a sustained grilling from Republicans. 'I'll put my record up against any other attorney general,' he insisted. 'Any hint that we have engaged in anything partisan in nature … I one-thousand-percent reject.'","Holder defended his record before a hostile panel of GOP lawmakers who won't let him forget that he was held in contempt of Congress in 2012 .

"Schools would open until 6pm for up to 45 weeks a year under plans drawn up by David Cameron’s former Number Ten policy chief. Paul Kirby suggests long summer holidays and short working days for teachers should be scrapped. Under the highly controversial scheme, which would enrage teaching unions, the average school day would run from 9am to 6pm, while school holidays would be slashed to seven weeks. Long summer holidays and short working days would be scrapped under the plans, drawn up by David Cameron's former Number Ten Policy Chief, Paul Kirby . However, government sources last night played down the prospects of the idea ever being adopted. Academies and free schools have had the flexibility to alter their school day and term length, including working longer hour, for years. But few have taken up the opportunity. A Government source said ministers were keen for more schools to experiment with different hours, but said Mr Kirby’s call for a compulsory 45-hour week went ‘well beyond’ anything being considered. Schools already have the freedom to set their own term dates and vary the length of days, which could signal the end of the long summer holidays for thousands of children. Mr Kirby told The Sun his proposals would ‘transform the lives of most households in the UK within two years’. Nine-hour school days would slash childcare costs for parents and boost education standards, it was claimed. A Government source said ministers are very keen to see schools experiment with their hours, but added Mr Kirby's proposals go 'well beyond' that. A spokesman for the Department of Education said they are open to consider new ideas for further reform . Pupils would also be better prepared for work as they would become used to the long hours and it would keep them off the streets. Mr Kirby, who left Downing Street a year . ago to return full-time to accountancy firm KPMG, added: ‘This is a . once in a generation reset that wouldn’t detract from the current school . freedom agenda. It also involves dramatically expanding what schools . actually do — into sport and other activities. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the Chief Inspector of Schools, said the six-week summer holiday is too long . ‘All the lessons from abroad where this has happened previously, such as the United States, show that elongating the school day takes much of the stress away from teachers and pupils.’ Last year teachers demanded a 20-hour a week limit on classes so they could maintain a healthy ‘work/life balance’. Union members called for a rigid 35-hour week, with little more than half given over to teaching children. But just last month Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, said the six week summer holiday was too long. It is thought that reducing the Christmas, Easter and summer holidays to little more than two weeks each would save the government money by reducing the number of claims for child tax credits. It could also net hundreds of millions more income tax from mothers able to go back to work, . A Department for Education spokesperson said last night: ‘We are already giving all schools the freedom to set the length of the school day and term. 'Many Academies and Free Schools offer extended opening hours, and we want more schools to take up these freedoms. We will obviously consider recommendations for further reforms.’","Long summer holidays and short working days would be scrapped .

"Pope Francis has condemned the practice of leaving the elderly in care homes as a form of 'hidden euthanasia', while speaking at a special mass in Rome to honour grandparents . Pope Francis has condemned the practice of leaving the elderly in care homes as a form of ‘hidden euthanasia’. At a special mass in Rome to honour grandparents, the Pope praised the value of the older generation to society. He stressed the importance of taking care of the elderly properly and warned of a ‘poisonous’ culture in which they are effectively abandoned in institutions where they may suffer neglect and loneliness. The . 77-year-old told the crowd at St Peter’s Basilica that this culture . ‘hurts our world’ and said a society that does not care for grandparents . ‘has no future’. ‘How many times we discard older people with attitudes that are akin to a hidden form of euthanasia,’ he added. The . Pope recognised that residential homes can be necessary for those who . have no family to care for them, but said they must truly be ‘homes, not . prisons’ and must serve the interests and needs of the residents. ‘There must never be institutions where the elderly are forgotten, hidden or neglected,’ he said. Describing . old age as ‘a time of grace’, Francis reminded the congregation that . grandparents have a lot of wisdom to pass down to the next generation. He . said a grandfather is in a way ‘twice a father’ and a grandmother . ‘twice a mother’, adding: ‘Blessed are those families who have . grandparents nearby.’ Former pope Benedict XVI, dressed in papal whites, made a rare public appearance at the meeting, although he left before the public mass. Pope Francis said that the culture of putting the elderly in care homes  'hurts our world' and said a society that does not care for grandparents 'has no future' Francis embraced him twice and took the opportunity to express his admiration for his predecessor, saying that he was ‘very happy to have him living in the Vatican as it was like having a wise old granddad in the house’. He has previously admitted that he continues to asks Benedict for advice. On the way back from his visit to South Korea in August, Francis told journalists: ‘We see each other.

"Caught: 'Mafia' boss Domenico Rancadore has been arrested in London after 19 years on the run, where he had lived a secret life as a travel agent . For 19 years he has lived quietly in a £300,000 white-painted house in a prosperous London suburb, running a travel agency business with his wife. Neighbours knew him as Marc Skinner, a 64-year-old father of two described as ‘reserved and polite’ who appeared to be a pillar of the community. Yesterday, however, they discovered he is actually Domenico Rancadore – a feared Mafia boss who has been on the run from the Italian authorities since 1994. While at large he was placed on the list of Italy’s most wanted criminals after being sentenced to seven years in jail in his absence for running a branch of the Sicilian Mafia. He was head of a crime family involved in extortion, racketeering and drug trafficking, police said. According to The Sun, he once sent a lamb's head and ten bullets to a prison chaplain who had spoken out about Mafia influence in Palermo, Sicily. A note with the bullets read: 'One is for your head, one for your heart. 'One is for the coup de grace. This is your final warning.' Italian detectives knew he was living in London under a false identity but could not intervene because the crime of ‘Mafia association’ is not recognised by authorities in Britain. The situation is understood to have changed significantly to have allowed British police to raid his home in Uxbridge, West London, on Wednesday evening. When officers arrived at his front door he tried to escape though the back gate. But a detective constable was waiting there and arrested him. Yesterday he appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court where a lawyer for the Italian government called for him to be extradited to serve his prison sentence. However, he could go free today because of ‘significant deficiencies’ in the warrant for his arrest. Born in Palermo, Sicily, in 1949, Rancadore was the son of a Mafia boss called Giuseppe, who was later jailed for life. Scroll down for video . Family: His wife Anne (right), 60, and daughter Daniela Skinner (left), 33, leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court today . He worked as a PE teacher and was fondly known as ‘the professor’ before turning to crime. Italian police say he was involved in the so-called Mafia Wars 30 years ago. He was known as a ‘man of honour’ in the Mafia or ‘Cosa Nostra’ group which controlled the Palermo district of Trabia, the court heard. Rancadore was jailed in his absence in 1999 for being part of a criminal organisation between 1987 and 1995. Gaetano Lima, a Mafia supergrass, told La Repubblica newspaper: ‘Rancadore is dangerous, I can assure you. I know, because I raised him.’ By the time he was convicted he was already thriving in his new life with his wife Ann, 60, the daughter of a former Italian consul to London, and their children Giuseppe, 36, and Daniela, 33. Sources said Rancadore was ‘living a golden life’ in Britain and was often seen driving Jaguar and Mercedes cars. Last night neighbours expressed surprise that he had chosen their neighbourhood to live in. One said: ‘People don’t hide out in Uxbridge, not even the Mafia.’ Home: This is the house in Uxbridge, London where fugitive Mafia boss Domenico Rancadore had been living with his wife and two children until he was arrested last night . Joan Hills, 76, said: ‘I know him very well and he’s one of the best neighbours you could ever have. ‘They have been here for years. I’ve seen the children grow up with my children. I don’t know the ins and outs of this, but they are the nicest people that you could wish to meet.’ The . Sicilian Mafia, or Cosa Nostra, which translates into English as 'Our . Thing', emerged in the mid-19th century and is still going strong. It . is not one single organisation, instead it is made up of around 100 . families who each run a territory on the island, either a district of a . city, a town or a few villages. Its . stronghold is Palermo, the capital of the Sicilian region, and the . areas surrounding it, where at least half of all members are based. Their power grew from protection, racketeering and extortion, because of the number of traders and landowners there to exploit. In more recent times, much of their money has come from the smuggling of cigarettes and drugs like heroin to Europe and America. In . the post-war era the Italian authorities fought against the Mafia, but . even after a series of huge court cases the families couldn't be broken. According . to Francesco Messineo, the Chief Prosecutor of Palermo, there are still . 94 Mafia families on Sicily, with between 3,500 to 4,000 mobsters. Tennis coach Terry Stidder, 53, said: ‘As far as I can tell he seemed a nice guy – quiet, reserved and polite. He would always say hello or wave. He would always go out dressed nicely, he was either in a very sharp suit or smart casual. ‘He was your typical southern European. He had dark hair, greased down and very sharp. There was no real weight on him, he looked in good shape for his age.’ According to Italian media, Rancadore lived openly in London and considered himself untouchable because his conviction was apparently not recognised under British law. He was remanded in custody yesterday, but could walk free today because of ‘deficiencies’ surrounding the warrant for his arrest. District Judge Quentin Purdy said: ‘The warrant may be such it has to be discharged. There are concerns about the validity of the warrant that has come before the court.’ Defence solicitor Euan Macmillan agreed that there were ‘significant deficiencies’ with the document. In a  statement the Italian interior ministry said: ‘Several witnesses have referred to him as a leading member of the Palermo Mafia “family”. In particular, in the 1990s, he played the role of chief of the Cosa Nostra in Trabia, Palermo.' Convicted: The boss was jailed for seven years in his absence for crimes carried out around the cathedral city of Palermo in Sicily . By RYAN HOOPER . Mafia man: Gerlandino Messina lasted 11 years on the run before being caught in 2010 - one of several mobster arrests that year . Domenico Rancadore's arrest in London this week brought to an end almost two decades of life as a fugitive for the Mafia boss. He had evaded justice since 1994, having been sentenced to seven years in jail his absence for links to the Mafia group Cosa Nostra, and was believed to have been running a travel agency in London. However his capture by authorities yesterday represents the latest in a line of Mafia fugitives to have been apprehended after years of evasion. Michele Zagaria was described as one of Italy's most wanted mobsters before he was caught at the end of 2011. On the run since 1995, Zagaria was found in an underground bunker in Casapesenna, in his home town province of Caserta in southern Italy, headquarters of the Casalesi clan of the Neapolitan Camorra. Prosecutors said at the time how the province's well-known infiltration of local businesses and politics was similar to that of the Cosa Nostra. Gerlandino Messina lasted 11 years on the run before being caught in 2010 - one of several mobster arrests that year. Messina had been on the run since the late 1990s having been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for mafia association and a series of murders. He was eventually nabbed by the Carabinieri in Favara, near Agrigento, his power base in Sicily. It prompted then-premier Silvio Berlusconi to say the arrest was the latest evidence of the government's 'unprecedented success' in cracking down on organised crime. It came as anti-Mafia police arrested dozens of suspected mobsters that summer, including Nicola Schiavone, from the Camorra crime syndicate in southern Italy, who was believed to have taken the helm of the Casalesi clan, a ruthless group responsible for murders, extortion and other trafficking - though police said he showed no resistance to his arrest. Found: In November 2007, Salvatore Lo Piccolo, convicted of murder and on the run since 1998, was caught in a morning raid near Sicily's capital Palermo . In November 2007, Salvatore Lo Piccolo, convicted of murder and on the run since 1998, was caught in a morning raid near Sicily's capital Palermo. Lo Piccolo's son Sandro, another top mob figure, and two men accused of being local bosses also were also arrested. Investigators believe Lo Piccolo could have emerged as the Mafia's new overall head after Bernardo Provenzano, the reputed number one of the Cosa Nostra crime syndicate, was held in Corleone in April the previous year. The group's second in command, Gianni Nicchi, was captured in 2009 when he was found hiding in an apartment in Palermo. Police said Nicchi, described as a 'young, dangerous, ambitious, pitiless killer', quickly climbed to the top of Palermo-based crime families after Lo Piccolo's arrest. Nicchi, a fugitive since 2006, was convicted in 2008 of extortion and sentenced to 18 years in prison. One man still evading capture is Matteo Messina Denaro, who has been on Italy's wanted list since 1993 for murder and other crimes. Rancadore's arrest is not the first time someone with links to the Mafia has been held in England. In 2007, housewife Ann Hathaway, from Greater Manchester, agreed to be extradited where Italian authorities wanted her to stand trial as one of 88 people accused over alleged Mafia activities. However, after agreeing a plea bargain deal with prosecutor Nicolo Marino, in which she admitted Mafia association, Hathaway was freed. She was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and warned that the penalty would apply if she committed a crime within the next five years.","Domenico Rancadore, 64, went missing in 1994 and has an English family .

Although they requested three scoops . of ice cream each, they avoided numerous toppings and extras, wary of . mounting costs, so they were shocked when they were  charged so much. Roger Bannister said: 'How can they get away with charging £50 for four ice cream cones? Ripped off: The scandal is reigniting a row in the country about tourists being 'ripped off' by local businesses . 'The cones had three flavours and a . couple of wafers but if we wanted whipped cream that was another three . euros on top each. We knew prices were expensive if you sat down, but we . took the ice creams away – how much would it have cost us if we had sat . down?' Mr Bannister, a company executive, . said the group had been on a six-day trip to Rome, adding: 'Up until . then we'd had a brilliant time, but that left a bad taste in the mouth – . quite literally. To be honest the ice cream wasn't that nice either. We'd had better ones earlier on in the holiday. 'I felt I had been ripped off but what could I do?' Matteo Costantini, a local councillor, . said of the tourists' ordeal: 'They were justifiably outraged at what . they had been asked to pay, and it should not be allowed. There needs to . be a clampdown on places like this that charge extortionate prices to . unsuspecting tourists. 'It does nothing for the image of the city and will probably put people off coming here.' Mr Costantini added that he had . personally offered to refund the money to the group but they had told . him donate it to a charity. The ice cream parlour in question gave . a chilly response. A staff member who refused to give her name said: . 'The prices are clearly on display. They got what they asked for – four . ice creams.' High cost: The family were horrified by the high price after buying ice creams at the Antica Roma bar (left of picture) in Rome . She said the gelateria's most . expensive cone is 25 euros (£21) and added: 'They got 16 euros' worth of . ice cream each – almost a kilo. What more did they want?

"Pope Francis yesterday signalled  a more tolerant era of Vatican thinking after he spoke out in defence of homosexuals. In remarks at odds with traditional rhetoric, the Pontiff refused to condemn homosexuality, saying: ‘We must  be brothers.’ In the most conciliatory words yet from the Vatican on the subject of gay priests, he added: ‘If a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge him?’ The new Pope used a talk with journalists covering his visit to Brazil to emphasise Roman Catholic teaching that says  those who have gay orientation should  be accepted. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Conciliatory: Pope Francis during a press conference on the flight back to Italy after departure from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where he signalled a dramatic turnaround in the Catholic church's approach to gay priests . A modern Pope? The Pope was funny and candid during a news conference that lasted almost an hour and a half, during which he did not attempt to dodge any difficult questions fielded by the reporters present . He stressed that the official position of the Church is that homosexual acts are sinful, but homosexual urges and thoughts are not. The message that gay people should be ‘integrated’ into society rather than marginalised marks a clear departure for the Papacy. In recent years the pronouncements of Francis’s predecessor Pope Benedict have fiercely condemned gay rights and at one point the former Pope described gay relationships as ‘evil’. Speaking on his flight back to Rome from Rio, the Pontiff saved his criticism for gay pressure groups and lobbies. ‘The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well,’ he said. ‘It says they should not be marginalised because of this orientation but that they must be integrated into society. ‘The problem is not having this orientation. We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem.’ Accepting: His statements marked a dramatic turnaround from his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who signed a document in 2005 that said men with deep-rooted homosexual tendencies should not be priests . But he deflected questions about a gay lobby active in the Vatican, said last month to have been the subject of complaints by the Pope. ‘You see a lot written about the gay lobby. I still have not seen anyone in the Vatican with an identity card saying they are gay,’ he added. Nothing said during the 80-minute in-flight interview alters the strong Vatican opposition to gay relationships or marriage, or the Church ban on actively gay priests. But his words mark an entirely different emphasis since the retirement of Benedict in the spring.Before he became Pope Benedict, the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger said gay relationships were  ‘evil’ and ‘contrary to natural order’. He underlined rules that prevent active gays from becoming priests, and he repeatedly condemned gay equality laws, saying they ‘violate the natural law upon which the equality of all human beings is grounded’. In further evidence of a softening of attitudes, Pope Francis said women should be able to take more important roles in the Church – but not as priests. ‘We cannot limit the role of women in the Church to altar girls or the president of a charity, there must be more,’ he said in his first public statement on campaigns in the Catholic church for women priests. Ministering to the faithful: Pope Francis is seen on a large screen as he celebrates the World Youth Day's concluding Mass on Copacabana beach, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, yesterday . Massive: More than three million people were estimated to have gathered for the farewell Mass . A woman holds rosary beads and an image of the Virgin at the Copacabana mass: Pope Francis also today suggested that he wanted a greater role for women in the Church, but he insisted they could not be priests . All this devotion is tiring: Sun worshippers top up their tan or nap as devout Catholics listen intently . ‘But with regard to the ordination of women, the Church has spoken and says no. ‘Pope John Paul said so with a formula that was definitive.’ The change of tone from the Vatican on homosexuality comes three weeks after the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, said in a key speech on gay rights that criticism of the Church of England’s attitudes may be  justified and ‘pretending that  nothing has changed is absurd  and impossible’. Archbishop Welby told Anglicans that the Parliamentary debate on same-sex marriage showed the Church was out of touch with majority thinking. He told General Synod that ‘the cultural and political ground is changing. Anyone who listened to the Same Sex Marriage Bill second reading debate in the House of Lords could not fail to be struck by the overwhelming change of cultural hinterland. Predictable attitudes were no longer there.’ He added: ‘We may or may not like it but we must accept there is a revolution in the area of sexuality.’ His shock resignation in February threw the Catholic Church into turmoil, at the notion there could be ‘two Popes’ living side by side in Rome. But Pope Benedict’s presence in the Vatican has been dismissed by his successor as ‘like having granddad in the house.’ Francis said that he does not feel ‘encumbered’ by his predecessor, but likes having him there to ask for advice. Benedict has now taken up residence in a convent close to St Peter’s Square, where his presence so close to the heart of power poses the threat that Francis’ authority could be undermined. But Francis claimed that he is not intimidated by the former leader of the world’s 1.2billion Catholics. He told journalists on his flight returning from a week-long visit to Brazil:‘Some say, “Do you not feel encumbered? Doesn’t it make you want to rebel?” 'I replied that it is like having your wise old grandfather in the hose. When granddad is in the house he is venerated and listened to.’ He added: ‘Benedict does not meddle ‘ . Once he stepped down as Pope and it emerged that for security reasons he would have to live within the Holy See, there was deep concern over Benedict’s role. The Vatican went out of its way to emphasise that retirement meant just that: retirement. Temporarily it was gripped by confusion over what name and title Benedict should have after retirement. To add to the sense of finality his papal ring and other powerful emblems of authority were destroyed– just as they are after a papal death. When he said goodbye to the cardinals in February Benedict promised not to interfere saying ‘among you is the new Pope that from now on I promise my obedience.’ But he continues to wear Papal white and is known as Pope Emeritus. And his continuing influence was evident earlier this month Francis published an encyclical or document of Catholic doctrine began by Benedict, calling it the work of four hands.’","Previous Pope had signed document saying gay men should not be priests .

"A group of British tourists who caused outrage in Rome when they were charged £54 for just four ice creams have received an apology from the Italian capital's mayor. Roger and Wendy Bannister have also been invited back to the city by mayor Gianni Alemanno in an attempt to make off for their rip-off experience. After they complained to an Italian newspaper about how they were treated at the cafe where they bought the ice cream, many Rome residents warned that the incident could damage the reputation of the city, one of the world's top tourist destinations. Outraged: Holidaymakers Roger Bannister, his brother Steven and their wives Wendy and Joyce with the receipt for their ice cream . Mr and Mrs Bannister, along with Mr . Bannister's brother Stephen and his wife Joyce, were handed the . extortionate bill on Sunday, the last day of their holiday in Italy.

Ripped off: The scandal is reigniting a row in the country about tourists being 'ripped off' by local businesses . Mr Bannister, 58, today told BBC . Breakfast of his shock at receiving the bill: 'It was just disbelief and . then giving the money and having the change slapped down, the five euro . note and the one euro coin, and then the receipt - 64 euros - we just . walked out in disbelief.' But after they went to a newspaper, . he said, Mr Alemanno had got in contact offering 'sincere apologies' and . saying he was 'very upset' about the incident. Mr Bannister, from Stourbridge in the .

"Firefighters scaled the roof of the Sistine Chapel today to install a chimney for the smoke signal that will tell the world that there is a new pope. Cardinals will begin their conclave to elect the new leader of the Catholic Church in Rome on Tuesday afternoon. A Vatican spokesman announced on Friday that cardinals will hold the private meeting  in the Sistine Chapel after a morning mass in St. Peter's Basilica. Firefighters scaled the roof of the Sistine Chapel to install a chimney for the smoke signal to announce the next pope's election . Firefighters place the chimney on the roof of the Sistine Chapel, which has been closed to the public in preparation for the papal conclave . Onlookers will watch the chimney for white smoke announcing the new pontiff, while black smoke will signal that another round of voting is required . Apart from eating and sleeping in the nearby Casa Santa Marta, they . will not be allowed to leave the meeting until they have chosen who will . succeed Pope Benedict XVI, who announced his surprise abdication on . February 10. The Vatican gave the clearest signal yet that it is preparing to elect a . new pontiff by closing off the Sistine Chapel to the public on Thursday. Michelangelo's frescoed masterpiece will be closed to tourists while preparations are made for the Conclave. When . the time come, it will be Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran's job as . proto-deacon to announce 'Habemus Papam!' ('We have a pope!') from the . balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square after the smoke has snaked up . from the Sistine Chapel chimney. On Friday morning, the cardinals accepted letters of explanation from two cardinal-electors who are eligible to vote for the next pope but will not attend. Cardinals arrive for a meeting at the Vatican today, greeted by the Swiss Guards . The cardinals will stay in the Casa Santa Marta while they are not in the Sistine Chapel. One apartment is reserved for the new pope to stay in for the first few weeks of his papacy while Benedict XVI's remain sealed . Casa Santa Marta will be the new pontiff's home for the first few weeks of his papacy while Benedict's old apartments in the Apostolic Palace remain sealed . One of the two was Keith O'Brien of Scotland, who cited personal reasons. All those taking part in the vote have now arrived in Rome, ready for Tuesday. As the . meetings for the conclave were delayed in Rome this week, the former Pope Benedict XVI, 85, was . pictured walking with the aid of a stick through the gardens of his . summer residence at Castel Ggandolfo on the outskirts of Rome. The . former First Leader of the Catholic Church will live at Castel Gandolfo . for several weeks, sleeping in a bed just 75cm wide and without a . canopy, unlike the one the much grander one he slept in over his eight . years as pope. Retirement: The former Pope pictured blessing his followers for the last time as he arrived at Castel Gandolfo last Thursday . Preparations: Workers are pictured installing the stoves where ballots are burned during Conclave . Decision time: The stoves are hooked up to the chapel's chimney and white smoke billows from them when a decision on the new Pope is made . He will then move to a specially prepared apartment at a convent in the Vatican. The retired pontiff has reportedly taken with him a number of theology books as well as music to listen to. He was also hoping to play the piano - one of his favourite pastimes - in the evenings. More than 150 cardinals attended the . third day of the preliminary meetings to sketch a profile for the next . pope following the shock abdication of Pope Benedict last month. The . preliminary meetings are taking place as the crisis involving sexual . abuse of children by priests and inappropriate behaviour among adult . clerics continues to haunt the Church and has rarely been out of the . headlines. Under Church law . the cardinals have until March 20 to start a conclave to choose a new . pope to lead the 1.2billion-member Church. Emotional: Thousands of people gathered to hear the Pope's final address last Thursday . Farewell: The former Pontiff left the Vatican in a helicopter after making his last speech as Pope last week . Sistine Chapel closes: Master of Liturgical . Celebrations Archbishop Piero Marini closes the door of the Sistine . Chapel . While many observers had expected the conclave to begin as early as this Sunday or Monday, there have been increasing indications that the cardinals want more time to ponder who among them might be best to lead a Church beset by crises. Workmen have begun preparing the Sistine Chapel, building a new, suspended floor to protect the centuries-old tiles. Workmen were pictured installing stoves into the chapel where ballots are burned when a vote is undertaken. The stoves are hooked up to chimneys on the roof and white smoke billows out of them when a new pope is chosen. Other preparations were also being made with the pope emeritus's coat of arms being removed from a floral display in front of the Vatican Governor's Palace, ready to be replaced with that of the newly elected pope. Nonetheless, the Vatican spokesman said it was important that no one felt 'pressured' into going into the conclave before they were ready and that more time would be needed for 'reflection'. One cardinal leaving the meeting said there had been no formal discussion on Wednesday of the so-called 'Vatileaks' scandal, which led to the arrest of Paolo Gabriele, the pope's butler, further besmirching the Church's reputation. Gabriele was convicted of stealing personal papal documents and leaking them to the media. The documents alleged corruption and infighting over the running of its bank. A trio of elderly cardinals prepared a report on the scandal for Benedict, who later pardoned Gabriele, and a number of cardinals attending the preliminary meetings said they wanted to be briefed on the report. Before: An aerial shot of the floral decorations in front of the Vatican Governors Palace pictured on Tuesday complete with Benedict XVI's coat of arms . After: The same floral decoration is pictured today, minus the Pope Emeritus's coat of arms, ready for it to be replaced with that of the new Pope .

Before . leaving, Benedict XVI said goodbye to the monsignors, nuns, Vatican . staff and Swiss Guards who make up the papal household. The 85-year-old’s Italian air force helicopter circled Rome, passing over the Colosseum to give him a last view of the city.

"Exile: There is growing evidence that several cardinals do not want Benedict XVI to live in an apartment block inside the walls of the Vatican . The Pope is under pressure to go into exile from Rome after he retires so that he does not interfere with the work of his successor, senior Roman Catholic sources indicated yesterday. There is growing evidence that several cardinals are anxious that Benedict XVI should not carry through his plan to live in an apartment block inside the walls of the Vatican. They fear the close presence of a retired Pope will create difficulties for the new man who will take over the Papacy this spring. The suggestion that Benedict should be effectively evicted from his planned retreat and dismissed from Rome came just two days after the Pope’s sudden announcement of his resignation threw the church’s leadership into turmoil. The Vatican has been gripped with rumours of faction fighting while potential candidates for the succession have been jostling for position for when 117 cardinals meet to elect a successor next month. There has been confusion over the future status of Benedict XVI, with conflicting statements on what name he will take after retirement and hints from his brother that he will not go into silent retreat but may make himself available to advise the newly-appointed Pope. According to reports, influential figures have indicated to Benedict that it may be unwise to live in an apartment block within the Vatican walls. The four-storey block, built in 1992, has been used to accommodate orders of nuns, but is currently being refurbished as a retirement home for the Pope and a small entourage of assistants and servants. However if Benedict moves in after his retirement takes effect on 28 February he may find his presence unpopular and sentiment among the cardinals leaning in favour of what could amount to an eviction. According to the influential Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, those who believe Benedict should think again include Archbishop Rino Fisichella. Fisichella was appointed by Benedict in 2010 to head his newly-created Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation, which is charged with reinforcing the faith in old Catholic countries. According to the paper, the Archbishop thinks that 85-year-old Benedict should find somewhere outside the Vatican to live. The Vatican has been gripped with rumours of faction fighting while potential candidates for the succession have been jostling for position . It said: ‘The continuing presence of both the old and the new Pope raises such embarrassment for the Vatican that those like Archbishop Rino Fisichella do not rule out that the Pope’s final home will eventually be found outside the hallowed halls.’ The pressure on Benedict to go into exile was also reported in the respected American journal National Catholic Reporter, by its widely-read Vatican commentator, John Allen. ‘There are already hints of a more critical tone,’ he said. ‘On background, one Vatican prelate said today that some cardinals are concerned about Benedict’s decision to live on Vatican grounds after his retirement, fearing it might cast a shadow over the new Pope. ‘Perhaps it would be better, he said, for Benedict to find a monastery in Germany to call home.’ Since the resignation announcement on Monday there has been deepening concern that Benedict’s presence will mean the church has, in effect, one too many Popes. No Pope has resigned in nearly 600 years. The last one to do so willingly, Celestine V, who resigned in 1294, was flung into prison by the next, Boniface VIII, in order to prevent any possible rivalry. The last Pope to resign willingly was Celestine V, who resigned in 1294, and was flung into prison . Celestine – Benedict visited his tomb and praised his actions in 2009 – died in his cell two years after abandoning the Papacy. Among difficulties that have surfaced is the problem of what to call Benedict. Different . church authorities have made conflicting statements that he will keep . his Papal name and the title ‘your Holiness’, and that he will drop the . name Benedict and return to being Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. A . further embarrassment surfaced when, following a phone conversation . with the Pope, his brother Georg Ratzinger said Benedict would make . himself available to advise his successor if required. Vatican . officials have since repeatedly insisted that Benedict will have . nothing to do with the appointment of his successor or the conduct of . Papal business after he retires. Rumours . in Rome yesterday were also pointing to enmity between two leading . Vatican figures likely to be influential when the conclave, the . gathering of cardinals that will choose the next Pope late in March, . assembles. Cardinal Angelo Sodano, Dean of the College of Cardinals, will organise the conclave. However, . his efforts to sway decisions, it was said, are likely to be frustrated . by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who in 2006 took over from Sodano as . Secretary of State, the Pope’s chief political representative. Sodano is said to be furious that Bertone has neglected the careers of officials he once promoted. However, no cardinal over the age of 80 may take part in the conclave. Since Sodano is 85 and Bertone 78, Bertone will be inside the conclave and in the best position to influence voting.","Fears a close presence of a retired Pope will create difficulties for the new man who takes over this spring .

"A British oil executive assassinated in front of his wife as they left a Brussels restaurant may have been targeted by Eastern European hitmen, it emerged last night. Nicholas Mockford, 60, was shot three times by two men wearing motorbike helmets as he left the Italian restaurant in a suburb of the Belgian capital. His wife of 15 years, Mary, was beaten before the two attackers escaped on a  motorbike. A local man tried to resuscitate Mr Mockford as he lay in his wife’s arms but he died on the way to hospital. Nicholas Mockford, pictured centre, was cradled by his wife as he lay dying after he was shot three times as he walked to his Lexus SUV . Mr Mockford, pictured here inside a boat, was reportedly the head of marketing for interim technologies for ExxonMobil Chemicals, Europe, promoting new types of greener fuel . And one line the police are believed to be investigating is whether the oil executive was connected to the world of industrial espionage. This theory has been looked at especially as ExxonMobil have refused to release details about his work. Details of the killing, which took place at about 10pm on October 14, were until now shrouded in secrecy because police imposed a news blackout. One theory being considered by Belgian police is that Mr Mockford was deliberately targeted because of his work at oil giant ExxonMobil. A source close to the investigation said the ruthless efficiency of the attack bore all the hallmarks of a professional hit by Russian or Eastern European assassins. ‘We are looking into his work dealings to see if he had any enemies or was working on anything sensitive,’ the source said. ‘Officers searched his house straight after his murder while his wife was in hospital to see if there were any clues which may identify a motive for the attack.’ Shocking: Belgian women look on as a street cleaner washes away bloodstains from the spot where the oil worker was shot . Police are also considering the possibility that Mr Mockford was killed in a failed bid to steal his Lexus 4x4 car, which was parked nearby. A witness who saw Mrs Mockford after the attack said: ‘She was clearly shocked. She said the men were demanding money and the car.’ However, the ferocity of the attack and the fact that Mr Mockford received a ‘coup de grace’ shot to the upper body as he was bleeding on the floor have prompted detectives to consider other options. Four bullet casings were later found in the road. One local, who asked not to be identified, said he heard a ‘Tac, tac’ noise and went out to investigate. He said: ‘I saw a woman lying on the pavement across the street. She was shouting, “Help, help!”. There was also a man lying next to a car.’ The witness initially thought the couple had been victims of a hit-and-run because he spotted a white van speeding away from them. The family home of Nicholas Mockford, who witnesses claim was slain when he walked out of a restaurant . Gunned down: Nicholas Mockford, in the blue coat, was a British ExxonMobil chief who was shot dead after he left the Da Marcello restaurant in Brussels on October 14. He is pictured with the successful ExxonMobil sailing team following a race last year . He added: ‘I tried to revive the man twice, but then he stopped breathing. I resuscitated him and he came to. Then he became unconscious again and at that moment the ambulance arrived. As the paramedics cut open the man’s clothing I saw he had a bullet in his chest and a bullet in his shoulder. There was also blood on his head.’ Mr Mockford was a department head promoting greener fuels for ExxonMobil, for whom he had worked for almost 40 years. A neighbour claimed Mr Mockford and his Belgian wife had sold their large family home in Grimbergen, in the city’s northern suburbs, two days before the murder and were planning to retire to Thailand. Mr Mockford had three adult children from a previous marriage, all of whom live in Britain. A keen sailor and golfer, he was brought up in Leicestershire and had last lived in this country in Chichester, but had spent several years abroad, mostly in Singapore and Belgium. When his link to a global oil company . emerged, police confirmed that a targeted attack on a specific . individual was one obvious line of inquiry. Scene: Mr Mockford was comforted by his wife Mary outside the restaurant. She was beaten and left covered in blood . Mr Mockford was walking to his Lexus SUV (not pictured) when he was gunned down in front of his Belgian-born wife . But . a spokeswoman for ExxonMobil said that, although the death was a shock, . there was nothing to suggest a link with the company. She . said: 'Mr Mockford was a department manager at our office close to . Brussels, but we have no indication that the incident was work-related.' A dossier has been compiled in the . days since the execution which is understood to examine several theories . - from a botched car theft to assassination by . eco-terrorists angered at ExxonMobil's involvement in Nigeria and . Afghanistan. Organised crime linked to the oil industry in Russia has also not been ruled out. ExxonMobil, parent company of Esso and Mobil, is a favourite villain of green activists around the world. In June this year US investigative . journalist Steve Coll published a mammoth 750 page book called 'Private . Empire' about the company which showed that if it were a country, it . would rank among the top 30 richest in the world. Belgian websites are awash with conspiracy theories. 'A topman for an oil company ... if . you know that oil is the main cause of war in the Middle East (and there . so many daily deaths), then a leading man of such company is anything . but innocent,"" said a blogger on the HLN.be news website. The headquarters of ExxonMobil in Brussels, where the successful executive worked before he was attacked . Another contributor to the same site . wrote: 'Carjackers don't execute someone with shots to the head, fail to . steal the car and leave a witness alive. This has to do with the environment.' Belgium police denied they had put a . media blackout on the crime because it had been reported in three local . Dutch language newspapers in the days afterwards. But it is understood that an official . silence on possible theories was imposed as lawmen contacted Interpol . to try to get a possible handle on the two assassins, one of whom . clutched a motorbike helmet as he fled. A Belgian police source said; 'It . could have been a carjacking gone wrong. They panicked and he died. But . this is not the only avenue we are pursuing.' The Belgian prosecutor’s office said . last night a ‘judicial instruction’ had been ordered by the . investigating judge, Martine Quintin, meaning ‘no explanation’ and . details about the killing could be released. Mr Mockford worked for oil company ExxonMobil, an enemy of many green activists, whose headquarters are based in Irving, Texas . A spokesman said: ‘This is usual in such a serious murder investigation.’ A Foreign Office spokeswoman said last . night: ‘We can confirm the death of a British national on October 14 in . Brussels and we are providing consular assistance.’ It . is understood Mr Mockford was the head of marketing for interim . technologies for ExxonMobil Chemicals, Europe, promoting new types of . greener fuel. He had worked for the company since the 1970s and had been married to his second wife, who is Belgian, for 15 years. Belgium has a higher homicide rate than the UK, according to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In . statistics from the year 2009, it shows that Belgium has 1.7 homicides . per 100,000 people, compared to 1.2 in the United Kingdom. However, Belgium reported186 homicides, compared to the UK's 722. Map showing Brussels airport, ExxonMobil HQ and the Needer-Over-Heembeek district of Brussels. The executive was shot three . times after leaving the Da Marcello . restaurant in Rue de Beyseghem at around 10pm . ExxonMobil has become the target of many hate campaigns. Some environmental organisations have . criticised the oil company for their approach to the environment, their . work and their past handling of oil spills. The Exxon Valdez oil spill happened . in Prince William Sound, Alaska, on March 24, 1989, when an oil tanker . struck a reef and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels of crude oil. The company were criticised for their 'slow response to the disaster'. The mayor of Valdez, John Devens, is . reported to have said his community felt betrayed by Exxon's inadequate . response to the crisis, Wikipedia said. More than 11,000 Alaska residents, . along with some Exxon employees, worked throughout the region to try to . restore the environment. After a trial, a jury ordered Exxon . to pay $5 billion in punitive damages, though an appeals court reduced . that amount by half. Exxon appealed further, and on June 25, 2008, the . United States Supreme Court lowered the amount to $500 million, The . Seattle Times reported. The July 2011 Yellowstone River oil . spill came from an ExxonMobil pipeline running from Silver Tip to . Billings, Montana, which ruptured about 10 miles west of Billings. The devastating spill leaked an . estimated 750 to 1,000 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River for . about 30 minutes before it was shut down, according to Wikipedia. It is accused of drilling in terrains leased to them by dictatorships, such as those in Chad and Equatorial Guinea.

"A 13-year-old girl has died after falling from a chairlift and plunging 20ft to the ground on a school skiing trip in the Alps. Poonam Bhattal hit her head on a cement pylon as she fell shortly after getting on the lift in the Italian resort of Claviere yesterday morning. It is thought the teenager may have had trouble getting on the lift, or slipped off before the protective bar was lowered. Accident: The schoolgirl came off the ski-lift in the Italian resort of Claviere, which is in the Alps . The schoolgirl from the Guru Nanak . Sikh Academy in Hayes, Middlesex, survived the fall and was airlifted . off the mountain, but died on the way to a hospital in the nearby city . of Susa, Italian officials said. Poonam was on a week-long excursion . with 30 other pupils and was due to return to her home in Langley, . Slough, tomorrow. Her parents are now understood to be on their way to . Italy. A spokesman from Guru Nanak Sikh Academy confirmed the death and paid tribute to the student. ‘The leader of this trip and everyone . associated with it is devastated by the death of an absolutely lovely . student,’ the spokesman said. ‘The vice principal leading the trip . has vast experience, having led 28 of such trips throughout his teaching . career. He is obsessive about safety and security on these trips and is . accompanied by two assistant head teachers and a massively experienced . team of eight staff.’ A British consular official is en route from Milan to offer support and ‘try to ascertain what happened’. A spokesman for Turin police added: . ‘We don’t know yet if she didn’t get on properly or if she fell because . the barrier wasn’t down. She was taken to hospital but died on the way, . presumably from a cardiac arrest. ‘Further investigations are in progress.’ The 13-year-old had been on a school trip with Guru Nanak Sikh Academy when she fell to her death . The trip was organised by holiday . company Skibound. A spokesman said: ‘Skibound regrets to confirm that a . pupil from Guru Nanak Sikh Academy in Hayes, Middlesex, has been . involved in a fatal incident in the ski resort of Claviere. ‘The thoughts and condolences of all at Skibound are with the family, school and friends.’ Claviere is a small resort at an . elevation of around 5,800ft on the border with France which is popular . with families and beginners. It is 70 miles from Turin. Poonam is the second British teenager . to die in the Alps in less than a month. Lucy Sallis, 19, drowned in . the French resort of Alpe d’Huez three weeks ago. This week, nine-year-old Brook Hill . was injured at Les Monts d’Olmes resort in the Pyrenees after a . 27-year-old skier mowed him down. He fell into a coma and has had a section of his skull removed to relieve pressure on his brain.","Schoolgirl, 13, from Kent, hit her head as she fell from ski lift .

"Pippa chose designs by Roksanda Ilincic and Stella McCartney . Wore three different outfits during appearance at Fulham book store . Her big sister has had more than a year to become one of the world’s fashion icons. So when it came to her big day in the spotlight, perhaps Pippa Middleton thought she had some catching up to do. The 29-year-old wore no fewer than four outfits for her book launch in London yesterday, altogether costing at least £2,959 – more than some first-time authors might hope for as an advance. Pippa Middleton launched her new creative entertaining book 'Celebrate' at an afternoon children's Halloween party in London . With echoes of her big sister Kate Pippa joined in with the children's games at the launch party . But then, Miss Middleton – whose advance was said to be an astonishing £400,000 –  isn’t any first-time author.

Earlier . she had worn another different outfit for the book signing at Foyles, . choosing a futuristic long-sleeved dress featuring an abstract panel by Paper London which is on sale on their website for £395. Earlier this afternoon Pippa tried to sneak in to the book store via the back entrance, but her famous curves gave the game away and photographers snapped her disappearing in to Daunt books in the elegant knee-length shift, which she teamed with patent stiletto shoes and a power blow-dry to rival sister Kate's glossy mane. After posing for photographers with her book Pippa changed in to a little black dress featuring a sparkling green pattern to play with the children who were attending her Halloween party. And then there was another quick change as she pulled on a sleeveless tweed dress from British designer Stella McCartney featuring slimming optical illusion panels on the back, which she accessorised with a Tabitha London clutch bag and bespoke Emmy court shoes. Pippa chose a sparkling Markus Lupfer LBD as her second outfit of the afternoon and then changed in to a sleeveless tweed Stella McCatrney dress for the evening . Pippa's Stella McCartney dress featured on-trend peplum detail and optical illusion panels at the back . Earlier in the day Pippa wore another different outfit, choosing a futuristic long-sleeved dress by Paper London featuring an abstract panel for a book signing at Foyles who tweeted this picture of the author .

David Loftus, the photographer who . took the pictures for the book said: 'She's the sweetest kindest girl . and -- you know she is very shy. 'This has all come about you know . because of the wedding, because of her sister, but it is essentially . what she was doing before . 'She's doing her best in very . difficult surroundings really. She's expecting to be criticized, she . doesn't deserve it, she works incredibly hard. 'She deserves the success. So I hope people read it and look at it and see it for what it is.'

Writing . in the book she acknowledges the effect her sister the Duchess of . Cambridge’s fame will have on sales, saying: ‘I know many of you will . pick up the book out of nothing more than curiosity. ‘[But] . I can assure you that it feels even stranger to me than it probably . does to you to have seen so much written about me when I have done so . little to paint a picture of myself.

Tips from party queen Pippa include . how to throwing the perfecting Highland tea and rustling up a quick . 'venison and beetroot stew'. One of the book's more eye-catching . chapters is dedicated to breakfast which, Pippa says helpfully, can be . 'anything from a simple pot of tea with a few digestive biscuits' to a . fully laden tray. For a special breakfast she advises . decanting milk into a jug rather than serving it in a carton. She also . suggesting serving a boiled with soldiers liberally spread with smoked . mackerel or trout pate and includes recipes for each . There is also a segment dedicated on . how to make a cup of tea or roast a chicken as well as rustle up some . remarkably pretty home-made Christmas decorations or some haggis and . filo parcels for Burns Night.

"The French magazine at the centre of the topless pictures scandal has ‘more intimate’ photographs of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, its editor boasted last night. Laurence Pieau remained defiantly unapologetic over her decision to publish the first set of photos in the French version of Closer magazine. She said the widespread outrage over the pictures was ‘disproportionate’ and tried to insist the shots were ‘not degrading’. Scroll down for video . Women pulling the strings: Editor Laurence Pieau (left) remains unapologetic for publishing the naked photos of the Duchess of Cambridge and claims there may be more. Meanwhile, the role of owner Marina Berlusconi (right) remains unclear . Grotesque: The magazine put three naked photos of the Duchess of Cambridge on the front cover . With a smile on her face she even said Prince Harry would feel ‘less alone’ as she compared the photos of a topless Kate to those taken of him cavorting naked in his Las Vegas hotel room  last month. And in comments which will further distress the Duchess, she said: ‘I won’t hide the fact that there are more intimate pictures that exist.’ The French edition of Closer is owned by Italian media group Mondadori,  the chairman of which is Marina Berlusconi, daughter of Italy’s former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Last night it remained unclear what influence, if any, Miss Berlusconi had on the decision to publish the graphic photographs. What is certain is that both women will face an avalanche of criticism for what William and Kate called a ‘grotesque and totally unjustifiable’ invasion of privacy. Strained: The Royal couple looked strained as they left the British High Commission while on a visit shortly after the photos were published. Both Kate and William are said to be furious about the publication of the pictures . Instead of showing remorse at the pain . felt by the royal couple, Ms Pieau gave numerous interviews to TV . networks in a shameless attempt to justify her decision and sell more . copies of her magazine. She . also posted a series of titillating messages on Twitter saying readers . could expect the ‘hot Provence version of the crown jewels’. She added that readers would get the chance to ‘discover very sensual shots of Kate and her husband  Prince William’. ‘What we saw in the pictures was a young couple who are just married, who are in love, who are beautiful,’ the editor said. ‘She is the princess of the 21st century. ‘They are a young couple in love.  She is a young woman who’s topless, just like the ones who can be seen on all of the beaches of France and the world. These are pictures that  are full of joy. The pictures are  not degrading.’ Preview: The topless pictures were muzzed out on the French version of Closer magazine's website billed as a 'World Exclusive . In an attempt to justify the intrusion of privacy Ms Pieau said the Duke and Duchess were ‘on a terrace of a chateau in the south of France which is not far from a road on which cars pass without any problems’. ‘They are visible from the street,’ she added. ‘It’s a nice series which we have a worldwide exclusive on at the moment. These are pictures that will go around the world. ‘And honestly I don’t know of a single celebrity magazine in the world that would not have published these if they had them. They wouldn’t have hesitated two seconds before running. One shouldn’t be hypocritical.’ The editor tried to downplay the furore by claiming that topless pictures of a princess were ‘not  really new’. Chateau D'Autet near Veins, Provence, Southern France, where the young royal couple were relaxing . Invasion of privacy: The Lay by (bottom left) on the opposing valley slope is where is where it is believed the pictures were shot with a long zoom camera . In reality, the couple’s balcony was about 1,000 yards from the road and the couple would not have been  visible without the most sophisticated telescopic lenses. The French version of Closer magazine was launched in June 2005 as a sister title to the British edition, which is published by Bauer Media. It was sold in August 2006 to Mondadori France, a subsidiary of the Italian company, and now sells around 400,000 copies a week. French Closer insisted there had been no breach of safety or security in obtaining the photos. One source at the magazine said: ‘If two public figures chose to strip off in full view of a public road then they can expect to be pictured, and they were.’ Soldiering on: The young Royals had been told about the magazine's plans to publish the pictures just before their first ever visit to a mosque earlier in the day . Last night a spokesman for Mondadori declined to comment. Bauer Media said it had ‘complained in the strongest terms’ to Mondadori about the pictures. Chief executive Paul Keenan said his company deplored the publication of the ‘intrusive and offensive pictures’. He said: ‘Bauer Media and Closer UK regards publication of these photographs as a gross intrusion of their Royal Highnesses’ privacy. ‘We have absolutely no control  over the editorial decisions of  Closer France.’ VIDEO: Watch the interview here...","Remains unclear if Marina Berlusconi influenced decision to publish photos .

"A British oil executive shot dead outside a restaurant was the victim of a 'nervous criminal who experienced a violent rage', detectives believe. Nicolas Mockford, 59, died instantly after being shot four times in Brussels. Police are working on the ehteory that he was the victim of a failed robbery rather than being targeted by hitmen. Mr Mockford's wife Mary was beaten badly around the face as she tried to stop two men taking her handbag and the keys to the couple's £40,000 Lexus 4x4 car. Nicholas Mockford, pictured centre, was cradled by his wife as he lay dying after he was shot three times as he walked to his Lexus SUV . Mr Mockford, pictured here inside a boat, was reportedly the head of marketing for interim technologies for ExxonMobil Chemicals, Europe, promoting new types of greener fuel . A family member said that Mr Mockford, a . long-serving department head at ExxonMobil, had been assassinated, but . could not explain why he was a target. The relation told the Daily Telegraph: 'We are all confused about what has happened. Nick was a genuinely lovely, clean-cut, mild-mannered family man.' He added: 'He was shot so calmly and so quickly, it smacks horribly of a professional hit, but we can't fathom why. He isn't the type to cave in to blackmail and it just doesn't compute.' Details of the killing, which took place in the Belgian capital at about 10pm on October 14, were until now shrouded in secrecy because . police imposed a news blackout. The theory he was the victim of a professional hit, possibly by Eastern European gunmen, is being examined because ExxonMobil have refused to release details about his work in 'intermediate technologies'. Police have not ruled out a robbery that went wrong and that Mr Mockford died trying to protect his wife from a violent mugging. But relatives believe he may have been executed because neither his silver Lexus 4x4 nor his wife Mary's handbag were taken. Shocking: Belgian women look on as a street cleaner washes away bloodstains from the spot where the oil worker was shot . A source close to the investigation . said: ‘We are looking into his work dealings to see if he had any enemies or was working on anything sensitive. ‘Officers . searched his house straight after his murder while his wife was in . hospital to see if there were any clues which may identify a motive for . the attack.’ Detectives believe Mr Mockford was killed by a 'nervous criminal' who experienced a 'violent rage' before firing four bullets in quick succession. A senior investigator said: 'A nervous criminal is likely to have got into a violent rage as the couple effectively fought back,' quoting expert police profilers. 'Four bullets entered the victim's body in quick succession. The victim's wife was also beaten severely round the face - also suggesting sudden and severe anger.' The profilers have spent almost two weeks studying the circumstances of the murder. A witness who saw Mrs Mockford after . the attack said: ‘She was clearly shocked. She said the men were . demanding money and the car.’ However, the ferocity of the attack and the fact that Mr Mockford received a ‘coup de grace’ shot to the upper body as he was bleeding on the floor have prompted detectives to consider other options. The family home of Nicholas Mockford, who witnesses claim was slain when he walked out of a restaurant . Gunned down: Nicholas Mockford, in the blue coat, was a British ExxonMobil chief who was shot dead after he left the Da Marcello restaurant in Brussels on October 14. He is pictured with the successful ExxonMobil sailing team following a race last year . There were claims on Belgian websites . that he had been killed by eco-terrorists angered by ExxonMobil's . involvement in Nigeria, Chad and Indonesia. One . contributor wrote: 'Carjackers don't execute someone with shots to the . head, fail to steal the car and leave a witness alive. This has to do with the environment.' The killers fled the scene near the Da Marcello restaurant in Rue de Beyseghem on motorbike or scooter. Four bullet casings were later found in the road. One local, who asked not to be identified, said he heard a ‘Tac, tac’ noise and went out to investigate. He said: ‘I saw a woman lying on the pavement across the street. She was shouting, “Help, help!”. The . witness initially thought the couple had been victims of a hit-and-run . because he spotted a white van speeding away from them. He added: ‘I tried to revive the man twice, but then he stopped breathing. I resuscitated him and he came to. Then he became unconscious again and at that moment the ambulance arrived. As the paramedics cut open the man’s clothing I saw he had a bullet in his chest and a bullet in his shoulder. There was also blood on his head.’ Mr Mockford was a department head promoting greener fuels for ExxonMobil, who he joined in 1974 after studying economic at Thames University. A neighbour claimed Mr Mockford and his Belgian wife of 15 years had sold their large family home in Grimbergen, in the city’s northern suburbs, two days before the murder and were planning to retire to Thailand. Scene: Mr Mockford was comforted by his wife Mary outside the restaurant. She was beaten and left covered in blood . Mr Mockford was walking to his Lexus SUV (not pictured) when he was gunned down in front of his Belgian-born wife . Mr Mockford had three adult children . from a previous marriage, all of whom live in Britain. A keen sailor and . golfer, he was brought up in Leicestershire and had last lived in this . country in Chichester, but had spent several years abroad, mostly in . Singapore and Belgium. When his link to a global oil company . emerged, police confirmed that a targeted attack on a specific . individual was one obvious line of inquiry. But . a spokeswoman for ExxonMobil said that, although the death was a shock, . there was nothing to suggest a link with the company. She . said: 'Mr Mockford was a department manager at our office close to . Brussels, but we have no indication that the incident was work-related.' A dossier has been compiled in the . days since the execution which is understood to examine several theories. Organised crime linked to the oil industry in Russia has also not been ruled out. ExxonMobil, parent company of Esso and Mobil, is a favourite villain of green activists around the world. The headquarters of ExxonMobil in Brussels, where the successful executive worked before he was attacked . In June this year US investigative . journalist Steve Coll published a mammoth 750 page book called 'Private . Empire' about the company which showed that if it were a country, it . would rank among the top 30 richest in the world. Belgian websites are awash with conspiracy theories. 'A topman for an oil company ... if . you know that oil is the main cause of war in the Middle East (and there . so many daily deaths), then a leading man of such company is anything . but innocent,"" said a blogger on the HLN.be news website. Belgium police denied they had put a . media blackout on the crime because it had been reported in three local . Dutch language newspapers in the days afterwards. But it is understood that an official . silence on possible theories was imposed as lawmen contacted Interpol . to try to get a possible handle on the two assassins, one of whom . clutched a motorbike helmet as he fled. A Belgian police source said; 'It . could have been a carjacking gone wrong. They panicked and he died. But . this is not the only avenue we are pursuing.' The Belgian prosecutor’s office said . last night a ‘judicial instruction’ had been ordered by the . investigating judge, Martine Quintin, meaning ‘no explanation’ and . details about the killing could be released. Mr Mockford worked for oil company ExxonMobil, an enemy of many green activists, whose headquarters are based in Irving, Texas . A spokesman said: ‘This is usual in such a serious murder investigation.’ A Foreign Office spokeswoman said last . night: ‘We can confirm the death of a British national on October 14 in . Brussels and we are providing consular assistance.’ Belgium has a higher homicide rate than the UK, according to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. In . statistics from the year 2009, it shows that Belgium has 1.7 homicides . per 100,000 people, compared to 1.2 in the United Kingdom. However, Belgium reported186 homicides, compared to the UK's 722. Map showing Brussels airport, ExxonMobil HQ and the Needer-Over-Heembeek district of Brussels. The executive was shot three . times after leaving the Da Marcello . restaurant in Rue de Beyseghem at around 10pm . ExxonMobil has become the target of many hate campaigns. Some environmental organisations have . criticised the oil company for their approach to the environment, their . work and their past handling of oil spills. The Exxon Valdez oil spill happened . in Prince William Sound, Alaska, on March 24, 1989, when an oil tanker . struck a reef and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels of crude oil. The company were criticised for their 'slow response to the disaster'. The mayor of Valdez, John Devens, is . reported to have said his community felt betrayed by Exxon's inadequate . response to the crisis, Wikipedia said. More than 11,000 Alaska residents, . along with some Exxon employees, worked throughout the region to try to . restore the environment. After a trial, a jury ordered Exxon . to pay $5 billion in punitive damages, though an appeals court reduced . that amount by half. Exxon appealed further, and on June 25, 2008, the . United States Supreme Court lowered the amount to $500 million, The . Seattle Times reported. The July 2011 Yellowstone River oil . spill came from an ExxonMobil pipeline running from Silver Tip to . Billings, Montana, which ruptured about 10 miles west of Billings. The devastating spill leaked an . estimated 750 to 1,000 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River for . about 30 minutes before it was shut down, according to Wikipedia. It is accused of drilling in terrains leased to them by dictatorships, such as those in Chad and Equatorial Guinea.

"The body of millionairess Carole Waugh was found yesterday stashed in the boot of a car hidden in a lock-up. Police said a badly decomposed body found crumpled in the back of a VW Golf was that of the wealthy former oil executive who went missing from her luxury Marylebone flat more than three months ago. A post-mortem examination found that Miss Waugh was killed by a single stab wound. Detectives are trying to trace the owner of the vehicle as it emerged that a mystery man hired the garage after spotting an advertisement on the Gumtree website in May, just days after the 50-year-old went missing. Scroll down for video . Found: Police have discovered the body of missing millionairess Carole Waugh, 50, in London . Police erected a tent outside a garage lock-up in the neighbourhood homeowners have described as 'peaceful and quiet' The body was believed to have been found in this blue VW Golf which was inside the lock-up garage, after police received new information . The gruesome discovery following a . tip-off to police is a devastating blow to Miss Waugh’s family, who have . feared the worst after detectives discovered that hundreds of thousands . of pounds had been siphoned off from her bank accounts by a gang . suspected of kidnapping her. At least three women have tried to use her credit cards and a man posed as her brother to try to sell her £650,000 flat. Police believe Miss Waugh may have led . a secret double life as an escort when she returned to Britain after . working in Dubai for eight years. Yesterday detectives began a massive . search of automatic number-plate recognition cameras to track the car’s . movements since April. Police are patrolling the area as they await the outcome of the postmortem which confirmed the identity of the body to be Carole Waugh . The quiet road has become the scene of a major crime investigation, as police now pursue the possibility that Ms Waugh may have been murdered . A police officer stands outside lock-up garages in New Malden as police search for clues surrounding the discovery of Ms Waugh's body . The garage doors lie open as police investigate the surroundings prior to the identification of the body, to the horror of local residents . The owner of the lock-up, which is off . a quiet residential street in New Malden, Surrey, said a man contacted . him after seeing the advert which read: ‘A very secure lock-up garage. Good access and off road. Ideal for garaging car, storage, vintage car . etc. Electricity available.’ Nick Kerven, the director of a . Reigate-based building company, said he agreed to hire the garage for . £135 a month. The man provided a home address in Central London and . arranged to pay by standing order, but he did not specify how long he . wanted it for. Mr Kerven said that because the garage . was open, there had been no need to send the new tenant keys, and that . the man said he would use his own padlock. He added: ‘I had never met . the guy. We put out an advert on Gumtree and in May, around the time . this lady went missing, he called me. ‘He rang me after seeing the advert . and I rented him the garage. He paid money directly into my bank account . but we never met face to face. ‘It’s shocking. My father built these . garages himself and we’ve been renting them out for 50 years and we’ve . never had anything like this before.’ Carole Waugh with her brother Chris, who admitted he was 'embarrassed' about how little he knew about her . Those who worked with Miss Waugh during the eight years she spent in the Libya speak of 'a complex character' who told extraordinary stories about her life in England . Police have been trying to piece . together the life of a ‘secretive’ and private woman who was known to . have met men through a variety of internet dating sites. Those who worked with Miss Waugh . during the eight years she spent in Libya as a secretary for an oil . company described her as ‘a fantasist with a reputation for . exaggeration’. Despite never marrying, she wore a . diamond engagement ring and gold wedding band and boasted that her . wealthy Egyptian husband had died of a heart attack and left her a . fortune. She told other secretaries that she . had rubbed shoulders with film stars at parties in London and she . claimed to be a property developer. Miss Waugh said she owned a flat . behind Harrods and had a top-of-the-range Harley Davidson motorbike, . despite her modest £25,000 salary. Mystery: Since disappearing, thousands of pounds worth of illegal transactions have been made in her name . Despite never being married, she wore a huge diamond solitaire engagement ring and gold wedding band . Police have arrested ten people during the investigation, including arresting one man on suspicion of murder . Known as a party girl, Miss Waugh . spent her time in Libya at the Janzour Tourist Village, a hotel and . villa complex overlooking the Mediterranean on the outskirts of Tripoli, . with one of the sons of Colonel Gaddafi, Saif, among her neighbours. But little is known about her life after she moved back to London in . 2008. Her brother Chris, a 53-year-old . Barclays bank manager, has described her as ‘secretive’, adding: ‘I’m . embarrassed about how little I knew.’ Her mother Margaret, 78, said after her disappearance: ‘I think the world of her, but she’s a girl you couldn’t talk to. ‘She never gave a good answer, if you know what I mean. ‘She kept everything to herself. She spoke to me two or three times a week, then all of a sudden, nothing.’ This yellow gold bracelet in the picture is identical to that worn by Carole Waugh. It was previously missing but has now been recovered . The bracelet and its golden twin have been found but a ring and a yellow golden necklace in the same series by Cartier is still missing . The alarm was raised on May 7 after Miss Waugh failed to answer calls from her family after she was last seen on April 16. Last night detectives were quizzing a . 47-year-old man detained when he flew into Luton Airport on Tuesday . night and later arrested on suspicion of her murder, kidnap and . conspiracy to defraud. Ten people – six men and four women – have been arrested in connection with Ms Waugh’s disappearance and fraud.

"A sex offender who posed as a doctor to prey on women was a guest of the Queen on the Royal Barge. Harbinder Singh Rana, 52, was jailed in the 1980s for a series of attacks on women, who believed he was a doctor, in which he performed internal examinations and administered injections. Rana served four years for his crimes, but has since reinvented himself as a pillar of the community. Raising questions: Harbinder Singh Rana on board the Spirit of Chartwell during the Queens Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the River Thameswith members of the Royal family . Rana spent the pageant in close proximity to the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and the Duke of Cambridge . And in an astonishing error of judgment the Sikh charity director, who now lives in Walsall in the West Midlands, was allowed to mingle with VIPs on the Royal Barge during Sunday’s River Pageant. During the afternoon sail, Rana came into close contact with every senior royal including Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The convicted sex attacker was at times during the 1,000 boat extravaganza just feet from the Queen herself. The former management consultant was invited to join the exclusive celebrations by Prince Charles in his capacity as community leader. He is understood to have met the prince through his charity work for the Anglo-Sikh heritage trail, a group that promotes Sikh culture in Britain. But palace sources last night said the prince was completely unaware of the charity director’s shameful past-and would never have invited him had he known. Approached yesterday Rana said that he did not know if he had been vetted and had not been asked about his sex crimes before the event. Harbinder Singh Rana, director of Maharaja Dalip .

The Prince of Wales unveiling a statue dedicated to the last Indian Maharajah, Duleep Singh on Butten Island in Thetford, in 1999 . He told the Mirror: ‘I was given the invitation and I attended. 'The fact that the Prince of Wales invited me clearly shows what I have done for the community since then.’ He added: ‘I have a relationship with some of Charles’s staff, not him – although I have met him at events, yes. ‘I have made it clear I wasn’t representing the Sikh community, I was there because I was very happy to be invited.’ He said that, although the Queen was at times just ‘a few feet' from him, he never spoke to her or any senior member of the Royal Family while on the boat. The revealation will raise questions about why apparently no checks were carried out on Mr Rana's background before he was allowed to be photographed within inches of senior royals . The convicted sex attacker was at times during the 1,000 boat extravaganza just feet from the Queen . The massive error brings into sharp focus the vetting procedures in place to protect the Royal Family. Questions . will now be raised about why apparently no checks were carried out on . his background before he was allowed to be photographed within inches of . senior royals. And an investigation into how such an unsuitable guest sailed through the vetting process will likely soon be under way. A . spokesman for Clarence House confirmed that the prince had not known . about Rana’s convictions. She said: ‘Harbinder Singh was asked to take . part in the pageant as he is a leading member of the Sikh community and . someone who has done a lot of charitable work. ‘Guests . of the Pageant including representatives from all major faith . communities, spread across a number of key vessels – as with the Royal . Family, who were present on a number of vessels.’ Last night the Metropolitan Police confirmed that those travelling on the royal barge would have been security vetted. But it is thought security chiefs did not deem him a threat to the Royals. A Met spokesman said: ‘The purpose of a security check is to assess the threat to members of the Royal Family and other protected persons.’ At his trial Rana protested his innocence and yesterday continued to say it was a case of ‘mistaken identity’. Speaking of his conviction he told the Mirror: ‘It was very circumstantial It is an area I have switched off from my life and got on with it.’ Rana’s previous convictions have caused controversy in the past. In 2002, the Sikh Secretariat, a campaigning group, said it was ‘appalled’ at Rana’s role as a Government adviser. Mr Rana represented Sikhs on the Inner Cities Religious Council, a group that advised the Government on local issues. Speaking about his place in the body, the Sikh Secretariat said: ‘We are aware that Government officials and junior ministers have known about the situation, but have taken no action. Out of a choice of 700,000 Sikhs we cannot understand why someone like this was elected to represent our views.’ Mr Rana defended his place on the body, saying: ‘I have never tried to hide my convictions, even though the evidence presented was contentious. Are they saying rehabilitation and forgiveness should not exist? What I should be judged on is the work I’ve done in the Sikh community since that date.’ Mr Singh Rana was found guilty of five counts of indecent assault, 11 counts of assault causing actual bodily harm and one count of attempted assault in August 1986.","Harbinder Singh Rana said he did not even know if he had been vetted .

"A teenage girl who plunged from a tower block while trying to avoid arrest during a morning raid had been wanted by police since last summer. Convicted robber Shanise Paris-Goff, 18, fell from a bedroom window ledge at the 17th storey high-rise flat, while officers stormed the flat. Scotland Yard had appealed in July, last year, for help to find her after she failed to register with her probation officer following her early release from a young offenders' institution in April, last year. Shanise Paris-Goff plunged to her death from the 17th floor of a block of flats in Woolwich on Monday . She had served nearly two years of a three-year sentence for a series of muggings, attempted robbery and assault. They finally tracked her down to her boyfriend's high-rise flat and is thought to have panicked on seeing the officers. The teenager, who dubbed herself . 'Reckless Shen', scrambled on to a bedroom window ledge at the flat in . Woolwich, South East London where she plunged to her death. On her Facebook page while on the . loose, the tearaway taunted them, saying 'Catch me if you can' and '**** . the feds and **** the law'. Miss Paris-Goff, who was also known as Sherise Steabler, was said to have been released from prison in April last year under licence . Death: The 17th-storey window from which Shanise plunged to her death . She was sentenced at Croydon Crown Court in May 2009 and released on April 20 last year on licence and subject to a curfew. The teenager, from St Paul's Cray, . near Orpington, Kent, who also went by the name Shenice and Sherise . Steabler, appears to have spent her days posting updates on Facebook . about smoking cannabis and moaning about her curfew. Eight days after her release, she wrote: 'Probation is a lonnnnnnng tome [time]! I'm a criminal get me outta here!' Then on May 26, she said: '**** dis . curfew **** its depresin ma life.' But after breaching the terms of her . release by not registering with the Probation Service or turning up to . any meetings, her licence was revoked three months later. After going into hiding, she taunted police on June 17 last year, saying: 'Katch me if yuh kann!' Friends urged her to change her ways . at the beginning of this year, with one asking: 'Where is your life . going? Seriously. Think about it.' But Shanise retorted: 'I hear yuh buh I'm only gonna live once so ima do it my way!!' In an bizarre rant posted on New . Year's Eve, she had written: '**** the new year! Were all gonna die! Hope yuh lot r ready kah I am!' Meticulous: Forensic officers scour the grounds for evidence after Shanise's death . Shanise Paris-Goff plunged to her death from the 17th floor of a block of flats in Woolwich yesterday . On her homepage, she described . herself as a beautiful, outgoing girl with a loud mouth, writing: 'I'm . Only Gonna Live Once So I Do **** My Way!! 'I've Made A lot Of Mistakes In The . Short Period Of Time I've Lived Buh I Say **** It S*** Happens Life Goes . Orn!' She added: 'I'm One Ina Million!!' Last night her parents were said to be too upset to speak about her death but friends and family paid tribute on Facebook. Her cousin, Krystle Goff wrote: 'Ur at peace now. Make sure yuh party hard up ther. I love you xxx.' An inquiry into her death will be held . by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Met Force's . Directorate of Professional Standards. Neighbours told how they heard a woman scream 'Get off me'. The two plain-clothes officers who went to the one-bedroomed flat will be questioned about her final movements. Shortly after they arrived, police said Shanise retreated to the bedroom alone, half closing the door behind her. Seconds later she fell. Her death was witnessed by children on the estate who screamed in horror. Officers later arrested her boyfriend Mason Okotie, 18, on suspicion of assisting an offender.

"For a company that describes transparency as one of its ‘core values’, it was something of a private party. Google’s annual conference began yesterday amid tight security, with members of the media and public barred unless specifically invited. Civil liberty campaigners warned that Google – which has been accused of invading the privacy of its customers by harvesting details about their online activity – was using its ‘dominance to influence decision-makers behind closed doors’ at the Zeitgeist event. Speakers: Former U.S. president Bill Clinton is due to speak at Google's annual Zeitgeist conference today and singer Annie Lennox gave a talk yesterday . Invited: Celebrities and academics made up the bulk of the guestlist, while Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow and Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark were among the representatives from the media . It comes after the Daily Mail revealed the astonishing scale of contact between the internet giant and the Tories, with meetings held once a month on average since the election. Zeitgeist has previously been a popular forum for such meetings. David Cameron spoke at the conference in 2006 and in 2007 was flown to California to address its US equivalent. Last year, Chancellor George Osborne spoke and Universities Minister David Willetts will speak at a Google event after the conference this year. Zeitgeist, now in its seventh year, is taking place at the five-star Grove hotel in Hertfordshire. The 300-acre grounds and the hotel’s isolated rural setting make it the ideal location for the secretive two-day event. All information about the conference is distributed via a password-encrypted program, which guests must download on to their smartphone. Taking the stage: This year's conference features a long list of speakers, including model Lily Cole and Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia . The theme of this year’s conference is ‘Beyond’ and features talks from the ‘great minds of our time’ on issues from technology and politics to the arts. Yesterday, guests including Gwyneth Paltrow were believed to be listening to a debate on the euro crisis led by former Greek prime minister George Papandreou and Sir Martin Sorrell, head of advertising firm WPP. In the final speech of the day, singer Annie Lennox highlighted the exclusive nature of the event, declaring she had just ‘addressed a room of 400 of Europe’s business leaders and biggest thinkers’. Guests were forced to negotiate layers of security to gain entrance, as guards patrolled the grounds. Anyone not wearing a large Google name pass was quickly stopped and questioned. Security is expected to be heightened even further today when former US president Bill Clinton gives the closing speech. But the real action takes place on the sidelines, as the great and the good take the opportunity to network away from scrutiny. One guest, who works in advertising, confided: ‘The talks are a bit of a distraction for me. Like everyone else I’m here to network.’ This year’s conference features a long list of speakers, including model Lily Cole and Jimmy Wales, founder of online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Celebrities and academics made up the bulk of the guestlist, while Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow, Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark and BBC sports presenter Clare Balding were invited from the media. Transparency? The internet search engine provider says transparency is a 'core value' and that it wishes to 'maximise' the amount of information about it available to customers . Yet access to the wider media and public was blocked. It is a far cry from the values Google espouses on its website, where the internet search engine provider says that transparency is a ‘core value’ and that it wishes to ‘maximise’ the amount of information about it that is available to its customers. Nick Pickles, director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘At a time when Google is under intense scrutiny for disregarding concerns about its privacy policy and the exploitation of user data, it is wholly inappropriate for Google to use their market dominance to influence decision-makers behind closed doors.' Google refused to comment last night. Zeitgeist is followed on Wednesday by a public conference to debate the internet and society called The Big Tent, to which the Daily Mail has been invited and which will feature a talk by Mail columnist Amanda Platell.

"Built to woo the Virgin Queen, architecture experts are now calling it ‘the Shard of its day.’ There is no doubt the views from the top of the 100ft tower, which boasts what were then the biggest glass windows in a secular building in Tudor England, are impressive enough to make you go weak at the knees. Whether they also made Queen Elizabeth I swoon into the arms of her favourite Robert Dudley in the spectacular quarters he created for her exclusive use at Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire remains a mystery as intriguing as the rest of their relationship. Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire has been nicknamed the 'Shard of its day' with its 100ft tower and what would have been the biggest glass windows in Tudor England . But English Heritage will tomorrow open the monarch’s rooms in the tower to the public for the first time following a two-year project to install stairs and platforms allowing access to the chambers at the centre of the affair that set tongues wagging in Elizabethan high society. Yesterday the historic monuments body’s Head Curator Jeremy Ashbee said a door - its arch still visible - from the queen’s outer chamber, where she would meet the great and the good, in the tower connected her rooms directly with Dudley’s living quarters next door, which like much of the rest of the castle were later destroyed during the English Civil War. There was, believes Dr Ashbee, an antechamber between the two sets of rooms where Dudley, the handsome and flamboyant Earl of Leicester, could well have ‘lurked’ until Elizabeth was free of other company before popping in to see her alone. From there it is just a few short steps into the regal boudoir, where no one was normally allowed except the Queen and her ladies in waiting. ‘We do not know whether their relationship was ever physical,’ said Dr Ashbee. ‘But they had known each since childhood, shared passions for riding and dancing, and it was no secret in Court circles that he was a suitor for the queen’s hand in marriage. Indeed, Dudley built the tower expressly to win her hand.’ The quarters within the fortress were built exclusively for the monarch by Robert Dudley, the First Earl of Leicester - and their relationship was a talking point at the time . Head curator at the castle, Jeremy Ashbee, believes there was also an antechamber between the rooms where the Earl could have ‘lurked’ until her majesty was free . A door arch is still visible from where her outer chamber would have been within the tower that connect her room directly with Dudley’s living quarters next door . Their relationship - portrayed by Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes in the 1998 film Elizabeth - was much talked about after Dudley’s first wife Amy broke her neck and died after apparently falling down the stairs at Cumnor Place, Berkshire, in 1560. Debate raged over whether Dudley had got rid of her as an obstacle to his relationship with the monarch. Dudley, who was also the Master of the Horse, overseeing all the queen’s equestrian needs for travel and hunting, was granted Kenilworth Castle by Elizabeth I in 1563. At a cost equivalent to tens of millions of pounds in today’s money, he began building the tower for her there in 1570. Elizabeth stayed at the castle four times during her summer ‘progresses’ away from London. Her last visit in 1575 caused particularly intense speculation about their relationship as she stayed for 19 days from July 9 to 27 - the longest she ever stayed at any courtier’s house. Elizabeth (posed by model) stayed at the castle four times during her summer ‘progresses’ away from London and her last visit in 1575 caused particularly intense speculation about their relationship as she stayed for 19 days from July 9 to 27 - the longest she ever stayed at any courtier’s house . Documentary evidence shows the tower was built right in the middle of the period when Dudley was getting her to come visit and it was referred to as “the Queen’s lodge . Dr Ashbee said: ‘We know from documentary evidence when the tower was built was right in the middle of the period when Dudley was getting her to come there. People referred to it as ‘the Queen’s lodge’. ‘She was 41 and he 42 during the 1575 visit and it has long been thought this was his last throw of the dice to get her to marry him. He even commissioned portraits of the queen and himself specifically for that visit, which might have been intended to hang in the dancing chamber above her bedroom.’ In a letter, Robert Langham, a member of Dudley’s household, described the tower as ‘in day-time on every side so glittering with glass, at night by continual brightness of candle, fire and torchlight, transparent through the lightsome windows, as it were the Egyptian Pharos [an ancient lighthouse] relucent unto all the Alexandrian coast.’ Dr Ashbee said: ‘It is the Shard of its day, architecturally extremely daring in its use of large glass windows and what it looked like from the outside. But Dudley (right) failed to win (left) Queen Elizabeth's hand - his chances having probably not been helped by him fathering an illegitimate son to Lady Sheffield in 1574 . A painting of Kenilworth Castle dated 1620. The Queen's rooms in the tower will be open to the public for the first time tomorrow after a two-year project to install stairs . ‘It would have formed an impressive backdrop to the deer hunts which the queen and Dudley went on daily during her stay, with the sun glinting off the windows and the tower reflected in the lake which was then in the grounds.’ Dudley failed, however, to win the queen’s hand, his chances having probably not been helped by him fathering an illegitimate son by Lady Sheffield in 1574. Elizabeth never returned to Kenilworth and he married Lettice Knollys, Countess of Essex, in 1578. But the queen evidently retained an affection for him and kept a letter he wrote to her shortly before his death in 1588. Its contents were mere pleasantries, but she wrote on the back ‘His last letter’ and kept it in a casket of treasured possessions by her bed until her death in 1603. The tower was previously only viewable looking up from its cellar level in what Dr Ashbee calls ‘a Baldrick’s eye view of history - like looking up a chimney.’ Now visitors can walk round the remains of all four storeys of the ruined tower and into what would have been its individual rooms. Elizabethan fireplaces, the vast bay window frames and door arches are still visible, as are holes in the walls where ornate plaster friezes decorated with gold leaf would once have hung. Tomorrow’s opening coincides with the 481st anniversary of Elizabeth I’s birth this Sunday.","The rooms within the castle were built exclusively for the Queen by Robert Dudley, the First Earl of Leicester .

Desperation: Ruth Madoff, wife of disgraced financier Bernie, has spoken for the first time about the night she leaned of her husband's massive Ponzi fraud . Madoff is serving a 150-year-sentence for his $65 billion Ponzi scheme fraud. His wife's interview with '60 Minutes' will be broadcast Sunday. The Madoffs' son, Andrew, also appears on the same show in interview. Meanwhile Bernie Madoff says that he is happier in prison than he was been for the past 20 years.

Madoff claims that he suffers . deep remorse and endures 'horrible' nightmares, but in comments that . are likely to enrage his victims further he said: 'Every once in a . while I find myself smiling and I find myself horrified'. In a two-hour jailhouse interview with Barbara Walters, Madoff revealed that he was forced to 'let... go' of his wife almost a . year ago. He said that whilst he can live with the anger of his victims, being shunned by his own family is too much to bear. The disgraced financier revealed that Mrs Madoff, 68, has not spoken to him since the suicide last December of their son Mark. When that happened she asked him to 'let her go'. Madoff, 73, said that 'not seeing my . family and knowing they hate me' is the worst thing about being in . prison because he 'betrayed them'. He said: 'Ruth not communicating is the hardest thing. Ruth doesn't hate me. She has no-one. 'It's not fair to her. She lost her first son. ... She is a devoted wife and didn't care about the money.' Talking of his life in prison, he told ABC News: 'I feel safer here than outside. 'Days go by. I have people to talk to and no decisions to make. ... I know that I will die in prison.

Their security guard Nick Casale said he was in the couple's home on the night they supposedly attempted an overdose and everything seemed normal. Mr Casale spent the early evening sitting talking with them both and 'didn't see anything unusual' before leaving at 7pm.

'We didn't realize truly . what was happening until she had almost left. The cashier recognised . her, but she was very unassuming.' 'We did not have advance notice; it was as big a . surprise to us as it was to everyone else.' Mrs Obama's casual slip-out trip to Target has been criticised as a . well-timed PR stunt. Only last month the First Lady was accused of indulging in luxury holidays worth $10million dollars on the taxpayers’ dime. And barely a week ago, the 47-year-old mother-of-two was criticised for wearing $40,000 diamonds to a fund-raising event. Release: The photographs of Michelle Obama came as the White House released photos of her and the President meeting with Americans in September . President Obama has been seen to have been trying to recast himself since Labor Day. He has made attacks on millionaires, corporate-jet owners, and oil companies, in what has been seen as an attempt to return to his populist persona that was seen before his election. This weekend he released a set of official photographs that show him meeting with Americans during September.","First Lady photographed shopping in Target store in Alexandria, Virginia .

"New love interest? The Italian magazine at the centre of the royal privacy row also published pictures of Pippa with a male companion . The Italian magazine at the centre of the royal privacy row has published photographs of Pippa Middleton holding hands with a mystery man. Chi magazine caused outrage by running front page pictures of the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge in a bikini while on a family holiday in Mustique. Now it has emerged that the same edition, published yesterday, also features pictures of her younger sister with a new love interest. Prince William and Kate flew to the private Caribbean island last week and were later joined by her parents Carole and Michael Middleton and siblings Pippa and James. But unauthorised photographs of the family taken on the beach emerged in the Italian magazine, and are also due to be published in Australia. Chi printed pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge paddling in the sea together beneath headlines such as ‘the belly grows’ and ‘honeymoon for three’. They also showed party planner Pippa in an orange and pink-striped bikini holding hands with a broad, brown-haired man. Looking tanned and toned, she is pictured smiling up at her companion, who wears black patterned swim shorts and sunglasses, as they walk along the beach. In another photograph, they are walking side-by-side with James Middleton, who is sporting a deep tan and blue swim shorts. Chi magazine, owned by disgraced ex-Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said they showed Pippa with her ‘boyfriend’ James Matthews, a wealthy businessman whom she was understood to be dating before Christmas. However, sources close to Mr Matthews, 37, denied it was him in the photographs, suggesting Pippa has a new man in her life. Eton-educated Mr Matthews – whose brother Spencer stars in reality show Made in Chelsea – was said to be at his office in London yesterday, where he is chief executive of the Eden Rock Capital Management Group. Pippa has not been in a serious relationship since she split with her boyfriend-of-three-years, City banker Alex Loudon, in November 2011, although she has been linked to several aristocratic suitors. On Tuesday, a spokesman for St James’s Palace said they were ‘disappointed’ that the photographs of the Duke and Duchess had been published and branded it ‘a clear breach of the couple’s right to privacy.’ One photograph shows Kate tying her hair up while she stands knee-deep in the crystal clear waters – with her rounded stomach on show – and her husband close by. Mustique: Pippa, 29, has joined her sister and brother-in-law on the Caribbean island, along with the rest of the Middleton family . Outrage: Chi magazine has published pictures of the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge in a bikini while on a family holiday along with her husband on Mustique . Another shows her wading through the . sea, next to the caption, ‘The bump is starting to show and the . princess has a softer figure than what she had on her honeymoon in 2011 . in the Seychelles’. Photographs of their private honeymoon in the Seychelles are also published on the same page. Last night the magazine remained defiant about running a six-page special about the couple’s break to Mustique. Defiant: Chi also published pictures of Pippa holding hands with a mystery man on the beach . ‘Referring . to the photographs as ‘unexceptional’ and ‘not scandalous’, Chi’s . editor Alfonso Signorini said: ‘You cannot talk of a violation of . privacy when we are publishing pictures taken in a public place in the . open air such as a beach, where there are other swimmers. ‘In any case the Italian press doesn’t have a gentleman’s agreement with the [British] royal family. ‘It’s about a serene moment between a loving couple, smiling. Where is the scandal?’ Ironically, . the article says the royal couple ‘hope’ that their villa ‘is big . enough to accommodate their bodyguards, who are there to protect them . from chance incidents like the pictures of Kate topless that appeared . last summer’. Chi was among the publications that published topless photographs of the Duchess, taken while she was staying at a private villa in France last summer. In 2006, the magazine infamously ran a picture of Princess Diana as she lay dying in the back of a car when her vehicle crashed in Paris. Yesterday, Woman’s Day magazine in Australia announced they had bought 39 photographs of the couple’s holiday in Mustique for almost £100,000. They plan to publish them on Monday. They claimed the photographs were taken by a member of the public who was staying on the island and not the paparazzo. Editor Fiona Connolly said: ‘She is on a public beach and she was mingling with holiday makers. There are other holiday makers in the photos. ‘These photos have not been taken by a professional photographer hiding in the bushes. ‘They are not nude photos taken with a telescopic lens from inside a private villa. ‘These are images showing her on a happy holiday, and she looks amazing.’ Despite her protests, it is possible that a photographer posed as a member of the public in order to gain access to the couple. Either way, it is an embarrassment for the island, which prides itself on providing on and off-shore security  for guests staying at its 74 exclusive villas. Mrs Connolly said: ‘I think the British are very sensitive about this. ‘As Australians, we see this every day. We see pregnant women in bikinis on the beach – and a public one at that – so we are a lot less sensitive here in Australia.’ The royal family launched legal action last year against the French magazine Closer over the topless images taken in France. A court in Paris granted an injunction banning further publication of the photographs, but the case is still on-going after the magazine appealed the decision.","Chi has also published photos of Pippa Middleton with a male companion .

"House-proud Daily Mail readers have told of their delight at beating the EU ban by hoovering up high-powered vacuum cleaners in our special promotion. Among the first to bag one was businessman Roger Hunt, who says his Hoover Spirit Pets Cylinder will be ideal for keeping the five-bedroom home spick and span. He lives there with wife Jane, their four children and four-year-old cocker spaniel, Tennyson, spick and span. Scroll down for video . Versatile: Businessman, Roger Hunt, says his Hoover is great for cleaning cars as well as the house . Yesterday Mr Hunt, 54, of Worcester, who has run his own second-hand car business for 35 years, said: ‘It’s lightweight so we can take it up and down the stairs easily and run it round the house. ‘It’s got attachments so you can get down the sofa and clear dog hairs, and it will do any surface, carpets or tiling. In my opinion, the Hoover is so good I’ll also be bringing it to work to use it on the cars.’ In a blow to families and pet owners who value powerful vacuums for making house cleaning quick and easy, a European Union directive banning cleaners of more than 1,600 watts came into force this week in an attempt to reduce energy use. The Mail teamed up with Hoover to offer readers an exclusive 50 per cent off two top Hoover vacuum cleaners – the Hoover Spirit Pets, which Mr Hunt ordered, for £74.99 including postage (normally £149.99), or the Hoover Breeze Pets for £99.99 including postage (normally £199.99). Both the models originally on offer sold out within just five hours. But today we are offering two different high-powered models to readers (see offer below). Mr Hunt said: ‘We wanted a high-power vacuum cleaner and every one of my generation knows Hoover are a good product so as soon as we saw the offer in the Daily Mail we knew it was the one for us. Last Saturday's Daily Mail story on new EU directive banning high-powered vacuum cleaners . ‘I cannot understand why the ban is coming in. With a high-powered one like this you use it once a week and get the job done properly. With lower powered models you end up using them maybe three or four times a week to get the same result.’ Mrs Hunt, 44, works as a service adviser for another car dealership, so fitting in efficient housework in limited time between work is essential for the busy couple. Three of their children – Harry, 18, Patsy, 15, and Archie, 12 – still live at home full-time, while the fourth, Georgina, 20, is at university. Another to take advantage of our promotion was Misty Taylor, 86, of Rhyl, Denbighshire, who opted for the upright Breeze Pets model. The grandmother said: ‘I’ve had Hoovers since 1949, they are reliable and you need the power to do a good job. I wouldn’t be without one.’ The EU ban led to a stampede to buy powerful vacuum cleaners in shops this with week, with retailers reporting a fourfold surge in sales. Retailers can continue selling stock until it runs out but they cannot import more and manufacturers can no longer make them. From next year the EU ban will extend to vacuums cleaners of 900 watts as well.","New EU law means vacuum cleaners with more than 1,600 watts are banned .

"When they found her, starving to death and desperately weak, she was half the horse she should have been. Polly the abandoned bay mare was so underweight she had zero body fat, her ribs poked through and her rescuers described her as the thinnest living horse they had ever seen. But after six months of constant care, she has made a miraculous recovery, is a picture of health and back to a weight close to what she should be. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Polly  was once described as the 'thinnest living animal' rescuers had seen after she was found near the M25 . She had zero body fat, her ribs poked through and she had worms, conjunctivitis and skin disease rainscald . Video courtesy of The Horse Trust . The five-year-old was found in a corn field backing on to the M25 in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, on a cold day in February by the RSPCA and taken to the nearby Horse Trust charity’s centre in Speen. Another mare dumped in the same field with Polly had collapsed in the mud and was unable to stand. Nothing could be done for her and a vet put her to sleep to prevent further suffering. A third with a seriously injured hind leg was put down a week later. All three were equally emaciated. Polly, who also had worms, conjunctivitis and the skin disease rainscald, weighed 316kg (696lb), almost less than half the healthy weight for a horse of her size, 15 hands. Jeanette Allen, chief executive of the Horse Trust, said: ‘It’s a miracle Polly is still alive. It’s the worst case of horse neglect I’ve ever seen. ‘We rate a horse’s weight on a scale from zero to five, with three being a healthy horse. Polly was a zero - she had no fat on her skin or even around her vital organs.’ Polly, pictured on the road to recovery shortly after she arrived at the Horse Trust’s centre in Speen . After six months of constant care, Polly has made a miraculous recovery and is now a picture of good health . Polly now weighs a near normal half a ton (466kg/1027lb) after putting on a much-needed 150kg (331lb). But her road to recovery was a long one, and far from simple. She could not be fed with a lot of food for fear of her dying from ‘re-feeding syndrome’. This meant that she had to have controlled amounts of hay a day to avoid being overloaded with calories and her body shutting down. Her lack of body fat also meant that the treatment she needed for worms could have proved fatal as well. Mrs Allen said: ‘When we first started treatment it could have proved toxic for her. It was a horrible Catch 22 situation where we had to treat her worms to stop them killing her but the treatment itself could have caused fatal damage. Polly, now well with workers at the Horse Trust . ‘The treatment is absorbed by fat cells and released slowly over a few months, but she had no fat and it would have just swamped her body.’ All three horses were microchipped, but their details only link back to their veterinary clinic, not their owner, making it unlikely they will ever be traced and prosecuted for neglect. Rescue centres reported a rise in admissions of up to 40 per cent last year, with increasing numbers of horses being abandoned because of the effect of the credit crunch on the price of feed. Unscrupulous dealers, hit by a slump in demand following the horse meat scandal, were also blamed for the surge. Polly is now well enough to have been released into a field at the centre with other rescued horses. Mrs Allen said: ‘She’s a real mare now, the transformation is unbelievable. 'She’s got a group of male horses who follow her everywhere - it’s a right little fan club. ‘When we first got her we would never have imagined putting her in with other horses. She could barely have survived the slightest brush.’","Abandoned bay mare Polly had zero body fat when she was found by RSPCA .

"With the stricken victim safely plucked from a 30ft roof after a two-hour operation, firefighters may have insisted it was a successful operation. But taxpayers were left questioning the wisdom of a £1,000 mission to rescue a seagull with a fire engine and aerial ladder platform – especially as the bird had to be put down almost straight away. The gull was spotted on Sunday morning by a family on the roof of their three-storey home in Esher, Surrey. They could see it was injured but could not reach it, so called the RSPCA. Scene: Two fire crews were dispatched to the house in Esher, Surrey, on Sunday to rescue the trapped seagull . Emergency: The stricken victim safely plucked from the 30ft roof after a two-hour operation (file picture) They in turn called the fire brigade, . which sent a fire engine, but the crew was unable to reach the gull so a . second team was called in with the high-rise equipment from Chertsey, . nine miles away. Hoisting . the longer ladder then proved tricky because of electrical wires around . the house. Neighbour Sarah Pitchforth, 36, said: ‘There was such a . commotion, we thought someone had fallen from a  window or had an . accident. I couldn’t believe it when my son came back and said it was a bird.’ The gull was handed to the RSPCA but had to be put to sleep because it was suffering from leg injuries and suspected botulism. A . spokesman for the charity said: ‘While this has a sad  ending, we would . like to thank the fire and rescue service for their assistance. It is a . great training aid for the service and their help meant the RSPCA was . able to quickly and painlessly help a suffering animal.’ But . TaxPayers’ Alliance director John O’Connell said: ‘Nobody wants to see . animals suffer, but incidents like these raise serious concerns about . whether this is the best way for the fire brigade to use its time. It . does seem like a rather excessive response.’ On . a local newspaper website, one user wrote: ‘What a waste of money. It’s . just an airborne rat. What was needed was somebody with an air rifle.’ When the first fire crew couldn't reach the bird, firefighters from Chertsey fire station, above, were called on . A . recent Freedom of Information request sent to 56 fire services showed . they had rescued 17,000 animals in the three years to 2011 at a cost of . £3.5million. That included 2,090 birds, among them 1,244 seagulls, 159 . pigeons, 57 swans and 12 parrots. They . have also been called out to rescue dolphins, bats, iguanas, a . chameleon – and even a snail that was crawling up an elderly woman’s . wall. In 2012, 25 firemen . were sent to rescue a seagull from a 3ft-deep pond in South London – but . then refused to wade in because of health and safety regulations. The . RSPCA spokesman added: ‘Like any member of the public, the RSPCA can . request the help of the Fire and Rescue Service, but it is entirely up . to them what level of response they can provide.’ Last . night a Surrey Fire and Rescue spokesman said: ‘The main reason we . carry out animal rescues is that if we don’t do it there is a strong . possibility that members of the public will attempt a rescue, putting . themselves at risk without our skills and experience.’ He . added: ‘We used available resources, with equipment and crews at three . nearby stations ready to cover any other incidents, and if human life . were at risk we would have redirected those involved in the rescue at . once.’ The spokesman confirmed that one fire engine attended, plus an aerial ladder platform which was on site for less than an hour.","Gull had become trapped on roof of three-storey house in Easher, Surrey .

"William Pooley, 29, was airlifted back to London after contracting the deadly virus while trying to save lives in Sierra Leone . Medics told yesterday of the stressful and desperate conditions in the makeshift ebola wards where the British victim worked. Staff were too scared to come to work at Kenema government hospital where the floors were left splashed with blood. The 350-bed hospital is a cluster of small cinder-block buildings in the centre of Kenema, the third largest city in Sierra Leone and a hot-spot for ebola. The isolation units where the afflicted are taken are in temporary covered shelters with concrete floors, plastic sheeting for walls and tin roofs. The doctors and nurses wear masks, goggles and impermeable Tyvek safety suits. Nevertheless, 20 nurses and healthcare workers have died of ebola since the outbreak began. Loss of concentration brought on by the gruelling workload is blamed for them exposing themselves to the deadly virus. Daniel Bausch, an American doctor and ebola expert who was at the hospital last month, said in one ward of 30 patients 'the floor was splashed with blood, vomit, faeces and urine'. Ebola sufferers often fall out of bed, he said, creating a decontamination nightmare for medics, who would also have to haul the patients back into bed. There were also staff shortages because nurses walked out after not receiving their £20 a week hazard pay. One nurse who continued working, Sister Nancy Yoko, 36, said: 'No one wants to come close to us, the nurses in the general ward won't talk to us, even our families are scared they will catch the virus from us.' Ebola is new to Sierra Leone and there is much suspicion and mistrust about the hospital. There was even a rumour that locals wanted to burn down the Kenema site, which is in Sierra Leone's Eastern Province. 'They are angry with us, they don't believe we are trying to help,' said another nurse. Robert Garry, an American professor of microbiology and immunology who has visited the hospital many times, said conditions were getting better. Scroll down for video . A health worker, wearing head-to-toe protective gear, offers water to a woman with Ebola, at the Kenema Government Hospital, in Kenema, Eastern Province, Sierra Leone . A healthcare worker wears protective gear against the Ebola virus before entering the Ebola isolation ward at Kenema Government Hospital, in Kenema . Of the nurses' decision to strike, he said: 'It's not really surprising that some people made the judgement it's not worth their personal risk – no one could fault anyone for doing that. 'Some have set aside their own personal wellbeing and paid the ultimate price. We only wish the best for this young British nurse who put it all on the line.' Professor Garry said the hospital was a decent multi-purpose facility by African standards but 'with not enough doctors, not enough nurses and not a whole lot of modern equipment'. He added: 'Working in the ebola wards is very stressful. You are dealing with patients that are carrying a very dangerous virus – one mistake and you'll become infected yourself. 'If you are working long days, up to 18 hours, day after day, as no doubt this young British nurse did, you are more likely to make a mistake. Humans can only maintain that kind of intense concentration for so long.' Colleagues who have returned from Kenema recently told him conditions were improving with more cleaners to do decontamination work. The hospital deals with 90 ebola cases a week. A risk assessment published last month by Public Health England said the current outbreak could raise the danger for Britons working in humanitarian and healthcare delivery in affected areas. However, the threat to tourists, visitors and expatriates was still considered 'very low if elementary precautions are followed'.","Staff were too scared to come to work at Kenema government hospital .

"A British tourist was killed in an horrific helicopter crash when the aircraft plummeted into New York's East River seconds after take-off. Sonia Marra was trapped inside the chopper after it spun out of control, landing upside down in the murky water. The victim's partner Helen Tamaki, her mother Harriet Nicholson and stepfather Paul are fighting for their lives after being pulled to safety by rescuers. Pilot Paul Dudley also survived the accident. He is a close friend of the family. Shock: The woman is held tight by her rescuers as others wait to pull her to safety . Chaotic: Dozens of rescue workers had rushed to the scene to try to pull the victim from the cold water . Sonia Marra died in the crash: She is pictured in Madame Fling Flongs bar, in Sydney, which she owned . Miss Tamaki had organised the doomed flight to New York to celebrate her partner's 40th and Mr Nicholson's 71st birthdays. The chopper took off from the East 34th Street heliport shortly after 3pm and lifted about 25 feet into the air before encountering trouble. Witnesses first thought the pilot was attempting some sort of 'daredevil' manouevre before watching in horror as the Bell 206 Jet Ranger fell from the sky. It came to rest upside down 50 feet below the surface of the swift-moving water with just its skids showing. People on the nearby docks began throwing life jackets into the water and emergency crews were on the scene in seconds. A dozen boats converged on the crash site. Police officers doing a counterterrorism drill jumped into the water wearing their uniform. They found two people clinging to the aircraft and one trying to swim to shore. A man was reportedly attempting to dive under the chopper in a futile attempt to rescue Miss Marra. 'The pilot did indictate that there was somebody still in the helicopter,' Lt Larry Serras said. 'By the time we swam to the helicopter it was completely submerged.' It took 90 minutes to recover Miss Marra's body. She was in the back seat and was not buckled in by any belt. Medics declared her dead at the scene. In the water: Five people were on board the Bell 206 tourist helicopter - and three survivors could be seen clinging onto the craft's wreckage . Safety: Rescuers swim with two of the crash survivors (left) while one man made an attempt to get to shore himself before emergency crews arrived (right) Crash site circled: The chopper can just be seen in the waters of East River shortly before it sunk . Survivor: Pilot Paul Dudley, 56, had more than 20 years of experience . Mrs Nicholson and Miss Tamaki are both in critical condition at the Bellevue Hospital, according to the New York Daily News. Mr Nicholson is being treated at New . York University Medical Center. Mr Dudley, a 56-year-old veteran pilot, . was treated at the scene. His helicopter was not equipped with . floats and was upside down in the water - which had a temperature of . around 66F -  as rescuers arrived. Mr Dudley's wife said she had spoken briefly to her husband after the crash. 'I think that he's OK,' she said. 'These were actually very dear friends of ours that were in the helicopter.' Hundreds of people were only able to watch in horror as the tragedy unfolded. Joy Garnett and her husband were on . the dock waiting to take the East River ferry to Brooklyn when they . heard the blades of a helicopter and saw it start to take off from the . nearby helipad. She said she saw it do 'a funny curlicue'. 'I thought, ""Is that some daredevil move?"" But it was obviously out of control,' she said. 'The body spun around at least two or . three times, and then it went down. It didn't make much noise. It was . just a splash and sunk.' 'It sank fast,' Luis Reyes told the New York Post. 'There were two guys on the outside holding on, screaming: ""Help! Help!""' 'The water is not too cold, but even 60 degrees can be dangerous,' coast guard spokesman Erik Swanson told the New York Post. Tragic ending: Rescue workers take away the body of Miss Marra which was recovered from the river after a 90 minute operation . Desperate search: A dozen boats had been involved in combing the river for survivors . Crash site: The helicopter went down with five people on board after taking off from the heliport at 34th Street . Carlos Acevedo, of Puerto Rico, was with his wife at a nearby park area when they saw the helicopter go down. Mr Acevedo said: 'It sank fast. In seconds. Like the water was sucking it in.' The helicopter has already been . recovered from the water and will be examined by crash investigators at . Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. Miss Marra, described as a . larger-than-life personality with a heart of gold, had moved to . Australia some years ago where she once ran bar in Sydney's Newtown . called Madame Fling Flong's. She had sold the venue and started selling fruit at a market in the neighbouring suburb of Glebe. Probe: Investigators have so far found no mechanical reason for the crash . Salvage: The Bell 206 tourist helicopter, which was not equipped with floats, was pulled from the East River hours after the crash . They gathered in quiet groups in the gay bars and nightclubs of Sydney's Newtown to pay their respects to Sonia Marra. As news of her death spread around the suburb, where gay couples openly walk the streets hand in hand, the community reacted with tears and cries of dismay. Miss Marra was described as a larger than life personality, known to just about everyone among the older generation of lesbians in Newtown. She had moved to Australia from the UK many years ago and for a number of years had run a bar in Newtown called Madame Fling Flong's, which, with its gold-padded bar and soft couches, was popular with the lesbian community (pictured above). She told her customers that every couch had been lovingly chosen and she had found the wallpaper on eBay - 'it was the last roll.' At the Sly Fox pub in Newtown, customers said the gathering would be more of an early wake rather than the usual fun night out. 'She moved on from Madame Fling Flong's a couple of years ago and we were all sad to see her go,' said Jennifer Walsh, 32, one of the women who gathered at the Sly Fox. 'Sonia was just, well, Sonia - she was always there. If you didn't know her well you might think she was a bit gruff, but she had a soft heart, a heart of gold. ' I can't believe she's been killed like that. It's just terrible.' Connie Calligeros, another member of the gay community, described Miss Marra as 'the light of Newtown - she had that kind of personality. She just bubbled.' By coincidence, Aleks Dawson, a former Sydney resident now living in New York, told the Sydney Morning Herald that he saw Miss Marra and her partner in the Big Apple last Saturday and recognised her from his days as a student in Newtown. 'She was cool, tough and a little bit scary at first. But she was actually very down to earth and to the point,' he said. 'It breaks my heart. She was a tough-as-nails, hard-working woman with a heart of gold.' RICHARD SHEARS . One of her co-workers Joe Galluzzo . revealed how Miss Tamaki, originally from New Zealand, had planned the . trip to New York as a special birthday celebration. 'She was overjoyed - she couldn't . stop talking about it,' he said. 'She must have told everyone of her . customers about it. They already loved her and it was because of her . personality that fruit sold so well. Everyone seemed to gravitate . towards her.' Mr and Mrs Nicholson, who now live in Portugal, had met up with their daughter and her partner in New York. They had been sightseeing and planned to go to Linden, New Jersey, for dinner afterwards, according to police. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Prime Minister David Cameron to tell him about the tragedy. 'We have a family who've come here to . see the best of our city and to end up in a tragic accident like this . just breaks our heart. Our thoughts and prayers are with them,' he said . last night. 'From what we know so far, the pilot . reported having trouble keeping aloft, tried to turn back, but crashed . in the water just north of the landing pad.' The helicopter was built in 1976 and formerly operated as a news chopper. It was owned by father-of-three Mr Dudley, who is also the director of Linden Airport, near the Statue of Liberty. Linden Mayor Richard Gerbounka described him as an accomplished pilot who flew light aircraft as well as helicopters. In November 2006, Mr Dudley landed a Cessna 172 light plane in a park near Coney Island in Brooklyn after the engine failed. No one was hurt during the emergency landing, and the plane was taken back to Linden after mechanics removed the wings. The chopper which crashed in East . River is one of the world's most popular helicopter models and was first . flown in January 1966. They are light and highly . manoeuvrable, making them popular with television stations and air taxi . companies. They cost up to $1.2million. In August 2009 a small plane collided . with a helicopter over the Hudson River, west of Manhattan, killing . nine people, including five Italian tourists. A government safety panel found that an air traffic controller who was on a personal phone call had contributed to the accident. The Federal Aviation Administration changed its rules for aircraft flying over New York City's rivers after that collision. Pilots must call out their positions . on the radio and obey a 161mph speed limit. Before the changes, such . radio calls were optional. Earlier that year, an Airbus 320 . airliner landed in the Hudson after hitting birds and losing both . engines after taking off from LaGuardia Airport.

"To match their skirts, flipflops and everything else in their doll-filled bedrooms, the girls have theirs in pink. The boys, of course, choose blue. But these are not toys, they are real guns — a U.S. gun-maker’s range of .22 calibre, single-shot rifles marketed for young children. The ‘youth model’ of the Crickett firearm, which is sold in a ‘My First Rifle’ range, are snapped up by American parents enthusiastic to introduce children to the joys of gun ownership. The youngest of the gun-toting girls pictured here is just six, the oldest eight. Hayley, six, from Kentucky claims she wants her rifle equipped with telescopic sights as she's afraid of sharks . Eight-year-old Abbey from Ohio wants her .22 caliber rifle in case she ever has to deal with a dinosaur . These portraits of children taken in their homes provide a disturbing insight into U.S. gun culture, a highly controversial subject that was reawakened this week by the fatal shooting of an instructor as he taught a nine-year-old girl to fire an Uzi submachine gun. Charles Vacca, 39, was accidentally shot in the head during a ‘Bullets and Burgers’ day at an outdoor range called The Last Stop in Arizona. He was standing next to the child, who was wearing pink shorts and a braided ponytail, as she fired the lethal weapon in single-shot mode before he told her to switch it to automatic. Yesterday's Daily Mail told the tragic story of how a nine-year-old girl accidentally shot a man dead with an Uzi . His last words, captured on video by her parents, were: ‘All right, full auto.’ The recoil from the gun — which is notorious for rising as it fires — made it jerk back in the girl’s hands, shooting her instructor in the head. The range is one of many throughout America that allow children as young as five to shoot .22 rifles under supervision. Other ranges even offer children’s party packages. Many appalled Americans castigated the girl’s parents for putting such a lethal firearm in her hands, but Arizona prosecutors refused to blame them, saying Mr Vacca was guilty of negligence for failing to keep his hand on the gun and was responsible for his own death. Charles Vacca, 39, left, was accidentally shot dead by the small girl, right, as she fired the Uzi sub machine gun . An almost identical lethal accident happened six years ago. Eight-year-old Christopher Bizilj was firing a 9mm micro Uzi at pumpkins at a gun fair in Massachusetts. The gun kicked back and the boy shot himself in the face and died. Only one state took any action as a result of the boy’s death. Connecticut adopted a law banning anyone under 16 from handling machine guns at shooting ranges. The latest tragedy comes just a month after a new report highlighted the growing number of accidental gun deaths among children. The report, compiled by groups campaigning for tighter firearms controls, claimed that almost two children are killed on average in the U.S. every week, mostly at home. Belgian photographer An-Sofie Kesteleyn took these shocking portraits after being horrified by a news report about a boy of five accidentally shooting dead his two-year-old sister with a Crickett rifle in Kentucky. Seven-year-old Abby, pictured, from Kentucky says she is afraid of both zombies and burglars . Lily, 6, from Louisiana, told photographer An-Sofie Kesteleyn that she was afraid of zombies . Young girls in America even have the opportunity to buy special pink gun cases for their pink rifles . She visited gun shops and ranges to find her subjects and said they were given the rifles by enthusiastic parents: ‘I got the feeling the parents were more into it than the kids,’ she says. ‘The adults were big gun users and wanted the children to learn how to shoot. I thought it was weird.’ She also asked the children what they were scared of that made them want guns. The Cricketts cost from $150 to $225 (£90 to £135) — considerably cheaper than the latest video games consoles — and are sold by a company in Pennsylvania called Keystone Sporting Arms. It sells around 60,000 a year, according to its website, which calls them ‘quality firearms for America’s youth’. It says the pink models have ‘brought more young women to the sport of shooting than ever before’. Matching pink gun cases are available. The website adds that the Crickett rifle is ‘ideally sized for children four to ten years old’. Miss Kesteleyn said the children she photographed were from responsible, well-off or middle-class families. The Crickett website says: ‘Warning: like all firearms this rifle should only be shot by a minor with adult super-vision at all times.’ But that was not enough to stop tragic accidents.","A US gun company sells 60,000 rifles a year for children between 4 and 10 .

"If your favoured work out involves counting calories on high tech digital equipment and you enjoy a sauna and steam at the end of your session, then the Kachalka gym in the Ukraine is probably not for you. With muscle-bound gym goers using stacked tyres as a punch bag and free weights chained to the ground surrounded by unorthodox makeshift metal machines, the gym looks more like a scrapyard than a fitness centre. And you won't just be dripping with sweat should the heavens open during an intense workout. Al fresco: Gym goers of all ages and fitness levels flock to Kachalka outdoor gym in Kiev - because it's free .

Outdoor workout: The Kachalka gym is the Ukrainian answer to California's Muscle Beach (pictured) For Kachalka - perhaps the most hardcore outdoor gym in the world - is completely open to the elements. But formed in the early 1970s, the Ukraine's answer to California's Muscle Beach has increased in popularity over the last four decades and is now home to more than 200 different fitness machines. The brainchild of a Polish gymnast Kasmir Jagelsky and maths professor Yuri Kuk, the 6.2 square mile outdoor fitness centre is located on the island of Tuhen right in the heart of the nation's capital Kiev.

Packed: The gym, which was formed in the early 1970s, has grown in popularity over the past four decades . Fitness fanatics: The gym was founded by Polish gymnast Kasmir Jagelsky and maths professor Yuri Kuk in the early 1970s . Unorthodox: The equipment, some of which looks more like torture machinery than something that belongs in a gym, is made mostly from old machinery and scrap metal . Put to new use: Much of the equipment was made when scrap metal was at a surplus in the country during the Cold War . Hardcore: An outdoor gym seemingly attended mostly by musclebound men, the Kachalka gym is a tough environment . Its name comes from the Ukranian word 'kachat' which literally means 'to pump'. Many of the machines were created when there was a surplus of scrap metal in the country during the Cold War years and consist of spare parts from machines and vehicles. Rusted tank chains and marine salvage parts have been roughly forged together to create the most primitive and basic of strength and resistance machines. Made mostly of metal and wood, the machines are painted blue and most lack the luxury of padded seats or soft plastic coated pulleys. Much of the equipment is chained to the ground so that it isn't stolen. Onlooker: An older gym-goer waits patiently as youngsters aim for bigger biceps on some of the equipment .

"Families are taking more holidays overseas, but they are spending less when they hit the attractions and clubs. The tightening of the purse strings which has brought reductions in supermarket spending at home appears to have continued once families board their flights for a summer break. Spending by UK residents while on overseas visits has dipped 16per cent in the first six months of 2014 compared with the same period last year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has announced. Holiday: Families are taking more holidays overseas, but they are spending less once they get there, official figures suggest . The spending figure, at £12.83 billion, fell despite the number of visits abroad taken by UK residents rising four per cent to 27.14 million in the first half of this year. The fall appears to be at least partly a reflection of the fact that the pound has soared in value against most foreign currencies, which means British travellers get more for them money. The same ONS study found that spending by foreign tourists to the UK in the first six months of this year was largely the same as the same period last year at some £8.92billion. Spending less: The spending figure, at £12.83 billion, fell despite the number of visits abroad taken by UK residents rising four per cent to 27.14 million in the first half of this year . The first six months of 2014 have seen overseas residents making 16.41 million trips to the UK - an eight per cent rise on the January-June 2013 total. David Edwards, head of research and forecasting at VisitBritain, said: ‘Tourism is an essential part of the wider success of our economy and these first six months have set us up for what could be another record year for inbound tourism. ‘It’s also hugely positive to see growth both from our high-volume European markets and also emerging markets across Asia and Latin America.’ Tourism minister Helen Grant said: ‘It’s fantastic that Britain’s tourism industry is performing so strongly with a record number of visits for 2014 so far . It shows the Government’s tourism strategy is working - creating more jobs, encouraging greater spend and growing the economy.'","Office for National Statistics reveals British holidaymakers spending less .

"The number of ‘super-commuter’ Britons who take 90 minutes to get to work has soared by 50 per cent in the last five years, according to a new report. The study shows the average UK worker spends 41 minutes commuting every day. But the number spending a total of three hours or more travelling has risen to 1.84million - or nine per cent of the workforce. According to the results, accountants have the longest average daily commute – 75.6 minutes – followed by IT workers at 65.6 minutes. The number of Britons spending at least three hours a day on their work commute has risen by 50 per cent . By contrast, people working in the car industry only travel for an average of 22 minutes. They are followed by retailers (31.8 minutes), leisure workers (32.3 minutes), estate agents (36.4 minutes) and teachers (36.9 minutes). Employees working in the leisure industry have the shortest distance to travel, an average of 12.6 miles, compared to IT workers with a 38.5-mile journey. The report, by recruitment firm Randstad, found that the car is Britain’s most popular method of transport to and from the office – accounting for more than half of work-related journeys. And around one in ten people will take the train, but only one in 40 cycles to work. Mark Bull, the UK chief executive of . Randstad, said : ‘The central tenet of the commuting life is that you . travel away from the workplace. ‘You . do this until you reach an area where you can afford to buy a house . that meets your standards. In this equation you’re essentially trading . miles for square feet. The car is still the most popular method of getting to work, accounting for half of all journeys . ‘Three hours is no longer extraordinary. Commuters travel across counties the way that they used to travel across neighbourhoods.’ And despite the tough economic conditions, British commuters are only spending marginally less time (2.3%) on the move than they were before the downturn began to take hold. For back in 2008, the average British commute took a total of 42 minutes each day. The average total daily commuting distance has dropped from 18.5 miles in 2008 to 16.7 miles - a fall of 10 per cent - as people live slightly closer to their workplaces. But the report notes: ‘The fact commuting times have remained broadly the same suggests commuters are managing their commutes and using slower - possibly cheaper - modes of transport than they were before the downturn.’","Almost 2million Britons spend three hours or more on their daily commute .

"David Whatmore was jailed for 18 years for five counts of child rape and one count of attempted rape . A child rapist who bribed his victim with the promise of tickets to see One Direction if she had sex with him has been jailed for 18 years. David Whatmore began indecently touching the girl when she was 11. Then, he exploited the girl's love for the popular boy band to progress to raping her when she was aged 12 and 13. The abuse, which lasted two years, was described by a judge as 'a campaign of rape' as Whatmore was sentenced at Bolton Crown Court yesterday. It only ended in February last year when the girl's horrified mother looked at child's Facebook account and found sexual messages from Whatmore. The teenager told police the 50-year-old had offered her gifts, including money, pets, concert tickets and singing lessons. 'But you have to have sex with me in return,' he had told her. Amanda Johnson, prosecuting, said Whatmore would rape the girl regularly, about once a month, sometimes in the back of his transit van and on other times at his home in Deane in  Bolton, Greater Manchester. Whatmore even devised a coded message to inform her when he wanted sex, telling her to 'take the dogs for a walk' or 'do the dogs'. 'She was a fan of One Direction and he pretended to have VIP tickets and used that to bribe her to have sex with him,' said Miss Johnson. On another occasion, he sent her a message telling her to put on some 'dressy up clothes' so she would look older than her age and they could go out to a bar in Bolton. The court heard Whatmore exploited the girl's love for One Direction, pictured, to progress to raping her . 'The defendant demonstrated controlling and blackmail behaviour towards her,' said Miss Johnson. 'She describes herself as having gone through hell and that is still ongoing.' She added that his victim now suffers from severe depression and has had to have specialist counselling. The court was told that Whatmore, had pleaded guilty to five counts of child rape and one of attempted rape on September 1, the day his trial was due to start, but then attempted to change his plea - a move he later abandoned. Katy Appleton, defending, said he is remorseful and accepts responsibility for his actions. Sentencing, Judge Peter Davies, said: 'This is someone who has identified a young girl and, in order for his own gratification, has bribed her with gifts in order to have sex. 'These are truly dreadful offences. It was, and I use this word advisedly, a campaign of rape.' He added that Whatmore had used the girls' love of One Direction to get her to have sex with him. 'Of course, there were no tickets and you manipulated her in a cruel way,' he said. Whatmore was ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life, banned for life from unsupervised contact with children under 16 and banned from contacting any child under 18 on social media. Judge Peter Davies described Whatmore's abuse as a 'campaign of rape' which lasted two years. Pictured, Bolton Crown Court .","David Whatmore began indecently touching the girl when she was 11 .

"An eastern Ohio elementary school official will perform community service related to rape awareness in exchange for prosecutors dropping a charge that she failed to report rumors of a teenage sex and drinking party, state Attorney General Mike DeWine announced Wednesday. Lynnett Gorman had faced a misdemeanor charge of failure to report child abuse or neglect related to the April 2012 party. The accusation against Gorman arose from an investigation into other crimes associated with the  the notorious Steubenville rape case of a 16-year-old girl after a different party in August 2012, but it was not related to that case. An eastern Ohio elementary school official will perform community service related to rape awareness in exchange for prosecutors dropping charges she ignored teenage sex said state Attorney General Mike DeWine today . Gorman, a principal in the Steubenville city schools, must perform 40 hours of community service at a rape crisis or victim assistance center and talk to teachers and administrators in Steubenville about the importance of reporting child abuse and neglect, DeWine said. She must also encourage the school system to host a speaker from the Ohio Alliance Against Sexual Violence during Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April. If she completes those activities, the charge will be dropped by June 1, DeWine said. The attorney general said more can be accomplished through community service than jail time had Gorman been convicted. Accountability: Assistant coach Matt Belardine, . left, has been indicted on four counts including allowing underage . drinking. Superintendent Mike McVey, right, faces five charges . Family affair: Hannah Rhinaman, left, and her father William Rhinaman, right, were indicted by the grand jury earlier this year . 'The interests of the community are served by having the principal acknowledge that she should have done things differently,'  DeWine said in a statement, adding: . 'This is about the long-term healing of the community.' A message seeking comment was left Wednesday with Gorman’s attorney, Dennis McNamara, who previously said Gorman was accused of failing to report possible child abuse, apparently involving a teen sex and drinking party in April 2012 unrelated to the rape of the West Virginia girl later that year. McNamara said Gorman learned about the party second- or third-hand while checking to see if her son had been involved. Because parents of the teens knew of the party’s circumstances, 'I don’t think she had an obligation' to report it, McNamara said last month. Last month the members school staff - including Gorman - indicted by a grand jury investigating the notorious Steubenville rape case and another claim from a second girl in the town were allowed to return to work on full pay, to the shock of the victims' lawyer. Trial by social media: The messages over . Twitter, Instagram and texts that were exchanged ona night of back to back parties in  August 2012 and the next . day were central to the original case - and to the outrage it caused . nationwide . Steubenville City Schools Superintendent Mike McVey, wrestling coach Seth Fluharty and Lynnett Gorman, Principal of Pugliese Elementary School, had been placed on paid administrative leave since November 25 when Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced their indictments. But a meeting of the Board of Education of Steubenville City has seen them reinstated in their positions pending trial – a decision described by attorney Bob Fitzsimmons as ‘surprising’ and which he admitted has left him ‘shocked.’ Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Fitzsimmons who represented the 16-year-old victim, raped by Ma’lik Richmond, 17, and Trent Mays, then 16, in August 2012 said: ‘I am surprised that the Board of Education put them back at this stage. 'Members of the community, of the grand jury, found that there is at least probable cause to support indictments on several felonies. I’m actually quite shocked.’ Trent Mays, left, sits in Jefferson . County Court, next to co-accused Ma'lik Richmond just hours before the . two were convicted of raping the 16-year-old who regarded Mays as a . friend . Mr McVey has been indicted on five counts: one of tampering with evidence, two counts of obstruction of justice, one of falsification and one of obstructing official business. Several of the charges he faces relate to a second ‘rape’ alleged to have taken place in April 2012. The ‘victim’ of this alleged assault, four months earlier than the now infamous rape case, was a 14-year-old girl now also represented by Mr Fitzsimmons. Mrs Gorman’s indictment, on the charge of failure to report child abuse or neglect when she had ‘reasonable cause to suspect’ that a child under 18 had been a victim of it, also links to a date on or about 12 April 2012. Torn apart: Steubenvillle, Ohio, was thrown into turmoil by the high profile rape which brought with it allegations of cover up and corruption and public protests on the steps of the court . Mr Fluharty was charged with failing to report possible child abuse in August 2012. Assistant coach Matt Belardine, in whose house one of the parties which culminated in the rape was held in August on four misdemeanors, inclduing allowing underage drinking, obstructing official business and contributing to unruliness or delinquency of a child. Steubenville Schools IT technician William Rhinaman has been charged with tampering with evidence, obstruction and perjury. His daughter Hannah Rhinaman have also been indicted on theft and receiving stolen property charges. Mr McVey, Mrs Gorman and Mr Fluharty were all expected to return to work on Monday December 9. All of those charged deny the charges.","Lynnett Gorman had faced a misdemeanor charge of failure to report child abuse or neglect related to the April 2012 party .

"Three tourists who were caught having sex amid the ancient ruins of what was once Pompeii's very lively red light district have been charged with trespassing by Italian police. A Frenchman and two Italian women, all aged 23 to 27, allegedly broke into the Suburban Baths to fulfil their fantasies inside a former brothel that is still decorated with centuries-old wall paintings depicting explicit sex scenes. But authorities brought the group's middle-of-the-night threesome to a premature end, the Italian newspaper Il Mattino reported. Scroll down for video . Suburban Baths similar to those in Pompeii are still intact in the ancient Roman city of Herculaneum . The trio allegedly climbed over a gate to access the erotic site, which was a hangout for wealthy businessmen and politicians before the Roman city was wiped out by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD.

"Ma'Lik Richmond has returned to the Steubenville Big Red football roster a little more than a year . Ma'Lik Richmond has returned to the Steubenville Big Red football roster a little more than a year after being found delinquent of raping a 16-year-old girl . after being found delinquent of raping a 16-year-old girl. Richmond was one of two teens convicted in the case that made national headlines and sparked intense discussion over the privilege of student athletes. He was convicted in March 2013 and released from the Ohio Juvenile Detention Center on January 6, 2014. The 7th District Court of Appeals upheld his sexual offender classification in June. Writer Alexandria Goddard, who is widely . acknowledged as having brought the case to national attention by . reporting on social media, told Buzzfeed Richmond's return to the team was to be expected. 'I wanted to be shocked, but I think we all knew it was bound to happen,' she wrote. 'Steubenville City Schools hasn’t really done a lot in the past two . years to prove to the world that they don’t tolerate rape culture and . allowing a Tier II registered sex offender on the team pretty much . solidifies the assumption that they are concerned about wins rather than . the safety of young girls or the destruction of rape culture in their . area,' she added. The . case stretches back almost two years to an August 2012 incident in . which the then-16-year-old victim was raped during a football party. The . girl was dragged from one party while too drunk to respond, stripped . naked, abused, digitally penetrated, and photographed while face down on . the basement floor. Texts . and tweets shared between the attackers and their friends humiliated . the victim as they joked about details of the attack online. Richmond and player Trent Mays were tried as . juveniles and though both were classified as Tier II sex offenders, the state’s second highest category. Mays was sentenced to two years . detention and Richmond to just one year. Neither Steubenville's athletic director or coaches have responded to interview requests regarding Richmond's return . Images of the victim being assaulted were shared on social media, humiliating her a second time . Mays will be released in 2015 with good behavior. The case drew a firestorm of controversy to the small Ohio town, especially after the family of Cody Saltsman, a . player who had partied earlier with the group and posted the picture and . derogatory comments on Twitter, tried to silence her with a defamation . suit. Eventually the case attracted the attention of online activist group Anonymous to both the assault and allegations to cover up the crime, who then began a movement for justice to be served. Richmond must continue registering as a Tier II sex offender every 180 days for the next 20 years . The unidentified victim has not spoken publicly about the case but has reportedly discussed a film based on her assault with Brad Pitt's production company . Upon being released from detention, his attorney described Richmond as 'a better, stronger person' who 'looks forward to school, life, . and spending time with family.' An attorney for the unidentified victim called the statement, which did not acknowledge his client, 'disheartening.' WTRF, which first broke news of Richmond's return, notes that he must continue registering as a Tier II sex offender every 180 days for the next 20 years. Trent Mays (L) and Ma'lik Richmond (R) attracted the attention of online group Anonymous after pictures and details about the crime were found to be shared on social media . Neither Steubenville's athletic director or coaches have responded to interview requests. Richmond's return is the latest twist the case's history, as it was revealed in April that the teenage victim of the . Steubenville rape wants to work with Brad Pitt on his movie of the now . notorious Ohio scandal. The . girl, who has never spoken publicly about her ordeal at the hands of . High School football stars, Ma’lik Richmond and Trent Mays, has asked . for ‘input’ into the movie which will chronicle the crime and the role . played by Anonymous hacker, Deric Lotstutter in exposing it and the . cover up that followed. Upon being released from detention, his attorney described Richmond as 'a better, stronger person' who 'looks forward to school, life, and spending time with family' In April, the victim’s attorney, Bob Fitzsimmons, said: ‘As time goes on it’s easier and better for her. ‘She’s . still in high school and she’ll be graduating in May. She’s been . accepted to college and she intends to go. She still receives a lot of . support from friends and family and from time to time she still receives . professional counselling. ‘Overall she’s made a good recovery.’ However he would not comment directly on the victim's feelings about Richmond returning to Steubenville, saying only: 'When somebody’s been a victim and the perpetrator returns to . the community it creates issues and a situation that I’m sure has to be . dealt with.’","Ma'Lik Richmond was one of two teens convicted last year of raping the girl .

"Fly-tippers face losing the cars or vans they use to illegally dump old furniture and rubbish. Under tough new laws, enforcement officers are to be given the power to seize vehicles from outside offenders’ homes or businesses without having to go to court for a warrant. They will then be able to keep them for up to 30 days while an investigation is carried out. Fly-tippers face losing the cars or vans they use to illegally dump old furniture and rubbish under new laws. Pictured: A road is blocked off thanks to fly-tipping in Buckinghamshire . Last year, councils reported 852,000 fly-tipping incidents in England, which cost taxpayers more than £4 million to clear. The new law, due to come into force next spring, will focus on ‘cowboy’ firms that undercut legitimate waste companies by dumping rubbish from building sites and industrial premises anywhere they can find. It will also target individuals who scar the countryside by getting rid of household waste from the back of their car. As well as losing their vehicle, those found guilty could be imprisoned for up to five years and fined up to £50,000. Peter Box, of the Local Government Association, said: ‘Giving councils tougher penalties will allow them to tackle this criminal activity head-on. It is inexcusable and unacceptable for anyone to dump waste illegally, and councils know how much people hate seeing this sort of vandalism.’ Last year, councils reported 852,000 fly-tipping incidents in England, which cost taxpayers more than £4 million to clear.

"This is the moment a suspected illegal immigrant was discovered after clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it drove from Calais to a suburban road in Kent. The man, believed to be in his late teens, is thought to have tied himself to the chassis of the vehicle before it entered the Channel Tunnel. He emerged after the two-hour journey as Paul Coles and his daughter, Joanne, were returning the vehicle to its owner in Hoppers Way, Ashford. Scroll down for video . The young man, thought to be in his late teens or early twenties, was found after stowing away for the journey from Calais to Ashford in Kent, which takes around an hour-and-a-half . Police arrived at the home of Teresa Tyrer, who runs Scarlett Motorhome Hire, and took the man away in tears. A spokesman said this morning he had been passed on to Home Office Immigration Enforcement. Mrs Tyrer, said the youngster looked 'shaken' and as though he 'didn't know what to do' when he was found this afternoon. 'The man and his daughter had been driving since 3am to make the crossing at Callais. Paul, Joanne and Clive Coles with Teresa Tyrer as they return the motorhome which they had rented . 'Literally the last thing I said to them before they left was to keep the garage doors locked and not to stop at any petrol stations,' she said. 'Many people are tempted to because it's cheaper over there but I've heard so much about people being bullied at the stations near the tunnel and others not wanting to get out because so many people were hanging around trying to catch a lift.' As Mr Coles unloaded his daughter's motorcycles, he discovered the young man who 'spoke no English'. The suspected illegal immigrant 'sat patiently' on the grass as Kent Police arrived before taking him away in their vehicle. Teresa Tyrer said the young man, though to be around 17, cried as he was taken away . The young man clung to the motorhome for the duration of the 54mile journey from the coast of France to Hoppers Way in Ashford, Kent . 'As soon as the father saw him he shouted for his daughter to get back and call the police. When the young lad came out he looked very shaken, he didn't quite know what to do and he just sat there patiently after we called the police. 'He was scribbling notes on a piece of paper in Arabic, whether they were to give to the police I don't know. 'I know there are many who don't have any sympathy for them and I don't want a ton of [illegal immigrants] coming into the country but they are human beings at the end of the day. 'He was just a young lad, he showed no signs of aggression he just sat there calmly the poor soul. 'It seemed as though he'd put everything he's got into getting here and he'll probably be sent back.' A spokesman for Kent Police said: ' We were called to an address in Ashford at 1.46 pm to a report of a suspected illegal immigrant found underneath a motor home. Immigrants protesting for human rights in Calais marched through the town's streets earlier this month, demanding entry to the UK .

"The British father-of-two facing death at the hands of Islamic State fanatics has spent his career as an aid worker helping to protect innocent civilians across the Third World. For more than two decades, David Haines has travelled with aid agencies through Syria, Libya, the former Yugoslavia and South Sudan. He has dedicated his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and has overseen projects to save civilians from land mines. The 44-year-old has been described as a hero by his family, who have been inspired by him to travel the world themselves on aid missions. Scroll down for video . Hero: David Haines has travelled with aid agencies through Syria, Libya, former Yugoslavia and South Sudan . Mr Haines was born in Holderness in East Yorkshire, before being brought up in Perth, Scotland, by his parents Herbert, 77, and Mary, 79. He studied at Perth Academy before, at the age of 17, joining the military where he enjoyed a 12-year career. Despite getting married to his first wife Louise when he was 22 – and having his first daughter five years later – Mr Haines was determined to continue working across the world to help civilians trapped in war-torn countries. Between 1999 and 2004, he was at a German NGO helping to revive abandoned villages and to return refugees to their homes after the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. The work led to swift promotion and he left a few years later to become an independent consultant, spreading his experience in dealing with security to various charities and organisations. He worked as a consultant director for manufacturing company Astraea, based in Croatia, and went to Libya three years ago, working with Handicap International on demining programmes. Captured: David Haines with his second child, who is now four, two years before he was abducted . A year later, the aid worker travelled to South Sudan, where he was a security manager for Nonviolent Peaceforce, a civilian peacekeeping group. Wanting more freedom and a shorter-term contract, Mr Haines left to join French non-governmental organisation ACTED, or the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, which works to support civilians affected by wars, natural disasters and economic and social crises. He was with the organisation in Syria when he was kidnapped with a colleague in March last year by IS forces near the Atmeh refugee camp, by the Turkish border. Aid workers desperately tried to secure Mr Haines’s release and his family in Scotland spoke of their devastation at his capture. The hostage’s 17-year-old daughter in Perth has described her agony in a series of online posts over the past year. She has planned a gap year doing aid work in the Third World, inspired by her ‘hero’. ‘I miss my dad. I would do anything to have him home,’ she wrote last year. In an online question-and-answer forum, she was asked what she wanted most in her life. The schoolgirl replied: ‘To have my dad home for good.’ In March, Mr Haines’s daughter uploaded a picture of a Fathers’ Day card she had written him, stating: ‘Hey Daddy, just because you’re not here doesn’t mean you should miss out.’ Alongside the card was a picture of them together when she was a little girl. She also uploaded a photograph of him cradling his younger daughter from his second marriage to Croatian Dragana Prodanovic in 2010. The child is now four. Mr Haines’s elder daughter described her father as her ‘biggest influence’ and her ‘idol’, adding: ‘It’s been a really tough year without my dad. I think heroes exist, but they don’t all show off in a stupid cape. ‘This sounds really cheesy, but I think my dad’s a hero.’ Pressure: David Cameron and Barack Obama now face a race against time to recover David Haines and stem the Islamic State's murderous rampage after two US journalists were killed . Mr Haines’s relatives has been informed that he is the hostage featured in the barbaric IS video in which American journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded. On Tuesday evening, members of the family travelled to his parents’ home in Ayr to come to terms with the news together. They are being updated on his fate by Downing Street officials. Mr Haines’s wife has also posted heart-breaking pictures online – many of their wedding day – and a series of photographs of his toddler wearing T-shirts bearing the words ‘I love my dad’ and ‘Daddy’s girl’. She has also posted a song called Far Away, with a note reading: ‘For my hubby... far away... miss you darling.’ The couple had been living near Zagreb and running a supplies business. Mr Haines is believed to have been abducted in Syria along with Italian aid worker Federico Motka, 31, who was also doing relief work for ACTED with Syrian civilians affected by conflict. Mr Motka was released in May. He said he had been tortured and moved six times. Afterwards, an ACTED spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts go towards all of those, humanitarian workers and journalists among others, still held hostage in Syria and throughout the world.’ Threat: The 44-year-old is now facing murder at the hands of ISIS, who captured him in March 2013 . One of Mr Haines’s former colleagues said when she saw the IS video: ‘My heart went into my throat.’ Tiffany Easthom, the South Sudan country director for Nonviolent Peaceforce, added: ‘I just felt ill. ‘He was hard working, very caring and had a good sense of humour. He decided, when he finished with the military, he still wanted to contribute, so he did it from a civilian perspective working for NGOs. ‘He decided to contribute to the humanitarian world from the civilian perspective. ‘He was up for the challenge. He was willing to sleep in tents and build compounds in the jungle for our team. A fellow he was abducted with was released a couple of months ago. We were hopeful that he would be released soon.’ She said Mr Haines was ‘very familiar with insecure locations’. Describing her former colleague’s appearance in the IS video, she said: ‘He looks thinner. I guess that’s not surprising, but it’s a pretty horrible thing. ‘This is a conflict that has taken on a whole new level of brutality that we haven’t seen before. ‘Let’s just hope that there’s a positive outcome for David and everyone else who doesn't have their freedom.’","Father-of-two has spent two decades working in war zones around world .

"Suzi Smith (above) has admitted falsely accusing Jonathan Coupland, 53, of attacking his six-year-old child in an official custody case note – which led to him being handcuffed in front of neighbours and thrown into a cell . A social worker who accused an innocent father of abusing his daughter has claimed the police put pressure on her to stand by the lie. Suzi Smith has admitted falsely accusing Jonathan Coupland, 53, of attacking his six-year-old child in an official custody case note – which led to him being handcuffed in front of neighbours and thrown into a cell. After the Mail revealed the case earlier this year, Mrs Smith was brought before a disciplinary hearing this week over her behaviour. Mrs Smith, who worked for Cafcass, the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, which represents children in the family courts, admitted writing the damning note but claimed she later tried to retract the allegation – only to be put under huge strain by the police to stick to her story. ‘At the earliest opportunity, I repeatedly tried to correct this,’ she told the Health and Care Professions Council. ‘I would not give in to pressure. I would not submit to pressure placed on me to exaggerate or lie.’ Asked who was putting pressure on her, she replied: ‘I was under pressure at that police station ... to exaggerate or confirm what I had written.’ Mrs Smith said officers were determined to act on the claims because the Lincolnshire unit had previously been ‘lambasted’ by a judge for poor handling of another child protection issue. ‘They were not listening to what I was saying,’ she added. Mr Coupland, a former painter and decorator, raised his daughter, now eight, alone in Spalding, Lincolnshire. He was granted custody shortly after her birth, but his former partner, a Thai illegal immigrant, has fought him through the courts. Mrs Smith made a home visit in January 2012 and wrote the case note while she was ‘really, really angry’, claiming she saw Mr Coupland stroking his daughter inappropriately – which he has always denied and she now admits was not true. Mrs Smith allegedly lied in a fit of pique after the single father criticised her handling of the case. She then waited three months to tell authorities about what she claimed she saw. Mr Coupland was arrested at home on suspicion of sexual assault and questioned for about ten hours, and officers threatened to put his daughter in temporary care. A day later, he was informed there would be no further action after Mrs Smith was interviewed and backtracked on her claims. Cafcass, which is funded by the Department of Justice, sacked Mrs Smith and has paid Mr Coupland £86,000 in damages. Mrs Smith told the hearing she did not mean to implicate Mr Coupland but misunderstood what she had seen. She said when she realised her mistake she tried to put the record straight. She added: ‘I sincerely apologise to the father.’ Last night Mr Coupland told the Mail: ‘I was arrested for sexually assaulting the most precious thing in my life ... Once you are tarred with that brush, that is it. People where I live think I am a paedophile. ‘I want answers from the police. I want to know why they put pressure on Suzi Smith to lie. I don’t accept her apology in any way. No parent or child should go through what my family has gone through.’ Lincolnshire Police said it was ‘duty bound to investigate’ the initial report of sexual assault, but added: ‘We will approach the individual concerned and will investigate any complaints.’ Panel chairman Stephen Fash said Mrs Smith had ‘overstated’ what she thought she had observed. The panel found she made the false allegation, but did not do so dishonestly. It will decide whether she is guilty of misconduct at a later hearing.","Suzi Smith has admitted falsely accusing Jonathan Coupland, 53, of attacking his six-year-old child .

"It was in a perfect location with easy access and no other takers.

"Equality: Ben Bradshaw said the Anglican talent pool is drying up while the Church has a high number of women who would make 'first-class' bishops . The Church of England is running out of male priests good enough to be bishops, a senior Labour MP said yesterday. Former Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw said the Anglican talent pool is drying up while the Church has a high number of women who would make first-class bishops. He spoke during a Westminster debate in which MPs warned the Church of England not to delay any longer in its progress towards allowing women to be consecrated as bishops. Mr Bradshaw said in a Westminster Hall debate that there were rumours that the Church had run out of credible candidates worthy of promotion. He said: ‘We have a great bunch of bishops and they do a fantastic job in the House of Lords, but one does hear sort of rumours that we are getting to the end of our talent pool when it comes to male suffragans who we can promote up into diocesan bishops. ‘That is certainly not the case when it comes to our senior women clergy. And there are many senior women clergy, who I can imagine, would make absolutely first-class bishops.’ The CofE has been under political pressure to speed the appointment of women bishops since the autumn of 2012, when conservative evangelicals in its parliament, the General Synod, succeeding in wrecking Church laws to remove the block on the promotion of women. David Cameron said at the time that the Church needed a ‘sharp prod’ and other MPs threatened that Parliament would force the CofE’s hand. A speed-up of Church legislation now means the first women bishops may be appointed by the end of the years. Labour Shadow Culture Minister Helen Goodman told MPs in the debate yesterday that Parliament would not settle for an ‘indefinite delay’ on the consecration of female bishops. Labour Shadow Culture Minister Helen Goodman said the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby had 'managed this situation quite brilliantly and has shown a very deft touch' She told Tory Sir Tony Baldry, who speaks for the Church in the Commons, said: ‘We want to offer our full support to you, as second Church Estates Commissioner, in the message that Parliament is not content to see indefinite delay. ‘We are 100 per cent behind you in giving that message to the Church.’ Miss Goodman added that the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby had ‘managed this situation quite brilliantly and has shown a very deft touch.’ Sir Tony warned MPs that although the Synod was set to approve women bishops, there would need to be primary legislation in Parliament before they could legally be appointed.","Ben Bradshaw said many women in the Church are 'first-class candidates .

"A ‘despicable’ mother who battered her toddler son to death was jailed for just 11 years yesterday and could be free within seven after she avoided being tried for murder. Rosdeep Adekoya beat three-year-old Mikaeel Kular for being sick and left him to die in agony before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods. She then told police the boy had wandered off, sparking a huge manhunt before she eventually led police to the body. Guilty: Rosdeep Adekoya, 34, (left) has been jailed for 11 years for killing her son Mikaeel Kular (right), three . Investigation: Police swept the family home after finding Mikaeel's body stashed in a suitcase in a remote wood . Mikaeel’s father Zahid Saeed told the Daily Mail: ‘Her actions were despicable and she is wicked.’ But Adekoya, 34, avoided a murder trial and the possibility of a life sentence of up to 35 years after a court accepted her guilty plea to the lesser charge of culpable homicide. The 11-year sentence means the party-mad single mother – who had frequently left her children alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine – could be out within seven years. It provoked a furious reaction from her neighbours, many of whom had helped scour the streets in the hope of finding Mikaeel alive after she said he had disappeared in Edinburgh last January. Some local people claimed the decision to avoid a murder trial had been taken to protect the police and social services, whose failings were never heard in court as a result. Social services have been widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers, but on both occasions was handed back to his neglectful and abusive mother. Five thousand local residents have signed a petition protesting at the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against Adekoya, who had five children. They claimed the violence to which she subjected the toddler and her failure to call an ambulance justified a murder charge. A neighbour to Adekoya, Julie Macleod, who started the petition, said: ‘There are lot of people at fault here, social services being one of them, and they have questions to answer. ‘By not having a trial and with no one from social services in the stands, they are avoiding being scrutinised. ‘At the end of the day, the sentence is not enough. I have to go home and explain to my teenage daughter that the woman who killed the child we went out searching for day and night will only go to prison for at most 11 years.’ In Kirkcaldy, Fife, where Mikaeel’s body was found in woods behind Adekoya’s sister’s house, neighbours also expressed their outrage. Attack: Adekoya, 34, (left) repeatedly beat Mikaeel (right) when they were on a family day out in Scotland . Trauma: Mikaeel's father Zahid Saeed leaving court after watching Adekoya admit to killing his son . One said: ‘She should definitely have been tried for murder. It is just disgusting.’ Their anger deepened when Adekoya’s defence QC Brian McConnachie dismissed those who had signed the petition as ‘an ill-informed mob’. Mr McConnachie told the High Court in Edinburgh: ‘No sentence will be deemed sufficient by what appears to be an ill-informed mob who are no doubt at this moment waiting impatiently to express their outrage and indignation.’ Mikaeel and his twin sister were twice taken into foster care by social workers in Fife, but were handed back to their mother. Authorities were repeatedly warned about her neglect, including that she was leaving them home alone while she partied for days at a time with drug dealers. It also emerged that when she moved to Edinburgh from Kirkcaldy last summer she was allowed to slip off the radar as social workers and police in the city were not informed. Officials in Fife neglected to tell those in Edinburgh and stopped monitoring the family in December 2013, weeks before the boy’s death. An independent significant-case review is to be held. Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham thanked the community for searching for Mikaeel . Jailed: Adekoya pleaded guilty to culpable homicide for the attack which took place during a family holiday . A social services whistleblower told the Mail that Mikaeel would still be alive but for the incompetence of social workers. The whistleblower said: ‘Rosie couldn’t cope with looking after them. In 2012 she had taken an overdose. There were constant cries for help from her like this. ‘They were not properly monitored after they moved. There was no communication, so Edinburgh did not even have a file on them when Mikaeel went missing.’ The court previously heard that Mikaeel died on the night of Tuesday, January 14, from injuries inflicted three days earlier when Adekoya battered him for being unwell. She lost her temper when he was repeatedly sick following a trip to a Nando’s restaurant in Edinburgh. She smacked him and struck him on the body and head with her fist, the court heard. When Mikaeel was sick for a third time, she dragged him to the shower by his arms and beat him heavily on his back as he lay over the bath edge. Over the next few days Mikaeel’s condition worsened and he was kept off nursery. He was assaulted again on the Monday after being sick and became listless. On the Wednesday morning she found his body on the floor and instead of calling 999, took his twin sister to nursery before taking his body in a suitcase in the boot of her car to Kirkcaldy, 25 miles away. She hid Mikaeel’s body in the woods and then fabricated a story suggesting he had been abducted. Her claims sparked a huge two-day search in freezing weather. But following inconsistencies in her account of events she eventually led police to the woods. Mikaeel had more than 40 separate injuries to his body. Reports prepared for the case found that Adekoya had suffered from depression for some time, particularly in the last few months before Mikaeel’s death, as she found herself ‘overwhelmed’ by her circumstances. Her internet search history in the weeks before his death had included: ‘I find it hard to love my son’, ‘I love all of my children except one’, ‘Why am I so aggressive with my son’ and ‘Get rid of bruises’. Horrific: She smacked the three-year-old (right) and punched him with a clenched fist, the court heard . Hidden: She hid Mikaeels' body in a case, drove it 25 miles to Fife (pictured), and reported him missing to police . Judge Lord Glennie, passing sentence, said that while battering her son to death was cruel and inexcusable, it was clear Adekoya did not intend to kill him and was ‘not even aware that death was a possibility until it happened’. John Dunn, Procurator Fiscal for the East of Scotland, said: ‘There can be few crimes more shocking than a parent killing their child. ‘Having considered all the evidence in the case, including that of expert pathologists, Crown Counsel concluded that pleas of guilty to charges of culpable homicide and attempting to defeat the ends of justice were appropriate.’ Father who saw his son just three times . MIkaeel’s father was criticised in court yesterday as it was revealed he had only seen his son three times during the boy’s lifetime. Zahid Saeed, a 30-year-old chef, had said that Rosdeep Adekoya should ‘suffer every day’ after what she had done. Mr Saeed, from Fife, told the Mail the decision to allow Adekoya to plead guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide was a disgrace. He said it was an ‘insult’ to his son that his former partner was not tried for murder. But the court heard that Mikaeel’s father had seen him and his twin sister only three times and had never sent them a birthday card. This was despite Mr Saeed promising Adekoya he would be there for the family, emotionally and financially, to persuade her not to abort the pregnancy after she discovered she was expecting twins. The hearing was told Mr Saeed had given a victim impact statement to the court, but defence QC Brian McConnachie urged the judge, Lord Glennie, not to consider it. Mr McConnachie said that the statement contained inaccuracies and that Mr Saeed didn’t have much of a role in bringing up Mikaeel, seeing the twins a total of only three times. He added: ‘Mr Saeed has seen fit to express his views in the media about what should happen to Mrs Adekoya. ‘There is a fiction in the mind of Mr Saeed. His contact with the twins was, to be generous to him, minimal. ‘Mr Saeed never sent them a birthday card and never supported them financially.’ Mr McConnachie said the relationship between Mr Saeed and Adekoya was fraught with difficulties and, looking back, was destined for failure from the start. When they started dating after Adekoya split from her husband, Mr Saeed was in a relationship with a woman who was pregnant by him. As a result, the relationship was disapproved of by Adekoya’s family and she became estranged from them. Despite her mother’s disapproval, the party-girl carried on dating Mr Saeed and became pregnant. Mr Saeed is understood to be fighting for custody of Mikaeel’s twin.","Rosdeep Adekoya, 34, pleaded guilty to culpable homicide after killing son .

"Lady Hale, Deputy President of the Supreme Court said the law does not show enough respect for Christian beliefs . The law does not show enough respect for the beliefs of Christians, one of the country’s most senior judges said yesterday. They have lost out in the courts while other faiths with stricter codes of behaviour, dress and diet have been able to win, said Lady Hale, Deputy President of the Supreme Court. Lady Hale called for the law to take a new and less hardline attitude to the right of Christians to live by their beliefs when, for example, they want to wear a cross at work, or turn away gay couples from their hotels. The current discrimination laws that have ruled against the rights of Christians in test cases are not ‘sustainable in the long run’, she argued. Lady Hale’s analysis, given in a lecture at Yale Law School and published yesterday, suggested a new religious settlement might be based on the idea that the law should show ‘reasonable accommodation’ for religious belief. This would mean in effect that Christians could ignore gay rights laws or demand to wear crosses at work – as long as they were polite about it. Failed court cases include that of hoteliers Peter and Hazelmary Bull, who refused to let a room to a gay couple because they only accepted married couples, and that of nurse Shirley Chaplin, who lost her claim to wear a cross on the wards. Lady Hale herself was among the Supreme Court judges who rejected the arguments of the hotelkeepers, declaring that discrimination against gay people is an ‘affront to their dignity as human beings’. But she said in her US speech that Christians lose in court because they cannot claim that their faith demands they follow strict rules. ‘It is not difficult to see why the Christians feel that their religious beliefs are not being sufficiently respected,' she said. ‘Other religions with stricter dress codes or dietary laws are demanding concessions which Christians feel that it is harder to claim because they cannot point to equivalent religious requirements.’ She added: ‘The Church of England is a very undemanding Church. It has no dietary laws, no dress codes for men and women, and very little that its members can say is actually required of them by way of observance.’ Citing cases in Europe and Canada, she said there were precedents to allow Christians more room to follow their beliefs. Lady Hale of the Supreme Court (pictured) said: 'Other religions with stricter dress codes or dietary laws are demanding concessions which Christians feel that it is harder to claim because they cannot point to equivalent religious requirements' ‘Would it not be a great deal simpler if we required the providers of employment, goods and services to make reasonable accommodation for the religious beliefs of others? 'We can get this out of the European Court of Human Rights approach but not out of our anti-discrimination law. ‘I find it hard to believe that the hardline EU law approach to direct discrimination can be sustainable in the long run.’ In her speech she spoke of a Canadian case in which a couple who ran a bed and breakfast house and turned away gay guests lost in court only because of ‘the offensive manner of the cancellation’. ‘This is not an approach which is permitted to us in the United Kingdom,’ she said. ‘But I am not sure how comfortable I would be with the sort of balancing exercise required by the Canadian approach. ‘It is fascinating that a country with an established Church can be less respectful of religious feelings than one without.’ Other senior judges, including appeal judge Lord Justice Laws and family judge Sir James Munby, have said Christians cannot expect special treatment in the courts. Other high-profile cases involving Christians include registrar Lillian Ladele, who lost her job because she would not conduct civil partnership ceremonies and Relate counsellor Gary McFarlane, dismissed because he would not give sex advice to gay couples.","Lady Hale, Deputy President of the Supreme Court has called for the law to take a less hardline attitude to the right of Christians to live by their beliefs .

"Outrage: BBC Director General Tony Hall, pictured, pledged to cap payout deals following public anger at the amount spent on redundancy packages . The BBC has paid out more than £10million to staff in golden goodbyes over the last decade before giving them new jobs at the corporation. The cost of the ‘revolving door’ payroll emerged only days after the BBC was made exempt from a government crackdown on the practice. NHS bosses and council leaders were last week told they would be stripped of their ‘unfair’ redundancy packages if they were later rehired. But the BBC was not included in the legislation to ‘protect its independence’, despite repeated criticism of the huge severance deals handed to departing members of staff. The revelation about the extent of spending on rehired staff will heap further pressure on bosses at the corporation to explain the use of licence fee money. Figures from the corporation revealed that 286 full-time staff made redundant in the last 12 years and re-employed on permanent or fixed-term contracts received £10,230,905 in payouts. Although the average payment was just under £36,000, some senior figures have been re-employed despite receiving payoffs of up to £365,000, . The BBC last night defended the payouts, claiming it has strict rules in place preventing recently departed staff from being employed again. Contracted staff are not allowed to be employed for a year after their initial employment has ended, while freelance staff must wait three months. However, the corporation’s head of human resources or three directors can bypass these rules in ‘exceptional circumstances’. The BBC has not disclosed how many times such exceptional cases have been permitted. TaxPayers’ Alliance director John O’Connell accused the BBC of ‘wasteful behaviour’. He said: ‘This lucrative revolving door must grind to a halt. This is a totally inappropriate use of the licence fee and is costing hard-pressed families a pretty penny.’ Under new rules announced by the Treasury last week, officials earning over £100,000 a year who take another job in the same public sector area within a year will have to pay back their redundancy package. But exceptions were made in the cases of the BBC, Bank of England and the Armed Forces. Back in the building: Almost 300 employees who were made redundant in the last 12 years were given redundancy payouts totalling more than £10million, but were later re-hired on permanent or fix-term contracts . Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘In acknowledgement of its independence from Government, the BBC is not subject to the clawback measures I announced last week. ‘However, I am writing separately to the BBC to explain the measures we have put in place. People will expect it to have in place measures at least as stringent as the ones I announced and that they will be implemented rigorously.’ Criticism of the six-figure salaries routinely handed to senior BBC figures led to Tony Hall capping severance payments at £150,000 last year. A National Audit Report in 2013 found senior BBC managers received a total of £25million in severance deals between 2009 and 2012. Embattled director general George Entwistle was given a £470,000 severance deal after resigning in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal despite completing only 54 days of work. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Our rules are stricter than the civil service and during a 12-year period it is inevitable that a small number of staff will leave and re-join the BBC.’","Almost 300 employees made redundant since 2002 were later re-hired .

"A boy who was left blind in one eye after years of neglect by his mother and her partner was so desperate he once scrawled ‘help me’ on a wall at home. But despite the vulnerable child’s plea, the authorities repeatedly missed opportunities to intervene. The 12-year-old was left in squalor with his baby sister while his mother, who lives on benefits, and her boyfriend were ‘too busy’ to notice his failing health. Social workers and police found squalid conditions in the family's home and the boy had written 'save me' on one wall in an apparent cry for help . The 12-year-old boy was kept in a filthy, fly-infested house in Thornaby, near Stockton, Teesside . Gillian Hendry and Craig Dick were jailed last month for neglect after Hendry's son went blind in one eye . Gillian Hendry and Craig Dick, both 34, were jailed for child cruelty last month for allowing the children to live in appalling, fly-infested conditions. But a report has revealed that the wretchedness of the youngsters’ lives had been flagged up on numerous occasions by school staff and health workers as far back as 2007 – and was not acted on. The pair were finally removed from their home in Thornaby, Teesside, last year, when a social worker noticed the words ‘help me’ written on a wall outside the boy’s bedroom. Hendry admitted to a social worker that her son had written the message when officials first paid a visit to the property. The unnamed boy developed a cataract in one eye after his parents failed to take him to hospital appointments that could have saved his sight. He had also been walking with a limp after developing arthritis from living in the filthy and mouldy property, and was forced to look after his two-year-old sister. The report into the case stated that worries were first raised about the boy, now 12, when he was six years old . The missed opportunities in the case emerged after a Serious Case Review was called into the boy's treatment . The report, compiled by a social worker tasked with investigating the case, revealed that a series of chances to help the children were missed. Issues about the boy’s cleanliness and attendance were first raised in 2007 by his primary school, but social services decided not to intervene. Hospital consultant Dr Fiona Clark warned in 2009 that the boy’s failure to attend appointments could leave him permanently disabled but social services again failed to visit. They finally acted when a school nurse went to the property in 2010 and found the child in a mouse-infested home with no heating or hot water. But a subsequent visit by council staff determined that conditions had significantly improved and the case was closed. Fears were raised by Dr Clark again after the child moved to a different property in September 2011. But when school staff said they had no further concerns, welfare officers decided not to carry out an assessment. Following yet another warning from the consultant, social workers visited the home eight months later – but declared it acceptable without even looking at the children’s rooms. It was not until the intervention of a GP last year that officials grasped the full horror of the child’s health problems. Photographs taken during a third and final inspection of the properties where the boy lived show the conditions . Photographs taken by inspectors show the appalling state of the family home . A serious case review has already been launched by the Stockton Local Safeguarding Children Board to look at the incident. Alex Cunningham, Labour MP for Stockton North, said: ‘This has been a tragic situation for this young boy and it is clear that there needs to be a full and detailed inquiry into why he was let down.’ Middlesbrough Council said the case was closed following improvements in the child’s home life and school attendance.","Repeated concerns raised about boy's hygiene by doctors and school staff .

"'Make us a brew’ and ‘I’m starved’ are well known and understood phrases in Britain - but they do not tend to be taught in English lessons. As a result, foreign nurses in the NHS are having such difficulty understanding some patients they are being sent on intensive courses to help them understand local dialects. Greek and Italian staff recruited to work at Wolverhampton’s New Cross Hospital are to be sent on the courses after struggling to grasp the strong local dialect. Foreign nurses at Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital are to be sent on a course where they will learn the local dialect because they are struggling to understand patients with strong Black Country accents . The nurses are fluent in English, but the distinctive dialect in the Black Country has left them baffled. As a result, nearly 80 staff will be sent on a six week course at the University of Wolverhampton to be versed in local sayings like ‘bostin’ which means ‘great’ and ‘I cor’ for ‘I can’t’. David Loughton, chief executive of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, said it made sense to teach the nurses some Black Country language. He said: ‘You can teach English to people overseas but the dialect needs to be taught here. The nurses will learn phrases such as 'make us a brew' while they are on the six week course . ‘It just makes sense to do it. The English they know is probably not the language they’ll get thrown at them in hospital. ‘Even the ones that are proficient in English will have to do some further education in terms of the Black Country dialect.’ University spokesman James Allen said the university was more than happy to tweak their lessons a touch to add a bit of local flavour. He added: ‘It won’t be a case of ‘I cor do that’ they’ll soon be asking ‘ow bist yow?’ ‘We’re proud to be working with the hospital in providing English classes to their new nursing staff. ‘As part of that we’ll be teaching the nurses the nuances of the Black Country dialect, which they will need when dealing with patients.’ Initially nurses were going to be hired from India, China and the Philippines because of a shortage of qualified nurses in the UK, but this soon changed to southern Europe. The nurses will be paid a salary of £21,500, as is consistent with NHS guidelines. The recruitment drive follows criticism for the trust from national health body the Care Quality Commission. They demanded action be taken after a hospital inspection revealed that at night there was just one registered nurse for every 10 patients.

"A dog breeder who nearly died after being savaged by his own pets has been arrested after the animals went on another violent rampage. Stephen Potts had to have his arm amputated when two of his American bulldogs turned on him during a frenzied attack last month. The 48-year-old was arrested today, only days after returning home from hospital, when his animals attacked three people. Scroll down for video . Stephen Potts pictured at his home today with his pet 6-year-old American bulldog called Buster . Just hours before the attack, Potts declared his love for the animals and insisted that they were not to blame for the horrific injuries he suffered during the ‘freak incident’. But another incident involving his animals unfolded today as Potts was walking six of them, which can weigh up to 60kg. The violence began when his pets are said to have pounced on another dog that was being walked by its owner. The dog-walker was in a serious condition in hospital after Potts’s dogs turned on him during the incident, while a woman was also injured. Another woman who was standing nearby the scene of the attack was also receiving treatment last night after one of the dogs pounced on her. Potts was saved following extensive surgery last month after his dogs turned on him when they were spooked by loud fireworks. Mr Potts pictured at his home in Durham. He lost his arm after being attacked by his own dogs last month . The two animals involved in the incident, which he had owned for six years, were killed by police immediately after. But Potts still houses 14 dogs in kennels beside his home in Pittington, Durham, despite the recent attack in which he was dragged around the ground screaming. The powerful breed is not banned, unlike American pitt bulls. Onlookers tried to stop the powerful animals mauling Potts by striking them with golf clubs and spades, with one neighbour even driving into them in a car. A huge search operation involving a police helicopter was launched for the dangerous animals when they let go of Potts and ran away. Speaking yesterday before the incident which led to his arrest, Potts reflected on his injuries and said: ‘I still love my pets.’ ‘I’ve lost an arm and I very nearly lost my life but I won’t have anyone blame the dogs for what happened,’ he said. ‘As far as I’m concerned the worst thing that happened was that they had to be destroyed.’ The father-of-two nearly lost his left arm in the incident as well and credits a local anaesthetist for keeping him alive until an ambulance arrived. ‘I still have 14 American bulldogs and I just want people to know it wasn’t the fault of the dogs or the breed, my dogs are big but they’re good natured, this was a freak incident,’ he said. ‘I feel terrible they were destroyed, they were both lovely dogs and I miss them.' He blamed the attack on the explosions from loud fireworks at a nearby hotel that startled the ‘timid’ dogs. Potts said that he did not breed the dogs for money but to help cope with the depression he has suffered after his son committed suicide two years ago. Yesterday’s attack took place in the Belmont area of Durham City at lunchtime. Dogs pictured at Mr Potts' home following the attack in which he lost an arm last month . The 63-year-old victim was taken by ambulance to the University Hospital of North Durham with injuries to his limbs and head. One of the female victims suffered bites to her hand and the other with injuries to her leg. A Durham Constabulary spokesman said: ‘A 48-year-old man from Pittington has been arrested in connection with the incident. ‘He is currently being questioned by officers at Durham City police station.’ The police also confirmed that all the dogs involved had been secured.","Stephen Potts had his arm amputated after he was attacked by his own dogs .

"Council budgets are more difficult to read than some of the most historically complex books ever written . They are some of the most mentally challenging works ever committed to paper. But for those of you who find Isaac Newton’s Principia and Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan a tad too easy, here is some required reading – your local council’s annual budget report. Analysis of local authority documents has found that trying to get your head around your a council’s expenditure can be a much harder task than understanding the laws of gravity. Texts that have puzzled students and caused them untold exam woe for centuries were compared against local authorities’ most recent budgets. It found that some councils’ spending reviews are much harder to get to grips with than weighty texts like Georg Hegel’s The Phenomenology of Spirit and Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time. The report used a series of tests to decipher how many years in education a reader required to fully understand council budgets, measured against classic works of literature, science and philosophy. It found that Newton’s Principia, the scientist’s three-volume tome that detailed the laws of motion and gravitation, required 17.1 years of education. Leviathan, another classic work penned by English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, was a slightly easier read, requiring just 14.7 years in education. But the analysis drew up staggering comparisons with local authorities. It revealed that understanding Kensington and Chelsea’s annual budget required 20.5 years of education, while Redcar and Cleveland’s needed 22.5 years. Transparency campaigners yesterday called for councils to stop using ‘ludicrously difficult’ language in their publications so taxpayers can decipher what funds are being spent on. The study used a variety of algorithms looking at aspects such as average sentence length and the average number of syllables in a word to come up with a difficulty grading. It used excerpts from over 40 council’s most recent budgets, mostly taken from the introductory passages. Councils scored an average of 12.6 years in education, which is still harder to take in than Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time, which scored 11.6 years. Even Isaac Newton's Principia - a three volume tome published in 1687 detailing the laws of gravity - was easier to read than Chelsea and Kensington council's budget report, researchers found . Solihull Council’s annual report was another of those that proved difficult to comprehend, requiring 16.9 years. This was gauged even more troublesome than the first chapter of Georg Hegel’s The Phenomolgy of Spirit, according to the Trinity Mirror research. Andy Silvester, spokesman for the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘How can taxpayers scrutinise Council decisions properly when those decisions are explained in such a complex way? ‘Too many of these documents are ludicrously difficult to understand. ‘Every council must strive to be as transparent as possible, and that means writing in language that everybody can get their head round.’ A Brief History of Time, by Professor Stephen Hawking (left), was easier to read than the average council budget report. It required 11.6 years of education, compared to the average council report that needed 12.6 . Redcar and Cleveland council, whose budget was the most complex to understand, said it is ‘not easy’ for council’s to present their spending figures in an easily digestible form. Councillor Norman Pickthall, cabinet member for corporate resources, said: ‘Clearly any reports which meet the statutory duties placed on us as a council are unlikely to be simple or straightforward reading. ‘We are constantly looking at ways to refine the way we present complicated financial data to our cabinet members, councillors and the public. ‘We always do our best to put things as clearly as possible and will continue to look at ways we can make our budget reporting less complicated in the future.’","Council budgets are more difficult to understand than the laws of gravity .

"Comedian Bobby Davro is at the centre of a bizarre divorce row after his friend’s wife flashed her breasts at him during an alcohol-fuelled internet video call. The comic’s friendship with Marianne Dobson is said to have devastated her husband, former TV magician Wayne Dobson, who is now divorcing his wife of seven years. When Mr Dobson confronted his friend about the incident on Skype, which allows users to make video calls over the internet, the comic said: ‘It’s no big deal.’ Scroll down for video . Comic Bobby Davro, left, is involved in a bitter divorce row involving the wife of his good friend of 30 years - former TV magician Wayne Dobson and his wife Marianne, right . It is thought their friendship has since soured. Davro and Mr Dobson, 57, became friends 30 years ago when they both enjoyed successful TV careers. Davro’s clean-cut routines made him a household name in the 1980s, while Mr Dobson’s Saturday night ITV programme, Wayne Dobson – A Kind of Magic with Linda Lusardi, attracted up to 11million viewers in the 1990s. Davro, 56, who lives with his ex-wife Trudi Jameson, a former topless model, yesterday claimed his relationship with Mrs Dobson was an innocent friendship. He told The Sun: ‘I have spent time with Marianne on my own, I gave her lifts. I’m very fond of Marianne Dobson, I’m very fond of her husband.’ He said he regretted doing ‘something silly’ but said that the incident had nothing to do with the breakdown of the Dobsons’ marriage. Wayne Dobson was a star of Saturday night television in the 1980s with his hit show A Kind Of Magic, but was forced to quit in the 1990s after developing MS. He and wife Marianne married in 2005 after meeting in hospital . He said: ‘The incident has no relevance on my friends’ split and I was terribly sad to see it happen, especially for my friend Wayne.’ Mr Dobson was forced to reduce his workload as a magician after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1988, which has confined him to a wheelchair. He met his wife when he was receiving treatment in hospital. They wed in 2005 and lived in Haslemere, Surrey. Speaking about the incident on Skype, Mrs Dobson, 54, told the Sun: ‘I think we were both really drunk. He [Davro] is just as big a culprit in this too. He is no longer a friend now.’ She blamed the marriage split on her husband’s illness, saying: ‘I could no longer cope with Wayne’s disability. I’ve had breast cancer myself which I’ve just got over.’ Davro had a run of hit Saturday night programmes on ITV including Bobby Davro on The Box, Bobby’s Sketch Pad and TV Weekly. More recently, he appeared in EastEnders as Vinnie Monks in 2008. Davro hit the headlines earlier this year when he performed at Cherie Blair’s 60th birthday party. He usually charges up to £4,000 for public appearances, but waived the fee as a favour for mutual friend Stephen Purdew, owner of Champneys health spa. Video courtesy of Anna Christian Productions.

Reflection: A book of condolence in memory of Alan Henning is displayed in Eccles Parish Church on Sunday . One message attached to Eccles Cross in the town centre read: ‘Whilst we come to terms with this living nightmare, your suffering is over. You leave an irreplaceable gap in all our lives.' ‘A special man with a heart of gold,’ read another. Friends of the father of two – known affectionately as Gadget due to his love of technology - stood on the Greater Manchester town’s quiet streets yesterday sharing stories about him. Anthony Flannery condemned the ‘appalling’ killing and expressed his disappointment that the Government had not done more to free the hostage. Outpouring: One of the tributes placed at the base of the Eccles Cross reads 'We never knew you Alan but you have touched everyone with your selflessness'. Dozens of bouquets were laid alongside it . The retired 64-year-old said: ‘It’s harder to take because he was really doing some good. ‘We really had a little light of hope that he might be coming back, especially when we heard Cameron making a speech about how we don’t give in to terrorists. Mr Flannery added: ‘It’s hard to describe how I feel. It’s like losing a part of yourself.’ He recounted talking to Mr Henning about a previous aid mission to Syria in which he had been shot at but insisted on his desire to go back. Public tribute: Yellow ribbons with the words 'Alan our hero' were tied around Eccles town centre on Sunday . ‘He knew the dangers and he went forward because he was all about helping people. He had a good heart.' Barbara Keeley, MP for Worsley and Eccles South, said that people were still ‘stunned’ by the death and struggled to accept the actions of his killers. She said: ‘They can’t square the fact that he was such a decent person on an aid mission with the savage and barbaric way in which he was killed. How could they do that?’ Muslim groups have responded unanimously to denounce the killings, describing Mr Henning as a ‘British hero’. Memories: One of the floral tributes contained a note that said 'thoughts are with your family' Manchester Central Mosque Iman Asim Hussain yesterday criticised IS, calling them ‘misguided individuals’. A visibly emotional Shameela Islam-Fulfigar, a doctor at Tameside Hospital who was part of the last convoy on which Mr Henning travelled, said: ‘The world lost an honourable and remarkable hero.’ Yesterday she set up an online memorial fund, in consultation with Mrs Henning, aiming to raise £20,000. Dr Islam-Fulfigar said she wanted to show the taxi driver’s children that ‘their father’s death was not in vain and that the work that Alan was so committed to will also continue’.","Mrs Henning and children joined mourners at service in Eccles, Manchester .

"Britain’s hop farmers have been saved due to an overwhelming thirst for American real ale. Sales of the crop have increased by almost 65 per cent in the last four years after decades of decline thanks to the US’s booming ale market. The phenomenal rise in popularity of ‘craft beer’, whereby small-scale brewers market their own drinks, has led many producers to the UK in search of more distinctive flavours. British farmers sold 600 tonnes of hops last year compared to 365 tonnes in 2009, while the price of the ingredient has also increased. British farmers sold 600 tonnes of hops last year thanks to a booming ale market in the US (picture posed by model) The flowers of the hop plant are one of the key components in beer production and different varieties can be used to impart an array of flavours and add bitterness. British hop farmers have struggled with plummeting sales in recent decades due to the popularity of continental lagers and a failure to take advantage of export opportunities within the EU. There are now only 2,500 acres of hop fields in Britain compared to 77,000 acres at the industry’s peak in the 19th century. The US and Germany are now the major hop-growing nations, enjoying around 30 per cent each of the global market. Due to the UK’s milder climate, the country creates hops that give more delicate flavours and can be used to produce beers such as Indian pale ale (pictured, Stone India Pale Ale) But American brewers have sought out British hops, which are milder in flavour and traditionally used in British ales, to distinguish their beers and some producers are increasing their farms as a result. Due to the UK’s milder climate, the country creates hops that give more delicate flavours and can be used to produce beers such as Indian pale ale. Trevor Stirling, a brewing industry analyst with Bernstein Research, said: ‘Craft beer is still growing like a steam train in the States. ‘There’s a definite move in the States to dial down the strength of their beers, which boosts demand for the milder British hops. ‘There are already 2,500 craft ale breweries in America, but I think one can safely say that there are at least five years of good growth left, maybe 10.’ Jim Kuhr, from American’s Matt Brewing Company said the business has been purchasing more and more British hops and he is travelling to the UK on a buying trip next week. ‘I like English hops because of their subtle, earthy quality. They create very drinkable beers,’ he said. ‘The difficulty in America is differentiating your beers from the rest, and using English hops mean we can get away from the piny, citrusy taste of most American craft ales.’","The US has seen a phenomenal rise in popularity of small-scale ‘craft beers’

"Bomb: Vladimir Aust, 19, sometimes built detonators in Newcastle University's communal areas . A racist student who made explosives in his halls of residence and boasted he would 'whiten n******' with peroxide was jailed for two years yesterday. Vladimir Aust, 19, used materials he bought on Amazon for just £22. He watched videos on YouTube explaining how hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) could be detonated and caused small explosions on four occasions. He lied to staff after causing the fire alarm to go off, claiming it was caused by matches, and was found with a knuckle duster and captured on CCTV cameras throwing knives into a communal kitchen table. Police found the HMTD in six plastic boxes in his halls of residence in Newcastle. Aust was arrested in London after the evacuation in June of a bus station and a language school at Newcastle University, where he studied. He had mixed chemicals in his halls and built detonators, sometimes in communal areas. Despite the evacuation, the university did not initially search his room and he explained away the incident by saying he had been lighting matches. The foundation course student posted several racist slurs on a Russian social network, boasting about using peroxide to ‘whiten n******’. He also talked about how his explosions had left him deaf in one ear. He wrote: 'I am f****** concerned to keep this s*** of mine it is f****** dangerous.' Jolyon Perks, prosecuting, told the court  HMTD was a 'primary explosive'. 'The weight of the white powder in the six Tupperware boxes was about 30-60 grams. 'He was a user of the VK website, a Russian equivalent to Facebook. Videos watched by him included igniting tissue with residue of HMTD. 'On the website he was complaining of ringing in his ears and how smoke he had caused in the room was a new record. Equipment: Police searched his bedroom in his halls of residence and found an array of bomb-making tools . 'The defendant was aware of the dangers of keeping HMTD as he referred to it as ""f****** dangerous""'. Richard Horwell, defending, insisted the case involved several misunderstandings. 'He did not know that it was illegal to make or keep HMTD,' he said. 'He was unaware of the danger. He believed it was safe to keep and store this explosive. 'The substance was in his room for many months and he slept a metre from it. 'None of the videos speak of the dangers of HMTD or any other explosive. 'The reference about how he should whiten n****** with peroxide, it is a remark from a film called I am Sky. It is a cult film and it is nothing to do with this offence. 'He was just 18 when he committed the offence. As a young boy he enjoyed playing with science kits and using his microscope. Find: Fire alarms were set off at his Bernicia Halls (pictured), and he told staff he had simply lit a match . 'He worked on the explosives and detonates in full view of students and friends in the in front of the university CCTV camera. 'He wanted to cause safe, small explosions. There is not one piece of evidence of these causing any damage. 'This was just an interest, one interest among many. It was not in any way an obsession.' But Mr Justice Coulson told Newcastle Crown Court  Aust was dangerous. The court heard he had wanted to join the Territorial Army but was barred as a foreign national. He admitted one count of making explosives at an earlier hearing. Aust, who was brought up in Moscow, received credit for his age, showing remorse and his previous good character.","Police found six plastic containers of explosives in Vladimir Aust's room .

"Police today continued to scour the banks of a canal for signs of missing schoolgirl Alice Gross, who vanished in west London 11 days ago. Officers were seen patrolling the banks of a waterway in Hanwell, west London, near where 14-year-old Alice lived. Yesterday a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder - the second arrest in connection with her disappearance. It came as it emerged officers are also looking into the girl's social media profiles, including a website at the centre of bullying claims. Scroll down for video . Divers: Police specialists searched under the water of the Grand Union Canal, near where Alice Gross went missing . Appeal: Police and Alice's parents have begged for information on the missing girl's location . Investigation: It emerged last night that officers are looking at the online profiles of the trouble teenager . Another man, 25, arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday, also remained in custody. Both were being held at a west London police station. The Metropolitan Police said the two arrests were 'independent' of each other. The force tweeted: ‘Despite two arrests following Alice Gross disappearance, all lines of enquiry still open & this remains a missing person investigation.' As divers yesterday continued to search the waterway, officers looked at the online profile of the troubled teenager, who had dropped to about six stone as she battled anorexia. Of particular interest is the Latvia-based chat room Ask.fm, where Alice responded to hundreds of questions from other anonymous users. The website has been heavily criticised for its lack of regulation and cyberbullying and linked to the suicides of at least 12 young people – including Izzy Dix, 14, who hanged herself after suffering months of abuse. Many of the questions faced by Alice were deeply personal, including potential boyfriends, sex, weight and her appearance. Online profile: Alice Gross, 14, from Hanwell, West London, was a prolific user of social network sites . Hunt: Police were today searching for Alice Gross by this canal in Hanwell, west London - the last place she was seen . Search: Officers were combing the area near these canal boats. Two men have been arrested over the disappeance . Hunt: Police were today searching for Alice Gross by this canal in Hanwell, west London - the last place she was seen . Dinghy: A sniffer dog is pictured with search teams yesterday as they continued to search the waterway . Search: Divers are today due to resume their search of a half-mile stretch of the Grand Union Canal in Ealing . Asked what she would 'change about herself', she replies in a video filmed in her bedroom: 'Everything'. 'Maybe I would keep my eyes because I like the colour of my eyes but that is it,' she said. 'I hate everything else, really hate everything else about me. I would change everything, I'm so ugly.' Police have seized the talented singer's computer from her home to examine her prolific use of sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Skype and the messaging application Kik. There are numerous 'selfie' photos showing how painfully thin Alice has become. One picture of her almost concave stomach in February prompted a series of questions on Ask.fm, which has more than 70 million users. Last sighting: Alice was last seen walking along a canal towpath near her west London home 11 days ago. Above, a CCTV camera captured images of the teenager walking along the towpath near Brentford Lock . Missing: Asked on Ask.fm what she would 'change about herself', Alice (pictured above) replied: 'Everything' To the query 'How long did it take you to a get a flat stomach?' Alice replied: 'I still don't have one yet.' Last year the mother of Izzy Dix called for Ask.fm to be closed down after the teenager suffered vile taunts, insults and cruel remarks. Hannah Smith, 14, also took her own life after enduring months of bullying on the website. Following an outcry Ask.fm announced measures including a higher-profile button for reporting bullying and a pledge to respond within 24 hours. Scandal website: Of particular interest to detectives is the Latvia-based chat room Ask.fm (pictured), where Alice responded to hundreds of questions from other anonymous users . It also vowed to set up a separate website for parents to find out more about Ask.fm and hire more site moderators. No-one from the firm was available to comment last night. Divers are today due to resume their search of a half-mile stretch of the Grand Union Canal in Ealing, west London. Two police dinghies could yesterday be seen on the waters as dog handlers searched undergrowth and were seen at her £850,000 home in Hanwell, less than a mile away. Family: The teenager's mother, teacher Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said Alice may have been going on long walks by herself. Above, Ms Hodgkiss is pictured with Alice's father Jose Gross (left) and sister Nina Gross (right) Alice was last seen on August 28. A CCTV camera captured images of the teenager near Brentford Lock and police are now appealing for five cyclists who pass her in the footage to get in touch.

"Kieran Clough, who used a fake name to contact a teenager of Facebook, despite being banned from using the web as part of a sexual prevention order imposed on him . A mother who posed as her teenage daughter to trap an online pervert reacted in fury yesterday as judges refused for a second time to send him to prison. Kieran Clough, 24, had planned to meet the woman’s 15-year-old daughter, after sending her explicit messages online. He was on his way to see the girl, armed with a knuckle duster, a police baton, a book on sex toys and a bottle of vodka, when he was arrested by officers who had been alerted by the mother. But despite being warned that Clough was ‘at high risk of reoffending’, a judge let him off with a supervision order. Months after avoiding a jail term, Clough contacted another young girl online, posing as a teenager called Bella. He was caught out, but the garage worker has been allowed to walk free by a judge yet again. The first victim’s mother expressed her anger at the ‘lenient’ criminal justice system and called for Clough to be jailed to protect other children. She said he would prey on young girls ‘again and again’ if judges only gave him a ‘slap on the wrist’. Using a fake name, Clough had tried to lure the woman’s daughter into meeting him by sending her intimate pictures of himself on Facebook and offering to buy her presents in return for sex. But his plan was foiled when the horrified mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, found the messages and arranged a meeting, pretending to be her daughter. The mother, from Wearside, said: 'I knew he would do it again. 'The sentence he got was too lenient in the first place. 'He was supposed to be banned from using the internet but unless somebody is there with him 24/7 it is easy for it to happen again. 'It makes me realise there there is something wrong with the system for him to go out and do it again. He is a very dangerous boy.' Durham Crown Court heard that despite being subject to the order and three-year community supervision, Clough, posing as ‘Bella Swinton’, contacted the 14-year-old girl via social media in August. He claimed to know her and asked her to send a photo of her bedroom, ‘to ensure she was on her own’. Katherine Dunn, prosecuting, told the court how Clough exchanged messages with the girl for two weeks, before eventually revealing ‘Bella’ was really a boy and telling her to delete their conversations. Miss Dunn said the girl asked if he was ‘that paedo arrested last year’ and Clough agreed, saying it had been ‘a mistake’. But the girl told her mother and Clough was arrested by police. The mother of the 15-year-old girl (both are pictured in silhouette to protect their identities) who was groomed online by Kieran Clough has said she 'knew he would do it again' He refused to give officers the password to his phone or computer and to answer their questions. Miss Dunn added: 'This was deliberate contact, targeting a young girl, aware of her age and identity, directly flouting the terms of the previous order.' Clough admitted breaching the order and has remained in custody since his arrest on August 11. Tony Davis, defending, told the court how Clough has a hearing impediment which requires him to lip read, and this may have partly caused his social immaturity. Mr Davis said: 'Clearly the behaviour in the original case was more serious than this. 'But, it has brought about what everyone was trying to avoid, namely the incarceration of this young man for more than two months now. 'Contacting girls younger than him, under the age of 16, was something of a pre-occupation, but that was because of his inability to form relationships with girls his own age.' Durham Crown Court heard that despite being the subject of a sexual prevention order, Clough posed as 'Bella Swinton' to contact the girl on Facebook . Recorder Jeremy Hill-Baker said as Clough has spent more than two months in custody he could impose a three-year community supervision order during which he will undergo intensive sex offender treatment work. He was also made subject of a new sexual prevention order, and must register as a sex offender, both for five years. It was last year that the mother of Clough’s first victim discovered the older man had been attempting to groom her daughter for sex via Facebook. She said was horrified to overhear her young daughter telling friends she had been to meet a 21-year-old man she had been speaking to on Facebook - and then demanded to see the messages between them. She spoke of how she was sickened to read the sexually explicit exchanges between her impressionable daughter and Clough - who knew the girl was 15 all along. The mother intercepted the messages and arranged a meeting with the Clough. He turned up with a car full of weapons and a book about sex and was arrested. When officers searched the garage worker’s home and found a stash of over 900 child porn images and seven movies on his computer. He admitted grooming, possessing indecent photographs of children and having offensive weapons, but walked free from Newcastle Crown Court last September.","Kieran Clough groomed a 15-year-old girl last year but was spared jail .

"Bloodied: Paul Kohler was left with 'life changing' injuries following the brutal attack at his family home . A top legal academic was savagely beaten when he answered the door of his £2million home to a gang of knife-wielding robbers. Father of four Paul Kohler, 55, suffered life-changing facial injuries after four masked men leapt on him screaming, ‘Where’s the money?’ The university lecturer desperately tried to fight off the ‘sadistic’ attackers as they hit his wife and attempted to hood her and tie her to a chair with gaffer tape. He was probably saved from a worse fate thanks to his daughter who locked herself in her bedroom after hearing the commotion and dialled 999. Police raced to the property where they arrested one blood-soaked suspect and another as he cowered underneath a parked car nearby. Police are still hunting for the two remaining suspects, who are believed to be in their 20s or 30s and of eastern European heritage. They are also looking for a silver VW two-door cabriolet car used as a getaway vehicle. Detective Inspector Dan O’Sullivan, who is leading the inquiry, said the house was left ‘covered in blood’ in the most brutal assault he has seen in more than 20 years of policing. Detectives believe Monday night’s robbery – as the family played a board game – was well-planned and targeted but are perplexed by the motive behind the ultra-violent attack. One line of inquiry is that Mr Kohler, who is head of law at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, is the victim of mistaken identity or that the gang simply struck at the wrong house. A 23-year-old Polish man appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court this morning and was charged with grevious bodily harm and aggravated burglary. He was remanded in custody until August 27 where he will reappear at Kingston Crown Court. Yesterday, a 32-year-old Polish national was remanded in custody at the same court having also been charged with GBH and aggravated burglary. Happy family: Mr Kohler is pictured with, from left, his daughters Eloise and Saskia, wife Samantha and daughters Bethany and Tamara. He is currently undergoing operations in hospital to rebuild his face . Detective Inspector Dan O'Sullivan, of Merton Burglary Squad, said: 'The victim and his family are distraught and they cannot understand why they were targeted in this way. We believe that the motive for this horrendous crime is purely for financial gain, and the attackers thought there was cash within the property. 'The level of violence used is unprecedented for this borough, and I'm appealing to anyone who was in the area between 21:00-23:00hrs to come forward and speak to us if they heard or saw anything suspicious. We are also seeking information regarding a silver car the suspects may have used. 'The fast response to the 999 call ensured that two suspects were apprehended and the victim could receive immediate first aid. 'I must stress that this appears to be an isolated incident, and such cases are thankfully rare. However, this serious attack is now subject of a meticulous enquiry whilst we work to support individuals affected by the events and the local community. Officers are currently conducting high visibility patrols and speaking to residents to answer their concerns.' Mr Kohler remained in hospital where he has already undergone six operations to rebuild his face. He will have to have further reconstructive surgery to repair a shattered eye socket and forehead. Couple: Mr Kohler (pictured with his wife Samantha),  is Head of Law at the School of Oriental and African Studies. Last night, Samantha said her husband fought tirelessly to survive, saying: 'He was so brave' Mr Kohler’s wife Samantha MacArthur described the attackers as ‘cowardly and wicked’ and praised her husband’s bravery. The couple married in April in Jesus College Cambridge where their four daughters were bridesmaids. Miss MacArthur, 50, said: ‘This was just totally pointless and totally cruel and cowardly. What sort of men, covering their heads, hold a man down and just beat him for no reason?’ ‘He is amazingly brave. Three men were beating him up and he didn’t stop. He fought the whole way and I’m sure if he hadn’t it would have been a lot worse for all of us. It was incredibly traumatic and we are very angry and upset. We have no idea what has happened. We have no reason.’ The attack took place as the couple played a board game with daughter Eloise, 24, and her boyfriend at their home in Wimbledon, south-west London. Proud parents: Mr Kohler and his wife Samantha are pictured with their daughter Eloise, who dialled 999 . Couple: Mr Kohler (left) had gone into the kitchen of his home (right) when he heard the doorbell at about 10pm . During a break in the game, Miss . MacArthur and the youngsters went upstairs and Mr Kohler went into the . kitchen when he heard the doorbell at around 10pm. He . answered the door to a smartly dressed man who proceeded to pull a . balaclava over his face before barging into the house and punching Mr . Kohler in the face. Three masked accomplices then charged inside and . knocked Mr Kohler to the ground. One sat astride Mr Kohler’s chest and pummelled his face as the others kicked him and attempted to wrap his head in tape. Miss MacArthur said: ‘I heard him starting to shout “Help” so I ran out of the bedroom and met two masked men on the landing. CCTV footage in Wimbledon Town Centre shows the suspect running across the street at 10.03pm . Metropolitan Police are appealing to anyone who saw the man or a silver Volkswagen on the night in question . ‘One . of them pushed me over on to the ground and put clothing over my head. I . could just hear Paul shouting, “Why are you doing this?” He was just . screaming in pain as they hit me.’ Police arrived at the house in minutes after her daughter locked herself in her room with her boyfriend and rang 999. After . arresting two men, officers found a trail of discarded stolen property . including iPhones, laptop computers and jewellery. A large kitchen knife . was also tossed away. One . suspect is a Polish national who travelled to the UK after spending . eight years in prison for an unknown offence in his homeland. Scene: Mr Kohler's daughter was upstairs with her boyfriend in the house in Kings Road, Wimbledon (pictured) A CCTV camera caught one of the escaped robbers as he ran off towards Wimbledon town centre. Miss . MacArthur, who runs a bar in London’s Covent Garden with her husband, . said the family is ‘shaken’ but added: ‘We stayed at home last night and . we are not going to let this stop us living in our own house.’ Mr . Kohler’s brother Marcus said he had described one of his attackers as a . ‘sadist’. Describing Mr Kohler’s academic work, he said: ‘He is a force . of positive teaching and looks after his students, so this is just . totally alien.’ Mr Kohler . has also taught law at University College London and New College Oxford.

"An ex-husband has appeared in court charged with stealing his former wife’s beloved cat Marmalade just weeks after they split up. Jonathan Brewster, 45, who left the marital home in Maidstone, Kent, when the couple separated, is accused of ‘catnapping’ the 13-year-old pet in July. His wife Tracy, 52, has devoted her life to finding the animal in recent months and has even lost her job as a housekeeper after investing so much time orchestrating a major community search. Mechanical engineer Jonathan Brewster, 45, (left) who now lives in Braintree, Essex, has been charged with theft and is accused of stealing his estranged wife Tracy's (right) ginger cat from Maidstone, Kent, in July . Marmalade the cat has been missing from Maidstone, Kent, since July and has not been seen for three months . She has also been having sleepless nights without her pet, which has not been seen since it disappeared three months ago. Mr Brewster, who now lives in Braintree, Essex, has been charged with theft and is accused of stealing the cat between July 13 and July 20. The mechanical engineer, who has received death threats over the alleged catnapping, has denied taking and subsequently ‘dumping’ the ginger cat. During an appearance at Maidstone Magistrate’s Court this week, Brewster was released on bail ahead of a trial in January. Shortly after Marmalade’s disappearance, Mrs Brewster set up Facebook and Twitter pages which drew online support from thousands of people. Along with friends, she raised a reward of £1,300 and mobilised huge groups of volunteers to take to the streets of Maidstone to raise awareness of the cat’s disappearance. Tracy Brewster (centre) has launched a widespread search within the community to find her beloved pet cat . Mrs Brewster, 52, has had thousands of posters printed and launched a Facebook page in the hunt for the cat . Armed with thousands of posters, she commandeered legions of helpers known as the ‘Marmie Army’ to scour her hometown wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the cat’s face. But the hunt for the prized feline has so far been unsuccessful. Last night, before going away, she wrote to the 2,317 people that have joined her Facebook page: ‘Look out for Marmie while gone. Got to get my baby home.’ She also urged those who have supported her search efforts not to mention her husband’s name. Mrs Brewster said she 'totally and utterly adores' Marmalade and has raised a £1,300 reward for his return . Following the court appearance on Monday, she posted a statement which said: ‘Please please do not comment on the person in question - we just need to carry on trying to find Marmie and I need you all with me.’ The cat, which is micro-chipped, is described as a ‘beautiful, long-haired, light ginger neutered male cat’ on the Facebook page. Mrs Brewster also described the cat, which she claims has never left her garden, as having a ‘freckled right eye and bald lower belly’. She added: ‘He is totally and utterly adored by his mum who is desperate and devastated without him.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jonathan Brewster charged with theft after allegedly stealing ex-wife's cat .

"The remains of a woman who apparently lay dead in the front room of her home in Bexleyheath, south-east London (pictured) for more than a decade . The remains of a woman who apparently lay dead in her front room for more than a decade were only discovered after the death of the son who shared her home. Police believe Doris Ames’s body was left to decompose after her younger son Martin, 55, failed to tell anyone that she had died. The grisly discovery was made by her estranged elder son Alan, who visited the family home on Friday following the sudden death of his brother from lung cancer. To his horror, the 61-year-old found the skeleton of his mother in the front room of the house in Bexleyheath, south-east London. It was the first time he had stepped into the dilapidated £335,000 semi-detached home in over ten years after having a row with his brother. The elderly widow, thought to have been in her 70s, had not been seen for years by neighbours. She had been left alone with her reclusive son Martin after her 62-year-old husband died in 1985 and Alan had later moved out. Last night neighbours said they assumed Mrs Ames had died, although they thought it strange they never heard of her funeral. They described her son Martin as a recluse who was only rarely seen leaving the house. Neighbours said that they had seen Alan return to the property several times in recent years but that the two brothers would only ever speak outside the house. Tom Carpenter, 68, who has lived opposite the Ames family home since 1973, said: ‘They were an extremely introverted and never really spoke to anybody on the street. They weren’t the kind of family that you would pass the time of day with.’ Mr Carpenter’s wife Linda, 67, said that locals had long speculated about why there had never been a funeral for Mrs Ames. She said that Martin told neighbours his mother had died, without revealing details about the death. Mrs Carpenter said: ‘It makes you feel bad as we have always wondered why there had never been a funeral. ‘And we always said it was strange that her body was never seen being taken out of the house.’ Last night the front of the property was shrouded by overgrown shrubbery in the garden. It is thought that Martin Ames used to work in a supermarket but had been unemployed in recent years. Detectives believe that Mrs Ames’s body had been in the house for at least ten years, given the advanced state of decomposition. It is not known how she died.

"George W Bush asked his officials: ‘Anything of interest this morning?’ half an hour before the 9/11 attacks began, newly declassified CIA documents reveal. The former US President was flicking through his newspaper during his 8am briefing when he asked for an update on the day’s news. But at 8.21am, four minutes before the meeting ended, the first of four hijacked planes’ transponders went off, marking the beginning of the horror of September 11 2001. Scroll down for video . Shock: Minutes before chief of staff Andy Card interrupted George Bush's speech at Booker Elementary School to say 'America is under attack', the president had sat through a remarkably uneventful security briefing . According to a dramatic account of the day by Bush's former intelligence adviser Michael Morell, in the wake of the attacks Bush seized up in apparent shock whilst on Air Force One - and was staring silently into space for five minutes. It was the President's first moment to take stock since the attacks began but he left Morell feeling 'uncomfortable' seeing him freeze up. Morell’s version of what happened that day is in the trove of CIA documents that were declassified this week after Freedom of Information Requests. Titled ‘11 September 2001: With the President’, it reveals in detail how the day unfolded from when Bush had his morning briefing in his suite at a hotel in Longboat Key in Florida, where he was staying at the time whilst traveling. By the end of the day some 2,995 people would perish in the worst loss of life for America since Pearl Harbour when Al Qaeda terrorists flew planes into the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. Morell, who later became deputy director of the CIA, writes: ‘A little after 8am, Chief of Staff (Andrew) Card opened the door, said: ‘Good morning’ and and motioned us in. ‘We found the president seated at a table with a cup of coffee and a newspaper. He seemed surrounded by plates of fruit and pastries. ‘When he saw us, he asked if we had enjoyed our night on the beach. ‘I reminded him that my schedule did not allow for late evenings out, adding that I heard some waves but had not actually seen any. He said: ‘Michael, you need to get a new job.’ ‘He put down his newspaper and said: ‘Anything of interest this morning?’ ‘On arguably the most important day in President Bush’s tenure, his intelligence briefing was uneventful.’ Terror: The president was ushered into a spare classroom at the school in Sarasota to watch the live footage . Froze up: Declassified CIA documents describe how the president froze up when he was told of the attacks . Bush and his motorcade then drove to Booker Elementary School in Sarasota - and during the drive the first plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Centre. Morell writes: ‘Within minutes of Flight 11′s impact, just as we were pulling up to the school, (White House press secretary Ari) Fleischer’s cell phone rang. ‘He listened for a few seconds and flipped his phone off. He turned to me and asked: ‘Michael, do you know anything about a plane hitting the World Trade Centre?’ ‘I said ""no"" but I told him I would make some calls. As the motorcade came to a stop, I said: ‘Ari, I sure hope this is an accident and not terrorism.’ Morell writes that in his mind this hope began to ‘unravel’ a few minutes later when he heard the jet was a commercial airliner - and a second one had struck the South Tower. He writes: ‘There was now no question: this was not an accident but a deliberate act of terrorism’. At that point Bush was informed by his chief of staff as he sat in a room with 16 first graders. The moment was captured in a now famous photograph: Card can be seen leaning into the President’s ear as he says: ‘America is under attack’. After making a speech at the school the President and his motorcade sped to Air Force One where a long line formed for everyone to be given security screening to get on board. Morell writes that there were bomb sniffing dogs checking every bag and that even he was inspected despite his high security clearance. He writes: ‘The plane was eerily quiet in those first few moments after the take-off. ‘Most of the people on board were still in shock and were anxious about what still might happen. The president was in his office with a small number of close aides. From there, he ordered the nation’s military to a high state of alert.’ Air Force One briefly landed at Barksdale Air Force base in Louisiana to offload some passengers and take on more supplies. Bush was then flown to US Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska but insisted on being taken back to Washington that day. Morell writes that the President was firm and ignored the objections of his staff, who said it was not safe, by saying: ‘I’m coming back’. At one point Bush summoned Morell to tell him who had carried out the attack and asked him: ‘When will we know?’ Morell told him he thought it was Al Qaeda under the direction of Osama bin Laden but he could not say for sure. Account: Intelligence chief Michael Morell was interviewed for the report, and described the eerie quietness . A White House photographer was also on board and took pictures of Bush as the commander in chief during the time of crisis. Morell writes: ‘After the photographer left Bush just said nothing. ‘He, Andy Card and I just sat. One minute elapsed, then two then three. I was beginning to feel uncomfortable. ‘After five minutes I asked the President if he needed anything else. The President said: ""No Michael, thanks very much"". I rose, left the room and returned to my seat in the empty staff section of the aircraft. ‘For the first time that day I felt very tired. I closed my eyes hoping that I could sleep for a few minutes. But sleep never came.’ Morell writes that he kept his own emotions in check until he got off Air Force One later that night and cried. He went home to his wife and three children in northern Virginia and ‘thought of the thousands of children who would never seen their parents again’. He wrote: ‘I kissed my three on their foreheads and told them I loved them’.","New CIA documents reveal minute-by-minute detail of the morning .

"As if all the barbecues, picnics and sunny days in the garden weren’t enough, the current warm weather has one more treat in store – an early pot of blackberry jam. The fruit is ripening almost a month ahead of schedule, leaving gardeners and walkers stunned. Sightings of blackberry bushes – common in gardens throughout Britain – loaded with fruit have risen by four times on last year. Blackberries: The fruit is ripening almost a month ahead of schedule, leaving gardeners and walkers stunned . The crops usually ripen in August, with many berries not developing into their most juicy state until late September. This year’s early blackberry crop – described as ‘unusual’ by an expert – has been noted in data collected by scientists to record climate change. The Woodland Trust’s Dr Kate Lewthwaite said: ‘It is perhaps more common than people might realise to see blackberries in July, but what is unusual is that we have had a far wider abundance across the UK this year than last year.’ She told The Independent on Sunday: ‘This fits into a longer-term trend where autumn fruiting has been two or three weeks earlier over the last 15 years or so.’ 'They may be sweeter': Botanist James Wong (pictured) said the conditions may also lead to tastier berries . And the mild winter was responsible for a bumper crop of strawberries, which also ripened earlier than usual. 'They may be sweeter and more nutrient-dense, due to the high light levels and low rainfall' James Wong, botanist . Dr Lewthwaite said sightings of rowan berries have also doubled. Botanist James Wong said the conditions may also lead to tastier berries. The BBC presenter said: ‘They may be sweeter and more nutrient-dense, due to the high light levels and low rainfall.’ Horticulturalist Bob Flowerdew said the time of ripening depends on the variety of blackberry and location, adding: ‘There is a huge difference between the south and the north of England, and indeed Scotland. ‘Most of my blackberries are well ahead and I have got quite a few varieties.’","Blackberries are ripening almost a month ahead of schedule in Britain .

"Jan Hooks died from cancer which she hoped to beat - and looked 'great' just a week ago, friends have revealed. The Saturday Night Live veteran, who died aged 57 on Thursday, told neighbors she was battling the disease, but 'took a turn for the worse' in recent days. And today, her one-time SNL co-star Nora Dunn - who was the other half of the infamous Sweeney Sisters - said: ‘I knew she wasn't well, but we always think things will get better. ‘It takes a long time, a long history, to know that the best things, the best moments in life, are gone in what seems like a flash. ‘She and I had our best moments together on television’. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Devastated: Nora Dunn, the other half of the Sweeney Sisters alongside Jan Hooks - pictured on SNL in October 1986 - paid tribute to her friend, saying:  'I knew she wasn't well, but we always think things will get better' Jan Hooks appears on '30 Rock; as Jenna Maroney's trashy mother, Verna (right) Jan is believed to have died at a Manhattan hospital, and paying tribute to the actress, Larry Liberstein, head of her building's co-op board, recalled how he would often see her walking her two German Shepherds, saying : 'She was very bubbly. She had one of those grins that meant you couldn't help bringing a smile to your face. It was an infectious smile.' Mr Liberstein confirmed that Jan told him she was suffering from cancer, telling MailOnline:  'I last saw her a week ago and she said that she was ill. It didn't seem that dire. She must have taken a turn for the worse. I think she was at a point where she was talking about it. 'She wasn't hopeless. I don't think she expected it to happen this fast.' Jan featured on SNL between 1985 and 1991 - at the same time as some of its greatest comedians including Phil Hartman, Chris Farley, Dennis Miller and Mike Myers. She was famous for playing half of the Sweeney Sisters, a talentless but overly enthusiastic lounge act, and for her impersonations of Sinead O’Connor. She was also the first SNL cast member to play Hillary Clinton.

Meanwhile, Peter Guttman, an award-winning travel photographer and journalist, one of Jan's neighbours, told MailOnline that she would pepper everyday conversations in the laundry room with jokes and comic asides. He said: 'I was always impressed that somebody who had got to that level of fame seemed so down to earth. 'The last time I saw her was a couple of months ago and when she asked after my son I remember thinking what a good person she was. 'When I became aware she was my neighbour and I looked at her work I was impressed with the very wide diversity of her stage presence. 'When she died my son called me to ask if I had heard. I was surprised by the amount of interest as it seemed like she'd been forgotten'. Jan's former SNL co-star and boyfriend, Kevin Nealon today said that they had had ‘amazing times as friends, then dating and then the incredible rush of being on SNL together’. He then posted a picture of the couple together, writing: 'My girlfriend in the 80s and my friend forever, Janners. God you were talented. Too soon and too sad.'

"Google’s attempts to put driverless cars on the road may have suffered a setback due to new motoring laws in California. Under the rules all drivers must be able to take ‘immediate physical control’ of a vehicle for it to be able to travel on roads in the US state. The law comes into effect on September 16 meaning that Google will either have to get it changed or convince legislators it is complying with its futuristic vehicles. Scroll down for video . U-turn? Under the rules all drivers must be able to take ‘immediate physical control’ of a vehicle for it to be able to travel on roads in the US state. But the tech giant has created a car with no steering wheel or pedals which will be completely autonomous and rely on GPS technology, cameras and in-built maps of cities to steer it . That will be tricky as the tech giant has created a car with no steering wheel or pedals which will be completely autonomous and rely on GPS technology, cameras and in-built maps of cities to steer it around. It wants to debut the two-seater vehicle in California where driverless cars are legal - but now lawmakers appear to have done a partial U-turn. Google has not revealed how it will comply with the regulations as its prototype driverless car only has buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop. There is also a computer screen showing your route on the vehicle, which Google hopes to have on the streets by 2017. Testing on private roads has is due to start next month and will include temporary manual controls. A Google spokesman said that the new California driving rules covered testing of its cars only. He said: 'During our testing we are equipping the vehicles with manual controls such as a steering wheel, brake pedal, and accelerator pedal. 'With these additions, our safety drivers can test the self-driving features, while having the ability to take control of the vehicle if necessary.' However that is not the only hurdle that the cars have to overcome. Another issue is liability for insurance companies in the event of an accident - experts have asked who will be responsible if there is no driver and Google is effectively in charge of the vehicle. To get round this California has insisted that anyone testing a driverless car must have a $5 million insurance policy to cover any eventualities. In the US driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver's seat. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as September. Changes to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, which dates back to 1968, are also afoot. It used to state: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.'An amendment agreed in May would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'. A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time. The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. Google has developed a . digital simulation that its cars can drive around in (3D mapping . software of the cars shown) and test their abilities before they head . out into the real world. Google has not revealed how it will comply with regulations as its prototype driverless car only has buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop . David Hall, the chief executive of Velodyne Inc, which makes laser technology used by Google's autonomous cars, told the Wall St Journal that these questions left him concerned. He said: ‘Who pays when there's a crash? Who will insure us against this?’ Google’s car is powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles before charging. Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face. The prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive. The car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing. The route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to Chris Urmson, the leader of Google's self-driving car team. The car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles (160 km) before charging. Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. In these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. Ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service.Driving works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.

Google has suffered other setbacks with its driverless cars after critics pointed out they will be able to exceed the speed limit.

Sgt 1st Class Paula Walker was 'in good spirits' when they spoke to her just a week ago, said Paul Walker. He revealed that the 33-year-old mother-of-one joined up at the age of 19 straight out of high school and was looking forward to retiring from the service and embarking on a second career. Sgt Walker leaves behind an eight-year-old daughter who will now be cared for by Paul and Paula's mother Flora, 61, of Yonkers, New York. Scroll down for video . Loving mother: Sgt Walker was the mother of an eight-year-old girl who served 15 months in Iraq. her twin brother Paul, of Yonkers, New York, told MailOnline she loved her job and 'loved her country' Mystery: Paul said he spoke to his twin sister a week ago and she was 'in good spirits'. He told MailOnline: 'This was totally unseen. I spoke to her a week ago... you never know what's going on in a person's mind' Fighting back the tears, Paul told MailOnline: 'She was a great mum, a great daughter, a great all round person. 'I am devastated at the loss of my twin sister. This was totally unseen. I spoke to her a week ago and she was fine and in good spirits. I just don't know, you never know. You never know what's going on in a person’s mind. 'It doesn't make sense to me.' Sgt Walker died after barricading herself in an office inside a building at the base in Fort Lee, Virginia, where she had been stationed for the last three years. She is said to have begun was throwing things around and that officials tried to negotiate with her. Her gun was not a service weapon, officials said. Sgt Walker's career included a 15-month combat tour in Iraq from 2007 to 2008. She also served a tour in Afghanistan in 2008 and had been awarded commendations and good conduct medals. Mr Walker spoke to MailOnline on the doorstep of the family apartment in Yonkers overlooking the Hudson where he and his sister grew up. Army Major General Stephen Lyons, pictured on Monday, said that he did not know if Sgt Walker was being treated for any mental health issues and could not speculate whether drugs or alcohol were involved . He described her as 'gracious, kind, humble, always thinking about what she's going to say before she said it'. Sgt Walker put 'God first, then family', Mr Walker said. He said: 'She was a hard worker. She wanted to be in the military for life - that was her goal, to retire in the army. 'She had been in for 14 years and she liked she was doing. We talked a lot about her being in the military. She liked it. She loved her country, she was patriotic.' Mr Walker said that his sister had normal stresses like paying the bills and making sure her daughter was ready for the new school year, but nothing serious. They were not aware that she was being treated for any mental health issues such as PTSD. Mr Walker said: 'Iraq was tough for her, her daughter was here. It was tough for our mother but Paula came home. It's possible that she kept something behind the facade but I didn't know about it. 'She signed up because it gave her stability which was good for her. She would have retired with a pension and worked a new career, that’s what she was going to do'. Mr Walker said that he will now be stepping up to raise his niece who he 'welcomes with open arms' and that he wished he could have been there for his sister. He said: 'What’s hard for me is that she was in such turmoil that she felt she had to do that to herself, to know that your sister is in that place mentally where she feels that's her only option. 'For me as a brother that hurts to know that she thought that'. When Sgt Walker shot herself, the building she was in had 1,100 people inside but nobody else was hurt. Maj. Gen. Stephen R. Lyons, the commander of the base at Fort Lee, has said he did not know whether she was being treated for any mental health issues and could not speculate whether drugs or alcohol might have been a factor. Prior to coming to Fort Lee, Sgt Walker served at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, starting in 2010 and was at Fort Eustis, Virginia, beginning in 2006. She also served in Hawaii before her tour of Iraq. Lyons has described Sgt Walker as upset and enraged but said he couldn't say whether that was consistent with her personality. Active shooter: The Fort Lee base was put in lockdown on Monday after Sgt Walker barricaded herself in a room and started throwing things around, before tragically killing herself . According to the Army, her awards and decorations include three Army Commendation Medals, four Army Achievement Medals, one Joint Meritorious Unit Award and four Army Good Conduct Medals. Army officials initially labeled the incident involving Sgt Walker, which happened on Monday, an 'active shooter' situation. The Department of Homeland Security uses the term to describe someone actively trying to kill people, usually in populated areas, with no pattern of choosing victims. While stationed at Fort Eustis in November 2009, Sgt Walker was interviewed by a reporter over the massacre of 13 people by Maj Nidal Hasan, a military psychiatrist, who opened fire at Fort Hood Army base. He injured 31 others in the deadliest such attack in history. In an interview with the Daily Press, a Newport News newspaper, Sgt Walker said: 'People are people. They go through things in life. They either handle stresses in a good way or in a bad way.'","Sgt 1st Class Paula Walker killed herself on Monday after barricading herself in a room .

"Terminally-ill pensioner Tina Kinsey waited nine hours on a trolley in A&E before she was admitted to hospital, her daughter has claimed . A terminally-ill pensioner waited nine hours on a trolley in A&E before being admitted to hospital, it was claimed yesterday. And when she was given a bed, Tina Kinsey, 67 suffered unnecessarily in her final days because of failures in her care, her daughter said. Mrs Kinsey, who had cancer, was taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital, in Bodelwyddan, North Wales, following a fall. After her nine-hour wait in casualty, she was given a bed on a general ward. Mrs Kinsey, from nearby Rhyl, died three days later, on November 1 last year. Her daughter, Wendy, lodged a formal complaint over ‘a catalogue of errors’ in her care in her final few days. She said staff were slow to give her mother pain relief and left her choking on her own vomit, before she eventually slipped into a coma and died. Yesterday it emerged that health bosses have formally apologised for not providing the level of care Mrs Kinsey ‘had the right to expect’ before her death. Her case is the latest in a series of patient horror stories reported to the Daily Mail about services under the Labour-run NHS in Wales. Wendy, who does not want her surname used, said her mother had endured unnecessary suffering at the hospital in her final days. ‘The morphine patches on her back had expired and needed changing,’ said Wendy, who is also from Rhyl. ‘I continually tried asking staff to help her and give her the pain relief she needed. She was given just paracetamol. ‘Vomiting uncontrollably and screaming in pain, she didn’t receive any morphine to control her pain until midnight. It was obvious she was dying. Mrs Kinsey, who had cancer, was taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital (pictured), in Bodelwyddan, North Wales, following a fall, but had to wait nine hours for a bed . ‘Her mouth needed to be suctioned on a regular basis, as she was unable to control her gag reflex and was choking on her own vomit. It took a long time for staff to arrive when she needed help, or not at all. ‘The lack of communication about what was happening was appalling.

We will be contacting the family to share our findings and it would not be appropriate for us to discuss these matters in public, although I fully accept that there were aspects of Mrs Kinsey’s care, and communication with the family, that should have been much better.’","Tina Kinsey, 67, was taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital, north Wales, after a fall .

"A pregnant survivor of the Sydney siege has revealed her unborn baby was unharmed by the crisis, as she paid tribute to her close friend who died in the incident. Barrister Julie Taylor, friend of the late hostage Katrina Dawson, today penned an emotional statement about this week's tragic events. Despite her grief, Ms Taylor, 35, said she had taken comfort from the huge floral memorial in Martin Place and the fact she and her husband will welcome a baby into their family in the coming months. Scroll down for video . The closest of friends: Julie Taylor, left, and her friend Katrina Dawson, right, were both trapped in the Sydney cafe siege. While Ms Taylor, who is pregnant, survived, Ms Dawson did not . Free at last: Julie Taylor, second from left, is pictured escaping the site of the Sydney cafe siege . Dash for freedom: Ms Taylor is pictured in the background escaping the Lindt cafe . Days after the floral tribute began, posies were continuing to pile up at Martin Place on Friday morning. Flowers are now laid at three different locations down the street . 'My husband and I have been told that our unborn baby is healthy and unharmed by this crisis,' she said. 'If all goes well, and there is no reason to think it won't, we will give birth to a precious baby in a few months.' Ms Taylor was visiting the Lindt cafe with Ms Dawson, her colleague at Eighth Floor Selborne chambers on Phillip Street, when Man Haron Monis took 18 people captive for more than 16 hours. Ms Dawson was killed after hostages staged an escape attempt around 2am on Tuesday morning. Police officers took Monis out in a hail of bullets. 'Katrina Dawson was the most wonderful person I have ever met,' Ms Taylor said. 'She was my closest friend, a role model and confidant. 'Her bravery and strength was, and continues to be, a comfort and inspiration for me.  he invested every moment of her life in her friends and family, and will be greatly missed by everyone who has known her. 'My thoughts and sympathy are with her family, whom I have come to know and love.' She also paid tribute to Tori Johnson, the cafe manager who was the other victim of the siege. 'Although our acquaintance was forged under the worst imaginable circumstances, I feel privileged to have known you and I will always remember you as a kind, considerate, level-headed and courageous person' 'It was clear to me how much you loved your family and how much compassion you had for everyone you met'. Ms Taylor said she had also taken comfort from the huge outpouring of public support - particularly from the huge flower memorial that has been established in Martin Place. Tens of thousands of posies and handwritten messages have been placed at three sites across the plaza, in what has been dubbed 'Sydney's floral heart'. Among the messages was a note written by Ms Dawson's youngest daughter, Sasha, which said simply: 'I love you mum. Love Sasha'. Pictured: Sasha, the youngest daughter of Katrina Dawson, left this touching note to her late mother at the Martin Place memorial . Although words cannot describe the events of the last few days and the feelings that I have towards the survivors and victims of the Martin Place siege, there are a few things I would like to say. Katrina Dawson was the most wonderful person I have ever met. She was my closest friend, a role model and confidant. Her bravery and strength was, and continues to be, a comfort and inspiration for me. She invested every moment of her life in her friends and family, and will be greatly missed by everyone who has known her. My thoughts and sympathy are with her family, whom I have come to know and love. I would like to pay tribute to Tori Johnson. Although our acquaintance was forged under the worst imaginable circumstnaces, I feel privileged to have known you and I will always remember you as a kind, considerate, level-headed and courageous person. It was clear to me how much you loved your family, and how much compassion you had for everyone you met. I am grateful that you were with my throughout our ordeal. To the other hostages, thank you for the support and consideration that you gave me throughout our time together. I will always be grateful to you. Thank you to the police, ambulance staff and health professionals at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, who helped us throughout 15 and 16 December and afterwards. It is difficult to be positive at a time like this, but there are two things which provide comfort to me. The first is the overwhelming display of public support for everyone involved in this crisis, including me. My own visit to the Memorial at Martin Place gave me a strength for the coming weeks which I thought that I might not have, as have the messages and kindnesses that have been sent to me by everyone I know and many I don't. It is good to know that none of us is alone. Finally, my husband and I have been told that our unborn baby is healthy and unharmed by this crisis. If all goes well, and there is no reason to think that it won't, we will give birth to a precious baby in a few months. Although it is an emotional time, we are trying to keep ourselves healthy so that can occur. I thank members of the media for their respect of our privacy in this difficult time, and ask that you continue to do so. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird has confirmed the government will examine establishing a permanent memorial to the victims of the tragedy. In an interview with the ABC's 7.30 program on Thursday night, Mr Baird said he did not want the floral shrine to end. 'In many respects, Leigh, I don't want it to end. It's just so beautiful down there,' he said. 'And it's the people, it's the stories, it's the families. 'I mean, people, complete strangers are hugging, in tears, putting down the flowers, reflecting on the loss, the thankfulness, in some respects, for the hostages that are still with us and an overall sense in this city that we will get through this.' The coroner released Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson's bodies to their families on Thursday nights, who are beginning the process of planning memorial services for the dead.","Barrister Julie Taylor today penned an emotional statement about this week's tragic events .

"Smiling broadly for the camera with her little boy beside her, Naomi Hulme looks the picture of health. But this photograph hides a terrible sadness. Because just months after it was taken, cystic fibrosis sufferer Miss Hulme, 22, was dead. She could have been saved had she had a lung transplant but her condition worsened before doctors could arrange an operation. The young mother, who was born with the genetic condition, died just over a fortnight ago while preparing to go on the waiting list for a double lung transplant. She deteriorated so quickly that doctors were powerless to save her. Naomi Hulme, 22, with her son Leo, four. Miss Hulme, a cystic fibrosis sufferer, died a fortnight ago, just months after this photo was taken. She could have been saved, but her condition worsened before doctors could arrange a lung transplant . Yesterday her family paid tribute to the ‘bubbly, outgoing, wonderful’ Miss Hulme, who they said doted on her son, Leo, four. Her mother, Jackie Hulme, 47, a carer for adults with learning difficulties, said: ‘Naomi was a beautiful person, inside and out. ‘She was a bubbly, outgoing, wonderful girl who was taken from us far too soon. ‘She adored Leo and he adored his mum. ‘Up until a few years ago Naomi lived a pretty normal life, cystic fibrosis never stopped her from doing anything. You would never have known that she was ill. ‘We had some professional photographs taken about 18 months ago, you wouldn’t have known she was ill, it’s just so sad. ‘But over the last six months Naomi hadn’t been home for two weeks at a time before having to go back to hospital. Yesterday her family paid tribute to the ‘bubbly, outgoing, wonderful’ Miss Hulme, who 'was taken far too soon' 'She had no quality of life at all, that’s when the doctors started talking about a transplant. She was having tests about going on the donor waiting list, but it takes time. ‘Then she got really poorly and went downhill fast. The doctors were shocked at how quickly she deteriorated.’ Miss Hulme was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was two years old. She lived a normal life, going to school and taking part in dancing clubs. In 2005 she was nominated for a ‘breathing life’ award which honours the exceptional achievements of young adults and children with the hereditary lung disease. Miss Hulme, who was separated from Leo’s father, even went through her pregnancy without any problems. ‘Until she was 16 she had always danced, taking part in competitions all around the UK and as far away as Malta,’ Mrs Hulme, who is looking after Leo following his mother’s death, with her scrap metal merchant husband, Barrie, 50. ‘She won hundreds of trophies and took to it straight away. In fact, it helped her condition as it would clear her lungs. Miss Hulme, here aged 13, was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was two years old . ‘Even her health when she was pregnant was fantastic, the doctors gave her a Caesarean section at 36 weeks, but said she could have gone full term.’ However, three years ago Miss Hulme’s health began to deteriorate. ‘She hated having the disease but never let it get on top of her until it worsened when she was 18,’ her mother, of Macclesfield, Cheshire, added. ‘We tried so hard, taking Leo to hospital, so they could have a normal mother and son relationship. 'He said his goodbyes about four days before she died –he says his mummy is an angel now. 'A family friend has named a star after Naomi and so Leo is still talking to his mummy who is in the sky.’ Shortly before her death, Miss Hulme made a heart-breaking video to publicise a charity night to help raise funds for a possible transplant. The 57-second clip showed the pretty brunette wearing an oxygen mask and playing with Leo on her hospital bed. She died five days after the event, at Wythenshawe Hospital, with her parents at her bedside, on October 16. The couple said they have taken strength from the huge number of cards, flowers and messages of support ahead of their daughter’s funeral, at St Paul’s Church, Macclesfield, tomorrow. ‘Naomi was my world, I feel like my heart has been ripped out,’ Mrs Hulme, who also has a son, Ryan, 27, said. ‘She was very, very popular and the funeral is going to be incredibly difficult. She has left a huge hole that can’t be filled. ‘I feel bitter about cystic fibrosis at the moment because it has taken Naomi away from me. ‘But Naomi will never be forgotten, and Leo will always be able to hear from us how special his mummy was.’ Miss Hulme's mother said a family friend had named a star after Naomi, and so her son Leo is 'still talking to his mummy who is in the sky'","Naomi Hulme was born with the genetic condition cystic fibrosis .

"Keith Cavendish-Coulson (pictured) abused boys at the Terra Nova School, near Holmes Chapel, Cheshire . A former master at a prestigious boarding school who sexually abused boy pupils was allowed to resign rather than face a police inquiry as part of an establishment cover-up, it has emerged. Keith Cavendish-Coulson, now 71, befriended the youngsters, who were aged between eight and 13, before molesting them in classrooms, their dormitories and his private quarters in the 1970s. The abuse was an ‘open secret’ among the boys at the £13,000-a-year Terra Nova School, near Holmes Chapel, Cheshire. Its past pupils include Olympic sailing gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie and David and Victoria Beckham’s eldest son, Brooklyn. But despite repeated complaints from pupils and their parents, Cavendish-Coulson’s abuse was covered up by the headmaster of the preparatory school, who was worried about the ‘untold damage’ that would be caused to it. Instead the French and music teacher, known for his tall stories, was allowed to resign for ‘health reasons’ rather than be sacked. The Education Department was informed about the allegations and Cavendish-Coulson was later barred from working at schools. But officials failed to talk to victims or call in police. As a consequence, he was allowed to work as a private tutor for many years, even coaching boys from Eton for a short time in the 1980s, before the headmaster checked his credentials and stopped him contacting pupils. Cavendish-Coulson also secured posts at at least three other independent schools, before being found out and dismissed. Although he was investigated by police in 1998 and 2005, no action was taken against him until November 2012 when officers reopened the case following a complaint. Cavendish-Coulson, of Crookham, Berkshire, was due to stand trial at Chester Crown Court but  dramatically changed his plea to guilty on Wednesday and admitted 41 sample counts of indecent assault on 24 boys under the age of 14. He also admitted a single count involving the 13-year-old brother of a girl he home tutored in the 1980s. He is facing a substantial prison sentence when he is sentenced today. Despite repeated complaints from pupils and their parents, Cavendish-Coulson’s abuse was covered up by the headmaster of the school (pictured), who was worried about the ‘untold damage’ that would be caused to it . Cavendish-Coulson arrived at Terra Nova in 1973. Anne Whyte, QC, prosecuting, said he was allowed to resign in November 1975 after the mother of one boy told the then headmaster she had caught the teacher in a ‘compromising’ position with her son. In a letter to a father, headmaster Andrew Keith admitted Cavendish-Coulson had done a ‘great deal of damage’ to the boys, but added: ‘It would do untold damage to the school if parents wished to take proceedings against Mr Coulson and… the quicker we can forgive and forget the better.’ A letter from Cavendish-Coulson’s GP, unearthed by police, also advised that the ‘matter should be dropped’ so as not to ‘stir up a lot of trouble unnecessarily.’ One of the victims of Cavendish-Coulson (pictured) has described the impact of the abuse he suffered . A boy persistently abused by Cavendish-Coulson between the ages of nine and 11 described in a victim impact statement, what happened to him and its effects. The married father of two, now aged 50 said: ‘When I was sent to board at Terra Nova School I was seven. 'I suffered from home sickness most of the time and yearned to be home with my parents. 'I felt abandoned, lonely and frightened. ‘The school was a violent, authoritarian place. Bullying was rife and corporal punishment was common. It was a dreadful place. It was the 1970s, but more like Tom Brown’s school days. ‘It was in this kind of environment that Keith Cavendish-Coulson befriended me. He was kind to me. 'He spoke to me softly and gently. He took advantage of my neediness, my vulnerability and instead of looking after me he used me for his own sexual gratification and he groomed me. ‘I knew it was wrong and horrible what he was doing, but I was completely unable to stop him. I felt totally frozen and horrified. It was humiliating. Sometimes it was also physically painful… but I didn’t feel capable of telling anyone. ‘I can say with absolute certainty that the experience of being sexually abused by Keith Cavendish-Coulson had a devastating effect on my life. Most of the time I am an emotional wreck, lacking self-esteem, plagued by depression. ‘I do not stand here a broken man. I’ve worked hard in therapy to understand what happened to me. ‘I have a lovely wife and two beautiful daughters, who feel like a real achievement which I am very thankful for.’ Mrs Whyte said the letter highlights that there was a ‘professional culture’ of assuming that the best response was to sweep such matters under the carpet. There was a ‘collective silence’ on the part of adults, professionals and possibly parents. ‘Other considerations took priority over the social welfare of victims and over Cavendish-Coulson’s criminal culpability,’ she added.","Keith Cavendish-Coulson abused boys at Terra Nova School in the 1970s .

"Companies which exploit loopholes to avoid paying tax in Britain will be made to ‘damn well pay’, David Cameron said last night. The Prime Minister pledged to clamp down on multinationals that funnel billions of pounds into offshore tax havens. It follows controversy over the way firms such as Google, Apple, Starbucks and Amazon handle their tax affairs in the UK. The Prime Minister vowed to clamp down on companies which funnel money abroad to avoid UK tax rates . Global giants have been accused of registering subsidiary companies in low-tax countries to avoid paying their full UK tax obligations. Mr Cameron said: ‘We’ve cut the rate of corporation tax down to 20 per cent, we’re the most competitive place to come and start a business, but here’s the deal – if they have a low tax rate, those companies have damn well got to pay it.’ His comments are in contrast to that of the former chief executive of Sainsbury’s, who appeared to defend the multinationals. Justin King, who left the supermarket giant in July, said the situation was ‘not black and white’ and that, if people did not like the tax methods used by a particular firm, they should shop elsewhere. Last week, it emerged that Facebook had not paid any corporation tax in the UK for a second year in a row, despite recording sales of £50million, after pushing much of its revenues through a complex scheme in Ireland. Mr Cameron said the culture is changing and those ‘sitting in boardrooms’ are realising it is ‘bad publicity’ for their business to avoid their tax responsibilities. He was responding to a question from a worker at mobile firm O2 during a visit to its call centre near Runcorn in Cheshire yesterday. Starbucks came under fire for its financial strategy which meant the company did not pay UK tax for years . The PM accused companies of being ‘very, very clever arranging their financial affairs, taking profit in different parts of the world’ and not paying tax on it. Mr King, however, denied loopholes existed. He told a tax conference organised by Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee: ‘They are not loopholes. 'They are legitimate tax systems put in place by legitimate governments legitimately elected. 'It is wrong to lay that at the door of companies operating their business in a structure… constructed by government. ‘The first thing you have got to do is hold governments to account for putting those structures in place; that we have seen in Ireland. 'The Irish have come to the conclusion that the “double Irish” is not acceptable in their own parliament.’ Justin King defended the multinationals saying they were not operating loopholes merely following legitimate tax systems . Earlier this month, the Irish government pledged to abolish a controversial scheme known as the ‘double Irish’ which had allowed the country to be used as a tax haven by large foreign technology and drugs companies. Mr King suggested that consumers who objected to such schemes should change where they shop to ‘reflect what they believe is right or wrong’ and choose a retailer which ‘most closely aligns with your values’. He said: ‘The vote with the wallet is the most powerful vote.’ Asked if it was morally right that companies exploited the law in this way, he added: ‘The word moral is unhelpful.’ Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said it was ‘morally reprehensible’ to avoid paying ‘a fair share of tax’ by exploiting Britain’s complex laws. She said: ‘I understand how complex these issues are. However, the law needs to change, and the behaviour of companies and individuals must also change. ‘We want tougher tax regimes, closing the loopholes that companies exploit and prosecuting avoidance schemes. We need to simplify our tax systems, so that they are less vulnerable to abuse.’ Last year, accountants at the Fair Tax Campaign criticised Sainsbury’s for having three subsidiary companies based in the Cayman Islands, known for its low tax rate. A Sainsbury’s spokesman said at the time the supermarket was ‘proud to play its part in society as a fair taxpayer’ and rejected allegations that it wasn’t paying its way.","Prime Minister said UK was 'the most competitive' place for new business .

"New South Wales police have found a suicide note but no sign of missing man Geoffrey Hunt after his wife Kim and their three children were found tragically shot dead at their family property in rural Lockhart. Mr Hunt, 44, hasn't been seen since police made the grim discovery of his 41-year-old wife and their young children Fletcher, 10, Mia, 8 and Phoebe, 6, at their home in the Riverina region, some 80 kilometres south of Wagga Wagga, on Tuesday afternoon. Police divers are expected to search for him at a dam at the property on Wednesday, after a white ute was found abandoned nearby. Mrs Hunt was well known as 'a miracle survivor' by the Lockhart community after re-learning how to walk and talk following a car crash in 2012 in which she suffered a brain injury, fractured spine and broken neck. Scroll down for video . Happier times: Police are looking for Geoffrey Hunt, 44, after his wife Kim, 41 and their three children - Phoebe, 6, Mia, 8 and Fletcher, 10 - were found dead at their farmland property in rural NSW . Police found the bodies of three children inside the house, while the woman's body was located on a path at the rear of the house . Police divers recovered a body from the dam at the Lockhart property on Wednesday after a white ute was found abandoned nearby (pictured) About six police cars were seen rushing to the property on Boree Creek Road in Lockhart in rural New South Wales . The Hunts posed and smiled for local newspapers a year after Mrs Hunt's miracle recovery from the crash, in which her youngest daughter Phoebe also suffered minor injuries. At the time of the crash it was reported that Mr Hunt never left his wife's side while she was slowly recovering in hospital. The tragedy has sent shockwaves through the quiet town, with a population of only 900, with friends and neighbours of the nurse and her children finding it difficult to describe their shock. 'We are devastated by the tragedy, it's unbelievable,' Lockhart mayor Peter Yates told Daily Mail Australia. 'I knew the family and the people that were involved were well-respected people, a farming family. 'I just can't believe it, especially when there's children involved. They had their whole lives ahead of them.' Police would not comment on reports a suicide note had been found at the property . Police search crop paddocks between the house and dam at the property between Boree Creek and Lockhart, NSW . A post-mortem is yet to be carried out on the bodies, but it is believed the family suffered gunshot wounds . Mrs Hunt was known as 'a miracle survivor' by the Lockhart community after re-learning how to walk and talk following a car crash in 2012 in which she suffered a brain injury, fractured spine and broken neck . Deputy mayor Roger Schirmer described Mrs Hunt, a former intensive care nurse who had recently started work at Lockhart hospital, as 'a lovely person' with 'a lovely family'. He also said the area had experienced 'pretty tough' weather conditions this year and widespread frosts hadn't been good for crops. Police found the bodies of three children inside the house, while the woman's body was located on a path at the rear of the house. Cr Yates extended his condolences to the family members of the victims. A Lockhart resident working at a service station said the deaths would be felt in the small community. 'God yes,' said the woman who declined to be named. 'We're only a tiny little village. We're all so sad.' NSW Police have confirmed they responded to calls about 3pm on Tuesday. About six police cars were seen rushing to the property on the Lockhart/Boree Creek Road in Lockhart. Local police, SES members and a forensic team worked through the night . The victims were found at a property in Lockhart. The property is south of Boree Creek - a small town 80 kilometres west of Wagga Wagga . Lockhart mayor Peter Yates tells Daily Mail Australia that the community is devastated by the tragedy, and that the family were a well-respected, grain farming family . A post-mortem will be carried out on the bodies, but it is believed the family suffered gunshot wounds. Mr Hunt is described as being of Caucasian appearance, about 193cm tall, with a medium and athletic build, short brown hair and a clean-shaven face. A strike force to investigate the deaths has been formed after a State Emergency Service team from The Rock - about 40km east of Lockhart - arrived at the scene before 7pm, followed by Forensic Services at 7.30pm, according to The Daily Advertiser. Strike Force Tullaroan comprises officers from Wagga Wagga Local Area Command and they are being assisted by detectives from State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad. Two crime scenes have been established at the property. Police are urging anyone with information about Mr Hunt's whereabouts to contact Strike Force Tullaroan investigators via Crime Stoppers . One is located at the homestead while the other is near a dam where police searching the property found an unattended white utility vehicle. The crime scenes were examined by specialist forensic officers throughout the night. Police divers will search the dam and other waterways today.

"Ever since the Duchess of Cambridge and model Cara Delevingne began sporting bolder, bushier eye brows, they have been a must for any fashion conscious female. But for some women cultivating a trendy and natural-looking ‘power brow’ was impossible after years of over-plucking. Now experts have finally come up with a solution – eyebrows in a bottle. Scroll down for video . Silk Fibre Brow Enhancer is a revolutionary new powder which has hundreds of tiny fibres mimicking real hair . Silk Fibre Brow Enhancer is revolutionary new powder, containing hundreds of tiny fibres which mimic real hair, that can simply be brushed onto existing brows or the forehead in seconds. The synthetic fibres, which are made from nylon and come in four shades, cling to existing hair or skin, thickening up sparse patches, lengthening brows and giving a much more natural, shapely look than one achieved with an eyebrow pencil or pen. It can even create brows if no hair exists at all, which means the powder can help restore the looks and confidence to cancer sufferers who’ve lost their eyebrows through chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The fibres are suspended in an ultra-fine powder, which is water-proof and derived from minerals found in sea clay. It sets within 60 seconds and can be washed off and applied daily like ordinary make-up. It can even create brows if no hair exists at all, which means it could restore confidence for cancer sufferers . The synthetic fibres, which are made from nylon and come in four shades, cling to existing hair or skin . It's already a best seller in Australia and costs £19.99 for a 4g bottle - includes around 120 applciations . Costing £19.99 for a 4g bottle, which includes around 120 applications, Fibre Brow Enhancer is already a best-seller in Australia, where it was launched last year. It is due to go on sale on the British High Street at Boots later this month (Oct). Sam Franklin, 28, from Brighton, Sussex, lost her eyebrows and hair after undergoing treatment for cervical cancer. ‘After I lost my hair and brows I really didn’t feel like myself anymore, in fact how I looked made me feel quite depressed,’ she said. ‘While I can wear a wig to disguise hair loss, I struggled to find a product that would give me brows. Every product I tried didn’t look realistic and didn’t stay very long on my skin. Model Cara Delevingne sports bolder, bushier eye brows and has inspired a generation of women to go bigger . ‘I tried the Silk Fibre Brow Enhancer and I haven’t looked back. It is waterproof, lasts at least 12 hours and the tiny fibres look so realistic, it’s completely changed the way I feel about myself while I’m undergoing treatment.’ The trend for thicker, bushier brows, dubbed the ‘Scouse Brow,’ was sparked by the stars of Liverpool-based E4 reality TV show Desperate Scousewives, and Merseyside WAGS Alex Curran and Coleen Rooney. It further increased in popularity when the Duchess of Cambridge cultivated thicker, bolder brows and many celebrities, including fashion model Cara Delevingne and actresses Natalie Portman and Keira Knightly, have also ditched thinner brows in favour of a bushier look.","Bushier eyebrows have been a must for any fashion conscious female .

"Doctor: Locum Christopher Uwagboe refused to leave his office at his practice despite an 88-year-old woman collapsing and cutting her head outside . One in five British doctors would hesitate or decide not to help if they came across an accident for fear of being sued, a new poll has revealed. According to a survey of almost 350 medics, 21 per cent said they would be unsure or would not go to the aid of someone in need of medical attention if off duty. The research, conducted on an internet discussion site hosted by the British Medical Journal, comes just weeks after a GP was criticised for failing to help an 88-year-old woman who fell and injured herself outside his surgery. Locum Christopher Uwagboe refused to leave his office, at his practice in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, despite Iris Henderson collapsing and cutting her head outside. She was eventually helped by a passer-by and taken to hospital. There is no legal duty in the UK for doctors to help if they come across an accident, or someone in need of medical attention, although medical authorities say they have a moral obligation to do their best in such circumstances. Caroline Fryar, head of advisory services at the MDU, the body which provides professional insurance for doctors, said medics had an ‘ethical’ rather than a legal obligation to act in times of accident or emergency when off duty. ‘The General Medical Council, in their good practice guidance, sets out that it is a doctor’s duty to offer help if an emergency arises, but also that they should take account of their own safety, competence and availability for other opportunities of care,’ she said. ‘Despite the evidence of this survey, it is not our experience that doctors don’t want to assist (when faced with an accident). Helping hand: According to a survey of almost 350 British doctors 21 per cent said they would be unsure or would not go to the aid of someone in need of medical attention if off duty (picture posed by models) ‘We provide indemnity for Good Samaritan acts for our members and, at the end of the day, they can only assist within the limits of what they are trained to do. It is rare for doctors to get sued for helping out.’ But one lawyer, who posted on the doc2doc forum, said he was ‘astonished’ at the attitude of some senior doctors when it came to helping out in an emergency. The unnamed lawyer, who claimed he had recently given a talk to senior doctors on the legal aspects of emergency care, said: ‘One physician was adamant he would not help in any trauma type situation because he is not trained in trauma care. ‘I countered this by saying that one does not need special knowledge in trauma care because anyone giving first aid (whether doctor, nurse, first aiders) always approaches with the same process – ABC (Airway, Breathing and Circulation). ‘The consultant would not have it at all. He said: ""What about if I move the unconscious pt (sic) from a burning car and cause (or worsen) a spinal injury"". ‘My response (as a medical lay man) was quite simply if the car is on fire and the pt is unconscious you either leave them to die in the fire or get them out despite the concomitant risk of making injuries worse. ‘A court will not find against anyone moving the pt where there is no choice. I was pretty astonished at his attitude and also disappointed. ‘We have discussed Good Samaritan acts a number of times but I remain curious about doctors current understanding and approach to such acts.’ Helping out in an emergency: One lawyer, who posted on the doc2doc forum (above), an internet discussion site hosted by the British Medical Journal, said he was 'astonished' at the attitude of some senior doctors . However, others contributing to the discussion said they had ‘some sympathy’ with the consultant’s position. ‘Over recent years the emphasis has been much more on whether certain guidelines have been followed strictly and criticism for only “doing one’s best” has become quite hostile,’ one doctor added. ‘The second factor that has changed is that those in the paramedical team are so much better trained - being the only person on site in the UK is fairly unlikely unless one is also involved in the accident.’ Mrs Henderson, a widow, had just got off a bus outside Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, when she collapsed, cutting her head and injuring her arm on September 18. Passer-by Jane Batchelor found her knocked out and dashed into the practice to ask for help, but said staff were ‘completely uninterested’. When she persisted, locum Christopher Uwagboe was approached, but he refused to leave his office. Staff even declined to supply a blanket or a defibrillator for Mrs Henderson, who has a pacemaker, until an ambulance came around 30 minutes later. The following day, Mrs Batchelor complained to practice manager Kenneth Spooner who told her Dr Uwagboe was not first-aid trained and the surgery had been sued several times for treating people in similar circumstances.","21% unsure or wouldn't help someone needing medical attention if off duty .

"Simon Rustage, 47, won £250,00 a year for the next 15 years on a scratchcard yesterday, but today he was back at work as a warehouse stock handler . A warehouse stock handler who won £250,000 a year for the next 15 years on a scratchcard yesterday has been back at work today, despite his huge windfall. Simon Rustage, 47, won the top prize on a £10 ‘Mega Rich’ scratchcard he bought at his local shop in Warrington, Cheshire, and will be paid a total of £3.75million. But today he went back to work as normal, and insists that he has no plans to sell his £220,000 three-bed semi-detached house, or take early retirement. Speaking outside his home  in Warrington, he said: 'I've been working today. I woke up and went and did a full 9-hour shift as usual. 'It might sound strange to some people but I've got no plans to quit my job or sell my house.I think in some ways life will carry on as normal. 'That's not to say I won't spend the money - I know I will.But because it's over a lot of years and not in a lump sum, it takes some of the temptation away. 'Because I was working today I haven't bought anything yet, although I would quite like a new car. 'I'm really happy and as long as my kids are taken care of, that's good enough for me. That's what really matters. 'When I woke up this morning it did feel a bit strange and I know life will be different now. But it will be different in a good way and I'm really looking forward to the future. 'I think I still need a few days for it all to sink in.' Earlier today Melanie Turner, who split from Mr Rustage 15 years ago after the couple had two children together, revealed she's not bitter about her ex's good fortune, but is slightly jealous of his winnings. Scroll down for video . Mr Rustage, who will be handed a total of £3.75million, says he does not plan to quit his job, will not sell his house, and says he hopes life will carry on as normal . Mr Rustage - who lives in this £220,000 three-bed semi-detached house - says he wants to use the money to make sure his children are looked after, but admits he would also like a new car . Mr Rustage went to work for a full nine-hour shift at this warehouse near Warrington today, despite his windfall . Mrs Turner, who has since remarried, told the Daily Mail: ‘I don’t expect I will see any of the money and I wish it had been me that won the lottery, but so long as he carries on looking after the kids then I think it’s great, it’s fantastic that he’s won.’ The 40-year-old carer, who met Mr Rustage in their local pub when she was 17, added: 'His win doesn’t change my opinion of him. 'He’s always paid his CSA and seen the kids, he’s a good dad and granddad. We’ve had our ups and downs, but we’ve been friends throughout.' Mr Rustage told yesterday how he celebrated his life-changing win with his partner of 14 years, Jacqui Webb, 38. ‘She came home and we cracked open a bottle of champagne,’ he said. ‘The money was in my account the same day. I keep having to pinch myself, it still hasn’t really sunk in.’ Mr Rustage, who lives with Miss Webb and their two children, Megan, eight, and Nathan, 14, said he has no plans to move from their £200,000 three-bed semi, in Appleton, Warrington, because ‘it’s a nice area’. Big win: Simon Rustage won £250,000 every year for 15 years on a lottery scratchcard this week . But he admitted he would be swapping his Vauxhall Astra for a flashier car, buying a season ticket to his beloved Warrington Wolves rugby team - costing up to £296 for 2015 - and treating 12 family members and friends to a two-week holiday in Menorca next year. He decided to splash out £10 on the card after winning £120 the day before on a football bet. ‘I don’t usually buy £10 scratchcards, they are a bit expensive,’ he said. ‘But I’d won about £120 the day before and had just been to collect it. I was feeling lucky and thought ‘go on then.’ ‘I scratched it there and then in the shop but I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I had to pass it to the shop assistant who confirmed I had won £250,000. I was just totally shocked. I had to look at the ticket about 40 times, but was absolutely delighted.’ However, it wasn’t until the following morning, when Mr Rustage rang Camelot to confirm his win that he realised the cash was not a one off, but will eventually amount to £3.75million - or £250,000 every year for 15 years. Mr Rustage said he will also be putting some cash away for his granddaughter, Myla-Rose, 20 months, and two older children – soldier son George, 17, and daughter Hannah, 19 - from his marriage to first wife, Mrs Turner. Super fan: The warehouse stock handler says he is not planning to go on a wild spending spree although he might treat himself to is a season ticket for his beloved Warrington Wolves rugby team . Will lightning strike twice? The winning ticket was bought at Bridge Lane Stores in Warrington, Cheshire . Mrs Turner's mother, Sandra Brunt, 63, a retired area manager, said: ‘Simon’s really level headed. ‘He probably doesn’t have it mapped out yet what he’s going to spend it on, but he told me he was pleased it was not coming all in one go. She added: ‘He said that would have been a bit mind blowing, he told me he felt a little bit sick when he first found out. 'We’re just all so pleased, it’s nice to know someone who has won the lottery.’ Mrs Turner said Mr Rustage was planning to pay for Hannah, who also works as a carer, to have driving lessons and to buy a car for both his older children. Baqar Hussain, 50, manager of Bridge Lane Stores, was on duty when Mr Rustage bought his lucky ticket. ‘Simon buys scratch cards in here nearly every day,’ Mr Hussain said. ‘He’s a great guy - everyone is very happy for him. ‘He scratched the card here in the shop and he had to ask me if the ticket was genuine because he was so stunned that he’d won.' Winners: Mr Rustage meets one of his Warrington Wolves heroes, Gareth O'Brien as he celebrates his win . Mr Hussain added: ‘He’s been in here after the win - he hasn’t let the money go to his head. I hope he enjoys spending his winnings.’ Next-door neighbour George Dean said: ‘He came round to tell us that he had some big news. ‘We had no idea what it was and then he told us he’d won a quarter of a million pounds every year for the next 15 years. None of us could believe it - we’re really happy for him. ‘He hasn’t told us what he’s going to spend it on yet - we’ll have to wait and see.’ Mr Rustage’s windfall is the second lottery win at his workplace, transport company Norbert Dentressangle, where a syndicate of staff scooped a £1.7m Lotto Jackpot in January. However, it was six weeks before the syndicate discovered they had won after forgetting to check their ticket.","Simon Rustage bought the winning scratchcard at a shop in Warrington .

"Her fur may be a little matted and her whiskers somewhat scruffy, but when you’re 115 you can be forgiven for letting yourself go just a bit. After turning 24 earlier this year – and hitting 115 in cat years this month – Olive is now laying claim to the title of the world’s oldest cat. But she has a potential catfight on her paws from other felines lining up to claim the distinction. John Burgess, 74, from Partington, Greater Manchester,  said Olive the cat was born in March 1990 . The previous record holder, Poppy from Bournmouth, who was born a month earlier, died in June . Now Mr Burgess has to get Olive recognised officially by Guinness World Records before it becomes official . Olive’s owner John Burgess, 74, says she was born in March 1990 – one month after the previous record holder, Poppy, from Bournemouth, Dorset, who died in June. Mr Burgess, from Partington, Greater Manchester, adopted Olive from a neighbour as a kitten – and it seems she is just as playful today as she was then. ‘Olive has got brilliant, bright eyes and her claws are sharp as anything,’ he said. ‘She still catches birds, frogs and hedgehogs. She’s kept her hearing and sight.’ Olive now needs to be recognised by Guinness World Records to be named the world’s oldest living cat, meaning Mr Burgess would have to provide documentation to support his claim. Yesterday David and Joyce Willey, of Sidmouth, Devon, came forward with Putts, a female tortoiseshell, who they say was born in January 1989 – making her 14 months older than Olive. However, the couple admitted they have no record to prove her age. Olive the cat is 24, or 115 in cat years - which is worked out along the lines of a complicated formula . In July, Pinky the tabby, from Dunston in Lincolnshire, emerged as a contender aged 28, or 129 cat years. Owners Ann and Bob Higginbottom said they had proof she was born in July 1986 but hadn’t yet got in touch with Guinness World Records with Pinky’s certificates. All the cats have a few years to go if they are to catch up with Creme Puff from Austin, Texas, who lived for an astonishing 38 years and three days before her death in August 2005. The formula for calculating cat years equates the first two years of life to 25 human years. Then each additional year counts as four cat years.","Olive the cat was born in March 1990 - making her the world's oldest moggie .

"It started out as a simple disagreement between neighbours over when to open and shut a gate on their shared driveway. But three years – and £100,000 later – the two middle-class couples have been criticised by a judge after their quarrel, which could have been solved for about £5,000, ended up as a bitter feud in court. Mr Justice Norris said he was surprised that retired construction firm director Peter Heslin, 73, and his wife, Marianne, 67, and retired teachers Martin and Rosemary Bradley had been unable to sit around a table and work out a solution. 'Prisoners in our own home': Peter and Marianne Helsin said that they didn't want to 'roll over' because giving the Bradleys control of their £650,000 five-bedroom property would be make it difficult to sell in the future . Centre of the dispute: The gates at the entrance to the driveway which is shared by the neighbours in Formby, Merseyside. The Bradleys' elegant £700,000 Edwardian villa, pictured, is at the front of the site . Instead they had spent what Mr Heslin called a ‘sickening’ amount paying lawyers to take the argument to court. After a three-day hearing in Liverpool in May, the High Court judge in London yesterday ruled a partial victory for the Bradleys, who will be allowed to lock the gates on the driveway to their properties in Formby, Merseyside, between 11pm and 7.30am. But he agreed with the Heslins that the most sensible answer – and much cheaper than legal action – would have been to install a set of electronic gates. Mr Heslin last night said the whole dispute had left him feeling ill. ‘We’ve spent a sickening amount of money on this and the Bradleys have too, but once the legal machine is rolling it’s impossible to get off without giving in,’ he said. ‘We’re determined to fight until a judge finally sees through the claptrap and orders for electronic gates to be installed. ‘That has been the obvious solution all along, but for some reason the Bradleys have refused point blank to have them. Lawyers: Retired teacher Martin Bradley and his wife Rosemary instructed solicitors after Mr Heslin padlocked one of the gates permanently open . ‘A set of electronic gates would have cost around £5,000, but with the amount we’ve already spent we could have had a pair of gold-plated gates by now.’ Mr Heslin said they didn’t want to ‘roll over’ because giving the Bradleys control of access to their £650,000 five-bedroom property would make it difficult to sell in future. He added: ‘Forcing the gates to be shut at night is a partial victory for them. We do feel like prisoners in our own home.’ Problems began in August 2011 when the Bradleys, who have lived in an elegant £700,000 Edwardian villa for 28 years, began routinely shutting the front gate for security reasons following a break-in at a neighbouring property. The Heslins’ home, which sits directly behind the Bradleys’ back garden and swimming pool, can only be accessed by a driveway down the side via a shared set of 4ft-wide wrought iron gates. They claimed that shutting the gates to their property, which they have owned since 2006, was inconvenient and dangerous because they would have to stop and park the car at the roadside each time they came home. Mr Heslin claims he spoke to Mr Bradley, 67, who agreed to look into getting a quote for electronic gates. But he said the Bradleys took umbrage when, in December 2011, after months of inaction, the Heslins got a quote themselves. Things came to a head in August 2012 when, following no further progress, Mr Heslin padlocked one of the gates permanently open. This was the last time either couple spoke to each other and led to the Bradleys instructing solicitors. Mrs Heslin said: ‘We offered to pay for electronic gates in full but they just won’t have it.’ She said the Bradleys had offered one objection after another to electronic gates, including fears that children would destroy post left in a mail box outside. She added: ‘Now I think it’s all about saving face.’ The judge said: ‘Sensible neighbours would have sat round a table and worked out either a regime for closing the gates at agreed hours or the installation of remotely-operated electric gates.’ Last night the Bradleys were unavailable for comment.

"Alan Henning – the second British hostage to be murdered by ISIS terrorists – was an ‘ordinary’ taxi driver compelled to travel to Syria to help child refugees in the war-torn country. Originally from Salford, Greater Manchester, he had seen the suffering first hand during a life-changing visit to a refugee camp, which inspired him to help the innocents whose lives were being wrecked by the conflict. After volunteering with a Muslim charity, the 47-year-old married father-of-two agreed to drive 3,000 miles in a convoy of old ambulances to help the aid effort and take much-needed medical supplies to hospitals in the northern Syrian province of Idlib. Scroll down for video . Originally from Salford, Greater Manchester, Alan Henning, was an ordinary taxi driver compelled to travel to Syria to help child refugees in the war-torn country . Known as ‘Gadget’ to friends and family for his fondness for technology, Mr Henning had been washing cars in the UK to raise money for donations before setting off on his fourth visit to the country. He travelled with eight others from charity Al-Fathiha Global, who intended to deliver vital equipment, including NHS ambulances packed with baby milk, nappies, food and defibrillators, but was kidnapped by Islamic State extremists on Boxing Day, shortly after making the 4,000-mile journey to the town of Al-Dana. Footage emerged three weeks ago of the keen fisherman looking ill and exhausted as he knelt before the knife-wielding militant nicknamed Jihadi John at the end of the chilling video of the barbaric murder of aid worker David Haines. Last night the terrorist’s threat that Mr Henning would become the next British hostage to be killed if David Cameron persisted 'in fighting the Islamic State' appeared to have been carried out. His death comes just two days after his wife of 23 years Barbara Henning, 45, appeared on camera to make a heart-breaking plea to his captors to spare his life. Tearfully, she said Mr Henning, 47, was 'in the right place, doing the right thing' when he travelled to Syria to deliver aid. Mr Henning travelled with eight others from charity Al-Fathiha Global, who intended to deliver vital equipment, including NHS ambulances packed with baby milk, nappies, food and defibrillators . Footage emerged three weeks ago of the keen fisherman looking ill and exhausted as he knelt before the knife-wielding militant nicknamed Jihadi John . She described her husband as a ‘peaceful, selfless man’ and begged ISIS to show him mercy. Earlier she had revealed that she had heard her husband’s voice just once over the past nine months – in an audio message sent by his captors in which he could be heard begging for his life. Neighbours living near his family's red-brick terrace house in Eccles, Greater Manchester, where the couple had lived for a decade, covered their community with yellow ribbons in a show of support for Mr Henning, his wife and their children Lucy, 17, and Adam, 15. ‘Free Alan’ ribbons were attached to cars, gates and lampposts and more than 100 friends and well-wishers attended a vigil for all faiths last week to pray for his safe return. Muslim leaders across the globe also urged the Islamic terrorists to show mercy to Mr Henning, who was 'an ordinary guy just trying to help women and kids.’ They said killing Mr Henning is against shariah law and would be the 'worst condemnable sin' against Islam. A fan of Phil Collins, which he enjoyed playing as he drove, Mr Henning was incredibly popular and during one trip insisted on sleeping inside his ambulance instead of a hotel to save money so it could be donated to the refugees instead. Mr Henning's death comes just two days after his wife Barbara, pictured, made a tearful plea to his captors to release him . BBC documentary maker Catrin Nye, who met Mr Henning when he was packing an aid convoy bound for Syria, said he had no formal background in aid work, but felt a 'pull' to return to Syria after a previous trip to a refugee camp. 'He was a funny man and was cracking jokes while we were packing up,' Ms Nye said. 'He told me that he'd been on one of those convoys previously and he was inspired by his friends who'd been, and since he'd got back he'd found it hard not to return. 'He's a taxi driver, not a professional aid worker - but he said he looked at the world differently [after he returned] and felt a pull to go back to Syria. 'He was very popular and friends would comment that he was very funny and very kind. 'He described holding the children ... and how that really affected him. He told me he had to go back.' Last week people held a candlelit vigil for Mr Henning near his home in Eccles Park, Greater Manchester . ‘Free Alan’ yellow ribbons were also attached to cars, gates and lampposts as a show of support for Mr Henning's family . Kasim Jameel, leader of the convoy on which Mr Henning was travelling when he was kidnapped, described his friend as a ‘big softie.’ Dr Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, who was also in the convoy, said Mr Henning was ‘remarkable.’ ‘He’s such a compassionate and selfless human being,’ she said. ‘It just simply wasn’t enough for Alan to sit back and just donate or raise awareness. He had to get up and do something about what he’d seen Every time the convoys went he had a yearning to go. That really motivated him, to see, practically, first-hand the difference he was making.’ But after the Ministry of Defence announced that RAF Tornados had attacked IS targets inside Iraq – many feared a backlash against Mr Henning. Relatives and colleagues said they feared air strikes would make it harder for him to be found alive. Last night it appeared their worst fears had been realised. Majid Freeman, from Leicester, who worked with Mr Henning in Syria said he appeared to have been 'abandoned' to his fate by the Government and the decision to join US-led airstrikes may have 'sealed his fate'. 'We have been pressuring the Government into doing something to secure his release but they abandoned him. The British Government left him out there,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'Turkey managed to release 49 hostages without paying a single penny. The British Government all they had to do was release one hostage.' The longer-than-previous delay after a video threat to kill Mr Henning had suggested they were at least open to sparing him, Mr Freeman told Today. 'However the Government have done nothing at all to help his case. If anything, they voted for air strikes which may have sealed his fate.'","Mr Henning travelled to Syria after previously visiting a refugee camp .

"When a cherished religious icon went missing from Chester Cathedral, police spent a month trawling CCTV footage to catch the culprit. And officers were astonished when their investigation led them not only to the painting but a haul of other artworks – all behind the door of a terraced house. More than 30 paintings, mostly depicting Jesus, were discovered on the wall of one room alone, crammed into the property alongside scores of crucifixes and busts. Officers are now trying to find out how many of them were stolen. Police discovered the large stash of religious icons inside a family home in Crewe after the unusual theft . They were looking for The Raising of Lazarus, which stood on the altar in the cathedral’s chapel of St Anselm until it was stolen last month. Painted on a wooden board, the icon, which is around 8in by 12in, was donated to the cathedral seven years ago by the family of the former dean of Chester, Ingram Cleasby. The chapel had been roped off but was recently opened up to the public with the altar guarded only by a 17th century rail. The painting was snatched some time between August 15 and 18 and a plastic Christmas angel was put in its place. Officers have spent the past month scouring CCTV from Chester city centre to try to trace the culprits. Yesterday Chief Superintendent Andy Southcott, of Cheshire constabulary, said the haul was found following old-fashioned policing. ‘While the number of heritage crimes committed in Cheshire is very low, it can have a high impact on the community,’ Mr Southcott said. ‘It can deprive people from viewing important paintings and also means they are lost to future generations. It is something Cheshire police take very seriously.’ Chris Jones, head constable at the cathedral, said: ‘The piece was an important addition to the chapel of St Anselm and helped to enhance the experience of our visitors and our worshippers. ‘We would like to thank the Cheshire Constabulary team for all their hard work on the case and for their ongoing support in the fight against heritage crime.’ Four men and a woman, aged between 31 and 59, were arrested at the terraced house in Crewe on suspicion of theft. The priceless 18th century icon was stolen from Chester Cathedral sometime between August 15 and 18 .","Police were called after a priceless icon was stolen from Chester Cathedral .

"A teenage girl who died after injecting herself with insulin may have taken it to try to lose weight. Charlie Dunne, 19, used an insulin pen belonging to her diabetic boyfriend while he was out at a hospital appointment. An inquest heard the trainee hairdresser may have taken the hormone previously after hearing that it could help slimmers. Miss Dunne with boyfriend Terence Rhoden. He found the teenager unconscious on the living room floor of their home after he returned from hospital and realised she had taken his insulin . But the teenager, who was fit and healthy, would have been unaware of the ‘catastrophic’ danger the drug posed to non-diabetics, a coroner said. Miss Dunne was discovered collapsed at the home in Atherton, Greater Manchester, she shared with boyfriend Terence Rhoden, 28, when he returned hours later. Loss: Charlie Dunne, 19, injected herself with an insulin pen belonging to diabetic boyfriend Terence Rhoden. She died in hospital a few days later . She suffered brain damage caused by a dramatic drop in blood sugar and died in hospital six days later. Police later investigated claims by Miss Dunne’s family that Mr Rhoden had confessed to injecting her with insulin in the past to help her lose weight. But he denied doing so and officers found no evidence that he was involved in his girlfriend’s death. Bolton Coroner’s Court was told that ‘bubbly’ Miss Dunne was a regular at her local Methodist church, where she was given the community title of ‘rose queen’ for her charity fundraising. However, the inquest was told she suffered mood swings and had tried to overdose on tablets during a previous relationship. She also claimed to have suffered a miscarriage and was worried she could not have children, despite a lack of medical evidence to support her fears. The court heard that Mr Rhoden was woken when Miss Dunne returned from her local pub in an ‘agitated’ state on December 17 last year and threatened to take painkillers. She told him to leave, saying he was ‘too good for her’. After talking, she calmed down and fell asleep on the sofa. Mr Rhoden left for his appointment at around 7am the next day, but arrived home to find his insulin pen on the couch ‘down the cushion, kind of sticking out’. ‘It was a brand new one,’ he said. ‘The box was in the bin. When I found the insulin pen it was empty.’ The court heard that the 100ml pens used by Mr Rhoden, who has suffered with diabetes for seven years and needs insulin injections four times a day, contain between 60 and 100 doses. Miss Dunne was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital, where doctors discovered her blood glucose levels had plummeted. She died on December 23. Her uncle, Andrew Dunne, claimed Mr Rhoden told him his niece had taken insulin before. The builder said the pair had ‘heard somewhere, like the pub, that insulin could help you lose a bit of weight’. The hearing was told Mr Rhoden (left) talked about insulin injections with Miss Dunne’s uncle Andrew Dunne (right) as she was being kept on a ventilator in hospital the day after her admission . Det Insp Paul Rollinson of Greater Manchester Police confirmed Mr Rhoden’s account was correct and an examination of Miss Dunne’s phones showed nothing to suggest the relationship was volatile . Philip Dunne (centre), the victim's father said: 'Charlie would never take her own life and would never take drugs as far as I’m aware and was very anti-drugs' He added: ‘He did say that two weeks prior he had given her an injection to see if it worked.’ Mr Rhoden said his girlfriend knew how to inject the drug, but denied helping her inject herself or seeing her take the hormone. Her parents, Michelle and Philip Dunne, told the hearing their daughter would not have committed suicide and was ‘anti-drugs’. ‘[She] would never do anything like suicide because it was selfish and all it does is upset the family left behind,’ said Mrs Dunne. Recording a verdict of misadventure, coroner Alan Walsh said: ‘It’s likely that this was a cry for attention that had the most dramatic and catastrophic consequence.’","Charlie Dunne, 19, died after using Terence Rhoden's medication .

"A boy of two had to wait more than ten hours in an accident and emergency department for treatment to a gash on his head. Alex Bellis was taken to casualty at 9pm on Saturday after he fell and cut his head on a wrought iron table. But he was not seen until 7am the next morning, when medics said the gash had ‘healed itself’ and sent him home with Calpol. Last night Alex’s grandfather, Stuart Roberts, 64, said the youngster’s experience was ‘disgusting’. Ordeal: Alex Bellis, pictured with his mother Ceri Roberts and grandfather Stuart Roberts, had to wait ten hours in A&E . ‘A two-year-old should not be waiting for ten hours to be seen,’ he said. ‘It’s not right. That kind of wait is ridiculous. ‘I know the nurses and doctors work hard, but it just isn’t good enough.’ The accident happened while the family was at a restaurant in Chester. Alex was climbing on a chair when he slipped and fell, cutting the back of his head on the metal table. His parents, Ceri Roberts, 26, and 27-year-old Dean Bellis, a refuse collector, initially took their son to nearby Countess of Chester Hospital. But they were told there was a four-hour wait and doctors agreed to let them take their son to Wrexham Maelor Hospital, which is closer to their home in Coedpoeth, north Wales, in the hope he would be seen sooner. When they arrived there, a triage nurse told the couple Alex’s cut would need to be ‘glued’, which is an alternative to having stitches. The two-year-old was taken to casualty at 9pm on Saturday after he fell and cut his head on a wrought iron table while out for dinner with his family at a restaurant in Chester . She reassured them it was a ‘two-minute job’, but Alex was not seen by a doctor until the next morning. Miss Roberts, a full-time mother who is pregnant, said: ‘My partner Dean and I were passing Alex back and forth. ‘He was uncomfortable but eventually went to sleep, although we didn’t. I’m 21 weeks pregnant so sleeping is uncomfortable enough as it is. It was ridiculous. A lot of people, when they were told of the wait, simply got up and left, but we didn’t want to take any chances. ‘They were apologetic, but it was shocking that we were made to wait so long.’ A nurse at Wrexham Maelor Hospital said Alex needed his head glued whcih she says was a 'two-minute job' - but he was not seen until 7am the next day, when he was sent home with Calpol . She added: ‘Whether other patients were going straight in to see a doctor I’ve no idea, but it didn’t even seem that busy to me. ‘We only saw a couple of drunk people arrive in the early hours. It wasn’t heaving like you would expect on a Saturday night. We couldn’t understand it.’ Professor Matthew Makin, of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which runs Wrexham Maelor Hospital, said: ‘We wish to apologise to Alex and his family for their long wait. ‘Saturday night was exceptionally busy, with a higher than normal number of patients attending the emergency department. ‘Each patient was assessed by the triage nurse and seen by medical staff in order of clinical need. We would be happy to discuss these concerns with the family.’ There has been growing concern over waiting times in the NHS in Wales, which is run separately from services in England. Last week coroner John Gittins demanded urgent action from health bosses following the death of 73-year-old Clive Turner, who waited five hours for an ambulance and a further two hours in the same A&E department at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, before being mis-diagnosed by doctors.","Alex Bellis was taken to Wrexham Maelor Hospital, north Wales, at 9pm .

"An investigation has been launched after an ambulance controller was pictured apparently asleep on the job. A photograph by a colleague allegedly shows Kim Fullerton, a performance manager with North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), having a nap during a night shift. It was leaked by a whistleblower who claimed that when it was taken Mrs Fullerton was supposed to be monitoring 999 calls on her computer. However, it is unclear whether the 51-year-old was on a work break and thus entitled to a nap, with the photo taken in jest.

Ambulance dispatcher Daniel Manning also appears smiling in the snap taken at Elm House, in Anfield, Liverpool, the control base where staff answer emergency calls for NWAS. Bosses at NWAS confirmed they had launched an inquiry into the allegations. The whistleblower told a local newspaper that Mrs Fullerton was supposed to be looking at emergency jobs on her screen when her eyes were shut. Mr Manning should have been at his desk waiting to dispatch ambulances to respond to the 999 calls. A spokesman for NWAS admitted a performance manager’s job is to monitor call activity, ensuring all 999 calls are answered and categorised, but dispatchers and call handlers do not always sit at their desks throughout their shifts. They can get up and walk around, take breaks and speak to colleagues, she added. Last night, Mrs Fullerton declined to comment on the photograph when approached by the Daily Mail at her home in West Derby, Liverpool. Building: . The image was taken at Elm House (pictured) in Anfield, Liverpool, . where staff answer emergency calls for the North West Ambulance Service . Michael Forrest, director of organisational development for NWAS, said: ‘The North West Ambulance Service takes any allegation about the conduct of its staff extremely seriously and has launched a full investigation into the circumstances in which this picture was taken.’ The allegation comes at a time when NWAS is under intense pressure following an unprecedented rise in the number of calls. Red calls – those requiring help for seriously ill patients – were up 12.1 per cent in July compared with the previous year. Rosie Cooper, Labour MP for Southport and Ormskirk, who last week claimed lives were being lost because staff are trying to cut corners and not dispatch ambulances unless absolutely necessary, said: ‘This picture raises serious questions for NWAS, especially in light of the news stories of poor performance recently. ‘NWAS need to investigate urgently and assure the public that, when they need an ambulance, the performance manager isn’t asleep and that they properly supervise their employees – after all, it’s precious public money and can’t be wasted.’ Despite the increased workload, NWAS is meeting strict Government targets that demand at least 75 per cent of calls for the most serious cases are dealt with within eight minutes.","Photo shows Kim Fullerton and ambulance despatcher Daniel Manning .

"Rat fear: Tony and Rebecca Bell from Tottington, near Bury, pictured with their daughter Hermione think their garden will be overrun with vermin . Some families are to be made to wait three weeks to have their household rubbish collected, it was revealed yesterday. A new wave of cutbacks means that one council has announced that bins containing general waste destined for landfill will be emptied every 21 days. Between times, the 180,000 residents of Bury, near Manchester, get only their recycling bins emptied. Despite residents’ anger, there were warnings that the new policy is likely to spread rapidly to other councils. The move is a blow for Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who has been campaigning volubly – to no avail – for councils to bring back weekly collections for all rubbish. His ministers condemned the decision by Labour-controlled Bury and accused the party of having ‘an agenda of monthly bin collections’. But there was no criticism from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which has been pressing councils to increase their efforts to enforce recycling to hit EU targets . The three-weekly system is being pioneered by one council in each of England, Scotland and Wales and yesterday the Local Government Association (LGA) gave the green light for others to follow. For the past three years, binmen in Bury have collected general rubbish meant for landfill once a fortnight. There have also been fortnightly collections of garden and food waste. Rubbish for recycling – such as glass, plastic, metal paper and cardboard – has been collected once a month. From October, the grey general rubbish bins will be emptied only once every three weeks. The announcement has enraged residents. Rebecca and Tony Bell of Tottington, near Bury fear their garden will be overrun with rats if they wait three weeks between rubbish collections. They they are committed to recycling but even so their grey waste bin is always full after a fortnight. ‘There are just some things that have to go in the rubbish bin,’ said Mrs Bell. ‘We even try to use washable nappies as much as possible, but we do use some disposables and having them in the bin for three weeks would be just horrible. ‘One of my friends said there is already a rat problem where they live and it will only get worse. ‘Council tax is going up but the service is going down.’ Retired taxi driver Victor Hagan, 69, said: ‘It’s a scandalous idea. The streets will end up a mess. There will be rats and more fly-tipping, it’s absolutely disgusting.’ One resident wrote on the council website: ‘Don’t I already pay to have my bins taken away? Can I opt out of paying council tax for refuse collection and get someone else to do it?’ First: Bury Council wants to become the first in England to collect its main household bin once every three weeks, suggesting it will save £1million a year . Doretta Cocks, of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collections, warned: ‘If Bury get away with this, all the others will follow. After that they will move to monthly collections. They don’t really want to collect the rubbish at all – they would rather make us all use private waste contractors.’ But the LGA said: ‘There is no one size-fits-all solution when it comes to bins, and councils will always work with householders to find the best way to collect the waste in their particular area. Our polling shows that the vast majority of people are happy with the way their bins are collected.’ Bury council said it aims to drive up household recycling rates to 50 per cent. Environment chief Tony Isherwood said: ‘Most households will continue to have a collection of at least one type of waste every week. Treatment and disposal of waste from grey bins costs us around £10.2million per year. A lot of this waste could be recycled. We know we can and must do more. Despite residents’ anger, there were warnings that the new policy is likely to spread rapidly to other councils. Anger: Bury residents have started leaving messages on the council website criticising the decision and explaining that the current fortnightly regime is not even adequate .

"Ukip leader Nigel Farage has come under criticism from Prime Minister David Cameron . Another Ukip council candidate was facing suspension last night for posting a stream of ‘crackpot’ homophobic and anti-Muslim comments on Twitter and Facebook. Harry Perry, who is standing in Stockport, said ‘Islam is evil,’ claimed homosexuality was an ‘abomination before God’ and described David Cameron as a ‘gay-loving nutcase’. The disclosures emerged as the Prime Minister yesterday attacked Nigel Farage’s party as ‘discredited’. Mr Cameron, launching the Conservatives’ local election campaign, said: ‘I don’t need to discredit Ukip – they do a good enough job themselves.’ He has recently sought to avoid direct criticism of Ukip, which appears on course to top the poll in elections to the European Parliament later this month. But he spoke out after a series of controversies involving Ukip candidates and donors accused of sexism, racism and homophobia. Mr Perry’s comments came to light after he sent a private message to the Liberal Democrat general election candidate, Lisa Smart, on Facebook. One of them said all three mainstream parties were seeking to ‘change our culture as fast as possible without permission from the white indigenous population’, before adding: ‘Don’t you know Lisa that God hates ­homosexuality, you cannot be a Christian and support the gay issue.’ Miss Smart said: ‘People should know what they are voting for on May 22.’ Mr Perry, who was unavailable for comment last night, also said Islam was ‘evil’ and called for Pakistan to be ‘nuked’. Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall, pictured with Nigel Farage, is investigating Mr Perry's claims . Ukip deputy leader Paul Nuttall confirmed the party would investigate. The revelations will heap ­further embarrassment on Ukip. Earlier this week another candidate, in North London, tweeted that comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black ­country’ and compared Islam to the Third Reich. William Henwood later resigned his membership of the party.","Council candidate Harry Perry posted homophobic and anti-Muslim comments on Twitter and Facebook .

"A murderer is still on the run today after absconding from an open prison over the weekend. Arnold Pickering, who stabbed a blind man to death, was given day release despite having absconded from jail at least three times. Thomas Moffett, a violent thief and fellow inmate who was also on temporary licence, also absconded on the same day from the same prison. Last night Moffett was arrested and being held in custody. Their escape comes a fortnight after Michael ‘Skull Cracker’ Wheatley absconded from an open prison and allegedly robbed a building society before being caught four days later. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling this morning promised to 'tear up' the current day release programme and suggested prisoners who had a history of escaping would no longer be allowed out. It came after MPs attacked the 'absolute scandal' of murderers being allowed out of prison 'willy nilly'. On the run: Arnold Pickering (left), a convicted murderer is still missing while robber Thomas Moffett (right) has been found in Blackburn . In 1991, a judge said Pickering . appointed himself as an ‘executioner’ when he decided to kill . 53-year-old Thomas Leigh, who was wrongly thought to be a paedophile. He . was serving 18 years for that murder when he went missing on Saturday. His three previous escapes have been from Strangeways in Manchester and . open prisons in Lancashire and Sussex. A spokesman said last night: . ‘Merseyside Police can confirm that officers from Lancashire . Constabulary have arrested a 51-year-old man tonight, Sunday, 18 May for . being unlawfully at large. ‘The man was arrested in Blackburn, Lancashire at around 9.15pm. ‘Enquiries are continuing to locate Arnold Pickering, 44 years, who failed to return to HMP Kennet yesterday afternoon.’ Pickering, 44, and Moffett, 51, . had been allowed out from HMP Kennet – an open category C prison in . Maghull, Merseyside – at 9.30am on Saturday. They failed to return as . agreed at 4.30pm. Moffett, . who has swastika tattoos on his arms, was jailed for seven years in 2006 . for a two-month spree of ‘professionally executed robberies’. He . threatened shop workers with a nail gun in a series of raids on off-licences in Blackburn. He was caught after an employee slipped an . explosive dye pack into a bundle of cash. Last night Jeremy Wright, the prisons minister, vowed to make major changes to day release as a matter of urgency. Crime: The men failed to return to prison after leaving HMP Kennet, in Maghull, at around 9.30am on Saturday morning . The day release programme is designed to help prisoners settle back into ordinary life towards the end of their sentence by allowing them to attend work or training. But it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed, dangeours criminals. The Government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers, druglords and other hardened criminals were granted day release last year. Last July, Ian McLoughlin (pictured above) was convicted of murdering Graham Buck in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire, while on day release. Murderer Joseph Williams carried out 11 armed raids on bookmakers after being handed a release pass in 2010. And Mark Neville, a drug dealer, spent his day out of prison in 2008 overseeing a £14million cocaine deal. Last week it was revealed more than 400 killers were kept in open prisons, which have minimal supervision. From . now on prisoners must ‘earn’ the right to go out on temporary licence, . he said. Monitoring of offenders will also be tightened, including with . tagging. In a strongly . worded statement, Mr Wright said: ‘I am not prepared to see public . safety compromised. The system for allowing prisoners out on temporary . licence has been too lax until now and we are making major changes to . address this. 'I am not prepared to see public . safety compromised. The system for allowing prisoners out on temporary . licence has been too lax up till now and we are making major changes to . address this' ‘Temporary release can be an important tool in helping offenders reintegrate but not at the cost of public protection.’ Justice Secretary Chris Grayling this morning added: 'I'm not happy with the way things are at the moment. 'Although the number of people absconding is tiny, we've seen in the last few months a number of serious offences committed by people on temporary licence. But we are tearing up the system as it exist at moment.' Mr Grayling said he would ban prisoners being allowed to walk around town centres.He said: 'Town-leavers will only be allowed out on temporary licence to do something tangible like a day's work. 'Serious offenders will be subject to a much stricter risk assessment. And I can't see why we allow back into open conditions people who have absconded before, so I'm looking at moving reforms in that area quickly. 'People who have absconded cannot go back to open conditions. These changes will happen within next few weeks.' But prison officers said overcrowding and job cuts were to blame for the escapes. Peter McParlin, chairman of the Prison Officers Association, said: 'We have been saying for many years now that we have overcrowding in the prison estate, people are being put into open conditions who are unsuitable for open conditions. 'Twenty prisons have closed in the last three years and prison staff numbers have reduced by 6,000 since 2010. ""There is immense pressure on the system and it is clear to me that the tick box mentality that goes into transferring prisoners to open conditions has failed the public. Tory . MP Philip Davies added: ‘Convicted murderers should not be released on . temporary licence, it’s common sense, the public are being put at . unnecessary risk. The idea that there is a robust risk assessment in . place is for the birds, the system is in complete shambles. ‘If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny, but these are dangerous people who the public deserve to be protected against.’ He said the disappearances were an 'absolute scandal' and questioned why convicted murderers were ever given temporary release when figures which he obtained through parliamentary answers showed 106 had absconded in the past 10 years. The Tory MP said that when he tabled an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill currently going through Parliament which would have prevented the temporary release of murderers, it was blocked by the Government. He said: 'It is an absolute scandal in the prison system. How on earth people like this can ever be given temporary release from prison on licence is beyond me. 'This is a regular occurence - murderers are walking out of prison willy nilly. It's a joke. I'm exasperated. I think the whole system is completely ridiculous.' A . spokesman for Merseyside police said both Pickering and Moffett had . been ‘risk assessed’ as suitable for release, but warned the public not . to approach them and to call officers instead. Pickering was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years for stabbing Mr Leigh to death in Oldham. But . he absconded while in the exercise yard of Strangeways prison and later . went on the run from Kirkham open prison in Lancashire after being let . out to empty bins in Manchester city centre. Armed robber Michael Wheatley, AKA the Skull Cracker, went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison . Kent Police issued this mugshot of 'Skull Cracker' Michael Wheatley, after he went missing while temporarily being allowed out of prison earlier this month . He . disappeared from Ford open prison in Sussex in 2006 and spent nine days . on the run before being caught in a flat in Bournemouth. A . third prisoner who absconded from HMP Kennet two months ago remains on . the loose. Robert Gavin, 36, disappeared on March 23 and police say the . robber poses a risk to some former contacts. An urgent review is currently taking place into why Wheatley was allowed temporary day release earlier this month. Despite . going on the run twice beforehand, the robber was allowed to walk out . of Standford Hill open prison in Kent where he was serving 13 life . sentences. He was eventually . caught in East London on May 7 after spending almost four days on the . run and has since been charged with robbing the Chelsea Building . Society, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, at gunpoint. Last . year, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick said HMP Kennet had . ‘needlessly restrictive’ security for an open prison. Located near . Liverpool, the prison is home to almost 350 men and is located next to . Ashworth high security hospital,  which houses Moors murderer Ian Brady. Pickering . is about 5ft 11in, of medium build and with blue eyes. He has tattoos . on his arms and chest.","Arnold Pickering, 44, from Chadderton, Manchester, convicted of murder .

"A married bank worker who stole more than £2million from Barclays and squandered it on prostitutes has been jailed for seven years. John Skermer, 45, set up fake bank accounts with overdrafts of £1million, then siphoned the money into his personal account. He spent almost all the cash on call girls, lavishing £1million on one escort alone. The computer geek spent months wining and dining the Thai woman, known as Kookai, travelling to London from his Cheshire home and taking her to expensive hotels and restaurants. John Skermer, with his wife Tracy, leaving court in Runcorn. Skermer stole more than £2million from Barclays and spent it on prostitutes . All the while Skermer's wife of ten years, Tracy, 33, with whom he has two young sons, was in the dark about his infidelity. He explained nights away from the family in Widnes by saying he was 'working with the police' investigating fraud. Skermer's . position as head of an IT security team allowed him to steal more than . £2.1million from the bank undetected over five years. But the fraud was eventually discovered when a routine security update at the bank logged the fake accounts. Bosses asked Skermer to investigate, but he confessed and police were called in. Chester Crown Court heard that Skermer, who pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud, also spent some money on luxury golfing days, tickets to see Manchester United and a £35,000 Audi 4x4. Skermer paid some of the cash to Thai call girl Auchareeya Pruankaewmanee (pictured) He began working as a software engineer for Barclays in 2008, identifying and eliminating 'ghost' accounts which had been created but not allocated to any customer. However he then worked out how to alter such accounts, setting them up to transfer money into his own account. Investigators from the City of London police's fraud unit discovered that he had paid at least ten different call girls with the bank's cash. It included £996,999 to one Thai prostitute named Auchareeya Pruankaewmanee, 43, who was also known as Kookai. Skermer's wife Tracy outside court (left) and Skermer (right), who pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud . She was based in London and he had a relationship with her for much of last year. The former waitress apparently turned to escorting seven years ago after she split from her husband Ryan Osborne, 38, from Barnsley. Her former father-in-law, Alan Osborne, 59, said last night that she was a 'lovely' but 'naive' girl. Skermer told the escorts he was a wealthy businessman, and often transferred money from the bank directly into their accounts for payment. A source close to the investigation told the Daily Mail: 'He spent time on this Thai escort, wining and dining her, but there were also around ten others. Mrs Skermer had no idea what was going on, she is another victim of his scam.' David Rose, defending, told the court that once bosses discovered the ghost accounts, Skermer 'knew the game was up'. He confessed and helped investigators recoup £722,000 of the stolen cash, and handed over his car. Sentencing Skermer last week, Mukhtar Hussain, the recorder at Chester, said it was 'clear' that the fraud was 'well thought out'. Mrs Skermer, a maths teacher, is understood to be 'devastated' by her husband's actions, which she found out about just before Christmas. The marital home, a large £400,000 four-bedroomed townhouse on a smart new estate, is up for sale. Detective Constable Graeme Ord, from the City of London police, said: 'Skermer has rightly received a long prison sentence for this large-scale fraud. We hope this case shows the cooperation between banks and police, and acts as a deterrent to others.' Last night Miss Pruankaewmanee could not be contacted for comment.","John Skermer set up fake bank accounts with overdrafts of £1m .

"A former pilot who killed his estranged wife in a car crash after disabling her airbag and unbuckling her seatbelt was jailed for at least 24 years yesterday. Iain Lawrence deliberately smashed into a tree in an attempt to commit  ‘the perfect murder’ hours after he and 47-year-old Sally had an ‘acrimonious’ row over their divorce. Lawrence, 53, claimed the tragedy was an accident caused by an excruciating leg spasm that made him lose control of his Peugeot 406. 'Cunning': A court sketch shows Iain Lawrence in . the dock at Leicester Crown Court, where he was found guilty of murdering . his wife Sally, right, by deliberately crashing his car into a tree . Cynical: Mr Lawrence's Peugeot 406, pictured before the collision, which he drove at 50mph into a tree with no attempt to do an emergency stop . But a jury decided he killed his . businesswoman wife because he could not accept that their marriage was . over, and convicted him by an 11-1 majority. Company director Lawrence, who was . sacked as an airline pilot in 2007, was jailed for life with a minimum . of 24 years. Mr Justice Leggatt QC told him he had ‘executed with . meticulous planning and efficiency’ a ‘ruthless and vile’ crime. ‘You thought that the crash would be . seen as a tragic accident and that you would get away with murder,’ he . said. ‘You would indeed have done so if it had not been for the thorough . police investigation.’ The judge said the couple’s ten-year-old son will have to live with the knowledge that his mother was murdered by his father. During a 12-day trial, Leicester Crown . Court heard the couple had separated and Mrs Lawrence, who had two . adult daughters from a previous marriage, had begun a new relationship. But they were still living in the £300,000 marital home in Oadby, . Leicester. Nirmal Shant QC, prosecuting, accused . Lawrence of trying ‘to plot the perfect  murder’. Gartree Road near Leicester, where Mrs Lawrrence died. The court heard the passenger's side airbag had been turned off . Tragedy: Sally Lawrence had warned a friends that estranged husband Iain Lawrence: 'One day he will kill me' She told the jury that . the couple had an acrimonious discussion about the division of their . assets the day before the crash in October last year. Later Mrs Lawrence told one of her daughters in a text message that her husband wanted more than half of the house. The jury were told the crash was . staged while the couple’s son was away on a school trip. Lawrence used . ‘trickery or force’ to get his wife – who had told friends she feared he . would kill her and would never normally travel in a car with him – into . the vehicle. It careered off a bend on a quiet . country road at 52mph. The passenger side received the brunt of the . collision and Mrs Lawrence, the managing director of a business which . specialised in cleaning up chemical spills, was found to be dead at the . scene. The court heard that she was . ‘fanatical’ about being strapped in, but was not on this occasion. Lawrence, who frequently did not wear his belt, was strapped in, . adopted the ‘brace’ position, and escaped with minor injuries. Accident investigators found that the car’s passenger airbag had been turned off for six journeys before Mrs Lawrence’s death. Lawrence of Knighton, Leicester, . denied murder, claiming his wife had willingly got into his car so that . they could take some wood from their garden to a tip. In an impact statement to the court, . Mrs Lawrence’s sister, Catherine Kudhail, described the killing as ‘a . monstrous act of utter cruelty’ and revealed that one of Mrs . Lawrence’s children is now plagued by suicidal thoughts. She added: ‘Sally was an inspirational, caring, kind woman with a huge heart.’ The Lawrences' £300,000 family home in Oadby, which the couple still shared.

"Having already attracted more than four million visitors, the Tower of London poppies looked set to cause chaos for police on the last day of the half-term break yesterday. On Friday, officials even urged the public not to visit amid fears of an unseemly and dangerous crush. In the event, however, they needn’t have worried. For while their pleas fell on deaf ears, those who turned out in their tens of thousands were a picture of dignity. Determined: Thousands of visitors flocked to the Tower of London’s poppy display today despite calls from organisers to cancel weekend visits because of overcrowding . Waiting: visitors queue for the installation, with lines of people stretching on to Tower Bridge as far as the eye can see . Dedicated: Crowds queue around the moat to get a glimpse of the sea of scarlet on the display's penultimate weekend . As the rain poured, orderly queues eight-deep huddled under umbrellas not just around the Tower itself but in a line across Tower Bridge. Come November 11, Armistice Day, there will be 888,246 ceramic poppies in the Tower of London’s mighty moat – one for each of the British and Colonial soldiers, sailors and airmen who perished in the Great War. Volunteers will start to take them away the day after November 11 and perhaps this is the reason why so many felt the weekend provided their only opportunity to glimpse the art installation – called Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red. One mother said she had braved the rain because her six-year-old daughter, Elina, was determined to see the poppies. Lucy Ward, 25, from Chiswick, West London, said: ‘She really wanted to come…she said she really cared about it. 'It’s important for children to know. My great great grandfather fought in the war and I was telling her about it when we were walking round.’ Nearing the end: The Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation will be finished on Remembrance Day, November 11 . Success: Up to four million people from around the world have now visited the exhibition at the Tower of London . Congestion: Officials from Historic Royal Palaces, which manages the exhibition, warned that Saturday and Sunday would be be exceptionally busy . Visitors crowd around the moat's perimeter despite the weather taking a turn for the worse with strong winds and rain in London today . Contrast: The Tower of London, first built in the 11th century, is surrounded by a sea of scarlet poppies in the shadow of the Shard - which became Europe's tallest building when it was completed in 2012 (picture taken Thursday) Powerful: Paul Cummins's Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation lies before an illuminated Tower Bridge on Thursday . Another family had travelled from Leicestershire on Saturday night to be at the Tower first thing on Sunday. David Hughes, 75, said: ‘It’s amazing. When we arrived it was teeming with people – we weren’t aware it was half term. My dad was in the First World War.’ His wife Pauline Hughes, 71, added: ‘My grandad was gassed in the First World War so it’s something very close to us.’ Bev Livermore, 37, from Portsmouth brought her parents Kathy and Mick Haggard, 70, to see the poppies. It took the family three hours to reach London yesterday. Mrs Haggard, 64, said: ‘I’ve never seen so many people…it’s really lovely and a very nice tribute. It’s something that’s not going to be here much longer. My grandad was killed in the First World War so we’ve been thinking about it.’ Officials from Historic Royal Palaces, which manages the exhibition, had asked those planning to visit the poppies at the weekend to ‘postpone their visit’ until after half term. The situation wasn’t helped by the closure of Tower Hill station yesterday, but the crowds remained calm and accepted that to visit such a stunning tribute would demand a little patience. Meticulous: Around 8,000 volunteers have been working on the powerful exhibition at the tower over the last four months . Journey: The poignant tribute in the tower's moat has come a long way since work originally started on it back in the summer (above) Each poppy is handmade and carefully shaped by a team of workers in Derby . Each poppy is handmade and individually shaped by a team of local workers in Derby, making each poppy unique. Clay is sliced by hand and rolled into large flat sheets and a metal stamp, much like a large biscuit cutter, carves out petal patterns. They are then paired together by hand to form six overlapping petals. The petals are individually moulded to create the shape of the flower and fired to fix their position. The bright red glaze is applied to the fired poppies before they are returned to the kiln for the second and final firing. Ceramic artist Paul Cummins, who came up with the idea, has had a team working on the project since January. He said: 'I was inspired to create this installation after reading a living will by an unknown soldier who we think may have been from Derby. I approached the Tower as the ideal setting as its strong military links seemed to resonate. 'The installation is transient, I found this poignant and reflective of human life, like those who lost their lives during First World War. I wanted to find a fitting way to remember them'. He came up with the idea of creating a 'sea' of poppies two years and was delighted when the Tower of London decided to bring his idea to life with the help of set designer Tom Piper. The artist has experience of working with historic buildings and over the last three years he has been commissioned to create large-scale installations for the Duke of Devonshire's Chatsworth House, Derby Royal Hospital, Althorp Estate and Blenheim Palace.","Officials from Historic Royal Palaces, which manages exhibition, were encouraging people to postpone weekend visits .

"Two judges were yesterday found guilty of misappropriating more than £1.5million of public money.Denis McKay and Stuart Turner systematically misused the legal aid money sent to their law firm, the Solicitors Regulation Authority said. It ordered the two men to be struck off the roll of solicitors and the Legal Aid Agency has reported their behaviour to the City of London police. However the pair continue to hold office as judges and, three years after their misuse of money was first detected, disciplinary proceedings are still going on and no criminal charges have been brought. The money, said to total more than £1.5million, is still missing. Stuart Turner, left and Denis McKay, right, were yesterday found guilty of misappropriating more than £1.5million of public money . Mr Turner, a junior partner in the Lancashire-based Lonsdales firm where the money went missing, said: ‘I would like to say sorry to the taxpayer. ‘I’ve been tried and found guilty, so I’ve got to pay the money back. But I didn’t know the full extent of the fraud. I regret ever going into partnership with Denis McKay – I’ve not spoken to him for four years.’ The misappropriation of legal aid money at Lonsdales is understood to date back to at least April 2000. 'We have a serious problem in this country with quality control when it comes to judges': Tory MP Douglas Carswell . The firm, which was founded by Mr McKay in 1980 with offices in Preston and Blackpool, held contracts to represent legally aided clients in civil claims, including major medical negligence cases. When its clients succeeded in winning their cases, the firm claimed costs to cover its fees and expenses from losing opponents. It should then have returned the legal aid money to the legal aid authorities. This did not happen. The Solicitors Regulation Authority said: ‘The pair deliberately, systematically and extensively failed to account to the Legal Services Commission, now the Legal Aid Agency, for at least £1.5million of public funds.’ Lonsdales was shut down by the regulator in June 2011, six months after the start of inquiries into its behaviour in December 2010. It said Mr McKay had agreed that the firm owed a considerable sum and he hoped to repay it. He is a deputy costs judge in London, where his role has been to adjudicate in disputes over the fees claimed by lawyers, including those involving legal aid. Mr Turner, 54, is a district judge at Bury County Court and also acts as a costs judge – assessing whether lawyers’ fee claims are correct – at Blackpool County Court. The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office said both men had ‘voluntarily refrained’ from sitting as judges since SRA investigations against them began. It has started an inquiry but both are unlikely ever to take charge of a courtroom again. The SRA has not published its full ruling against the two men and may not do so if they take up the option to appeal against yesterday’s decision. Both have large houses near the upmarket seaside resort of Lytham St Annes in Lancashire. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘We have a serious problem in this country with quality control when it comes to judges.’","Denis McKay and Stuart Turner have been struck off the roll of solicitors .

"Disciplinary: Ann Hughes, 64, was alleged to have run her rural Welsh primary school in a 'climate of fear' A group of primary school children were left ‘crying their eyes out’ when a strict headmistress asked a police officer to tell them off for pulling faces in their school photograph, a disciplinary hearing was told today. Ann Hughes allegedly ran Ysgol Goronwy Owen, a village primary school on the Isle of Anglesey, in a ‘climate of fear’, swearing at pupils and showing favouritism to those whose first language was Welsh. So when a group of 10-year-old classmates tried to sabotage the end of year picture because their usual teachers were on strike, she responded ‘excessively’ by asking school liaison officer Pc Brian Jones to reprimand them, it was alleged. The staff members were absent after all but one of the school’s teachers called in sick following a vote of no confidence in Mrs Hughes, who had been headteacher for 17 years, and her ‘dictatorial’ management style. She was later suspended and then sacked from the school in Benllech following a catalogue of complaints from teachers and parents, which included calling children names, excessively shouting and punishing them in public. Mrs Hughes, 64, who previously had a 40-year unblemished teaching record, appeared before the Professional Conduct Committee of the General Teaching Council for Wales, sitting in Ewloe, near Queensferry, north Wales. Giving evidence, the mother of one pupil, referred to as Pupil L - accused Mrs Hughes of a huge over-reaction by asking Pc Jones to intervene following the incident involving Year Six children in June 2011. ‘He (her son) came home from school absolutely distraught,’ she said. ‘He was crying his eyes out, saying he was never going to school again. He was terrified. ‘My dad was a police officer, he has respect for them. He was absolutely terrified.’ Pc Jones admitted some of the children, who had begun a petition and circulated a note to encourage others to sabotage the photo, broke down after he told them he was disappointed with their behaviour. Village school: The panel was told Mrs Hughes had been the head of Ysgol Goronwy Owen for 17 years . ‘I spoke to them as a class, I didn’t speak to any individual children,’ he said. ‘I told them how some of them had made a member of staff cry and how a few of them had ruined the photo for the whole class. ‘I told them that if they had an issue they should have talked about it and should not have been seeking to sabotage the photo or manipulating others. ‘One or two did break down and start crying, I remember a large number of children turning to look at those responsible. In my view they were crying because of the guilt at what they had done.’ Panel: Ann Hughes arrives at the hearing today . Presenting officer Martin Jones suggested the reason the children were upset was because they thought they were in trouble with the police. Pc Jones said he would be ‘inordinately surprised’ if they believed it was a criminal matter, although he admitted he could not be certain. In fact, the officer, who said he was treated like a ‘celebrity’ by pupils every time he went to the school, received an angry phone call from one of their fathers following the ticking off. ‘He rang me and said he was angry, he said it was not criminal that his child didn’t want to take part in the photo and I agreed with him,’ the police officer added. Mrs Hughes, of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, faces further allegations including that she used the word ‘c**p’ when speaking to pupils, repeatedly called one child ‘twp’ - the Welsh word for ‘stupid’ - and shouted excessively in the classroom. She is also accused of failing to investigate and address bullying of two pupils, highlighting parents’ complaints during school assembly thereby potentially identifying pupils, and engaging in unnecessary open criticism of children’s mistakes. Further claims include openly criticising a pupil’s error in the spelling of his middle name and tearing up his SATS examination paper in front of him, and being insensitive by commenting on the length of a pupil’s absence to his brother following the death of their father. Supply teacher Bethan Roberts told the hearing the school was left ‘up the creek without a paddle’ when five of the six permanent teachers phoned in sick on the same day in May 2011. She said she never heard Mrs Hughes shouting in class and blamed ‘lack of co-operation’ from the staff, who were often seen ‘whispering’ about the headteacher, for the problems. They returned in the new school year in September, following Mrs Hughes' suspension, and two temporary headteachers were put in charge. However, during that time 23 children were pulled from the school by their parents because of the crisis. Accused: The case was heard before the General Teaching Council for Wales in Ewloe, near Queensferry .","Ann Hughes said to run Ysgol Goronwy Owen, Anglesey, in 'climate of fear'

"Supermarkets have launched emergency investigations following claims that contaminated chicken is being sold on the high street. Whistleblowers say the public is being put at risk because of suspect practices at two of the largest UK poultry processors, the 2 Sisters Food Group and Faccenda. A hygiene alert has been raised around factories and farms supplying chicken to Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Marks & Spencer and Nando’s. Scroll down for video . Supermarkets have are investigating claims contaminated chicken is being sold. (Stock picture) The allegations, which are denied by the two firms, have prompted Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks & Spencer to launch inquiries into the way their chicken is produced. Concerns about poor hygiene standards come at a time of mounting concern that supermarkets are failing to protect customers from food-poisoning bug campylobacter – which is most often found on raw chicken, and is responsible for around 100 deaths a year. An official study published in 2009 found two thirds of all fresh chicken on shelves was contaminated with it. The whistleblowers claim failures they saw at the operations run by 2 Sisters and Faccenda are likely to spread bugs. The allegations, which first appeared on The Guardian website, are denied by the companies, while the supermarkets all insist that their own audit systems ensure that the meat reaching the high street is safe. The insiders claim that: . The allegations have prompted supermarkets including Tesco to launch their own inquiries . The alert was raised after the Daily Mail revealed how supermarkets have been secretly lobbying official watchdogs to stop them naming and shaming stores selling contaminated chicken. Yesterday, the board of the Food Standards Agency decided to drop a previous pledge to publish quarterly surveys identifying which stores are selling chicken contaminated with the bug. The decision followed pressure from retailers, producers and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The move was widely criticised by food safety experts, academics, consumer groups and even several of the board members. Erik Millstone, of the University of Sussex, said: ‘The decision of the FSA board is deeply disappointing, and shows it has abandoned its commitment to put the interests of consumers ahead of the interests of the food industry.’ The allegations about the two food firms were partly based on information supplied by Ron Spellman, director general of EWFC, which represents meat inspectors across the EU. Probe: Marks & Spencer said it launched an immediate investigation into these allegations . EWFC has been lobbying against a scaling back of inspections at meat plants that have been introduced by the EU and backed by the FSA. Tesco said: ‘We take these allegations of poor practice against one of our suppliers extremely seriously, and have launched an immediate investigation. ‘Customers can be assured that we conduct our own stringent quality checks on fresh chicken received from suppliers before it is placed on shelves, so we can be confident that it meets our very high quality and safety standards.’ Sainsbury’s said: ‘Customers can be confident in the safety of products bought from our stores. We perform regular independent and in-house checks to ensure these standards are met and are investigating these allegations with 2 Sisters.’ Sainsbury's was another supermarket accused of selling chicken which has been contaminated . A hygiene alert has been raised around factories and farms supplying chicken to Tesco Asda and Aldi . M&S said: ‘We take food safety very seriously and regularly audit all of our suppliers to ensure they meet our strict codes of practice. We do not tolerate any alleged breach of our standards and have launched an immediate investigation into these allegations.’ Asda referred enquiries to its suppliers. Both Nando’s and KFC said they were confident that their suppliers operate to high hygiene and welfare standards. Aldi said: ‘We take any claims of this nature very seriously. Aldi works with our suppliers to ensure the high standards we expect are adhered to.’ Both Nando's and KFC said they were confident that their suppliers operate to high hygiene and welfare standards .

"A girl of nine died in her father's arms on Christmas Day just hours after a junior doctor wrongly sent her home, an inquest was told. Rhianna Rawding, who was born with kidney problems, was rushed to hospital after falling ill with a severe water infection. She was examined by a junior doctor but, despite being unable to walk or breathe properly and suffering purple blotches on freezing cold feet – a possible symptom of septicaemia or blood poisoning – Rhianna was discharged and told to simply take antibiotics instead. Rhianna Lilly Rawding died on Christmas Day after a junior doctor sent her home when he should have kept her in for observation . However, less than six hours later the youngster was dead. She suffered a massive heart attack and died of septicaemia at around 6.30am Christmas morning. Yesterday her parents, Gemma and Justin Rawding, accused the NHS of 'gambling' with their daughter's life after a coroner said she should never have been sent home from hospital. Mr Rawding, 39, a forklift truck driver, said: 'We certainly feel the doctors let her down, they could have done more. 'We felt something was very wrong and kept expressing our concerns, but they didn't want to know. 'I know that the NHS is pressed, I know that they can be understaffed but it's not acceptable to say we can't have senior doctors examine patients. 'I feel like they were taking a gamble sending us home and they shouldn't be able to take shortcuts or put lives at risk. 'No-one wants to be in hospital on Christmas but I would rather have waited another two hours and made sure Rhianna was seen by the right people. 'We feel that something could have been done if they had been monitoring her. Gemma and Justin Rawdings said they were 'extremely reluctant' to return home with their daughter on Christmas Eve last year . 'The tragedy for us is that we will never know what would have happened if she had stayed in hospital and not been sent home.' Mrs Rawding, a support worker for adults with learning difficulties, added: 'The whole family has been absolutely devastated by Rhianna's death. 'We believe she would be alive today if she had had better care.' Rhianna, described as a 'bright, loving and funny little girl,' was diagnosed with a duplex kidney aged 18 months. The relatively common condition meant she had two kidneys on her left side, but only one was working correctly, leaving her susceptible to regular urinary tract or water infections. The inquest, at Southwark Coroner's Court, was told that, despite her problems, Rhianna, of Medway, Kent, lived a 'pretty normal' life. But on Saturday December 22 last year the schoolgirl began complaining of stomach ache, nausea and a headache. When she hadn't improved by Christmas Eve, her parents took her to the family GP, who confirmed she had a water infection and prescribed antibiotics. She was examined by a junior doctor at Lewisham Hospital but, despite being unable to walk or breathe properly and suffering purple blotches on freezing cold feet ¿ a possible symptom of septicaemia or blood poisoning ¿ Rhianna was discharged . Later that night, however, Rhianna's condition worsened and she began struggling to breathe. Her parents noticed purple blotches or bruising to her feet and decided to take her to Lewisham Hospital, where she was seen by junior doctor James Connors at around 12.30am. The medic, who qualified four years earlier, but had been working in paediatric A&E for just a month, said he 'didn't think' to take the youngster's blood pressure. The test, the court heard, may have shown Rihanna to have low blood pressure - a symptom often associated with blood poisoning. Mr Rawding added: 'I told him we'd never seen her as poorly as this before, we were concerned that it wasn't just a water infection. 'The doctor went to speak to a senior paediatrician but when he came back said the best thing was to discharge her and see if there was improvement within 48 hours.' Fighting back tears, he told the hearing: 'We knew something wasn't right. I had never seen her like that. We left it to the professionals as we thought they knew best.' Dr Tina Sajjanhar, a more senior doctor at the hospital with 15 years' experience, said she would most likely have admitted the youngster. Rhianna - pictured on her first birthday - described as a 'bright, loving and funny little girl,' was diagnosed with a duplex kidney aged 18 months . 'It is very difficult to disagree with the father's view that Rhianna should have been kept in for observation,' she said. ' We tell doctors to take parents' concerns into consideration as they can be very astute.' The couple returned home 'extremely reluctantly' at around 2.30am but at 6.30am Rhianna was still complaining of feeling cold, so Mrs Rawding went to run her a hot bath. As Mr Rawding picked up his daughter to take her to bathroom she suffered a massive heart attack and stopped breathing. Rhianna once said to her father that when she died she wanted to come back as a beautiful butterfly.  Coroner Dr Phillip Barlow refused an application by the hospital that Rhianna died of natural causes . Rhianna pictured last year. Her parents, who are taking legal action against the hospital, tried to resuscitate her while waiting for an ambulance, but nothing could be done and she was pronounced dead two hours later . The couple, who are taking legal action against the hospital, tried to resuscitate her while waiting for an ambulance, but nothing could be done and she was pronounced dead two hours later. Coroner Dr Phillip Barlow refused an application by the hospital that Rhianna died of natural causes. Instead he delivered a narrative verdict, saying: 'It seems to me that if she had been seen by a more experienced doctor she would probably have been kept in for observation and …further deterioration would have become more apparent during the early hours of Christmas morning and would have been acted on more quickly.' However, the coroner stressed it was impossible for him to say 'on the balance of probabilities' whether she would have survived. The couple's solicitor, Beth Reay, of Manchester-based JMW Solicitors, said the Rawdings had 'lost everything they lived for.' 'We are very concerned about the care provided to Rhianna as some quite basic checks were not done,' Mrs Reay said. 'It is also very worrying that her parents reported symptoms to hospital staff that indicated she was suffering from septicaemia yet she was not kept in for observation.'","Rhianna Rawding had 40 per cent of her kidney after operation as a toddler .

"Ian Forman was described as 'evil' by a judge after a court heard of his plans to blow up mosques in Merseyside . A racist Nazi fanatic who plotted to blow up mosques with home-made gunpowder is facing life in jail. Ian Forman, 42, whose obsession with Hitler and extreme right-wing ideology saw work colleagues nickname him ‘Adolf’, secretly made a bomb in his bedroom at his parents’ home, where he also kept an SS uniform. The would-be terrorist, a receptionist at a recycling factory, had made a file of mosques near his home in Merseyside which he referred to as his ‘dreck ziel’ – a German phrase meaning ‘dirt target’. Forman, who had learned how to make bombs on the internet, was condemned by a judge as evil after being found guilty of planning acts of terrorism. Kingston Crown Court was told that a list of targets found on Forman’s home computer included the Wirral Islamic Centre and the Penny Lane Mosque in Liverpool. Police were alerted when horrified colleagues discovered he had been researching how to obtain dangerous chemicals on the internet at work. His home in Birkenhead was raided on June 6 last year, with officers finding more than a kilogram of gunpowder and a home-made explosive device in a briefcase hidden in his bedroom cupboard. Under his bed they found containers of sulphur, potassium nitrate and charcoal – the three components of gunpowder. Fanatic Ian Forman boasted about making a pilgrimage to Hitler's Berghof mountain retreat . Crown prosecutor Annabel Darlow told the court: ‘Ian Forman is a deeply racist man who has fervently embraced extreme right-wing ideology. ‘His ultimate goal was to create explosive devices that could be used as part of acts of terrorism against one of those sections of society who were different in race and religion to himself and represented the object of his hatred.’ Miss Darlow said Forman, a former admin worker at a Jobcentre, told police he was using the chemicals to make fireworks. But when police seized his computer and mobile phone, his emails and internet history uncovered his true motive. Miss Darlow added: ‘They were not a random collection. They are chemicals which when mixed together create gunpowder.’ Forman was found guilty on one count . of engaging in conduct for the preparation of terrorist acts and will be . sentenced next month. The Penny Lane Mosque in Liverpool was on a list a potential targets found at Forman's home . Forman, who said Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik (left) was his 'hero', was described as having 'very extreme' views by Judge Paul Dodgson (right) The jury was told that Forman became notorious at Recresco, a glass recycling plant, for his racist and extreme right-wing views, and that he had boasted on Facebook about making a pilgrimage to  Hitler’s wartime headquarters in Germany in 2012. In a text message to a friend he said he was making an explosive with ball bearings and nails, and added: ‘It might be destined for the Muslim centre in Birkenhead.’ In another, he said Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik was his ‘hero’ and added: ‘Time to start blowing them up.’ He also made a racist video featuring pictures of people in Muslim dress and searched on YouTube for videos of ‘killing Muslims’. Forman, who has a degree in German and Spanish from Liverpool John Moores University, is understood to have been operating alone rather than as part of a group. Judge Paul Dodgson said: ‘The defendant had, in my judgment, very extreme and evil thoughts – I think the word evil is appropriate. ‘He had the intention of carrying those evil thoughts out. ‘For his sentencing there must be a message sent out by the court that this behaviour is regarded with extreme gravity.’ A former friend told the Daily Mail: ‘He was a very friendly, well-liked person. But he was a bit vulnerable and could be easily influenced by others.’ Forman is married but lived apart from his wife at the time of the offences.","Ian Forman, 42, of Birkenhead, Merseyside, was obsessed with Hitler .

"Tearaway: Jennice Lynch, 19, had pleaded guilty to raiding her family home three times and was given a suspended sentence . A teenage tearaway whose parents begged for her to be locked up has been arrested for stealing a car from the family of a disabled girl. Ruth and John Lynch were furious when a court failed to jail 19-year-old Jennice Lynch after years of trouble ended in her raiding the family home. They said they were devastated by their daughter’s betrayal when she burgled their £300,000 house three times in a matter of weeks, stealing jewellery including a £4,000 gold watch. She pleaded guilty at Burnley Crown Court in March to three burglaries in October and November last year but Recorder Kevin Talbot let her off with a 22-month suspended sentence. Lynch, who was also banned from going within 200 metres of her parents’ home in Whitworth, Lancashire, claimed she had carried out one of the raids because her mother had ignored her and given her a ‘dirty look’. At the time, Mrs Lynch, 45, and her company director husband, John, 46, called the punishment a ‘joke’ and said it would not deter Lynch, a single mother of two, from stealing again. Six weeks later she is alleged to have broken into the home of Mike and Phillipa Christie in Bacup, Lancashire, and stolen the keys to their Fiat Punto Evo. The specially adapted car is used to take their autistic six-year-old daughter Catherine to hospital appointments and after-school activities. It was found abandoned and written off the following day. Lynch, who is unemployed and lives off benefits, was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of theft and of breaching her two-year suspended sentence. Mr Christie, 40, the director of a computer company, said the family have been left with no transport for their daughter and will have to raise thousands of pounds for a replacement. He said: ‘The car was a lifeline for us and when we realised what had happened our hearts sank. We can’t take Catherine anywhere without it and it just feels utterly cruel.’ Crown Court: Lynch's parents had begged for her to have a custodial sentence, knowing a suspended one would 'not deter her' Mrs Christie, 26, a web designer, said of Lynch: ‘Her own parents begged for her to be put behind bars and yet she was once again allowed back on the streets. If this girl has taken our disabled daughter’s car then she needs serious help or needs to be behind bars. ‘She has shown a pattern of serious criminal behaviour since she was 14 and for her to be let free to go on committing crimes is just ridiculous.’ Following her arrest, Lynch requested psychiatric help and is now in the mental health unit at Burnley General Hospital. Previously, Mr and Mrs Lynch have spoken of the problems they have had with Lynch for most of her life and particularly since she was 14. Mr Lynch said: ‘No matter how many times we tried to help her or get her help it has not worked – she has been a total nightmare. ‘We knew that this suspended sentence would not deter her and it is just crazy that she was able to go free.’","Jennice Lynch, 19, targeted her own family home in a string of burglaries .

"Victoria Beckham has been listed as Britain's most successful entrepreneur . She rose to fame as Posh Spice and was recently named a goodwill ambassador by the United Nations. Now Victoria Beckham has a new title to add to her growing list of accolades – Britain’s most successful entrepreneur. The 40-year-old singer turned fashion designer was yesterday named top of a list of the country’s 100 business people, beating Sir James Dyson and Dame Vivienne Westwood. It comes after the turnover of Mrs Beckham’s fashion business has risen from £1million to £30million in just five years. Last month, the mother of four opened her first stand alone boutique in London’s Mayfair. Just five years ago, she had three employees on her books. She now has 100. The title was awarded to the former pop star by Management Today after the business magazine ranked scores of entrepreneurs by their success over the past five years. In 2012, Mrs Beckham, said in an interview that she was called posh because she ‘liked the nice restaurants, and the nice clothes’. And now she can certainly afford both. Since 2009, her turnover has increased by 2,900 per cent. Her current wealth is estimated at £210million – overtaking her husband David, who was worth a reported £165million in 2013. Andrew Saunders of Management Today told The Daily Telegraph: ‘She’s got a real business, some design talent and some business nous. She gets a lot of stick for being a celeb fashionista but I don’t think that’s fair. ‘She has built something real out of her own celebrity which is quite a contemporary story. She deserves to be celebrated.’ The former pop-star's fashion label has grown by more than £20million in just five years, with a flagship store launching in London just last motnh . Individually, Mrs Beckham is now worth more than her football icon husband, David. The couple are pictured with their three sons, Cruz, Romeo and Brooklyn. They also have a daughter, Harper . Mrs Beckham launched her fashion label in 2008. Her designs have been worn by stars across Hollywood from Gwyneth Paltrow to Kate Winslet. Last month, singer Ellie Goulding was pictured coming out of Mrs Beckham’s boutique, where prices begin at £150 for a keyring. Instead of tills, customers pay using an iPad. At the launch of the shop in September, Mrs Beckham said: ‘We’re not going to have any ugly tills anywhere’. After being made a goodwill ambassador for the UN last month, she said: ‘It’s taken me to get to 40 to realise I have a responsibility as a woman and as a mother.’","Victoria Beckham listed as most successful British entrepreneur .

"British armed forces could become deeper embroiled in the battle against the Islamic State after it was revealed last night that Apache helicopters could be deployed to Iraq. Until now, only the Royal Air Force has been involved in air strikes against the terror group. If Apaches are sent to Iraq - which are piloted by the Army Air Corps - it would mark the first British Army involvement in a conflict role in the country. Escalation: British Army Apache helicopters could be deployed to Iraq, it has emerged. File picture . A source told The Times last night that Apache attack helicopters may become necessary because jihadis are able to move around the battlefield quickly thanks to social media and messaging application WhatsApp. Warplanes flying at 20,000-30,000ft are therefore having to react to moving targets. A Government source told the newspaper: ‘What we are seeing is ten-man, two-vehicle teams being tasked through messages on WhatsApp or Facebook. Apache helicopters are able to fly close to the ground and at a slow speed, making them more effective at finding opposition troops on the ground . ‘Once they’ve got their objective, they decide themselves how to meet it, what equipment and arms they need, so there’s almost no command or control to hit from 20,000ft.’ The source said that, in order to respond to the changing tactics, UK troops needed ‘something that can act very quickly on intelligence’. Apache helicopters are able to fly close to the ground and at a slow speed, making them more effective at finding opposition troops on the ground. Britain had a fleet of eight Apaches in Afghanistan, where Prince Harry was among the co-pilots during 2012. Until now, only the Royal Air Force has been involved in air strikes against the terror group ISIS. File picture . A second Whitehall source told The Times that the idea of sending Apaches to Iraq had been suggested to Permanent Joint Headquarters, the UK’s hub for all military operations. Sending the helicopters could be seen by some critics as a step closer to putting troops on the ground. If Apaches were deployed, a base would also have to be set up for the helicopters closer to the area of engagement. Describing the Apache’s strengths, Colonel Mike Smith, the Army Air Corps officer in charge of aircrafts at a US base in Kandahar told The Times: ‘What we have demonstrated [in Afghanistan] is if you take the Apache specifically, if you need to engage, it is a hugely capable attack platform.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night that Britain had no current plans to send Apache helicopters to Iraq. ‘We constantly review our options and will carry on scoping what other training and support we can offer in conjunction with the coalition,’ he said.","Move would mark the first British Army involvement in a conflict role .

"White is the most popular colour for underwear, but new research says 51 per cent of it goes grey. Here, we put the most common whitening solutions to the test to see if any of them really work. We washed a pile of new, white, cotton pants three times in different coloured washes to get them all the same shade of grey. We kept a pristine, white pair and one of the grey pairs for reference to gauge any colour changes in the rest of the underwear as they were tested. Daniel Browne, of Blossom & Browne’s Sycamore Launderers And Dry Cleaners in London — a holder of three royal warrants — gives professional advice on each technique. DENTURE CLEANING TABLETS . Many people claim an overnight soak in warm water with dissolved denture tablets will transform off-whites . Many people claim an overnight soak in warm water with dissolved denture tablets will transform off-whites. Denture tablets are a blend of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), well-known for its cleansing properties, and citric acid, which has natural bleaching properties, so it sounds plausible. I use two Steradent Active Plus tablets (£1 for 30). The next day, rinsed and dried, the fabric smells minty fresh and the grey has lifted a shade. But the fabric is rough and bobbly. Expert opinion: Sodium bicarbonate is used as a stain remover and deodoriser, rather than a bleaching agent. It might remove biological stains, such as sweat and smells, but it’s unlikely to bleach out the grey efficiently. 1/10 . SUNLIGHT . It’s the oldest trick in the book: hang laundry in the garden on a bright day and the sun’s powerful ultraviolet rays will bleach any discoloration. After a day soaking up sunshine, my laundry smells fresh. But the UV rays had whitened my smalls only subtly. Expert opinion: Sunlight can help fade a ketchup stain on a tablecloth, but it’s unlikely to bleach an entire item of clothing. Further UV exposure may help fade the grey even more, but too much will damage delicate fabric. 2/10 . NAPPY DETERGENT . Napisan powder can make underwear come out a couple of shades lighter . If it can make nappies look good, perhaps it can perk up off-white briefs. I add a tablespoon of Napisan powder (£3.80 for 800g) to a couple of litres of hot water, give it a stir and leave to soak for two hours. The water and underwear immediately turn bright blue, but there’s a lovely washing powder smell. After rinsing and drying, I’m amazed. The underwear is a couple of shades lighter and the fabric and elastic look as good as new. Expert opinion: Soaking agents remove stains, but the combination of bleaching agents and optical brighteners in this product have helped remove and disguise some of the grey, too. 5/10 . SOLUBLE ASPIRIN . This is widely touted online as a fix for off-colour whites. I dissolve three aspirin (30p for 16 tablets) in a litre of warm water and leave my smalls to soak for eight hours. Once washed, rinsed and dried, the underwear looks tired, as if it has been laundered ten times rather than four, but the fabric is a shade whiter than the Napisan-treated version. Expert opinion: Salicylic acid in aspirin may have a bleaching effect. I’d be wary of soaking clothes in aspirin solution as its acidity could damage delicates. 6/10 . LEMON JUICE . Lemon is well known for its natural bleaching effects. I add the juice of three lemons to a litre of hot water and leave my pants to soak overnight. In the morning, the water and underwear are yellow. Lemon is well known for its natural bleaching effects . After a rinse and tumble dry, the knickers are back to their original grey and the decorative elastic at the waist is curled and puckered. Expert opinion: Lemon juice is unlikely to whiten clothes because it contains fruit sugars, which attract dirt and cause discoloration and staining. The acid from the juice may have started to eat away at the elastic in the decorative waistband, too. 0/10 . HOUSEHOLD BLEACH . the most obvious method to try is household bleach. I soak greying whites in warm water with a little bleach (£2 for two litres) for an hour. After washing, rinsing and drying the underwear, it’s obvious the bleach has removed more grey than all the other techniques. However, the underwear is still a dull off-white, with a lingering smell of chlorine. The fabric looks rather tired and the elastic has slackened, too. Expert opinion: Bleach can whiten greying fabrics efficiently, but getting the ratio of bleach and water and the timing of your soak right can be almost impossible. Nine times out of ten, the fabric will turn yellow. Always check the care labels on garments to make sure it’s safe to use bleach as it can damage some fabrics. 7/10 . DR BECKMANN GLOWHITE . I had high hopes for this product, which claims it will ‘restore that intensive whiteness’ even at low temperatures. Empty a sachet  into the washing machine with my usual detergent, then run a 30c wash. Washed and dried, the grey has faded a couple of shades . I empty a sachet (£1.85 for five) into the washing machine with my usual detergent, then run a 30c wash. Washed and dried, the grey has faded a couple of shades — on a par with the aspirin effect. The fabric feels soft, but the elastic is curled and mis-shapen. Expert opinion: Most supermarket whitening treatments will improve the brightness of your whites. But a coloured trim or logo may transfer or fade. 6/10 . SLOW COOKER . A friend put me on to this bizarre whitening technique. Borax substitute (£1.59 for 500g) is a traditional cleaning powder that can be used for everything from scouring work surfaces to making your own laundry detergent. I place my underwear in a slow cooker with 2tbsp of powder and a couple of litres of water and put it on a low setting overnight. The next day, the kitchen is filled with a metallic, chemical smell. Washed and dried, the knickers are a few shades lighter, but with an odd salmon pink hue. Expert opinion: Putting cotton underwear on a very hot wash may help to brighten it, but an eight-hour boil wash is extreme and likely to damage the fabric and delicate trimmings. 4/10 . HOW PROFESSIONALS DO IT . Daniel Browne says: ‘The main reason underwear goes grey is transference of colour from other garments, so always wash whites separately. ‘White cotton should brighten up on a very hot wash. This is not true for all fabrics, so always check the care instructions. ‘Optical brightener (the little blue dots in your washing powder) helps make white clothes appear whiter, but can build up over time, leaving it dull and grey. ‘The colour in fabric softener will also dull whites over time. Gentle hand wash detergent and a white fabric softener can control this. ‘Keep your washing machine really clean. Mould, fluff and dirt inside the drum and drawers can discolour clothing. ‘Three or four times a year, clean your machine by adding a litre of white vinegar to your empty machine once it has filled with warm water and allowing it to run through a hot cycle.’","An overnight soak with dissolved denture tablets will transform off-whites .

"The mother of Sarah Payne today thanked the public for their 'love and understanding' after her ex-husband Michael, the murdered schoolgirl's father, died after a long battle with alcoholism. Michael Payne, 45, was found dead at home in Maidstone, Kent, on Monday, and had turned to drink after his eight-year-old daughter Sarah was abducted and killed paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000. Mr Payne, a former airport worker, separated from his wife Sara Payne less than three years after their daughter’s death. They were expecting their fifth child at the time. Ms Payne today re-tweeted a message by close friend Shy Keenan saying: 'Sara thanks you all (more than she can say right now) for your love, kindness and understanding at this very painful time in their lives. 'Sara is not making any media comments at this time as she wants to be left alone to care for grieving her family'. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Michael Payne, 45,  had turned to drink when his eight year old daughter Sarah was murdered in 2000 and three years later he and his then-wife Sara, right, divorced . Message: Sara Payne spoke through her friend Shy Keenan today and thanked people for their support after the death of her ex-husband . Their daughter Sarah was abducted and killed by paedophile Roy Whiting after being abducted from a country lane close to her grandparents' home at Kingston, West Sussex. Whiting was sentenced to life behind bars in January 2001, in what became one of Britain's most high profile child murder cases. It later emerged that Whiting was already on the Sex Offenders Register after abducting and sexually attacking another eight-year-old. The death of his daughter became one of Britain's most high profile child-murder cases and Mrs Payne later campaigned for ‘Sarah’s Law’. The rule allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. Mr Payne,  previously said that he felt ‘full of rage and guilt’ after his daughter’s murder. He said: ‘I’ve a lot of anger and bitterness inside me. I’m full of guilt and rage that I wasn’t there to protect my little girl from that man.’ His ex-wife Sara said at the time: ‘We’re not the same people we once were, and everyone knows the full reason why.' Sarah's parents, Michael and Sara Payne, pictured during the trial of Roy Whiting in November 2001 . His daughter Charlotte Payne posted this heartfelt tribute to her father on Facebook last night . Charlotte Payne's tribute to her father on social media states he will 'always be my daddy' Michael and Sara Payne pictured together prior to their divorce. Mr Payne went on to battle alcoholism as he struggled to cope with the murder of their daughter . Mr Payne’s son Lee, 27, a personal trainer, announced his father’s death on social media yesterday. He wrote: ‘Dad, you had your demons and troubles but you had a good heart and was a decent man. ‘I hope now you have found peace at last! RIP, you will be missed. We are all heartbroken.’ His daughter Charlotte, 19, also paid tribute, writing: ‘Heartbroken to say the least. No matter what happened and how many mistakes we all made. 'You will always be my daddy. 'I'm sorry I couldn't save you dad. I hope you have finally found your peace and happiness.' Later, Sara Payne spoke of the effect their daughter's death had on Mr Payne and the difficulties men had in using victim support systems. She said: 'I feel sympathy for any man in the situation. It’s not geared to dads. It doesn’t take into account their emotions. They have no one to turn to.' A Kent police spokesman said: 'The death is not being treated as suspicious. A report will be prepared for the coroner.' A neighbour told the Mirror the police were concerned for his welfare and 'forced their way in to his flat a few days ago'. In 2011, Mr Payne was jailed for 15 months after hitting his brother with a glass bottle. His brother, Stephen Payne needed 15 stitches in his hand. Maidstone Crown Court heard that Mr Payne had consumed three litres of cider and a bottle of vodka before the attack. Defending solicitor Oliver Saxby told the judge at sentencing: ‘The assorted aftermath had a life-changing effect on him and his then wife and his family. It’s desperately sad. ‘He never sought nor was offered assistance with bereavement counselling. 'In a nutshell, he suffered the kind of experience that is every parent's enduring nightmare.' Roy Whiting (left) was convicted of murdering schoolgirl Sarah Payne (right) in 2000. Sara and Michael pictured together at their Surrey home. Mr Payne has died following a long battle with alcoholism . Last year around five families a week were being told by police about a paedophile who has had contact with their children, and more than 700 child sex attackers were unmasked using the law. In 2008 Sara Payne suffered a stroke leaving her paralysed down the left side of her body. 'For a moment as I lay there I wondered if this was the point when Sarah and I would be reunited,' she said afterwards. 'I chose to live. When you've lost a child that's a hard thing to come to terms with.' Sara and Michael Payne pictured outside Lewes Crown Court following the conviction of Whiting . In December 2001, Roy Whiting was sentenced to life in prison with a recommendation that he never be released after a jury found him guilty of the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne. After his conviction was entered, the court heard he had a previous conviction for the kidnap and indecent assault of a nine-year-old girl. The jury, who had been unaware of the previous sex conviction, were told Whiting had been sentenced to four years in jail for the sex attack in June 1995. Revelations Whiting already had a history of child abuse prior to the killing of Sarah prompted a national debate about how paedophiles are dealt with in the justice system. Mr and Mrs Payne began actively campaigning for a law change, piling pressure on ministers to allow people to know about convicted paedophiles living in their area. In the wake of Whiting's sentencing, Mrs Payne said: 'The Government only can make this decision. Right now, we have got a lot of work to do and it doesn't stop here. It just begins. You know what change I want, Sarah's Law.' The rule, eventually introduced in 2011, allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending. The scheme is a watered-down version of similar laws in the U.S. under which details of where convicted paedophiles live are actively publicised. In 2008, Mrs Payne was awarded an MBE for her tireless campaigning on the issue.","Michael Payne, 45, was found dead at his home in Maidstone, Kent .

"Statins could be used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) but are being blocked by NHS red tape, a charity has claimed. The Multiple Sclerosis Society believes cholesterol-busting statins could help treat MS but are not prescribed because of strict NHS rules that prevent drugs being re-licensed for conditions other than that for which they were originally designed. The disease affects nerves in the brain, eyes and spinal cord, often causing patients to lose basic bodily functions. The Multiple Sclerosis Society believes cholesterol-busting statins could help treat MS . Initial trials conducted show that simvastatin, a drug traditionally prescribed to those suffering from heart disease, could slow the breakdown of the tissues in the brain by 40 per cent. But the drug is not being given to MS sufferers because of laws which prevent old drugs being re-licensed. The patent for simvastatin expired in 2004 and a new licence would be required to make the drug widely available, the charity has said. In a letter to today’s Daily Telegraph, the charity described giving old medication a new purpose as ‘a fast and cost effective way’ to provide new treatments. The MS Society is now asking people to lobby their MP to attend the Off-patent Drugs Bill reading, which will be held in the House of Commons this Friday. The bill could help tens of thousands MS sufferers currently receiving no effective treatment according to the MS Society. Initial trials conducted show that simvastatin could slow the breakdown of tissues in the brain by 40% . The letter to the newspaper has been signed by half a dozen medical experts including five neurologists. Michelle Mitchell, the charity’s chief executive, said that denying patients from receiving the medication was ‘nonsensical’ and called for MPs to ‘cut the red tape’. She said: ‘In progressive MS, symptoms gradually worsen and there are currently no medicines that can slow or stop the accumulation of disability. ‘This can leave people desperate and willing to try anything and we know some even consider unproven therapies or interventions which might be expensive and dangerous. ‘In the example of simvastatin, if phase 3 trials are successful, it would be cruel to tell people we have finally found a drug that might slow the progression of their MS but they cannot have it.’","Multiple Sclerosis Society believes cholesterol-busting statins could help .

"Iceland will start selling lobster, from Canada, for just £5 from next week . Like champagne and caviar, lobster is usually reserved for the most special of occasions. Now budget supermarket Iceland could make it an everyday luxury by offering the seafood for just £5. Its lobster, which will go on sale next week, has been imported from Canada. Ordering the delicacy at speciality London restaurant Burger and Lobster costs more than four times the price at £20. Iceland will also begin selling ‘hand-dived’ Peruvian scallops for £4, which is the same price as Waitrose. The supermarket said it was committed to providing families with ‘great quality seafood at Christmas’. The spokesman added: ‘Our aim this year is to offer great quality meal solutions for our customers, from simple starters in shells to a side of salmon for the buffet table. The range is accessible to most customers, with prices ranging from £2 to £7, but we haven’t compromised on quality.’ The move comes as budget supermarket chains are increasingly offering items once seen as the preserve of luxury suppliers. Earlier this year, German chain Aldi secured supplies of Wagyu, the world’s most expensive beef, which it sold at £6.99 for a sirloin steak, or £25 per kilo. Normally the succulent Japanese meat is priced at £100 per kilo. Food experts have praised Lidl’s £2.65 Best Smoked Salmon, while Aldi was applauded for its £7.99 pheasant for two. But Aldi came a cropper over its 20g portions of luxury caviar for £9.99. The product was originally described as ‘Beluga’ but the name was changed after experts discovered it did not come from the correct species of sturgeon. And even though luxury items are becoming increasingly common in supermarkets, there are still many expensive foods which are yet to appear on the high street. Swedish moose cheese, for example, will cost you around £187 per pound, while British White Stilton Gold is £262 a pound, or £6 a slice. Chairman and CEO of Iceland Malcolm Walker. The company says it was committed to providing families with ‘great quality seafood at Christmas’ Ordering lobster at speciality London restaurant Burger and Lobster (above) costs four times the price at £20 . France has developed a taste for British food – including chicken tikka masala. Marks and Spencer’s store on the Champs Elysees now sells more portions of Britain’s favourite curry than any branch in the UK. In 2005, France’s then-president Jacques Chirac mocked British food, scoffing: ‘You can’t trust people whose cuisine is so bad.’ But the nation is now setting aside its culinary heritage to buy vast quantities of scones and crumpets. Jill Bruce, Marks and Spencer’s head of international food, said they had noticed a big uptake in UK classics since opening branches in France three years ago. The nation of camembert, brie and Roquefort has even developed a taste for Stilton. Pret a Manger, another UK brand, is also doing well in France as consumers there want food quickly. Mark Palmer, of Pret, said: ‘There was a demand for high quality food at pace.’","Iceland will start selling lobster imported from Canada for £5 next week .

"Switzerland is lobbying for the art of yodelling to be given Unesco World Heritage status. The form of Alpine singing, which has existed since the 1830s, would be added to the Unesco World Heritage list alongside Stonehenge and the Taj Mahal, if the status is granted. The request comes after the Argentinian tango was named a World Heritage tradition in 2009. Falconry and the Mediterranean diet have also been added to the list. Scroll down for video . Tradition since 1830: Alpine horn blowers and yodelling chorus from the Geneva Swiss Alps canton of Valais . Traditionally, World Heritage status was only granted to buildings, monuments and places of natural beauty but in 2003, the category of ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity’ was created. The Swiss government has now asked for eight ‘intangible heritage’ traditions to be added to the prestigious list, The Daily Telegraph reported. As well as yodelling, the Swiss have asked for, among others, mechanical watchmaking and managing the risk of avalanches to be given official status. But they may have to wait eight years for the status to be granted as under current rules countries can only submit one ‘intangible heritage’ entry each year. Status: The form of Alpine singing would be added to the Unesco World Heritage list alongside Stonehenge (left) and the Taj Mahal (right), if the status is granted . The yodel is a song sung with an extended note which rapidly and repeatedly changes in pitch and makes a high-low-high-low sound. Developed in the Central Alps as a method of communication between mountaineers or between villages, the yodel later became part of the region's traditional lore and musical expression. Most westerners of a certain age know it purely through a version of a song warbled by Julie Andrews in the classic Austrian-set musical The Sound of Music.","Song sung with extended note rapidly and repeatedly changing in pitch .

"Wizard news, Harry Potter fans: JK Rowling has written a new spin-off story for Halloween.

A spokesman for the author later confirmed it would be ‘filled with many new details’, as well as Miss Rowling’s ‘revealing first-person thoughts and reflections’ of Professor Umbridge, first introduced to readers in her fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The news comes after Miss Rowling, 49, published a tale on Pottermore earlier this year featuring a grown-up Harry watching a Quidditch match. Short stories are not the only Potter-related pet projects that Miss Rowling has been working on, however. It emerged this month that the wealthy author has submitted plans to build a cottage similar to Hogwarts caretaker Hagrid’s hut at her estate in Perthshire. Earlier this year the author revealed she would be writing the screenplays for 'at least' a trilogy of Harry Potter spin-off films. The writer has not ruled out ever writing another Harry Potter book but revealed she had no plans to do so in the near future.

"Patients should receive healthcare statements every year telling them how much they have cost the NHS in a bid to clamp down on time-wasters, a report says. The ‘bill’ would list the number of times they had visited their GP, A&E and outpatient clinics over the past 12 months and, where possible, the cost of these services. It could compare their usage to the average patient in their local area – highlighting to frequent visitors where they might be using services unnecessarily. Scroll down for video . Costs: Patients should receive healthcare statements every year telling them how much they have cost the NHS in a bid to clamp down on time-wasters, a report says . The study, released by the Centre for Policy Studies, said the statements would help patients ‘understand the costs’ and encourage them not to misuse the NHS by missing appointments or visiting casualty departments when it was not required. The report, How Much Do We Use the NHS, co-authored by Tory MP Jesse Norman, said the estimated annual cost of unnecessary or missed appointments was £1billion. It said the healthcare statements would be ‘simple and transparent’ and had the ‘potential to save the NHS hundreds of millions of pounds every year by encouraging users to change their behaviour and to take greater personal responsibility’. However, the statements would not be used as an attempt to introduce the public to private healthcare, the authors said, insisting that ‘political and public opposition to charging for NHS services remains strong’. It is estimated that the cost of a GP appointment ranges from between £10 and £25, while attendance at A&E is more than £100 a visit and more in the case of admission to hospital. But many of appointments could be avoided, it is claimed. According to PharmaTimes, 51million people every year visit their GP with minor problems which would clear up by themselves or through use of an over-the counter remedy. 'Awareness': The report,  co-authored by Tory MP Jesse Norman, said the estimated annual cost of unnecessary or missed appointments was £1billion . These include as many as 40,000 GP visits a year for dandruff, 20,000 for travel sickness and 5.2million for blocked noses. The report, which was co-written by Museji Takolia, chairman of the Wye Valley NHS Trust, said: ‘As with an annual bank, ISA or pension statement, each individual user of the NHS would receive a Healthcare Statement every year. ‘The user would be able to see what services they had received over the past 12 months and the cost of those services to the NHS. ‘Where the same or similar service could be provided less expensively – say by visiting their GP rather than A&E – they might also be able to see the savings to be made.’ The statements could include the number of visits to a hospital or GP practice, the basic cost of these services, the number of missed appointments and the cost of this to the NHS and information highlighting potentially unnecessary visits. Mr Norman, a member of the Treasury Select Committee and MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire, said any costs of collating data across different health bodies and posting out the statements would be out-weighed by the savings made. He said the ‘tax’ statements meant patients would see themselves more as customers rather than recipients, making them aware of the true cost of the services of doctors and nurses. He said: ‘This is not a matter of charging people. This is about raising awareness of where people are not using the NHS effectively. ‘For example, if they are repeatedly visiting their A&E department where they could be getting exactly service at a lower cost by visiting their GP. ‘Or where people are repeatedly missing appointments. ‘The bill might say you have visited your GP seven times, missed three appointments and been to A&E four times in a year. ‘Your doctor could ask you to bring in your healthcare statement to see how many times you have visited different services and discuss this. ‘If people are frequent users or unnecessary users, they would be able to see a pattern of behaviour.’ The report suggested that the scheme would have to undergo thorough trials before being rolled out nationwide. It added: ‘In addition in end-of-life contexts special care will have to be taken to prevent patients from seeing themselves as burdens on their families or on the NHS if cost information is included.’","'Bill' would list patients' visits to their GP, A&E and outpatient clinics .

"As a 26-year-old former circus chimp, he may not be able to understand the legal terminology. But Tommy the chimpanzee certainly got his day in court yesterday – as part of a two-year bid to prove he is human. Activists say the primate is a prisoner because he spends his retirement with his owners in a trailer park watching television. Yesterday a lawyer representing the animal told an American court his client had been ‘unlawfully imprisoned’ in a cage and should be released. If activists win their case, Tommy will be the first animal declared a person – with the same rights as humans – under US law. Tommy, a 26-year-old former circus chimp, is currently at the centre of a two-year legal battle in the U.S. Attorney Steven Wise, of the Nonhuman Rights Project, said the chimp - a 26-year-old former circus act - had been being ‘unlawfully imprisoned’ in a cage by his owners and should be released to be a primate sanctuary . They are calling for the ageing chimp to be released to live out his days with others of his kind in a primate sanctuary in Florida. Tommy is kept alone by his owners, Patrick and Diane Lavery, along with other exotic animals at a trailer park in New York state. Lawyer Stephen Wise argued that Tommy was being kept in what he described as ‘a cavernous dark shed’. He said the chimpanzee was a ‘legal person’, entitled to freedom from captivity, the Daily Telegraph reported. In a hearing before the New York Supreme Court appeals division, Mr Wise called for the case to be considered under the category of ‘unlawful imprisonment’ – instead of animal welfare laws. Mr Wise, who is fighting for the chimp’s rights on behalf of activists with the Nonhuman Rights Project, said Tommy should be treated as a ‘habeas corpus’ – a law which requires a prisoner or detainee to be brought before a judge. In an emotional plea Mr Wise told the court: ‘As a matter of both liberty and equality, Tommy should be seen as a person.’ Attorney Steven Wise, of the Nonhuman Rights Project, argues on behalf of Tommy the chimp before the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division. The court will decide whether the animal should be declared a 'person' Tommy was not in court and nor was his owner. But Mr Lavery has previously described the chimp as having ‘a lot of enrichment’. He told an American newspaper: ‘He’s got colour TV, cable and a stereo. He likes being by himself.’ The case was thrown out by a lower court in December, when a judge said Mr Wise had made ‘a very strong argument’ but he did not agree that habeas corpus applies to chimpanzees.

"Novelist Hilary Mantel has warned the BBC not to turn a televised version of her books into ‘nonsense’. Booker Prize-winning novels Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies will be merged to create a six-part series starring Damian Lewis which will air next year. Mrs Mantel was involved in the script stage of the production but will not have any further say in the televised version of her books. The outspoken 62-year-old author, who was made a Dame in June, said she hoped producers would not add inaccuracies to her masterpieces. Period set: Damian Lewis, pictured right in costume, during filming for the new drama at Gloucester Cathedral . Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, she said: ‘As soon as you decide this is too complicated for the viewer, or history is an inconvenient shape and can’t we just tidy it up a bit, then you fall into a cascade of errors which ends in nonsense.’ Yesterday, referring to TV series The Tudors – which was broadcast on the BBC in 2007 – she accused its creators of dumbing-down, saying: ‘At some point, someone had decided that it was too complex for Henry VIII to have two sisters, so they rolled them into one. Hilary Mantel hopes the BBC will not add inaccuracies to her books Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies . ‘Then they had to find a fictitious king for her to marry, so I think they invented a king from Portugal unknown to history. It’s so shaming, and it stems from not trusting the intelligence of the viewer. ‘I think the problem was that there would be too many Marys in the story. But what do I do? Every second man in Henry VIII’s England is called Thomas.’ She added: ‘At any one time, there are five Thomases on the page, all shouting at each other. The only thing to do is let the reader in on it. Admit the difficulty. No one ever pretended historical fiction was easy and we should share that difficulty with our reader.’ Regal: The 43-year-old certainly looked regal in his attire as he got into character for the show which is based on the award-winning historical novel of the same name . Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies are both set in the 16th century and depict the rise to power of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII. The books have already been adapted for a stage version, which will be transferred to Broadway from March 2015. Mrs Mantel sparked controversy in February last year when she described the Duchess of Cambridge as a ‘shop-window mannequin’ who was ‘machine-made’. The author has since apologised for the comments made during a lecture organised by The London Review of Books. Meanwhile, Game of Thrones star Charles Dance has launched a scathing attack on the state of British TV. The 68-year-old actor told the Guardian: ‘We have to take risks in British television. It has to stop patronising people. ‘I think a lot of programme makers are underestimating the intelligence of the viewing public.’ Royal style: Homeland actor Damian Lewis pictured on the set of the TV adaptation of Mrs Mantel's novels .","Booker Prize-winning novels to be turned into a six-part television series .

"Student Annabelle Sacher was shopping in her local Sainsbury’s when she decided to give her girlfriend a spontaneous peck on the cheek. One fellow customer, however, didn’t see the ‘light kiss’ as a romantic gesture – and reported the couple to a security guard who allegedly then told them to leave. The female guard explained that the shopper had complained that the lesbian clinch was ‘disgusting’, and that she was ‘worried for her child’. Infuriated, the 22-year-old reported the incident to fellow gay rights activists online, declaring that Sainsbury’s was guilty of perpetrating a hate crime and that she had a ‘human right’ to kiss in the supermarket. The row began on Saturday – which was National Coming Out Day – in a Sainsbury’s in Brighton, a town known for its vibrant gay scene. In a post on gay rights charity Stonewall’s Facebook page, Miss Sacher said: ‘The security guard later apologised, saying that she herself was gay and had simply been asked to speak to us by another customer who found us “disgusting” and was “worried for her child”. ‘I felt sorry for the guard. However, the fact is that she perpetrated a hate crime on behalf of Sainsbury’s. ‘My partner and myself should not have been made to feel humiliated simply because we were two women. It is our legal and human right to express ourselves and today Sainsbury’s took that right away and made me feel like a lesser human being.’ The English literature student at Sussex University in Brighton added: ‘I am outraged and deeply humiliated by this incident.’ Last night a Sainsbury’s spokesman said that it had made a full apology, promised similar incidents would not happen again and said it had paid money to a charity of Miss Sacher’s choice. The spokesman denied the security guard had told Miss Sacher to leave, and instead asked her to stop kissing, but apologised for her treatment all the same. ‘This should never have happened – it is clear that she and her partner were not behaving inappropriately and we are very sorry that they were treated in this way,’ the spokesman said. ‘We have called her to apologise and will be making a donation to a charity of her choice.’ Miss Sacher, who is originally from Hampstead Garden Suburb, north London – where she was brought up by her leading lawyer father Jonathan, 59, and estate agent mother Marla, 55, in a £3million house – said she was delighted with the response. She has since made the supermarket one of her ‘favourites’ on Facebook.

"James McArthur caused backlash on Twitter after he complained about getting a parking fine . A Premier League footballer who earns £40,000-a-week has riled fans after he took to Twitter to moan about a £38 parking fine. James McArthur, central midfielder at Crystal Palace, had taken a trip to a Costa coffee shop in central London when he returned to his car to find a penalty charge notice on the windscreen. He snapped a picture of the yellow ticket and posted it on Twitter, via social networking site Sportlobster, with the comment: 'Coffee cost me 39 pound. #nothappy.' But the 27-year-old Scot, who signed from Wigan for £7million last summer, got little sympathy on social media as fans mocked his tight-fistedness. Frankie Humphries told him: 'Sure 38 quid won't be denting your bank balance terribly,' and James Kearney said: 'That's at least five minutes wages! Unlucky pal.' One fan, Craig Wilson, sarcastically commented: 'Bet you're skint now,' while a Wigan fan quipped he should have stayed in the north-west to use the free parking outside the side's stadium. Another user, named Alan, joked: 'Take the boy out of Glasgow but can't take Glasgow out the boy!!' The midfielder, who landed a three-year contract with the club in September, has only played for the side seven times so far. He started his career at Hamilton before joining Wigan - where he established himself in the first team and played in the famous FA Cup final success over Manchester City in 2013. McArthur, who has a wife - Louisa - and a daughter Ella-Rose, often posts on social media about visiting coffee shops. In September he tweeted a picture of a Starbucks coffee cup with the name 'Jims' written on the side, and joked: 'This is what I sound like to a southerner'. Later that month he posted another picture of himself with his baby daughter after telling fans they were enjoying some 'daddy and daughter time' and 'two coffees will do it'. The tweet, which the 27-year-old Crystal Palace player posted on Twitter, caused outrage from fans . Jamie O'Hara has also caused outrage on Twitter . Multi-millionaire footballer Jamie O'Hara sparked a Twitter fury in 2012 after he wrote on the social networking site about his hard life as a professional footballer. The Wolverhampton Wanderers player - who is thought to be paid about £35,000 a week - posted a tweet where he appeared to bemoan his life situation, longing for 'easier' days on £100 a week. The 26-year-old wrote: ‘Things were so much easier when I earned 100pound a week on wts #stress’. The tweet referred to his days on the Youth Training Scheme, and it did not take long before his followers' angry reactions came flooding in. And after an angry backlash from followers, he caused even more fury by hitting back with: ‘Why do people think cos I earn good money I don't have bills to pay we all pay tax an we have mortgages to pay, some people are deluded.’ Dozens of people bombarded Twitter with mocking tweets, accusing the footballer of being out of touch with the lives of ordinary people.","James McArthur had taken trip to Costa coffee shop in London this week .

"A burglar returned money he stole from a children's fundraising cup to the football academy he took it from - with added interest. Darren Green, 30, went to Top Corner Sports in Middlesbrough, which is owned and managed by retired footballer Jamie Pollock, to watch his nephew play football when he took the cash. A court heard Green, who has committed 41 offences, seized his chance to steal in a 'moment of madness' after the building was made accessible to the public during the football tournament. Scroll down for video . Darren Green, 30, admitted stealing the cash from Top Corner Sports in Middlesbrough when he went to watch his nephew play football . He went into the closed bar area and stole a black cash box and a cup full of money for children's fundraising, according to the Evening Gazette. Teeside Magistrates' Court heard that when he was challenged by a suspicious witness on the evening of November 11, he said he worked at a nearby office. But he later confessed he had taken the money to his manager and police and paid back £150 to the football academy, which is home to five children's football teams. Top Corner Sports, which has five-a-side pitches, is owned and managed by former Middlesbrough footballer, Jamie Pollock (pictured in 2000) Green, from Teesville in Middlesbrough, admitted the burglary - his 41st crime on record and his first since 2011. Dominic Tate, defending, said: 'Clearly he's made a massive mistake. He recognises the error of his ways. He realised that almost immediately. 'He went back later that night to try and rectify things. However it was the following day he then returned and repaid the money, with additional money also. 'He understands that he shouldn't have done this. Essentially it was a moment of madness. 'His original intention was to see his nephew play football. He saw the cash and unfortunately took the incorrect decision to take that money.' Mr Tate told the court that Green, whose pregnant girlfriend sat in the public gallery, was currently working as an Avon representative and a volunteer for a local garage. He explained that the 30-year-old had made efforts to turn his life around and had shown extreme remorse. Robert Birch, chairing a bench of three magistrates, told Green that while he accepts his deep regret and the fact he has repaid the money, he had committed a 'crime against the community'. Green was given a one-year community order with supervision and must carry out 60 hours of unpaid work, and ordered to pay £100 costs. Following the sentencing, Top Corner Sports said it was delighted the money had been returned. A spokesman said: 'We're really pleased that the money was returned. 'All money raised by the children of Top Corner Sports is re-invested and put back into this community initiative and used to support local children of all ages and abilities to improve their football skills, but more so to build friendships for the future. 'We would like to thank those involved in bringing this sad incident to a closure and the monies can now be returned and used by the children.'","Darren Green went to Top Corner Sports to watch nephew play football .

"The RSPCA should stop attempting to bring criminal prosecutions against hunts, an independent inquiry found yesterday. The charity should also rethink its longstanding role of taking animal cruelty cases to court, and help develop a new system in which it would work with Government agencies to bring offenders to book. The inquiry led by former Crown Prosecution Service chief inspector Stephen Wooler followed criticism of the RSPCA over its successful prosecution of the Heythrop Hunt for breaking hunting law by using hounds to chase foxes in 2012. Scroll down for video . The RSPCA was accused of a political vendetta against the Heythrop Hunt and the magistrate in charge of the case called the prosecution costs run up by the the charity ‘staggering’. Above, huntsmen from the hunt in 2012 . The charity was accused of a political vendetta against the hunt – which once numbered David Cameron among its riders – and the magistrate in charge of the case called the £327,000 prosecution costs run up by the RSPCA ‘staggering’. Fines and costs levied against the hunt came to less than £30,000. Mr Wooler said the charity had over its 190-year history come to act as a private police force pursuing those suspected of animal cruelty. ‘The current role of the RSPCA has evolved largely outside the mainstream criminal justice system and owes more to history than any strategy,’ he said. ‘The unstructured and haphazard environment within which the RSPCA operates now means that the RSPCA role is poorly defined and its relationships with the public bodies with whom its work overlaps are unclear.’ He added that the charity has substantial public support but ‘there are significant weaknesses. In particular, its prosecution role has failed to develop to accord with contemporary expectations of transparency and accountability. It therefore needs to adapt.’ The report recommended that prosecutions under hunting law should be the province of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service, and the charity should act only as a last resort if state organisations fail to act. Cruelty prosecutions should be pared back to avoid clashing with the RSPCA’s campaigning objectives. On the Heythrop prosecution, the report said that the 2004 law outlawing hunting with dogs had failed to stop traditional hunting. ‘The evidence reviewed leaves no room for doubt that, despite the 2004 legislation, traditional fox hunting remains “business as usual” in many parts of the country. 'Extensive flouting of the law risks bringing Parliament, the police and prosecuting authorities into disrepute. Widely publicised criticism of the RSPCA over the costs of the Heythrop Hunt case undoubtedly caused it reputational damage even though the prosecution itself was fully justified,’ it found. The report, which runs to 140 pages and contains a string of recommendations for re-organisation the the charity’s prosecution arm, said the RSPCA must develop an open system of co-operation with state investigators and prosecutors. ‘Without such change, the Society will be vulnerable to those with a very narrow agenda that is not founded on legitimate concern,’ he said. RSPCA chairman Mike Tomlinson said: ‘The RSPCA recognises that the world has dramatically changed during the 190 years that we have been investigating animal welfare complaints and helping to enforce the country’s animal welfare laws. Ruling: On the Heythrop prosecution, the report said that the 2004 law outlawing hunting with dogs had failed to stop traditional hunting. Above, Heythrop Huntsmen and hounds, pictured in 2008 . ‘We accept the need to re-position the RSPCA’s long-standing enforcement role and will now consider these recommendations in detail. We are determined to ensure that we operate an enforcement process fit for the 21st century. The public and the animals deserve no less.’ He added: ‘Hunting prosecutions are a tiny part of the RSPCA’s enforcement work but this review provides an ideal opportunity to look at the way we handle such cases and to make any necessary adjustments. 'Significantly, the review found that the RSPCA’s prosecution of the Heythrop Hunt had been appropriately brought and was not politically motivated. We accept the criticism that the costs of that case were much too high and have implemented lessons learned in subsequent cases.’","Inquiry followed criticism of the RSPCA over prosecution of Heythrop Hunt .

"Myth: Very few over-65s are moving after retirement, and those that do stay in the same area . Moving to a quiet place in the countryside, by the coast or even abroad, might seem like the perfect retirement. But for most older people it seems the reality is a lot closer to home. Despite winding up careers and no longer having young families to look after, millions of over-65s prefer to stay exactly where they are. Analysis by the Office for National Statistics showed only a tiny number relocate – and most of those who do move house still stay in the same area or close by. The reluctance of older people to leave their neighbourhood was revealed in a study of 2011 national census figures. Only 3.6 per cent of over-65s said they had changed their address in the previous year and 57 per cent of those stayed within the same local authority boundaries. The findings come despite current retirees enjoying the financial benefits of five decades of rising house prices and of gold-plated final salary pensions, which have disappeared for most young people. Older people who do move are likely to have reasons that include downsizing from a large family home, the need for personal or medical care, or the loss of a spouse or partner, the report said. Increasingly, a husband or wife may be lost through a marriage break-up rather than death – 8.7 per cent of over-65s are now divorced, compared with 5.2 per cent at the last census in 2001. There are no comparisons from previous censuses to show whether the trend for retirees to stay put is a rising trend, because no comparable question about moving home was asked. Scroll down for video . Pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann said: ‘Many [older people] prefer to stay in the family home, which is not just bricks and mortar, but part of the family… the kind of homes many older people would want to live in aren’t there, because we aren’t building them. Many people do not want to live in a flat.’ She said retiring abroad has also become less likely. ‘France and Spain have been highly popular retirement destinations in recent years, but that has been reversed, partly because people may have underestimated some of the problems they can encounter,’ she said. ‘The grass is not always greener, and the beach isn’t always sandier.’ The ONS report said 5.8 per cent of the retirees who relocated in the year before the census had moved from abroad. It also found that for every 100 women over 65 who relocated, only 72 men did so. The ONS said this may be due to longer female life expectancy, leading to women downsizing into more manageable accommodation or ‘to access residential care support’. A new reason for older people staying put may be that they are delaying retirement, with one in ten over-65s in employment or looking for a job, the report said. The most popular regions among movers were the South East and the South West, with 4.1 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively.","Only very few over-65s move home, and those that do stay in same area .

"Miss Husain said that all right-thinking people share outrage at the behaviour of extremist Muslims . The BBC’s most prominent Muslim presenter yesterday urged Islamic scholars to use social media to defeat terrorist propaganda. The Today Programme’s Mishal Husain said that theological arguments could form a ‘counterpoint’ to the claims made in the Islamic State’s murder videos. Miss Husain said that all right-thinking people share outrage at the behaviour of the extremist group and called for support for Muslim campaigns against terror. Her intervention, in an interview with the Radio Times, came amid widespread condemnation of Islamic State hostage murders, and its attempt to use horrific videos to draw support in the West, from the leading British Islamic organisations. Miss Husain, 41, who moved to her high-profile role at the Radio 4 news show last year, was asked if Muslims in Britain were coming under too much pressure to apologise for every grotesque act carried out by the Islamic State. She praised a campaign set up in east London to publicise rejection of terror by British Muslims. ‘I think the Not In My Name campaign is a very positive development because outrage is shared by all right-thinking people,’ Miss Husain said. ‘I would really like to see much more of the counterpoint from a theological perspective, with scholars taking to social media to refute the awful arguments we see put forward in those videos.’ A number of prominent Islamic organisations, including the Muslim Council of Britain and the Islamic Society of Britain, together with local alliances of mosques, have made calls for clerics to condemn the Islamic State and its methods. The Not in My Name campaign, organised by the anti-extremist Active Change Foundation, has appealed to young Muslims to use Twitter and social media to make their voices heard. Miss Husain said she believed that most Muslims in Britain follow a tolerant strand of Islam. ‘I don’t think my way of life is under any kind of threat,’ she said. ‘I think I’m true to the way my parents brought me up and the home I came from.’ Inayat Bunglawala of Muslims4UK said that Miss Jusain's call was 'a helpful development' She added that she found the debate about Muslim identity in Britain misguided. ‘The emphasis on what you wear on your head or how many times you pray, on the outward things rather than what’s in your heart and the way you treat people, I find slightly misguided,’ she said, adding that she had not met people who called themselves British Muslims until she arrived at Cambridge University in 1992. ‘Before that people generally said British Asian or “of Pakistani heritage”,’ Miss Husain said. ‘Then I became aware that Islam was the defining bit. If you’ve never been to India or Pakistan, don’t speak the language, Islam is more accessible; it has no boundaries.’ Asked how she would described herself, she said: ‘Oh gosh! I would say simply British. I feel it’s a shame that we have started to divide people much more. Now we want to know whether people are Sunnis or Shias. All these labels within communites. I’m not sure how helpful it is.’ The rise of religious intolerance in Pakistan is recent and she had not encountered it when visiting the country as a child, she said. Her paternal grandfather, a devout Muslim from the Punjab, married an equally devout South Indian Catholic. ‘I remember asking him, “Did you ever ask her to convert?” He just looked at me baffled, and said, “We were both people of strong faith, and we understood each other perfectly.” He used to drive her to church.’ Miss Husain, who was born in Northampton, lived in the Middle East as a child as her family moved with her doctor father’s career. She said of her time living in Saudi Arabia, when she wore a head-to-toe black abaya cloak: ‘It was not enjoyable. Not great in the heat.’ She has said that she will never wear the hijab, and also acknowledges that she drinks alcohol and does not fast during Ramadan. Miss Husain, who is married with three children, added that she had travelled through Syria as a child when her father drove the family from Abu Dhabi to London. ‘I remember the water wheels of Hama, the grandeur of Old Damascus, where I felt as though I was in One Thousand and One Nights,’ she said, ‘and driving through Aleppo. I have never been to Syria since, only gazed across the border from Lebanon when speaking to Syrian exiles there.’ She said the trip would be impossible today. Muslim activists welcomed her intervention in the debate over Islamic State yesterday. Inayat Bunglawala of Muslims4UK said: ‘This is a helpful development. There is no reason why scholars should not be arguing on social media. ‘There is a lot to be said for a prominent lady in her position making her views known. Her actions may help persuade other Muslim ladies to speak out.’","Today host praised campaign set up in London to publicise rejection of terror by British Muslims .

"More than 100 homes a week are being seized from elderly people by councils to pay for their care home fees. Families have been forced to hand over properties because local authorities are refusing to pay for the care. The scale of the confiscations – revealed yesterday by a Freedom of Information request – will pile pressure on the Government to help the thousands of families forced to pay ruinous care fees. Scroll down for video . More than 100 elderly a week are being forced to give up their houses to pay for care home fees . The Coalition promised a cap on care costs by 2016, but this will only apply to bills of £72,000 or more. Up to that point, all those with assets of more than £23,250 are expected to pay their own way – even if that means selling the family home or agreeing to surrender it when their relative dies. Between 30,000 and 40,000 people a year are thought to lose their homes this way. Critics say the system denies families their inheritances and punishes those who have worked hard, saved and paid mortgages. The figures – gathered by the finance firm NFU Mutual – showed that over the past five years councils have taken legal action to secure a share in more than 3,000 older peoples’ homes each year. From 2009 to 2014 the 72 councils questioned put a charge on 15,174 homes. Older people with assets of more than £23,250, must pay their own care bills. Many are forced to sell their homes to meet the costs, which are close to £600 a week for an average care home place. Councils take out a legal charge on a property when an older person will not pay care bills, and the council has to cover the cost. Often the family has failed to sell the home. Some try to give their property to their children if they suspect they will need costly care. But they must still pay care bills for seven years after the gift is made. During this time, the council will put a charge on the property. A charge is also taken out in the ‘deferred payment’ scheme, which allows the person to stay in their home. The charge ensures the council can seize and sell the property after the owner dies. The number of properties targeted annually rose by more than 10 per cent over the period – from 2,816 in 2009/10 to 3,109 in the financial year which ended in March. On average, there were more than eight charges on homes every day. However, if the councils which did not provide FOI answers have been taking homes at the same rate, numbers will be nearly 17 a day, well over 100 a week. The thousands of homes taken without dispute, from families who agree to sell up and settle their bills before legal pressure from the town hall, are not included in the figures. In cases where the local authority agrees that the family can delay paying care costs until after the relative has died and their home is sold, councils often treat continued use of the property as a form of loan – and will charge high interest rates when the home is sold. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘We know that every day, thousands of families face agonising decisions about care … where dwindling savings are just not enough to meet rocketing care costs.’ She added: ‘The Government needs to help people understand … how the system will work and what they will actually have to pay, and ensure a care system is in place that is fit for today’s older people and future generations.’ Seizure of homes happens because of the means test system that affects people who need to go into care homes or have help at home. Councils carry out the means tests and insist those with property sell it to meet the costs of their care – unless there is a spouse, a disabled relative or a child still living there. People who have no savings and own no property are given free care home places paid for by councils. Many cases included in the figures involve people who have failed to pay their bills and now face legal action by local authority lawyers. Others are a result of ‘deferred payment’ schemes, in which people live in their homes while the council provides care, but the council takes the property after their death. Philip Davies, MP for Shipley, said the system is ‘grotesquely unfair’.","Between 30,000-40,000 thought to lose homes this way every year .

The injunction . was also designed to prevent anyone knowing the names of the social . workers, or discovering the name of the local authority that applied for . the order, Staffordshire County Council. Sir . James, president of the Family Division of the High Court, also . rejected the council’s bid to bar the father from sharing information . about the case. And in a . dramatic intervention, he said there was a ‘pressing need’ for more . transparency in the family justice system as a whole. Destroyed: The father says he was left feeling powerless and upset by the removal of his baby son . The . 41-year-old husband at the centre of the case said yesterday: ‘Taking . our children away destroyed my life and my wife’s life. I posted the . video to show how draconian the state can be even when social workers . have accepted we would never have harmed our children.’ The . father, whose comments could not be printed until the judge’s . intervention, added: ‘Hopefully if there’s more openness in how these . decisions are made it will prevent injustices.’ They . claim social workers removed their baby because they decided the mother . was incapable of bringing them up because of her learning disability. The couple said it was only after they had a second daughter in 2008 they came ‘under the microscope’. One social worker can be heard saying: 'We are here to take [baby J]. I don't want to have to get physical' Harrowing: The bewildered newborn baby can be heard crying during the distressing seizure . Sir James Munby said the baby's father should not be prevented from sharing information about the case after Staffordshire Council tried to gag him . Two . years later, the mother was accused of pulling her elder daughter’s . hair – which she denies – and after an investigation, both girls were . taken away. The couple had a third daughter last year, but she was taken . away aged six hours, the same fate that was to befall their baby son, . known only as J. Accompanied . by police, social workers allegedly citing ‘risk of emotional harm’ took him away following his birth in April, unaware the father was . filming on a computer webcam. In . the video, the mother is clearly distraught as her husband remonstrates . with officers and council staff at their Staffordshire home. In June . the father was given a suspended six-week prison sentence for refusing . to co-operate in removing the video from internet sites. An . edited version of it plus the parents’ account can only now be . published following Sir James’s ruling, although they still cannot be . named in order to protect their children, three of whom have now been . adopted. The father said: . ‘The social workers said my wife and I were in a volatile relationship. There has never been violence. The court was told there was a risk the . children would come to harm in the future. They were never harmed.’ He . added: ‘The judge’s comments are a step in the right direction, but I’d . like to see the Press allowed into all family courts to stop social . workers getting away with telling lies.’ The . father said that although social workers considered his wife disabled, . her disability benefits were halted after intervention by council staff, . and because neither work they had to be supported by family. Staffordshire . council said it had never tried to shield itself from scrutiny. ‘I . believe any parent in this situation should be able to tell their story, . but the prime interest of the local authority is that the child has to . be protected,’ council leader Philip Atkins said. Last . night the British Association of Social Workers warned that encouraging . aggrieved families to publicise their experiences risked ‘demonising’ their profession. Chief . executive Bridget Robb said: ‘Such images do not tell the whole story. If the public want children to be protected, they have to get behind . social workers, understand that removal of a child is not a decision . taken lightly by them alone. Sire James Munby told his colleagues they must learn to deal with offensive and defamatory material on the internet, rather than ‘throw up their hands and moan’. The country’s most senior family law judge said much of what is posted online about the courts is ‘highly objectionable’ but the law had to adapt to it and judges must stick to the ‘fundamentally important principles’ of free speech. Sir James spoke during his High Court ‘Child J’ ruling this week, one of the first to advise judges on how to deal with material on the web and social media. He said: ‘The internet allows anyone, effectively at the click of a mouse, to publish whatever they wish. ‘The consequence is that the internet is awash with material couched in the most exaggerated, extreme, offensive and often defamatory terms, much of which has only a tenuous connection with objectively verifiable truth. ‘The law must develop and adapt, as it always has done down the years in response to other technologies. We must not simply throw up our hands in despair and moan that the internet is uncontrollable. Nor can we simply abandon basic legal principles.’","Seizure by Staffordshire social workers secretly recorded on webcam .

Glasgow Airport spokesman Brian McClean told MailOnline the landing was made at the request of the captain and the airport declared a full emergency as a precautionary measure. Witness Andrew Workman took photos as flight LO004 landed safely shortly before 11.30am. The Dreamliner was met on arrival by emergency services and was allowed to taxi to the main terminal building after an inspection by firefighters did not find any flames or smoke. No injuries were reported. Technicians inspected the plane after it landed and deemed it safe, according to an airline spokeswoman .

Boeing's flagship 787 model made its maiden flight in December 2009 following two years' of delays, and its brief history has been a troubled one. Despite the fanfare surrounding the iconic plane, the model has suffered extensive delays, manufacturing holdups and problems with its lithium-ion batteries in a program worth an estimated £19m. Last year, the world's entire Dreamliner fleet was grounded for three months - just two years after entering commercial service - for repairs after two lithium-ion batteries burned in two incidents in Japan and the United States. Border Force employees check the plane's cargo, including cartridges for firearms, as it is removed . Firefighters did not find any flames or smoke during their inspection of the aircraft .

"Terrifying video footage shows the moment four badminton players narrowly escaped being crushed to death when the roof of a stadium collapsed mid-match. Two singles matches were taking place in Ho Chi Minh City for the Vietnam Open when the roof caved in, raining down huge chunks of concrete on the court. One spectator managed to film the dramatic moment a huge section of the ceiling caved in and spectators screamed and ran for cover. Just seconds before the collapse, the referee had halted two simultaneous first-round singles matches taking place at the Phan Dinh Phung Sports Cente, when the roof started to move. He managed to usher the four players off the courts just before the roof gave way. Players and spectators at the £30,000 tournament in Ho Chi Minh City were left unharmed but shaken. Players were evacuated from the courts after the roof started moving - just seconds before it collapsed . It has been confirmed the building was  earmarked for renovation. The dramatic footage shows spectators dashing for cover as the ceiling fell, leaving a pile of debris and sending a plume of dust into the air. 'This stadium was too old, nearly 30 years old,' said Mai Ba Hung, deputy head of the city's Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism. The concrete rained down on the courts as spectators screamed and ran for cover . 'It is awaiting major reconstruction, so safety checks may have been a bit loose,' Mr Hung said. He said the tournament had been shifted to the city's Tan Binh Sports Center and an investigation into the ceiling collapse would take place. Organisers of badminton's Vietnam Open rushed to set up a new venue on Wednesday and resume play for the shuttlers who had a narrow escape from a ceiling collapse at an indoor stadium.","Two Vietnam Open matches were taking place when roof collapsed .

"Plans for an exclusive £30m hotel and golf course development on the estate that was home to press baron Lord Beaverbrook have been given the green light after a lengthy legal battle. The proposals for Cherkley Court near Leatherhead, Surrey, were scrapped when a High Court judge quashed planning permission in August. Now the Court of Appeal has ruled that plans to turn the historic greenbelt estate into a golf resort can go ahead after all. Grandeur:  Cherkley Court near Leatherhead in Surrey, will now become a luxury golf resort after a High Court decision was overturned on appeal. It is the former estate of media baron and politician Lord Beaverbrook . An artist's impression of the clubhouse at the Cherkley Court development . Mr Justice Haddon-Cave found Mole Valley District Council's decision to grant planning permission on such an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty was perverse, and that the council had 'erred in law'. But Law Lords yesterday overturned his judgement after an appeal by the council and developer Longshot Cherkley Court. Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the Express Newspaper Group and minister during both World Wars, bought the property after a single viewing in 1911. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, to whom he acted as a confidante, is said to have had his own room because he spent so much time there. Canadian-born Lord Beaverbrook revolutionised the media in the UK . In 2010 the historic country house closed to the public and was put up for sale after the Beaverbrook Foundation decided it could no longer be profitable. The project, which is expected to create 200 jobs, includes an 18-hole golf course which is being co-designed by golfer Tom Watson. Local campaigners, backed by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), argued the project would blight precious chalk grassland habitat. They said ecological and water surveys should have been carried out. Ian Todd, director of developers Longshot Cherkley Court, said: 'From our point of view the Court of Appeal judgement and the overwhelming support from the local community have only strengthened our resolve to deliver a project, of which Mole Valley residents can be justifiably proud.' Yvonne Rees, chief executive of Mole Valley District Council, said: 'The appeal raised a number of important planning principles which are of significant interest to other planning authorities across the country. 'Such a decision reinforces the validity of the decision-making process that MVDC undertook.' Shaun Spiers, chief executive of Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: 'This is a good day for millionaire golfers, and a very bad day for the countryside. 'CPRE Surrey and the Cherkley Campaign have fought a magnificent battle against the suburbanisation of some outstanding open countryside. It is a huge shame that on this occasion they have outgunned by the big battalions.' In his judgement in the High Court, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave ruled that 'very exclusive private demand' was contrary to public need and highlighted the number of golf facilities already in the area. Plush: How the swimming pool at the £30million resort might look . Palatial: Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the Express Newspaper Group and a minister during both World Wars, bought the property after a single viewing in 1911 . In a statement today, Longshot Cherkley Court said: 'Lord . Justices Richards, Underhill and Floyd unanimously agreed that Mr . Justice Haddon-Cave’s quashing order and costs order should be set . aside. 'The planning permission for the transformation of Cherkley Court has now been reinstated. 'LCC, having bought the site three years ago, looks forward to pressing ahead with its implementation, thereby enabling them to fully preserve and transform this precious site of historic and environmental importance.' Local campaigners, backed by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), argued the project would blight precious chalk grassland habitat . The project, which is expected to create 200 jobs, includes a 18-hole golf course which is being co-designed by Tom Watson . Cherkley Court is located in Surrey, near Leatherhead . It added: 'Working closely with the local community, they are confident that Cherkley has an exciting future which will honour the building’s history, protects the precious landscape and ensures that this unique location is enjoyed by many people for many generations to come. 'The project will create up to 200 jobs across all the estate’s facilities and they will be looking to recruit at operational and management levels for the hotel, spa, health club, gardens, golf course and club house. 'Having already awarded the construction contract to the local company Wates, LCC will also be seeking where possible to employ local Mole Valley residents.' Sir Winston Churchill pictured chatting with his friend Lord Beaverbrook at Beaverbrook's 83rd Birthday celebrations. Churchill is said to have had his own room at the estate because he spent so much time there . Lord Beaverbrook was an influential press baron, owning The Daily Express, the Sunday Express and the London Evening Standard. He was also a powerful politician, serving as a government minister during both World Wars. Born Max Aitken in Maple, Ontario, Canada in 1879, he set up his first newspaper at the age of 13. The shrewd businessman made his fortune as a young man in Halifax and moved to Britain in 1910. He quickly turned to politics and found candidacy as a Conservative, and then election, in Ashton-under-Lyme, in Manchester. From 1911 he made overtures to buy the Daily Express in London, slowly increasing his stake in the newspaper from that year onwards. By 1916 he owned the paper outright. It is widely believed he was a key player in the ousting of wartime Prime Minister Herbert Asquith and the rise of his replacement Lloyd George in 1916. Later that year he was offered a peerage and chose the title Beaverbrook. After resigning as Minister of Information, the 1920s and 1930s established Beaverbrook's reputation as a brilliant exponent of crusader politics. In 1919, the Daily Express sold 400,000 copies a day. By 1938 it sold 2,329,000 and by 1960, 4,300,000. He attracted criticism in the run up to the Second World War for his isolationist stance and defence of Russian leader Josef Stalin, but when he became minister of aircraft production by Winston Churchill, fighter and bomber production were immeasurably increased. 'This was his hour,' Churchill later declared. After the war he travelled, wrote and engaged in charity work. He died in June 1964.

"'Erratic': Steven Brooks is set to become the first Nevada Assemblyman to be expelled in 150 years . A Nevada politician is set to become the first assemblyman to be expelled from the state's legislature in 150 years after being arrested for violent disturbances twice in two months. Steven Brooks's 'increasingly erratic' behaviour began in January when he was arrested after allegedly making threats toward colleagues. According to police he had a gun in his car and dozens of rounds of ammunition. He was arrested a second time  in February after a domestic disturbance at his estranged wife's home in which police say he threw punches and tried to grab a officer's gun. Now a bipartisan Nevada legislative panel has recommended his expulsion after voting 6-1 in favour. The expulsion requires a two-thirds majority vote of the Assembly, though Assembly Majority Leader William Horne gave no indication when the full chamber might take up the matter. The seven-member panel was tasked with recommending what action should be taken against Brooks. Since January, the 41-year-old Democrat from North Las Vegas has been arrested twice, hospitalized for a mental evaluation and placed on leave from the Legislature. The last time the Assembly considered kicking out a sitting member was in 1867, but it never came to a final floor vote. Brooks' attorney, Mitchell Posin, said the vote was 'disappointing, of course. I hope when the Assembly meets to consider this, they see another side of this as Ms. Neal did.' He was referring to Assemblywoman Dina Neal, the North Las Vegas Democrat who cast the lone dissenting vote. She said she preferred suspending Brooks. 'I was at a crossroads and I know Steven Brooks needs help,' she said. Horne reiterated the difficulty of the panel's job and said it had been 'difficult watching these events the last few months.' 'I believe, as others, that Steven - Mr. Brooks - is not ready, not capable of serving in this body,' Horne said. 'I haven't seen and I was hoping to see something that would lead me to see something to think he may be able to. I really hope he does seek that help.' Leave: Nevada Assemblyman Steven Brooks, D-North Las Vegas during the opening day of the 77th Legislative Session in Carson City last Monday. Embattled: Nevada Assemblyman Steven Brooks, D-North Las Vegas, gets his shoes shined at Comma Coffee, across the street from the Legislative Building in Carson City last week . The committee met for three hours . behind closed doors to consider Brooks' behavior and medical issues. Horne said that while he preferred open meetings, 'there is a point at . which we must protect privacy.' He added that Brooks already has been . the subject of intense media attention and that it was not the panel's . intention to 'harm or further embarrass Mr. Brooks.' Mark Ferrario, the panel's independent . counsel, said the private documents include health records and other . information obtained from state agencies under the condition of . confidentiality. Posin sat alone in the courtroom that . was set up for the hearing. He did not explain why Brooks was not . present, but agreed with the decision to close the meeting to the . public. 'It is appropriate to have some . matters in public but there are also some very private documents here . that do not belong in the public eye,' Posin said. Brooks, a two-term Democrat from North Las Vegas, won re-election by a 2-to-1 margin in November over an unknown challenger. Since January, his behavior became . increasingly erratic and spiraled downward. In addition to the two arrests he was hospitalized after police were . called to his grandmother's home for a domestic disturbance, posed . shirtless for a newspaper photograph, was sworn in to the Legislature . but then banished from the Legislature building as a possible security . risk. Bizzare: The arrest came only days after the North Las Vegas Democrat embarked on a three-week leave following his January 19 arrest for allegedly threatening Assembly Speaker Marilyn Kirkpatrick, pictured . Concerning: The arrest came only days after the Assembly announced the unprecedented creation of a seven-member committee to investigate Brooks' behavior (file photo) Brooks hasn't been charged with a . crime in the threat case, but faces one felony and three lesser charges . in the case involving the police officer. He also was denied the purchase of a gun last month at a Sparks sporting goods store. Posin said before the hearing that Brooks poses no real threat to anyone. The Assembly last initiated the . expulsion of a member accused of libeling other lawmakers in 1867 but . never took a formal vote. Back then, Assemblyman A.H. Lissak, of Storey . County, had published a letter referring to the Assembly speaker's . 'sore-eyed, red-haired, baboon-looking face' in a political feud that . prompted a ban on Territorial Enterprise reporters from the chambers. An ouster requires a two-thirds majority, or 28 votes in the 42-member Assembly. Brooks' lawyer has already filed . papers with the Nevada Supreme Court to challenge legislative action to . prevent Brooks from serving voters who elected him. Posin argues the Legislature is taking unconstitutional steps to block Brooks' right and duty to serve his constituents.","First arrest for allegedly threatening Assembly Speaker Marilyn Kirkpatrick .

"It's Breaking 'bout time that the immensely popular AMC show added some Golden Globes to its roster of awards and on Sunday night, it did just that. The slow-burning cult classic bowed out in September with a critically acclaimed finale that was also a resounding hit with the show's diehead fans. It saw Bryan Cranston's meth-cooking antihero Walter White enjoy a redemption of sorts just before he died and involved a typically mesmeric performance from the 57-year-old. Scroll down for video . Well deserved: Breaking Bad scooped Best TV Drama and Bryan Cranston walked away with Best Actor for his epoch-making turn as Walter White . So it's fitting that the talent that powered the transformation from Walter's meek school science teacher incarnation to terrifying overlord 'I am the danger' Heisenberg era was recognised by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association at the 71st Golden Globes. Sadly, his partner-in-crime, the incandescent Aaron Paul, 34, lost out in the supporting actor to category to Jon Voight for Ray Donovan, but he got the chance to yell his catchphrase when the show bagged the Best Drama honour. 'Yeah, B****!,' Paul yelled after the ensemble cast took to the stage to accept their award with show creator, Vince Gilligan. Jesse gets his moment: Aaron got to yell Pinkman's 'yeah b****!' when the cast accepted the award for Best Drama . Recognition: Vince Gilligan finally got the recognition he deserves with this award . The winning team: Cranston, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt, Gilligan, R.J Mitte and Aaron Paul celebrate their achievement . Hey there, Skyler! Anna Gunn played White's Machiavellian wife in the show and she never got to wear dresses like THIS . Cranston took to the stage to thank Gilligan, who was a writer on the cult X Files, who helmed the show throughout its five seasons. 'He's a genius,' he told the audience before shouting out to Paul: 'I love you, man... you're a great actor!' He also thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and revealed he hoped a win at the Globes would help international audiences find the show. And it might not be the last time we've seen Paul's excitable but pure-hearted Jesse Pinkman, or strangely, Cranston's Walter. At last: Cranston accepted Best Actor for his incredible portrayal of Walter White in AMC's sleeper hit . Transformation: Cranston's performance as the meek chemistry teacher who becomes a drug kingpin was as breathtaking as Paul's was heartfelt . Slow burner: The show finished after its fifth season in October and was by that point a huge hit for the network . In the February issue of Details, Paul reveals he and co-star Cranston want to make cameos in the upcoming spin-off, Better Call Saul. With production on the spin-off scheduled to start later this year, the actor, whose character was last seen driving off into the sunset in the series finale, is eager to get back into those meth covered shoes. 'Both Bryan and I want to be a part of that, if they'll have us.' Television favourites: RJ Mitte, Bryan, Anna, Betsy Brandt and Vince posed together with the awards . Mr and Mrs: Cranston and Gunn enjoyed a moment at the AMC afterparty . Sparring partners: Jesse Plemons, who played psychopathic Todd in Breaking Bad, was pleased to see Aaron - who killed him in the series finale . His lucky night: Series creator Vince Gilligan gets a kiss from Anna Gunn and Betsy Brandt, as Cranston looks on . But the Emmy winner does admit when the series was winding down he couldn't resist giving input and sent a letter to producers with suggestions of how he thought his character should die in the finale. 'I just felt like I would always regret it if I didn't at least throw them a pitch on how I wanted Jesse to go out. So I gave a few different ideas of how I thought he would kill himself. I didn't want anybody else taking his life.' While he says 'the letter was awful,' producers, thankfully, didn't take the advice and spared Jesse's life in the end. The gang's all here: RJ Mitte, Cranston, Gunn, Gilligan and Brandt pose with their statues . 'I wish that I was Jesse's Girl!' Paul, with wife Lauren Parsekian in the background, got the party started as usual . Exciting times: Brandt, who played Walt's kleptomaniac purple loving sister-in-law thew herself into the celebrations . Interestingly, Jesse was supposed to be killed off in the first season but quickly became a fan favourite. Aaron was nominated for five Emmys for playing Jesse and won two during Breaking Bad's five year run. Back in September, the series finale attracted an all-time high of 10.3 million viewers. Step aside, Lady Macbeth! Robin Wright celebrated her win for Best Actress in a Television Series for House of Cards . Coming into her own: Elisabeth Moss's gritty performance in Top of the Lake won her Best Actress . Compelling: Moss in Top of the Lake and Wright in House of Cards . She did it! Robin gave the thumbs up as she rushed to the press room . Luckily, Gilligan has said he wants to bring both actors back for cameos on Breaking Bad Saul, which stars Bob Odenkirk as sketchy lawyer Saul Goodman. This is great news for Aaron who says he never interferes with what the writers and producers of the show do. 'I never give my two cents when it comes to Breaking Bad, because why would I?' he says. 'I'm just the actor, and what they're doing is perfect, you know?' Elisabeth Moss, 31, was probably similarly respectful on the set of her latest drama, the Sundance Channel's Top of the Lake, which is written by The Piano auteur Jane Campion. Hitting the ground running: Former SNL star Andy Samberg's Brooklyn Nine-Nine won Best Comedy and Best Actor for him . Eye candy: The Brooklyn Nine-Nine cast - Chelsea Peretti, Melissa Fumero and Stephanie Beatriz - are a comely bunch . Brand new hit: Samberg plays a police cub trying to cut it on the 99th precinct with his chief, played Andre Braugher . Rising star: Andy can add a Golden Globe to his impressive resume . Her diligence in the role of police officer Robin Griffin, who is investigating the disappearance of a pregnant 12-year-old, won her the Best Actress in a Mini-Series of Motion Picture TV award. Visibly shaken, the star - best known for her portrayal of Peggy Olsen in AMC's Mad Men, accidentally swore as she accepted her award. Newly engaged Robin Wright, 47, managed to keep her speech clean but was obviously moved as she was ushered to the stage to accept Best Actress in TV Drama. Wright shines as the Lady Macbeth to Kevin Spacey's Machiavellian US representative in the original Netflix series. No surprises: Michael Douglas won Best Actor for his acclaimed portrayal of Liberace in Behind the Candelabra . Showing the love: Douglas heaped praise on his co-star Matt Damon, and the pair enjoyed an embrace at the HBO party . Critically acclaimed: Douglas and Damon were a revelation in Behind the Candelabra . Big win: Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub won a Golden Globe for Behind The Candelabra . Saturday Night Live alum Andy Samberg, 35, hit the ground running with his new comedy, Brooklyn Nine-Nine. The show picked up the Best Comedy or Musical award and Samberg himself was named Best Actor in the same category. As predicted, Steven Soderbergh's Behind the Candelabra was named Best in the Mini Series or Motion Picture category and its leading man, Michael Douglas, claimed Best Actor. The 69-year-old, who played Liberace in the biopic, heaped lavish praise on his co-star Matt Damon, 43, for his portrayal of the musician's lover, Scott Thorson. She gets a go! Presenter Amy Poehler won for her turn in Parks and Recreation . Helping hand: Poehler got a backrub from Bono before collecting her award . Funny lady: The immensely popular Poehler was overjoyed to be recognised for her work on this hit show . 'The only reason he's not standing up here is I had more sequins,' Douglas generously quipped. Angelina Jolie's father Jon Voight, 75, upset the Breaking Bad clean sweep by pipping Paul to the Best Supporting Actor honour for Showtime's Ray Donovan. And the show's co-host, Amy Poehler, 42, got to see proceedings from the other side as she accepted Best Actress for Parks and Recreation in the Comedy of Musical section. 'What did she say?' Jacqueline Bisset's speech was a disaster but her performance in Dancing in the Edge was anything but . Jolie good: Angelina's father Jon Voight was a surprise win for Ray Donovan . Noted: Jon Voight in Ray Donovan and Bisset starring in Dancing on the Edge . Best Supporting Actress in Mini-Series of TV Motion Picture went to Jacqueline Bisset, 69, who funnily enough, could have done with some herself. She won for Dancing on the Edge, and given her rambling acceptance speech, may have just fallen off. Top prize: Chiwetel Ejiofor in 12 Years A Slave . BEST DRAMA12 Years A Slave .

"When Alan Pardew headed a dramatic FA Cup semi-final winner against Liverpool in 1990, his relationship with Crystal Palace fans changed. He became a cult hero after his extra-time goal took the Eagles to their only FA Cup final. Palace fanzine Eagle Eye even gave away ‘Supa Al’ badges showing Pardew flying to the rescue caped crusader-style. Pardew back in his playing days scored a memorable winner over Liverpool in the FA Cup back in 1990 . Crystal Palace vs Newcastle - Wednesday February 11, 8pm . Until then, there had been misgivings about a semi-pro Yeovil midfielder who quit his full-time job as a glazier to join Palace for £7,500. He had struggled to impose himself in a Palace side built around strikers Ian Wright and Mark Bright. There were times when Pardew was booed as his name was read out before games. Pardew, with highlights and a trendy haircut, was better known for his skills as team social secretary, something Steve Coppell — the club’s greatest boss — referenced at a recent Selhurst Park lunch. Pardew was a grafter but he was no match in midfield for the fans’ favourites Andy Gray, sold to Aston Villa in 1987 before returning in 1989, or the injured captain Geoff Thomas. Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . He left for Charlton in 1991 but whenever he has returned as a player or manager, Pardew has always been given a warm reception at Selhurst Park. He has earned it. This time last year he attended the funeral of former Palace chairman Ron Noades. Among hundreds of mourners, Pardew let it be known that he would love to return to Palace as manager one day. Now he has the chance. Pardew played a prominent role in Palace's recording of Glad All Over in the build up to the 1990 FA Cup final .","Alan Pardew scored a famous winner against Liverpool in the 1990 FA Cup .

"Stuart Pearce is under increasing pressure  after a Clayton Donaldson-inspired Birmingham City ensured Nottingham Forest’s winless run in the Championship extended to six matches. David Cotterill’s free-kick gave the visitors the lead before Donaldson fired in a brace before half-time. Forest could only muster a last-minute consolation through Britt Assombalonga, leaving Pearce at a loss to explain his side’s woeful recent form. Pressure is mounting for Nottingham Forest manager Stuart Pearce after his side's loss to Birmingham . Birmingham boss Gary Rowett acknowledges the travelling fans after getting his team back on track . Birmingham striker Clayton Donaldson (left) celebrates his second goal of the afternoon against Forest . ‘It was one of those games, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes I wouldn’t have believed it,’ said Pearce. ‘We started very well and had enough chances to win the game. We gave away three horrible goals. They’ve won it with a big charitable donation from Nottingham Forest. ‘I’ve told the players to roll up their sleeves and man up. The defeat today is more of our own doing than Birmingham’s, who did not deserve to win.’ In contrast, Birmingham boss Gary Rowett was overjoyed as his side bounced back from a Boxing Day thumping against Derby. The 4-0 reverse was the worst result of Rowett’s reign at St Andrew’s, but he stuck with the same 11 for this clash and was vindicated for his loyalty. Donaldson puts Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Karl Darlow under pressure for David Cotterill's opening strike . The midfielder (centre) has now scored seven goals for the Blues in the Championship this season . Rowett said: ‘It shows character because there’s one or two that might have fancied a breather today after that to get them out of the firing line. They’ve manned up and put in an absolutely fantastic performance once again.’ Tactically the match was also a triumph for Rowett as his side, which is set up to counter-attack, continually troubled Forest on the break. Cotterill found the target on 35 minutes after Henri Lansbury’s ugly challenge on Demarai Gray. The midfielder stepped up and hit the free-kick past everyone in the area to find the bottom corner. The ex-Doncaster man thought he had a second but it was Donaldson who had supplied the final touch. Birmingham worked a quick corner routine to catch the home defence asleep and Cotterill found space on the edge of the box for a shot that the centre forward turned past Karl Darlow. Forest defender Eric Lichaj (left) is put through his paces as City's Demarai Gray looks to beat him . A Nottingham Forest fan shows his support for Pearce from the sun-soaked stands of the City Ground . A third came before the break when Forest allowed Andrew Shinnie to twist and turn his way into the area and Darlow could only palm away his shot. The ball cannoned off the back of one of his own defenders and Donaldson guided the ball into an empty net. Pearce had clearly laid into his players at half-time and they came flying out of the blocks for the second half. But they could not find a way past the packed Blues defence as Lansbury and Jamie Paterson were frustrated by the Birmingham bodies being thrown into the fray. At the other end City had their chances to make it four with Donaldson and David Davis testing Darlow. Assombalonga headed in from Ben Osborn’s cross to get Forest on the board, but the damage was done.","Birmingham first half trio paved the way to victory at Nottingham Forest .

"Hibs chairman Rod Petrie insists the time has come for fan ownership at Easter Road – even if it could ultimately cost him his position. The Edinburgh club have unveiled plans backed by Sir Tom Farmer, who currently owns 98 per cent of Hibs, for a £2.5million flotation that would allow fans to take a 51 per cent controlling stake. Farmer, whose own shareholding will be dramatically diluted by the influx of new cash going straight into club coffers, has also cleared Hibernian’s bank debt and halved the overall borrowings of the club. Hibs chairman Rod Petrie (right) backs plans for fan ownership at Easter Road . The scheme, which has the influential backing of Easter Road legend Pat Stanton, opens the door for supporters – many of whom have been vitriolic in their demands for Petrie’s resignation – to ultimately call the shots in the boardroom. ‘Obviously, as the balance changes from 98 per cent ownership by the holding company and two per cent by supporters at the moment, closer to the 51 per cent of supporter ownership, then that will lead to greater influence of other people to have a say in who is on the board and what roles people have,’ Petrie said. ‘That will come out of the process we are on. ‘Today is about an important announcement for the club, it’s not about dissecting what’s happened over the last few months. It is a fantastic opportunity for Hibernian supporters, it’s what they have been saying they wanted. ‘I spoke to Pat Stanton this morning. He is welcoming it on behalf of supporters. It is something they want to unite behind. ‘It is important we understand this is a step along a journey. Over time, subject to the various approvals, there will be an opportunity for the fans to have a greater stake in the football club. Sir Tom Farmer currently owns 98 per cent of the Edinburgh club . ‘Together, as other people come on board and contribute to it, we will have a bigger group of people who are able to take the club forward. ‘All money raised by supporters will go into the club to help finance football activities. The money raised will not be used to buy shares from existing shareholders. Instead, the club plan to issue new shares in return for the money raised. ‘I think this is the way forward. The whole environment of football has changed. There is even a Scottish government working party looking at fan ownership and fan engagement. ‘The supporters put their faith in the club – and we’ve put our faith in the supporters. Together, we can take the club where it should be.’ Petrie reassured fans that Farmer isn’t about to remove the safety net provided by his financial strength, always ready in the event of an emergency, saying: ‘Sir Tom Farmer is not a guarantor but I understand the point about the comfort he provides. Hibs owner  Farmer (left) poses with Petrie at the opening of the club's new training centre back in 2007 . ‘Nothing changes. The holding company and every other shareholder have the shares they have at the moment. What we have done is take the opportunity for other people to have new shares.’ Stanton, welcoming proposals that contain cast-iron guarantees over the ownership of Easter Road and the club’s East Lothian training facility said: ‘A lot of people have come forward since relegation and they’ve done so because they care passionately about our club. A lot has been said – and now it is the time to get behind the team and support this plan. ‘As far as I am concerned, the plan gives people what they have been telling me they want, a much greater stake in their club. ‘I am particularly delighted that the stadium and training centre will remain in the ownership of the club – and therefore the supporters. ‘I would urge supporters to look at what is being proposed and I think they will find it to their liking. Things also look to be going in the right direction where it matters most, on the park, and I would urge everyone to unite behind the club.’ The proposals will go before shareholders at the club’s AGM on January 28 and, with Farmer already on board, they are guaranteed approval.","Hibs unveiled the plans backed by 98 per cent stakeholder Sir Tom Farmer .

"Former Ajax midfielder Demy de Zeeuw has been advertising his services via his personal LinkedIn account after becoming a free agent in the summer. The 31-year-old has been without a club since leaving Belgian side Anderlecht after the club decided not to renew the Dutchman's contract. De Zeeuw, who has made 27 appearances for Holland, has taken to business-orientated social network site LinkedIn to search for a club in 'Europe, the Middle East or MLS'.

"The nephew of the former owner of the San Diego Padres baseball team has died after the exclusive sports car he was driving rammed into an SUV on Christmas Eve. Barry Alexander Moores was driving a rare Ariel Atom sports car, which has top speeds of more than 150 mph, when he lost control of the vehicle on a curve. The 21-year-old, the nephew of multi-millionaire John Moores, then collided head-on with a Ford Expedition in Rancho Santa Fe, California, according to the Union-Tribune.

Pardew, who ducked the post match press conference after the dramatic 3-2 victory against Everton on Sunday, hopes he will be allowed to leave by mutual consent to join Crystal Palace. Despite a fixed £5million compensation clause in his contract, which still has six years to run, he will appeal to the Newcastle owner's compassionate side to let him walk away from the club after four years in charge.

Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club . Pardew made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991, scoring eight goals. The highlight of his time at Selhurst Park, however, was the FA Cup run in the 1989-90 season. Pardew was one of the 'Fab Four' (with Mark Bright, Gary O'Reilly and Andy Gray) and scored the winner against Liverpool in that memorable 4-3 semi-final victory at Villa Park (the other three also netted in that match). The Eagles pushed Manchester United all the way in the Wembley final, drawing 3-3 in the first match, but lost 1-0 in the replay. Pardew played every minute of both matches. Pardew has faced various campaigns calling for his resignation or dismissal by sections of supporters throughout his turbulent reign at the club. Ashley, who did not attend the victory over Everton on Sunday, is plotting his next move from his holiday retreat. The billionaire is wary of the upheaval if he allows his manager to quit the club and will also need to find a replacement prepared to work under his demanding ways. Ashley could yet play hardball and demand the £5m compensation from Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish, but the Eagles are unlikely to agree to that. Pardew is known to be frustrated after being told at a transfer meeting held around four weeks ago that there will not be any money to spend in January. Instead there is the possibility that Moussa Sissoko will leave in January after Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain declared an interest in the France midfielder. Pardew played a prominent role in Palace's recording of Glad All Over in the build up to the 1990 FA Cup final . The former Crystal Palace midfielder played for the south east London club from 1987 until 1991 . Newcastle are ninth in the Barclays Premier League following the victory over Everton and Ashley is happy with the team’s progress following their poor start to the season. Pardew, who wants to progress and challenge for honours, expected Ashley to make funds available to strengthen the team. Instead the Newcastle owner, who has an excellent relationship with his manager, appears content with the current squad. Pardew, who joined Palace in the Eighties and went on to score the winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in 1990, is currently at his family home in Surrey waiting for Ashley to make his move. Pardew (No 11) scores the winning goal for Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool . Pardew chose not to speak to the press following Sunday’s 3-2 win over Everton and he would have been aware that such a stance would fuel speculation linking him with a return to south east London. He returned south on Sunday night after Newcastle’s 3-2 victory over Everton, but is expected to be at the training ground on Tuesday morning as things stand. His first team players were given the day off after a hectic Christmas schedule, but the rest of the squad - including non-playing substitutes - reported for work. Pardew's press conference previewing the New Year's Day visit of Burnley - scheduled for Tuesday - is still planned to go ahead. Crystal Palace are stepping up their search to replace former boss Neil Warnock .

"Cardiff City have agreed to sell midfielder Mats Moller Daehli to Bundesliga side Freiburg for £2million in January. The 19-year-old was signed by the Bluebirds just 12 months ago from Norwegian outfit Molde by former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the club tried to avoid Premier League relegation. The Norway international has only made two substitute appearances since Russell Slade replaced Solskjaer in the Cardiff hotseat, and will officially complete his move to Germany on January 3. Cardiff City have agreed to sell Mats Moller Daehli (left) to Bundesliga club Freiburg for £2million .

'We would like to place on record our thanks to Mats for his contribution and wish him the very best for his future.' Daehli didn't make the match-day squad for Saturday's 3-2 home loss against Brentford - a result that sees the club move down to 11th in the Championship. In his 12 months at the club, the teenager has scored once in 24 appearances.

"Arsenal are planning a cut-price £4million January move for West Ham defender Winston Reid. Arsenal have identified the centre half because they believe West Ham can be persuaded to sell next month rather than lose Reid for nothing in the summer. Arsenal have watched Reid in every game he has played since November and are ready to make their move. Winston Reid is a target for Arsenal who are considering making a £4million offer in January . West Ham are trying to get the 26-year-old to sign a new deal but Reid wants more than £60,000 per week, in addition to a £1million signing-on fee. The Gunners are also keen on Ipswich left back Tyrone Mings, but his £10m asking price is proving prohibitive, while Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk has also been on the radar since last summer. Meanwhile, Inter Milan believe that they have struck a deal to sign Lukas Podolski on a six-month loan deal but not until after Arsenal have played at Southampton on New Year’s Day. Lukas Podolski is set to join Inter Milan on loan from Arsenal after struggling to feature for the first team . Representatives of the Italian club were in London on Saturday and are confident they will soon have Podolski in their ranks. Inter will pay a loan fee of £1.5m. The unsettled German striker has one year on his Arsenal contract at the end of this season and may not return if his loan is successful.","Arsenal hope to lure Winston Reid to the club in January .

"Property developers in Dubai are to resume building on a collection of artificial islands that form the shape of the global map. Construction on the cluster of man-made islands began in 2003 but was halted six years later in the wake of the financial crisis. So far only two of the 300 islands have been developed, though work on six dubbed the 'Heart of Europe' will get underway next year. Work is to begin again on the cluster of man-made islands in Dubai after development was halted following the 2008 economic crisis . The first European island to be built will be Germany, according to developers Kleindienst Properties. The project titled The World was unveiled in 2003 by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and was marketed as a playground for the rich and famous. Built using sand dredged from Dubai's shallow coastal waters, the islands lie four kilometres off the shore of Jumeirah. Properties vary between private homes, estate homes, 'dream resorts' and community islands. Richard Branson owns the piece of land that represents Great Britain. Though 60 per cent of the islands had already been sold to private developers in 2008, the majority of work came to a grinding halt as the emirate suffered the brunt of the worldwide economic crisis. The region found itself $100billion in debt after enjoying years of excessive and exuberant spending, leaving deep-pocketed investors hesitant to pile money into its many development projects. Only two of the 300 islands have so far been developed, with one playing host to a show home . The project which resembles the world's map was begun in 2003 but had to be suspended following the 2008 economic crisis . Dubai was forced to ask the federal government of the United Arab Emirates for a loan, forcing the closure or suspension of thousands of developments that may never be completed. Progress on construction sites indicate the city's recovery from such crisis however, with The World islands just one of the many examples of its strengthening property market. Apartment prices rose by 42 per cent from the beginning of the year to September 30, with almost 50,000 new flats under construction, the Times reports. Dubai's ruling family is eager to put return the city to its former state of prosperity by hosting the 2020 World Expo, which will bring about an estimated $25billion economic boost. The Virgin tycoon Richard Branson is pictured on the patch of land representing Great Britain in the archipelago of islands . Around $7billion has already been put aside to build new infastructure for the event that will reportedly create 277,000 jobs and attract 25million visitors to the UAE. The emirate's economy expanded by 4.9 per cent in the first half of 2013, with its stock exchange doubling in value and hittting a five-year high this week.","The cluster of man-made islands resemble the world's map from above .

"A British car collector spent four times the expected price of a 1967 Ferrari because it was once owned by the King of Cool Steve McQueen. The actor bought the Ferrari 275 GTB/4 while filming police drama Bullitt. In the film, his character Frank Bullitt is followed in his 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback by a black Dodge Charger in one of the best car chase scenes in Hollywood history. McQueen insisted during filming that he would perform most of his own stunts, including the high-speed car chase. Scroll down for video . Steve McQueen's old 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 was sold at auction earlier this week by a British car enthusiast for £6 million - four times more than it was worth . The stunning 165 mph Ferrari was bought by McQueen as he filmed Bullitt, which featured one of the most legendary car chase scenes in Hollywood history . McQueen, pictured left, kept the car until 1971 when he sold it to fellow actor Guy Williams who starred in Zorro and Lost in Space . Unlike the V8 in his film car, the Ferrari was powered by a magnificent 3.3 litre V12 engine producing 300bhp. From a standing start, the car would hit 60mph in 6.5 seconds before reaching a top speed of 165mph. McQueen kept the car until 1971 when he sold it to fellow actor Guy Williams, who appeared in Zorro and Lost in Space. Vern Schuppan, an Australian former Le Mans winner, recently bought the car and asked Ferrari to return the car to how it looked when McQueen owned it. The 165mph Ferrari, regarded as one of the finest classic sports cars, went under the hammer at RM Auctions' sale in Monterey, California. Bidding opened up at $4 million, before a phone bidder offered $6 million. It then went to $7m before increasing in increments of $250,000. At $8.5 million, the offer suddenly leapt to $9 million before the hammer went down at $9.25 million. The final price, with a premium, was $10.1 million (£6 million) - which is around four times what someone would have paid for the car had it not been owned by The Great Escape star. The 275 GTB/4 was one of the best looking Ferrari's ever made and was designed as a Grand Tourer, capable of being driven thousands of miles in speed and luxury . The car has leather bucket seats, wooden steering wheel and the famous Ferrari H gate gear shifter. The car has been restored immaculately by Ferrari specialists . The car is not fitted with a stereo as this would interfere with the sound from the v12 engine while there is even room in the back for two very short people . Max Girardo, managing director of RM Auctions in Europe, said: 'The Steve McQueen factor is simply immeasurable. 'There is nothing better to spend your money on than a Steve McQueen Ferrari.' McQueen's Ferrari was controversially - and expensively - transformed from a coupe into a convertible after he sold it. But Mr Schuppan, decided to spend a six-figure sum giving the car its McQueen factor back. He gave it to Ferrari's Classiche department which restored the car to how it looked when the screen icon had owned it. The staggering fee paid for the Ferrari is the latest example of the 'McQueen Factor', where people pay over the odds for cars owned by the late actor. In 2011, his old Porsche 911 sold for £830,000 - more than 12 times its typical value. The car has 14,243 miles on the clock, but having been owned by Steve McQueen, many of those miles would have been north of 100mph . The car underwent a six-figure restoration. Max Girardo of RM Auctions said: 'There is nothing better to spend your money on than a Steve McQueen Ferrari' According to Mr Girardo, having Steve McQueen's name on a car's logbook increases the value of the vehicle several times over as he is still 'The King of Cool' Mr Girardo had previously said the car 'ticks all the boxes when it comes to collectability'. Under the bonnet of the Ferrari 275 GTB/4 is a 3.3-litre V12 engine which develops 300bhp. Ferrari said the McQueen 275 was 'one of the more interesting cars ever to leave the factory'. While unconfirmed, it is thought the Ferrari has been sold to a very wealthy British car collector, who was bidding over the telephone. However, the Brit was not Chris Evans, who has been in Monterey for the week. But the Radio 2 presenter, who is known for his car collection, was involved in the record-breaking Ferrari 250 GTO auction on Thursday night. Bonhams said he bid $30 million for the Ferrari, but still missed out. The 250 GTO is also thought to have gone to a British buyer. The front engined rear-wheel drive sports car was capable of 165 mph in 1967 and produced 300bhp from its three-litre V12 engine able to hit 60mph in just 6.5 seconds .","Steve McQueen bought the 1967 Ferrari 275 GTB/4 while filming the classic movie Bullitt in San Fransisco .

"There are certain traditions over Christmas and New Year that are inevitable - and the trip to the pantomime often tops the list. But for some of us who have been to our fair share of festive plays 'she's behind you' can start to sound like a broken record. So rather than suffer another year of bad jokes and questionable celebrity guests FEMAIL has done the legwork and found the best alternative shows. From those  after a naughtier serving of  entertainment to parents looking for a show suitable for all the family, we have got an option for everyone. Scroll down for video . Sleeping Booty sees the traditional fairy tale take on a very adult, double entendre-packed persona . FOR THE GROWN-UP PANTO-GOER: SLEEPING BOOTY . Rating: . Verdict: Completely offensive but an absolute hoot . Vulgar, smutty and crude are just some of the words that could describe Sleeping Booty, an adult take on the classic fairy tale but, honestly, that's the appeal. The UK's number one adult pantomime production responsible for DICK! returns this year with its somewhat obscene version of Sleeping Beauty. The somewhat obscene production stars one of Soho's most infamous drag queens Miss Dusty O . The demure sleeping beauty that you are familiar with takes on a gangster persona in this story. The ladette and stripper Booty, desperate to rid herself of her purity enlists the help of Fairy Muff in the quest to find the perfect man to...do the job. But despite her best efforts the determined fairy can only conjure up the sexually ambiguous Prince Willie Wontie complete with silver knee high boots. Booty soon realises she will have to look elsewhere, so the story follows one princess's quest to pop her cherry while dodging the threats from the infamous drag queen Miss Dusty O who is at her best as the foul mouthed Mangelina wreaking havoc across the perverted panto land. The production follows the story of a young stripper on a quest to lose her innocence with hilarious results . The storyline may not be the strongest to have graced the West End but you are sure not to notice as the side-splitting humour that comes with it is enough of a distraction. The small venue creates  a cosy atmosphere so makes the perfect arena for audience participation - of which there is plenty -  for those of us who are still kids at heart. The themes may be tawdry but the performers are all talent and will honestly leave you in the best of moods. Who knew that a bad taste joke was the key to that  festive feeling? Sleeping Booty! runs at the Leicester Square theatre until 17 January. Ticket price £22. WARNING: Sleeping Booty is strictly an over-18s show . Matthew Bourne recreates Tim Burton's classic tale of Edward Scissorhands in a charming new ballet . FOR AN ENCHANTING EVENING: EDWARD SCISSORHANDS THE BALLET . Rating: . Verdict: Tentative and thoughtful . The ballet is one our most genteel Christmas traditions filled with Sugar Plum fairies and mouse kings. But the dance production of the Tim Burton classic Edward Scissorhands is a far cry from the Nutcracker. Matthew Bourne first wowed audiences with his production of Swan Lake 20 years ago when he ruffled feathers with his troupe of all male bare-chested swans. Fans of the film will notice the few changes to the storyline, particularly the ending in the ballet adaptation . It has since seen him reinvent classic ballets including Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella and Nutcracker. But for his latest work Bourne has chosen the ultimate Gothic fairy tale and the film that cemented director Tim Burton’s career in 1990, as well as those of its young stars Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder. The Scissorhands character, the clunky sharp-fingered Edward's awkward movements and clumsy manner are incorporated into a glorious and inventive sequence. The tender nature of Edward Scissorhand's character complements the style of dance exquisitely . Those who are familiar with the film will know that Edward isn't much of a talker and this marries perfectly with speechless ballet capturing his tender and curious characteristics perfectly. There is no shortage of stage magic with Edward's knack for hairdressing and topiary recreated entirely seamlessly and convincingly. Fans of the Tim Burton classic will notice some changes to the story with much of the brutal final scene altered and made more ballet-friendly. The quirky Burton sensibility remains, however, and the set and costumes are perhaps some of the most familiar aspects of  the production with the candy-coloured houses and all-American costumes instantly recognisable. Despite its sombre themes, the production is charming and is sure to leave you feeling surprisingly Christmassy. Edward Scissorhands is showing at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London until 11 January. Ticket price from £27. Slava's Snowshow follows the story of a clown caught in a snowstorm in a mesmerising production . FOR THE KID IN YOU: SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW . Rating: . Verdict: Breathtaking and endless fun . If there is one aspect of a panto that is always unavoidable, it is the grumpy dad. Uncooperative, refusing to engage in any sort of audience participation and murmuring 'oh no you didn't' as quietly as possible, it is well known that most dads do not share a passion for panto. So it really must be a testament to Slava's Snowshow that not only is there a sea of smiling men in the audience but a flurry of fathers who are actually WILLING to join in. The show relies mainly on mime  while the fantastical set and effects provides the main point of interest . The audience unravels giant spider webs (pictured) and gets caught in a spectacular snow storm . Celebrating the 20th anniversary of its UK debut in 1994, the multi award-winning production follows the tale of Assissiai the clown as he gets caught up in a spectacular snow storm that engulfs the whole stage. The style of the show is similar to that of Cirque du Soleil in its theatrical quality with the colours, set and music taking on an inventive and wacky charm. The storyline is loose and sometimes hard to follow with the cast of clowns relying mainly on mime to communicate the tale, however this is neither here nor there as the conjuring of a paper snow storm on stage is what you really come to see. The show which is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its UK debut is designed to appeal to your inner child . The performance is in no way confined to the stage and the audience becomes blasted by a blizzard and giant balloons pass through the crowd. The producers behind the show wanted to create an immersive experience that transports their viewers back to their childhood and the show does exactly that. The textures and colours of the inventive mise-en-scene are so tempting to both older and younger viewers that even the grumpiest of dads are transported back to a younger and more innocent time that is all about having fun and being silly. Slava's Snowshow is showing at  London's Southbank Centre until 5 January. Ticket price £20-£65. Premium tickets are also available. Recommended for children five years and over and strictly no children under three will be permitted.","We pick three seasonal shows that buck the usual festive formula .

"Louis van Gaal has warned Manchester United’s misfiring strikers that they can write off their title hopes if they continue to be as wasteful as they were against Tottenham. A point ensured United extended their excellent unbeaten run to nine games and keeps them within sight of Chelsea, but missed opportunities are grating on the Dutchman. He was unhappy after United could only draw at Aston Villa before Christmas and had pointed words for his squad after they left the pitch on Sunday. ‘I said in the dressing room that when you cannot win such type of matches when you are the better team — like against Villa and also now — then it is very difficult to be the champions at the end of the season,’ Van Gaal said. Hugo Lloris makes himself big to deny Robin van Persie as Manchester United spurned several great chances . Juan Mata sees his free kick deflected off the Tottenham wall and onto Hugo Lloris' post . ‘When you play your best first half of the season, as we did, and you are playing at White Hart Lane against a top-six club and you play like that and create six to eight open chances, then you have to finish them.’ United faded badly in the second half, with Ryan Mason blowing a glorious late chance to snatch a win for Spurs. Van Gaal blamed the festive schedule for his side’s slump, hitting out at the Premier League tradition that saw United, like the rest of the division, playing on Sunday having also turned out on Boxing Day. Neither Falcao or Van Persie were able to turn the ball over the line as it came back off the post . A frustrated Van Gaal makes an angry point to fourth official Lee Mason during the clash in London . Wayne Rooney scored twice on Boxing Day  but failed to find the back of the net against Spurs on Sunday . He said: ‘It is scientifically proven that the body cannot recover in 48 hours. You see what it is like — the second half is much different to the first.’ However, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino insisted: ‘The condition was the same for both teams. (They) had the same hours as us to recover.’ He also felt his side could have had a penalty in the second half when United’s Wayne Rooney grappled with striker Harry Kane. ‘Maybe it was a penalty because I saw it on the TV. But from my vision during the game it was difficult to define,’ he said. Rooney, continuing in his new midfield role, challenges in the air with Benjamin Stambouli . Radamel Falcao had several excellent chances in the first half, but could not find a way past Lloris .","Manchester United and Tottenham drew 0-0 in their Premier League clash .

"Contact lens wearers are risking their sight by shunning opticians and buying directly over the internet, eye experts are warning. They might be saving themselves a few pounds, but in ‘cutting corners’ they are also said to be putting themselves at risk of a dangerous eye infection. Foreign websites that sell lenses without asking to see evidence of a prescription are believed to be largely to blame for the problem. Scroll down for video . Experts fear that people are buying contact lenses online so they can avoid paying for a prescription (file pic) Cases of eye infection with a type of amoeba called Acanthamoeba – which can irreparably damage the corneas – have doubled since 2010, said Professor John Dart, of Moorfields Eye Hospital in London. He said the trend towards internet purchasing had contributed to the rise, because people do not undergo ‘vital’ eye checks so frequently. These are essential for spotting early signs of infection and to make sure people know about contact lens hygiene, explained Prof Dart. He said: ‘People will want to save money. So a student or a young person may try to cut corners to save money. They will get their eyes tested for lenses in the high street, but then get new supplies of lenses on the net. ‘They will decide to save money by avoiding contact lens checks. But these checks are vital, not just to see if the prescription needs changing, but to check eye health. 'You are putting a foreign object in your eye, and it is important your eyes are checked to make sure your contact lenses aren’t harming your eyes.’ Infection: Student Saira Hussain, 21, damaged her sight through poor contact lens care . Infection starts when contact lenses are exposed to the amoeba because, for example, the wearer stores them in water rather than sterile saline solution, or has worn them in the shower. If spotted early it can be treated with drugs, but if left untreated the infection can badly scar the eye. In a third of cases the cornea is so badly scarred it needs to be taken out and replaced with a donor one. Prof Dart has seen a seven-fold increase in cases of the infection – officially called Acanthamoeba Keratitis – at his Moorfields clinic since 2010, up from 11 a year to about 80. Nationwide, the number of known cases has risen from around 100 to more than 200 a year, although Prof Dart believes that is just a fraction of the true number, as many people fail to seek treatment. Optometrist Dr Nigel Best, from Specsavers, said the real threat came from ordering lenses online from foreign-based websites, rather than UK-based firms which required a prescription. He explained: ‘Once the prescription expires, you cannot re-order online from a reputable UK website, so you have to go back for a test. ‘However, there are an awful lot of foreign websites [selling to UK customers] and these don’t require a prescription. Because they are based outside the UK, the General Optical Council is powerless to act.’ Art student Saira Hussain, 21, from Southend, Essex, developed the infection in her first year at university. ‘I used to do things that put you at risk like wearing throwaway daily contact lenses more than once and sleeping in them if I stayed over at a party. And I showered in them, but I didn’t know I was doing anything wrong,’ she said. ‘I developed a sore red eye and blurry vision and after a number of weeks ended up as an inpatient at Moorfields. My vision in one eye has been damaged. My other eye compensates, but it has been a shock.’ Other risky contact lens behaviour includes licking lenses to moisten them if they fall out, swimming in them, touching them with dirty hands, reusing solution, and even making a ‘DIY’ solution from tap water and salt.","People are buying lenses online to avoid having to pay for a prescription .

"The five-man Fulham search committee charged with identifying the club's next manager will hold its second meeting on Thursday. The panel, which includes former Cottagers captain Danny Murphy, will convene in London for talks to whittle down a long list of applicants to a shortlist of four or five. The front runners for the post are current caretaker boss Kit Symons, Chris Hughton, Steve Clarke and Gianfranco Zola. Former Fulham captain Danny Murphy is one of the five men on the panel to choose Fulham's next manager . American striker Brian McBride - who played for Fulham between 2004 and 2008 - is also on the panel . Former Sunderland chairman and striker is one of the members of the panel . Billy McKinlay, who left the Fulham coaching staff when Martin Jol was sacked last season, is the bookmakers' favourite to replace Felix Magath after being abruptly sacked as Watford boss, but it is not certain that he will even be named on the shortlist. Glenn Hoddle and Neil Lennon are among those who will also be considered. Murphy is joined on the committee by fellow former player Brian McBride, Fulham academy director Huw Jennings, senior Nike director and Fulham fan David Daly, and former Sunderland chairman and Republic of Ireland international Niall Quinn. Fulham caretaker manager Kit Symons is one of the leading contenders for the job along with Chris Hughton . They have had an initial meeting to establish the parameters of the search and will now discuss the credentials of those who have applied to be the new manager.

"Liverpool's year began in imperious style and they claimed 11 straight wins from February to April. Brendan Rodgers' side headed into May top of the pile and, although coming second in the Barclays Premier League denoted a fine season, the way the title was lost in April and May provided a bitter blow for the club and supporters. Luis Suarez departed for Barcelona in the summer and the club have floundered since, crashing out of the Champions League at the group stages and hobbling along at home. Sunni Upal reviews the year for Liverpool. Luis Suarez waves to the Anfield crowd following his final match for Liverpool after they finished second . JANUARY . January was all about bouncing back after two defeats in three days in late December by Manchester City and Chelsea saw Liverpool fall from first at Christmas to fifth by New Year. A 2-0 win over Hull at Anfield kicked off 2014 on the right note before the SAS (Suarez and Daniel Sturridge) put on a master-class in a 5-3 win at Stoke. Liverpool were fortunate to earn a point against Aston Villa at Anfield, fighting back from 2-0 down having been played off the park in the first half to draw 2-2. But the month ended perfectly with a 4-0 win over Everton in the Merseyside derby. Luis Suarez (left) and Daniel Sturridge (right) celebrate during Liverpool's 4-0 win over Everton at Anfield . FEBRUARY . Kolo Toure’s gaffe at The Hawthorns gifted West Brom a point and saw Liverpool fall eight points behind leaders Arsenal. But they responded by blowing the Gunners off the pitch with a 5-1 victory at Anfield. The opening 20 minutes was as good a football as Liverpool played all season. That victory proved to be the start of an 11-game winning streak that took the Reds to the brink of the Premier League title. A 3-2 win away at Fulham thanks to a late Steven Gerrard penalty and a 4-3 win over Swansea at Anfield made it 10 points from 12 in February. Kolo Toure (right) reacts after his mistake against West Brom cost Liverpool a win at the Hawthorns . Steven Gerrard (second right) celebrates after scoring a late penalty as Liverpool beat Fulham 3-2 . MARCH . March was the month that made Liverpool fans really believe it could be their year. Brendan Rodgers’ side notched up five straight league wins, starting the month with a 3-0 victory at Southampton. The 3-0 win at Old Trafford that followed will live long in the memory and it could have been an even wider margin of victory, such was Liverpool’s dominance. Suarez’s hat-trick then led the Reds to a 6-3 win at Cardiff, before a nervy evening at Anfield and a 2-1 win over Sunderland followed. A 4-0 drubbing of Tottenham moved Liverpool to the top of the table at the end of the month, setting up two huge clashes in April against Manchester City and Chelsea. Gerrard slots home one of his two penalties in the 3-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford . Brendan Rodgers (second right) congratulates his players as his team won five straight games in March . APRIL . Gerrard’s two penalties helped Liverpool overcome a tricky tie at Upton Park before the visit of Manchester City to Anfield. It proved to be a memorable afternoon, with Raheem Sterling and Martin Skrtel giving the Reds a 2-0 lead before David Silva and a Glen Johnson own-goal dragged them back. Philippe Coutinho struck the winner, though, in a 3-2 win as Liverpool took a huge step towards the title. A 3-2 win at Norwich followed, and then Chelsea came to Anfield in what looked like the last hurdle Liverpool needed to overcome. It proved to be the day the title was lost, with Gerrard’s costly slip letting in Demba Ba to score the opening goal in a 2-0 win for a weakened visiting team. Liverpool’s title destiny was out of their own hands. Philippe Coutinho jumps for joy after scoring Liverpool's winner against Manchester City .

Gerrard's (right) error contributed to Liverpool losing the Premier League title after a 2-0 loss to Chelsea . MAY . Liverpool’s title challenge ended on a frantic Monday night in south London. Manchester City were already in the driving seat in the title race, but Rodgers' men could’ve kept the pressure on by winning their last two games. They looked well on course at Selhurst Park in going 3-0 up against Crystal Palace only to crumble in the closing stages and let Palace in to draw the game 3-3. It was Liverpool's 'Crystanbul' moment and Suarez’s tears on the pitch were the image of the night. He knew his chance to win the Premier League had gone. A 2-1 win at Newcastle on the final day wasn’t enough to prevent Manchester City from being crowned champions. It was a season that promised so much and ultimately delivered very little. Liverpool came agonisingly close to ending their 24-year wait to win the title. Suarez (left) is consoled by Gerrard (right) after crying following Liverpool's 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace . Gerrard (second left) leads a subdued lap of honour after the game with Newcastle as Liverpool came second . JUNE . Arguably one of the most significant moments of Liverpool's year happened thousands of miles away in Brazil. Suarez, while playing for Uruguay at the World Cup, sank his teeth into Italy's Giorgio Chiellini and provoked a storm of criticism and ultimately led to a four-month ban. On the home front, Liverpool signed boyhood fan Rickie Lambert and his Southampton team-mate Adam Lallana, who cost £25m. Suarez holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini . JULY . It was almost inevitable that Suarez would leave Anfield following the World Cup bite and so it proved. The Uruguay star swapped Anfield for the Nou Camp and signed for Barcelona for £75m, leaving a massive hole in Liverpool's attack. At the other end of the pitch, the Reds bought Southampton's Croatia centre half Dejan Lovren for £20m. Suarez smiles as he signs for Barcelona in a deal worth £75m . AUGUST . A new season began and there was an optimistic feel around Anfield that Liverpool’s new look team could go one better than last season despite the sale of Suarez to Barcelona. A new SAS was forming in the shape of Sterling and Sturridge and both of them scored in a 2-1 opening day victory over Southampton. After a 3-1 loss at Manchester City, the month ended with Liverpool’s best performance of the season so far as they dismantled Tottenham at White Hart Lane in a 3-0 victory. They also signed a relatively unknown striker by the name of Mario Balotelli... Sturridge (right) celebrates scoring Liverpool's winner  in the season opener against Southampton . Raheem Sterling (centre) scores as Liverpool recorded an impressive 3-0 win at Tottenham in August . SEPTEMBER . News that Sturridge was injured while on England duty rocked Liverpool, and they started the month poorly by losing 1-0 to Aston Villa at Anfield. Balotelli then got his first goal for the club as Liverpool laboured past Ludogorets 2-1 in their Champions League return. Worryingly, though, the Reds were simply bullied out of a game as they lost 3-1 at West Ham, and Phil Jagielka’s stunning strike in injury time denied them a win in the Merseyside derby that ended 1-1. There was also a thrilling penalty shoot-out win over Middlesbrough that Liverpool won 14-13 in the Capital One Cup. Sturridge picked up an injury on England duty in September and has yet to play for Liverpool since . Mario Balotelli (third left) scored his first goal for Liverpool in the Champions League against Ludogorets . OCTOBER . The month started badly as Liverpool were beaten 1-0 in Basle, and their Champions League campaign was in dire straights when they lost again, 3-0 at Anfield against Real Madrid. In the Premier League,Lallana scored his first goal in a much-needed 2-1 win over West Brom and a crazy last few minutes saw Liverpool snatch a 3-2 win at Loftus Road. There was also a frustrating 0-0 draw with Hull at Anfield in which the Reds looked like they lacked ideas in how to break down stoke. One positive to end the month, though was a 2-1 win over Swansea in the Capital One Cup. Adam Lallana (left) scored his first Liverpool goal in October and the Reds won 3-2 at Queens Park Rangers . NOVEMBER . The first half of November saw Liverpool’s season hit rock bottom. They lost four games in a row in all competitions against Newcastle, Real Madrid, Chelsea and Crystal Palace. Rodgers decided to rest players at the Bernabeu in a move that was criticised while the collapse at Palace was almost as extraordinary than the one in May. A 2-2 draw in Bulgaria against Ludogorets set up a must-win Champions League tie against Basle in December, and the month at least ended well with a 1-0 win over Stoke thanks to Johnson’s late header. Rodgers (right) looks on as Liverpool lose against Palace, one of four straight defeats in November . DECEMBER . Liverpool’s Champions League fate was sealed in December as they failed to beat Basle at home. A 1-1 draw was not enough to progress to the knockout rounds as Rodgers’ side crashed out of the tournament. It was a devastating loss, and just as painful as losing 3-0 against Manchester United. But December has also been a month of many positives with a 3-1 win at Leicester, progress in the Capital One Cup after beating Bournemouth 3-1 in the quarter-finals and a Boxing Day win at Burnley. Skrtel’s header in the 97th minute earned Liverpool a 2-2 draw with Arsenal that kept their top four hopes alive going into 2015 and there was then the 1-0 win over Burnley. Liverpool need a winning streak in 2015 similar to the 11-game run of last season to push themselves into top-four contention. Liverpool captain Gerrard was a dejected man as Liverpool crashed out of the Champions League . And five days later, Liverpool were emphatically beaten 3-0 at Old Trafford by Manchester United .

"A one-cent postage stamp belonging to the late eccentric heir and famous murderer John du Pont has become the world's most valuable stamp - again. The 1856 British Guiana One-Cent Magenta sold on Tuesday at auction in New York for $9.5 million - although the stamp expected to bring between $10 million and $20 million. Still, the sale became the fourth time the stamp has broken the auction record for a single stamp in its long history. Sotheby's said the buyer wished to remain anonymous. The price included the buyer's premium. Scroll down for video . The one-cent 1856 British Guiana stamp is shown sold for $9.5 million on Tuesday at Sotheby's in New York . David Redden (L), Sotheby's Vice Chairman, and employees after the British Guiana One-Cent Magenta (R, on video screen), described as the most famous stamp in the world, sold for $9.5 million . Pictured here is the front (left) and reverse (right) side of the rare one-cent magenta coin . David Redden, Sotheby's vice chairman, called the sale 'a truly great moment for the world of stamp collecting.' 'That price will be hard to beat, and likely won't be exceeded unless the British Guiana comes up for sale again in the future,' Redden said. Measuring 1 inch-by-1 1/4 inches, it hasn't been on public view since 1986 and is the only major stamp absent from the British Royal Family's private Royal Philatelic Collection. 'You're not going to find anything rarer than this,' according to Allen Kane, director of the Smithsonian National Postal Museum. 'It's a stamp the world of collectors has been dying to see for a long time.' An 1855 Swedish stamp, which sold for $2.3 million in 1996, previously held the auction record for a single stamp. Owner: John E. du Pont, pictured in 1992, bought the stamp in 1980 and it was sold off after his death . Killed: Du Pont, left, was found to be mentally . ill when he shot dead Olympic wrestler David Schultz, left and right, at . his estate.

June 17, 2014 The stamp will be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York, where it is expected to fetch as much as $20 million . David Beech, longtime curator of stamps at the British Library who retired last year, has compared it to buying the 'Mona Lisa' of the world's most prized stamps. The last owner was John E. du Pont, an heir to the du Pont chemical fortune who was convicted of fatally shooting 1984 Olympic champion wrestler David Schultz at his Pennsylvania estate in 1996. The stamp was sold by his estate, which will designate part of the proceeds to the Eurasian Pacific Wildlife Conservation Foundation that du Pont championed. Printed in black on magenta paper, it bears the image of a three-masted ship and the colony's motto, in Latin: 'we give and expect in return.' It went into circulation after a shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the postmaster asked printers for the Royal Gazette newspaper in Georgetown in British Guiana to produce three stamps until the shipment arrived: a 1-cent magenta, a 4-cent magenta and a 4-cent blue. While multiple examples of the 4-cent stamps have survived, only the tiny 1-cent issue is known to exist today. Its first owner was a 12-year-old Scottish boy living in South America who added it to his collection after finding it among family papers in 1873. He soon sold it for a few shillings to a local collector, Neil McKinnon. McKinnon kept it for five years before selling it to a Liverpool dealer who recognized the unassuming stamp as highly uncommon. He paid 120 pounds for it and quickly resold it for 150 pounds to Count Philippe la Renotiere von Ferrary, one of the world's greatest stamp collectors. Upon his . death in 1917, the count bequeathed his stamp collection to the . Postmuseum in Berlin. The collection was later seized by France as war . reparations and sold off in a series of 14 auctions with the One-Cent . Magenta bringing $35,000 in 1922 - an auction record for a single stamp. A Sotheby's empoyee (L) talks on the phone to the winning bidder as the British Guiana One-Cent Magenta, described as the most famous stamp in the world, sold for $9.5 million .

After Hind's death in 1933, the stamp was to be auctioned with the rest of his collection until his wife brought a lawsuit, claiming it was left to her. The next owner was Frederick Small, an Australian engineer living in Florida who purchased it privately from Hind's widow for $45,000 in 1940. Thirty years later, he consigned the stamp to a New York auction where it was purchased by an investment consortium for $280,000 - another record.The stamp set its third record in 1980 when it sold for $935,000 to du Pont.","The 1856 British Guiana One-Cent Magenta sold on Tuesday for $9.5 million - although it was predicted to sell for as much as $20 million .

"A rare piece of artwork painted by Vincent van Gogh weeks before his death sold for $61.8 million Tuesday and a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti took in over $100 million at a sale kicking off New York City's fall art auctions of impressionist and modern art. Van Gogh's 1890 painting, 'Still Life, Vase With Daisies and Poppies,' had expected to fetch between $30 million and $50 million at Sotheby's evening sale in Manhattan. Van Gogh painted the bouquet of wildflowers at the French home of his physician, Dr. Paul Gachet, in 1890. It's one of the few works the Dutch artist sold during his lifetime. Expensive taste: Vincent van Gogh's 'Still Life, Vase With Daisies and Poppies' sold for $61.8million . It's mine! Wang Zhongjun, pictured, reportedly had the winning bid for the van Gogh painting . History: One of the founders of the Museum of Modern Art, A. Conger Goodyear (seen center),  acquired the van Gogh painting in 1928 . Whopping: Giacometti's 'Chariot' sculpture sold for $101million on Tuesday . The Wall Street Journal reported that Wang Zhongjun of Huayi Brothers Media Corp made the hefty purchase. One of the founders of the Museum of Modern Art, A. Conger Goodyear, acquired the van Gogh painting in 1928. It remained in the family for decades and was on permanent exhibition at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo for 30 years. The most recent owner bought it around 1990. The auction record for a van Gogh is $82.5 million. The big-ticket auction at Sotheby's brought in $101 million for Giacometti's 'Chariot.' The rare 1951 bronze sculpture features an elongated goddess-like figure perched atop a wheeled chariot. The price almost broke the $104.3 million record for the Swiss artist. Amazing: Amedeo Modigliani's 'Tete' fetched $70.7 million, just topping the previous auction record for the artist at $69 million . The 1951 piece, embellished with paint to enrich the textural quality of the bronze, has been in the same collection for over 40 years. Giacometti made six casts of the 'Chariot'during his lifetime. The one sold Tuesday is one of only two painted examples. Aleko Goulandris reportedly sold the sculpture after purchasing it in 1972, a source told The New York Post. Another important sculpture sold at the auction was Amedeo Modigliani's 'Tete.' It fetched $70.7 million, just topping the previous auction record for the artist at $69 million. The deitylike elongated head was carved in 1911 and 1912 from a block of limestone scavenged from a Paris construction site. It had a presale estimate of $45 million. The auction house Bonhams, which is selling more than 700 items from the homes of Lauren Bacall, offered two Henry Moore sculptures from her collection on Tuesday. 'Maquette for Mother and Child: Arms' sold for $281,000, just over its pre-sale estimate high of $200,000, and 'Working Model for Reclining Figure: Bone Skirt,' sold for over $1 million, topping its presale estimate of $600,000 to $800,000. The legendary actress' other artwork, jewelry and furniture will be offered for sale in March. All prices included the buyer's premium. The major fall sales continue Wednesday at Christie's. Among the highlights is a celebrated portrait of a Parisian actress by Edouard Manet. 'Spring' has a presale estimate of $25 million to $35 million.

"Earlier this season I picked Thierry Henry as my greatest-ever Premier League striker. One look at the tributes paid to him on Tuesday show plenty of people would agree. Thierry had it all. Pace, power, skill, intelligence — it was the perfect combination. But he backed up all that talent with trophies.

The club asked if I would let him have my No 14 shirt because Henry wanted it. I was after Steve Bould’s old No 5 so I agreed, although I’m sure people will remember him wearing 14 more than me! He is still the best athlete I’ve ever seen wear a pair of football boots and when he scored his first goal I said I’d be able to tell my grandchildren I had played with him. He gave me a puzzled look. After the career he had, maybe now he sees why.

"Ronny Deila’s vision of fast-paced goal gluts from his Celtic side seems light years away, rather than one threatening to put in an appearance at some stage of 2015. Four days shy of the turn of this year of change and during a time of transition for the Premiership champions, Ross County were able to dig in for a draw thanks to gutsy defending and Celtic’s shocking creative shortcomings. At least January 1 will open up the market for Deila to go shopping for inspiration. For that was sadly lacking in this dismal display that won’t bring the crowds back to Parkhead any time soon. Ross County's Scott Boyd (left) and Celtic's Leigh Griffiths tussle for possession during the first half . Griffifths lies dejected on the floor after a missed opportunity in the match that ended goalless at Celtic Park . Celtic: Gordon, Matthews, Ambrose, Van Dijk, Izaguirre, Biton, Brown, Stokes (McGregor 9), Griffiths, Johansen, Guidetti (Scepovic 67), McGregor (Commons 67). Subs Not Used: Zaluska, O'Connell, Henderson, Tierney. Booked: Izaguirre. Ross County: Reguero, Brittain, Saunders, Paul Quinn, Reckord, Dunfield (Ross 90), Woods, Kiss, Boyd, Gardyne (Toshney 38), Arquin (Jervis 90). Subs Not Used: Cardle, Maatsen, Brown. Booked: Saunders, Kiss, Reguero, Dunfield. Referee: Crawford Allan (Scotland). It’s a sorry state of affairs when the day’s positive for the grumbling Celtic support was points dropped at Perth by closest-pursuers Dundee United. Celtic extended their lead to five points thanks to St Johnstone’s victory — a gap sure to be targeted now by an Aberdeen outfit offered encouragement about mounting a challenge by this blunt effort. This was a County team that Celtic slammed five past in October at Dingwall at a canter, a fact that asks yet more questions of the signs of progress Deila claims to be witnessing during his working week. They have disappeared at the weekends, clearly, and on this form, the trip to Firhill on Thursday could be as tricky as a few of the old traditional Glasgow derbies staged on New Year’s Day. Jim McIntyre’s men, now without a victory in six, have never won at Celtic Park and only with one crack at goal from Filip Kiss with six minutes remaining did they flirt with the upset of the season. Even their joy at this superb result was diluted by dropping to the foot of the table on account of St Mirren’s victory, but this point could prove a precious one come May if they can start scoring wins against their bottom-six rivals. Virgil van Dijk (left) salutes the home fans as John Guidetti rues another golden opportunity to score . The stalemate was secured despite personnel problems. Jackson Irvine being ineligible to play against his parent club forced McIntyre into one of his four plotted changes. That soon became five when a back spasm felt by Graham Carey in the morning got no better from a combination of medication and a warm-up. His replacement, Michael Gardyne, lasted all of 38 minutes before hobbling off himself. Following a minute’s silence for the victims of the George Square bin lorry accident, Deila began the bid to tease more goals from his side by fielding three strikers. Leigh Griffiths was rewarded for his scoring cameo in defeat at Tannadice with a first Premiership start since August 23, alongside Anthony Stokes and misfiring John Guidetti. That three became a two when Stokes succumbed to an early calf problem and Callum McGregor was introduced after only nine minutes. Yet for the bulk of the contest, the on-loan Swede was up top on his own with the curiously ineffective Stefan Johansen his closest support act, while Griffiths remained a non-factor on the flank. Guidetti was clearly greedy to get back among the goals as he grabbed the chances to let fly from free-kicks. He ruffled the side-netting rather than the County keeper, who was drawn to make a save only once in the first half. It was a feisty affair with tempers flaring on both sides as referee Crawford Allan tried to keep the peace . The defensive banks brought south to keep Celtic out were solid in their deployment, such a contrast to that 5-0 thumping two months ago, and great credit to Paul Quinn, Scott Boyd and company for limiting Celtic opportunities. Even on the occasions Celtic succeeded in stringing together a menacing move, there was always a boot or, in the case of Kiss, a hand in the way to stall what momentum the home side had mustered. The battle for a point was then fuelled by injustice. Emilio Izaguirre was on a yellow card when committing a bookable offence as County broke with the tireless Yoann Arquin, and the visitors made their feelings known to referee Crawford Allan. Celtic were making hard work of it with 11 men, so quite how they would have constructed a swashbuckling attack with 10 is not something the home fans would’ve wished to consider during their half-time break. McGregor took early and ambitious aim at breaching County’s resilience, cleverly carving out space for a 25-yard drive that cannoned off the crossbar. Guidetti’s poor form stalked the follow-up as the Swede stumbled into the rebounding ball and missed the open goal with the keeper floored. Celtic fans hold up a banner during a minute's silence for the victims of the bin lorry crash in Glasgow . The Celtic players take part in the silence dedicated to those killed and injured by the out-of-control bin lorry . The toils of Celtic begged for significant change and there was no surprise when Guidetti made way for Stefan Scepovic. After netting 11 in 10, Guidetti is now without a goal in five. McGregor, meanwhile, was dealt the insult of being a substituted substitute as Kris Commons appeared in his place for what was meant to shape up as a late assault on Antonio Reguero’s goal. Yet they offered no signs of being an upgrade in creative or clinical terms and, a quarter of an hour later, the next chance of the game fell to the visitors. On the break, Kiss cracked a 20-yard drive off the base of the post with Craig Gordon at full stretch, to the relief of the Celtic support. The first scoreless league draw at Celtic Park since October 2011 was greeted by jeers — an understandable reaction from a dejected home crowd.","Celtic are still top of the Scottish Premiership after draw with Ross County .

"Alan Irvine was fighting for his job from day one. Supporters frustrated with a season of turmoil on and off the pitch were vocal in criticising the appointment of a man sacked from his two previous stints as manager, at Sheffield Wednesday and Preston North End. Irvine, renowned as an excellent football coach, will be bitterly disappointed he failed to last longer than 22 games in charge of West Bromwich Albion. But a record of five wins and 11 losses was viewed as unpalatable by chairman Jeremy Peace, whose instinct to pull the trigger decisively sees him about to embark on a fourth head coach in little more than a year. Alan Irvine can't hide his anguish after his side fell to another defeat at Stoke at the weekend . Steve Clarke was sacked on December 14, 2013, while Pepe Mel left the Hawthorns in May after Albion finished one place above the relegation zone. Stability seems a distant planet for this club right now. The revolving door is not just used by the employee charged with training the squad and picking the team – for that is the role of head coach in West Brom’s continental structure. Joleon Lescott (centre) said that Irvine always had the backing of the West Brom players . Forward Mame Biram Diouf scores the opening goal of Stoke City's win against West Bromwich Albion . The head-spinning extends to those on the pitch. A summer flurry like no other saw 10 players leave and 11 join. At times signings appeared slapdash. A significant number have failed to impress. Chief among them is record purchase Brown Ideye, who cost £10million but has scored only twice in all competitions and looked off the pace. Giorgos Samaras, Jason Davidson, Sebastian Blanco and Chris Baird have all made little impression, with the jury still out on Cristian Gamboa and Silverstre Varela. Club record signing Brown Ideye (centre) has been a major disappointment since joining in the summer . Irvine had a hand in all these moves to varying degrees but is not intimately involved on the recruitment side. Recently he admitted to not stepping foot in the recruitment room since the summer. The system Albion use on that front needs scrutiny. Technical director Terry Burton was appointed from Arsenal last summer tasked with bringing in a new head coach and overseeing transfers. But his previous role was not dedicated to that and he started at West Brom playing catch-up. That left the club behind others and they are paying the price now. Technical director Terry Burton (left) at Irvine's unveiling was brought in from Arsenal last summer . Sporting director Richard Garlick sorts contracts and finances. Everyone is answerable to Peace. Irvine was popular with players who respected his training methods – described as varied and interesting. But perhaps, to his cost, he was too nice – unable to provoke performances on matchdays. Even though Irvine would work his fingers to the bone – in contrast to Mel, for example – this eventuality was all too predictable. Peace grew increasingly concerned as results tailed off, with the current run at seven defeats in nine matches. Irvine could have been sent packing before the Aston Villa match but got a win courtesy of Craig Gardner’s late strike. Irvine acknowledges the crowd at his home debut back in August at the start of the season . At Irvine’s peak during the 4-0 win over Burnley supporters chanted his name, but it was all too fleeting. The viciousness of the abuse aimed his way after the 2-0 defeat at Stoke on Sunday was impossible to ride out, Peace determined. Peace must make his next appointment work. The turbulent nature of the Hawthorns dugout needs to cease. Tim Sherwood, who came very close to getting the job after Mel, is the frontrunner. Talks collapsed last summer over his wage demands and his desire to bring in staff of Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey. Those hurdles could be overcome this time. Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood is the favourite to replace Irvine at the Hawthorns . Sherwood would work within West Brom’s structure but provide a more outspoken voice to Irvine. It would be interesting to see how he functions in the role. Tony Pulis is another option and a surer bet in the Premier League. Although whether the former Stoke and Crystal Palace manager would agree to West Brom’s model remains to be seen. Assistant head coaches Rob Kelly and Keith Downing will take charge for the New Year’s Day clash at West Ham but their long term futures remain uncertain. Former Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis is looking for a new club and could head to the Hawthorns . Late on Monday night West Brom released a statement. Tellingly, a replacement is expected by the weekend. Irvine was praised by the club for his work to bring on Saido Berahino and Craig Dawson the imperative of staying in the top division was underlined too. Whoever comes next will understand that necessity.","West Brom have only won once in their last nine Premier League games .

The diamond will then parachute back down to earth in a giant orange parachute - and whoever finds it will be a cool £12,000 richer. This diamond worth £12,000 has today been shot into space, and whoever finds it gets to keep it . It will rise above the earth until the atmospheric pressure at the edge of space causes the balloon to pop . The diamond was launched just before 9am today from a field in Derbyshire and is expected to land back on earth around noon. A tracking device has been fitted to the diamond and the firm will be tweeting clues using #diamondinthesky for gem hunters to join in the race in the search for the gem when it lands. The potential 'drop zone', however, is estimated to cover a range of more than 60 miles - meaning it could be days before it is found unless it lands in the middle of a village, town or city. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and online retailer 77 Diamonds worked together to launch the jewel into space and are tracking its path. Chiefs at the website with the 'largest selection of natural diamonds in the world' hand-picked the diamond was for its 'brilliance and sparkle'.

"Geoff Pullar, the former England, Lancashire and Gloucestershire batsman, has died aged 79. The left-hander made his Test debut as an opener against India in 1959, scoring 75 at Headingley, and 131 at Old Trafford, the ground’s first Test century by a Lancastrian. Pullar became a fixture in the England side for four years, making four centuries and averaging more than 43 in 28 Tests. Geoff Pullar, who played 28 Tests for England, has died aged 79 . Pullar made his Test debut as an opener against India in 1959, scoring 75 at Headingley . Affectionately nicknamed ‘Noddy’ - he was known to sleep in the dressing room while team-mates were at the crease - Pullar did well against South Africa in the home series of 1960, following a solid winter tour of the West Indies where he played in all five Tests against a bowling attack including Wes Hall, Garfield Sobers and Charlie Griffith. He topped the batting averages on the 1961-62 tour to India and Pakistan in 1961-62 despite bagging a pair in the first Test in Pakistan. Pullar’s highest Test score was 175 against the South Africans at The Oval in 1960, when he put on 290 for the first wicket with Colin Cowdrey. When Pullar scored 131 at Old Trafford against India he was the ground’s first Lancastrian Test centurion . Pullar (left), the tall and strong left-hander, with the Lancashire team of 1962 . After the 1962-63 tour to Australia, during which he contracted pleurisy, Pullar lost his England place and never regained it. Joining Gloucestershire in 1969, he topped the county’s batting averages in his first season but arthritis forced his retirement in 1970. Pullar was the Cricket Writers’ Association 1959 Young Cricketer of the Year and in 1960 he was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.

"Life as the Australia captain continues to treat Steve Smith well as he shone on day one of the third Test with India in Melbourne. Smith ended the opening day of the famous Boxing Day Test at the MCG unbeaten on 72 as the Baggy Green just about shaded honours on 259 for five. Captain Smith made sure any advantage was a home one, digging in at the end to continue his fine form so far against the touring Indians.

Smith ended the opening day of the famous Boxing Day Test at the MCG unbeaten on 72 not out . Australia ended day one of the third Test in Melbourne on 259 for five against the touring Indians . He made 162 in the first Test in Adelaide and then, replacing the injured Michael Clarke in charge for the second, he scored 133 in Brisbane as Australia went 2-0 up in the series. A third ton in a row looks a good bet here, with the experienced Brad Haddin alongside him on 23 at the close. Their gritty stand of 43 was needed, with India rewarded for some good discipline with the ball prior to that. Umesh Yadav made a breakthrough just 12 balls in, opening the face of David Warner's bat and removing him at third slip for a duck. Fans in Melbourne watch as Australia got on their way to leading 259 for five by the end of day one . That threw Chris Rogers and Shane Watson together and the pair both made half-centuries in a stand of 115.

"Brendon McCullum lit up the new-look Hagley Oval with a stunning 195 as New Zealand bossed day one of their first Test with Sri Lanka. The Black Caps captain made sure the first day day of international cricket at the redeveloped Hagley would be remembered as he raced to his score off 134 balls as part of a team total of 429 for seven. There were many highlights, but perhaps his stand of 153 for the fifth wicket with Jimmy Neesham was the best, the pair scoring at 7.84 an over while together. Brendon McCullum hit a superb 195 off just 134 balls to propel his New Zealand side to 429-7 on day one . McCullum was at his aggressive best, smashing the bowlers to all parts as the Black Caps took control . Neesham would make 85 from 80 and Kane Williamson a more considered 54 from 98 as Sri Lanka toiled. They had looked on song at one point, though, reducing the hosts to 60 for two and 80 for three, but after that it went downhill. There were some teething problems for the venue, with both opening bowlers losing their footing, but they were quickly amended. Hamish Rutherford went first for 18, cleaned up by Suranga Lakmal, with Tom Latham then holing out to point for 27. The New Zealand captain reached his century off just 74 balls, the fastest in a Test by a Kiwi . Sri Lanka had the early edge when Hamish Rutherford's off stump was expertly removed by Suranga Lakmal . Shaminda Eranga appeals for a decision as Sri Lanka looked to get on top during the first session . Ross Taylor followed for seven, run out attempting a quick single, but that brought McCullum to the crease and he set about causing chaos. Williamson made a watchful 54 in his company before he was bowled by Dhammika Prasad, but by this point all eyes were on McCullum. Treating the occasion like a Twenty20 game, he broke his own 78-ball New Zealand record for a fastest century in Tests by four balls and continued to swing from the hips. Coming in with his side in a spot of bother at 88-3 McCullum took back the momentum with a blistering knock . The New Zealand captain salutes the crowd after finally being dismissed five runs short of a double century . Neesham did the same at the other end, with the pair both shelled by Kumar Sangakkara. McCullum was on course for the quickest double hundred in Tests - having gone to 200 in his last outing too - when he holed out to long off when facing Thaurinda Kaushal, with his stand including 18 fours and 11 sixes. BJ Watling came out and added 26 before going to Angelo Mathews, with Neesham then removed by the visiting captain for 85, with Sangakkara finally taking one.","New Zealand close day on 429-7 after dominating day one of Test Match .

"Adrian Lewis began his quest for a third world title with a comfortable win over David Pallett in just 23 minutes Alexandra Palace on Tuesday. The 2011 and 2012 champion brushed his opponent aside in three sets and recorded a three-dart average of 101.9, the highest of the tournament so far.

He said: 'I wanted to send out a warning shot to the rest of the field tonight and I think I did that. 'After that first set when I come off the stage and saw I was on 126 average I fancied having a go at the record, but I missed a few doubles in the second set and it slipped away. 'No tournament really gives me a buzz like this one does, I've put a lot of work in over the last few weeks and I'll be practising more over Christmas as well because this is the one I want to win.' Tuesday was the final day of first-round action at Ally Pally before the three-day Christmas break, and there was another upset as German teenager Max Hopp beat Mervyn King.

Hopp prevailed in a final set tie-break, and he admitted: 'I didn't expect to win the match.' The German continued: 'He's a brilliant player in the tournament but I just had a little feeling that I could do well. And when I had that 161 I just had a feeling it was going to go in, so I thought just go for it and when I did it was just amazing, I don't really have words for it.

"Ronny Deila has revealed moves are afoot to ensure Jason Denayer extends his stay in Glasgow by another season. The 19-year-old Belgian central defender is in the middle of a year-long loan from Manchester City and it was widely expected he would return to the English champions in the summer to fight for a first-team place. Celtic defender Jason Denayer is in the middle of a year-long loan from Manchester City . The player’s recovery pace caught the eye in a Celtic jersey before he was sidelined recently through injury. Deila, though, feels the exposure to first-team football has developed other aspects of his game and that, rather than returning to be a squad player at City, he’d be better served staying in Glasgow for another term. ‘I hope to do that,’ Deila confirmed. ‘He is in good development here. He hasn’t played a lot of matches at the top level and when you are in good flow you should keep doing it to go to the next stage. Celtic manager Ronny Deila wants to extend Denayer's stay in Scotland . ‘When he is ready for that he will go on but it’s also important for us to have consistency going into next season as well.’ Deila has strong links with City following a study week spent there while manager of Stromsgodset. That relationship helped facilitate a loan deal for John Guidetti and now he hopes City manager Manuel Pellegrini will see the merits of allowing another of his emerging talents to further develop north of the border. ‘I have a good feeling,’ Deila said. ‘City are co-operating very well with us, I’ve done that with them for many years and this has been a happy relationship so far. ‘We really want to do that in the future as well. I have contacts at City, so there is good communication with them.’ Celtic previously tied up goalkeeper Fraser Forster on back-to-back one year loan deals from Newcastle United before signing him on a permanent contract.","Jason Denayer is in the middle of a year-long loan from Manchester City .

"Gareth Barry became a Premier League record-breaker during Everton's 1-0 defeat by Stoke City at Goodison Park on Boxing Day. The 33-year-old midfielder picked up the 100th yellow card of his 17-year, and counting, career in the top flight of English football - more bookings than any other player in Premier League history. As Barry lunged into a challenge with Steven Nzonzi, referee Lee Mason reached for his pocket to award the former England international his sixth league caution of the season sending him to the top of the all-time Premier League bookings' list, but which serial offenders make up the top-ten? Gareth Barry received the 100th yellow card of his Premier League career against Stoke on Boxing Day . Everton midfielder Barry picked up the caution for a foul on Stoke's Steven Nzonzi during a 1-0 defeat . 10. Philip Neville (82 bookings) Former Manchester United and Everton defender Neville was hardly an angel during his 18-year stint in the Premier League, and he received 82 bookings before retiring. In 2006, Neville finished the season with the most yellow cards out of any player in the league - 12. Three years earlier, the now-BBC pundit was United's most-booked player despite starting just six games. In contrast his brother, Gary, received three yellows to his seven that season. Phil Neville receives a card - as he did 82 times in the Premier League with Everton and Manchester United . =8. Wayne Rooney (83 bookings) Rooney is no stranger to ill discipline. The Manchester United and England captain kindly reminded us of that against West Ham earlier this season, although his hack on Stewart Downing warranted a straight red from Lee Mason. It was reminiscent of Rooney's sending off in the 2006 World Cup against Portugal for a stamp on Ricardo Carvalho - yet more evidence of repercussions for the 28-year-old's hot-headed decisions. Eighty-three bookings in the Premier League means Rooney sits joint eighth in the table, for now. Wayne Rooney commits a professional foul on West Ham's Stewart Downing during the Premier League tie . Manchester United's Wayne Rooney's foul, however, warranted more than a yellow as the captain saw red . Wayne Rooney couldn't believe he didn't just get a caution for the hack on Downing earlier this season . =8. Kevin Nolan (83 bookings) West Ham's midfielder Nolan is never one to shy away from a challenge, and it shows. The former Bolton and Newcastle  midfielder is currently level with Rooney on 83 yellow cards - but the duo are the only two players on the list - other than Barry - still playing in the top flight, so expect some movement. Surprisingly, Nolan is yet to be booked in 14 league appearances this season. Last campaign, though, he registered as many cautions as he did goals - seven. Newcastle's Kevin Nolan makes a nasty challenge on Everton's Victor Anichebe in 2009 at St James' Park . Kevin Nolan receives a red card on this occasion and the West Ham midfielder knows how to get a yellow . 7. George Boateng (85 bookings) In Boateng's 13 years in the Premier League, the midfielder received 85 yellow cards. Coventry City, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and Hull City were his clubs between 1997 and 2010, and Boateng  kept his yellow card count up  throughout. It was in that final year he received a second booking for a dangerous challenge on Bacary Sagna after poking Nicklas Bendtner in the eye. Ten in 1998, and nine apiece in the following two years. Boateng was nothing if not consistent. Geroge Boateng pokes Arsenal's Nicklas Bendtner in the eye during their Premier League match in 2010 . 6. Robbie Savage (89 bookings) For a while, Savage held the illustrious position at the top of this most-booked players table. He has since, though, lost his 'dirtiest player in Premier League history' crown and been overtaken. Savage was, by no means, a stranger to a telling off from a referee. Take the 2003-04 season, for example. The midfielder received 13 yellow cards that year at Birmingham alone. Two years later, he was cautioned 11 times for Blackburn. That makes the ex-Derby and Leicester player sixth in our list with a total of 89. Robbie Savage took his yellow card exploits to the Championship with Derby County as shown in 2011 . Robbie Savage received 89 bookings during his time in the Premier League with Blackburn and more . 5. Scott Parker (92 bookings) Parker no longer adds to his Premier League tally of 92 as the Fulham midfielder competes in the Championship. Nevertheless, the 33-year-old remains comfortably fifth. It seems Newcastle brought the aggressive nature out of Parker. The England international was booked nine times in each of his two seasons at St James' Park between 2005 and 2007. That said, Parker bested that in 2002-03 with Charlton, adding 10 to his still-young tally at the time. Scott Parker receives a yellow card and the former Tottenham midfielder got 92 in the Premier League in total . Scott Parker pleads with the referee to not give him a booking as he plays for Tottenham Hotspur in 2012 . 4. Paul Scholes (97 bookings) The former Manchester United midfielder was not unfamiliar with seeing a referee reach for his pocket. Arguably his most famous yellow card did not arrive in the Premier League, though. It came in the semi final of the Champions League. Scholes was cautioned against Juventus, ruling him out of their win in the 1999 final against Bayern Munich  at the Nou Camp. That rule has since been changed after UEFA announced they will no longer hold suspensions that carry to such European finals. Too little, too late for Scholes, though. Paul Scholes receives a caution during Manchester United's 1999 Champions League tie with Juventus . Paul Scholes receives a yellow card as he plays for Manchester United during the Champions League in 2007 . =2. Kevin Davies (99 bookings) Davies, now a striker for League One club Preston, stayed true to his yellow card nature internationally. The former Blackburn, Southampton and Bolton goalscorer made his England debut in 2010 as a substitute for Peter Crouch, and was immediately booked. His place near the top of the list is hardly surprising, given Davies has committed the most fouls in Premier League history, too. Former Blackburn and Bolton striker Kevin Davies receives a yellow card during his time for England . =2. Lee Bowyer (99 bookings) Bowyer, on the other hand, was far more of a traditional scrapper. Squaring up with fellow players - and on the odd occasion his own Newcastle teammate Kieron Dyer - became a regular occurrence. The ex-Leeds, West Ham, Newcastle and Birmingham midfielder first season in the Premier League in 1996 saw the aggressive player pick up seven bookings, his last in 2011 finished the same. Davies and Bowyer will now have to settle for second place on the list after Barry laid sole claim to the title of most Premier League yellow cards. Lee Bowyer grabs a handful of Liam Miller and vice versa during their Premier League match in 2007 . Lee Bowyer scraps with Kieron Dyer, both Newcastle players, as Gareth Barry (left) pulls him away . 1. Gareth Barry (100 bookings) With his booking against Stoke, Barry has moved out on his own and the former Manchester City man is likely to extend his lead at the top of the standings as he continues to play a key role in Everton's midfield. In Barry's defence, the 33-year-old sits fifth in the Premier League's all-time appearances list, too, having played more than 500 games for Aston Villa, Manchester City and Everton combined.

"Maybe come the season’s end, Brendan Rodgers will look back to Boxing Day and realise that was when Liverpool’s fortunes finally turned. This was a day that had all the elements to give Rodgers nightmares: freezing cold conditions, incessant, squally rain, a home side high on energy and endeavour and Liverpool bedecked in that dreadful yellow kit, the one they always seem to lose in. They might have lost wearing it again at Turf Moor. For sizeable parts of this collision with Burnley, Liverpool were second best and had they gone in at half-time two goals down, Rodgers could have had no complaints. He has, after all, seen his team capsize in similar conditions. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Burnley 0-1 Liverpool . Raheem Sterling (right) scored a second-half winner as Liverpool earned a hard-fought victory over Burnley at Turf Moor . Sterling rounded goalkeeper Tom Heaton before slotting into the back of the net in the 62nd minute at Turf Moor . Here, though, they weathered the storm and thanks to the dancing feet of Raheem Sterling, they headed back down the M6 with three points and, crucially, their momentum building; defeat in East Lancashire may have killed their Champions League ambitions but, for now, they can keep believing. Improvement, undoubtedly, is required for them to reach the top four next May but sometimes a team needs an afternoon like this to send them in the right direction. After drawing with Arsenal, Liverpool had to follow up by beating Burnley. Somehow they did. Bold words are all well and good but they need to have substance to be taken seriously, so having insisted Liverpool were “absolutely” capable of reaching the top four following their 2-2 draw with Arsenal, Rodgers required a similarly robust performance. For much of the first 45 minutes, he would have been tempted to watch the action unfold with hands clasped over his face. Liverpool were wretched, only posing a sporadic threat on the break, as Burnley scuffled and scurried and knocked them out of their stride. Nobody was busier than the impressive Danny Ings and he almost opened the scoring in the 14th minute when Liverpool’s defence froze and, with Brad Jones rooted to his spot, he thrashed a right-footed drive that thudded against the post before rebounding to safety. That proved to be Jones’ last involvement as he was substituted immediately – Rodgers would later reveal he damaged his thigh – replaced by Simon Mignolet. What became immediately apparent, was the break from the team had not done anything for Mignolet’s confidence as in the first five minutes he was on the pitch, he flapped at two crosses and had one clearance charged down by Ings. Sterling kept his composure with two Burnley defenders rushing back and picked his spot at the near post to give Liverpool the lead . The goal on the hour mark was Sterling's third in his last three appearances while playing as a striker . Burnley: Heaton, Trippier, Keane, Shackell, Mee (Jutkiewicz 90), Boyd, Marney, Jones (Wallace 83), Arfield, Ings, Barnes (Vokes 80). Subs not used: Kightly, Reid, Gilks, Long. Liverpool: Brad Jones (Mignolet 16), Toure (Can 46), Skrtel, Sakho, Henderson, Gerrard, Lucas, Markovic, Coutinho (Lambert 73), Sterling, Lallana. Subs not used: Moreno, Manquillo, Balotelli, Ojo. Goals: Sterling 62. Booked: Lucas. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire). Captain Steven Gerrard covered a lot of ground in the midfield for Liverpool as his head map (above) shows - CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE . Burnley’s supporters preyed on his vulnerability, taunting him as he prepared to take goal kicks, and it was hard not to feel some sympathy for the Belgian; he resembled a golfer with a severe case of the ‘yips’, every kick resembling a skewwhiff drive being sliced out of bounds. Sensing a chance to take advantage, Burnley upped the tempo. Their work was relentless and intense, it unsettled Liverpool and enabled them to start creating chances. With better fortune and sharper finishing, they would have sewn matters up before the interval. Ings went close with a header after one quick break; Mignolet was grateful to Lucas Leiva when the Brazilian diverted a shot from Scott Arlfield around the post; George Boyd thrashed another right-footed drive just over the bar. Play like this from January to May and they will stay up. Other a one tame shot from Adam Lallana, which Tom Heaton comfortably dealt with, Liverpool offered nothing and it was with good reason there was a collective sigh of relief when half-time was called. Against different opposition, they would not have been so fortunate. Belgian goalkeeper Simon Mignolet made a return to the Liverpool team as he replaced the injured Brad Jones . Australian goalkeeper Brad Jones looked dejected after being forced off with an apparent thigh injury at Turf Moor . Rodgers marched back to the sanctuary of Liverpool’s dressing room with much to consider and he sent his players out for the second period early, having made another adjustment with Emre Can replacing Kolo Toure, who had suffered most at the hands of Ings. That meant Liverpool had only two natural defenders but the brave call soon began to pay dividends; Can, usually a midfielder, gave Liverpool more assurance and he used possession more competently than Toure. The more they kept the ball, the more they frustrated Burnley. Soon the change in momentum became obvious. Burnley’s supporters, having been so loud, began to lose voice and in the 63rd minute, they saw their team drop their guard and, in the blink of an eye, they had been undone by a classic sucker-punch. There did not seem to be any danger when Lucas jumped for a ball inside his own half but the Brazilian’s header found Philippe Coutinho, who in turn ushered Sterling forward with a perfectly weighted lofted pass. Liverpool's defence struggled to deal with Burnley in the first half and they couldn't put together any meaningful attacks either .

Sterling did not need a second invitation to streak away and as Heaton sped out to try and divert the danger, the England winger jinked around his challenge before rolling the ball into the net in front of the David Fishwick Stand, which housed Liverpool’s supporters. Such was Rodgers’ relief, he repeatedly pointed at Sterling, seemingly praising and thanking him in equal measure. Coming so soon after Martin Skrtel’s point-saving header on Sunday, this was another big goal for Liverpool and, perhaps, further evidence that they can get to where they want to be . ‘We had to show a different side to us, different types of qualities to what we showed against Arsenal and Bournemouth,’ said Rodgers. ‘the home crowd gotbehind the team, a team that is always in the game. Burnley don’t concede too many, so my players deserved huge credit.’ For the plaudits to continue, the results must keep coming and Swansea are up next on Monday. There is no margin for error but keep winning like this and Rodgers will not be complaining.

"Graham Kavanagh has revealed a text message from Roy Keane made him see the errors of his ways and he is determined to learn from his mistakes as a result. The former Stoke, Wigan and Sunderland midfielder was sacked as Carlisle boss on September 1 after a poor start to the new season, following on from relegation to League Two. Kavanagh was appointed on a full-time basis in September 2013 after taking over as caretaker manager following the sacking of Gregg Abbott. VIDEO Scroll down for video of Paul Lambert admitting Roy Keane did visit Tom Cleverley . Graham Kavanagh took over from Gregg Abbott at Carlisle, but lasted less than one year . Kavanagh finished his playing days at Carlisle before taking on a role as player coach . Roy Keane in his days as Sunderland manager, and it was his text message that got Kavanagh thinking . However, the board were unhappy with the progress the team were making and the Irishman was relieved of his duties. And after several months to consider what went wrong, the 41-year-old has admitted it took a message from his fellow countryman Keane to help him evaluate his management style. ""There was one (a message) from Roy Keane,"" Kavanagh told the Irish Mail on Sunday. ‘Welcome to the club.’ it said. ‘You’re not a real manager until you’ve been sacked. 'Was he right? Yes. In the process of being sacked, when you are sacked, and immediately afterwards, you don’t see it coming. Kavanagh in happier times at Carlisle, but he couldn't turn the club's fortunes around . The former Republic of Ireland international represented his country 16 times, scoring once . ‘You are still so wrapped up in the intensity of getting the job right, of making the players better and getting results, and dealing with the finances that you don’t have time to sit back from it. ‘In the time of reflection after being sacked, you can look back and assess how you could improve, what you can do better. The fact is when you’re winning you don’t analyse things, when you’re losing you look at everything.’ Another mistake Kavanagh discussed is forgetting the perils of managing in the modern era, with news more accessible thanks to social media. Kavanagh went to tell his players of his sacking, and was asked to remind them not to post anything on social media sites. The club would handle the announcement. ‘I told them I accepted full responsibility and in some ways I’d let them down,’ Kavanagh added. ‘But I did say a few of them had to look themselves in the mirror and look where the club is now. ‘Greg Abbott had gone and they’d had the chance to put that right. There were a few home truths but it needed to be said. I shook their hands, wished them all the best and walked out. ‘And as I walked out the door, I thought ‘**** forgot about the social media thing.’ So I’d walked four steps, literally four steps, turned round, went back in the dressing room, and almost every one of them was on his phone. ‘I just said ‘ah come on lads’ but it was too late.’ And yet he misses it. Wants more of it. He’s learned from it. He doesn’t despair of the Twitterers. He wants to help them and make them better players in his team. ‘There are elements of me I have to change,’ Kavanagh added . ‘I have to learn to turn a blind eye to stuff like that and manage it differently. But it’s not easy. No badges prepares you for these things.’","Kavanagh was relieved of his duties at Carlisle on September 1 .

Golden Years takes to the skies this week, as Sportsmail's weekly nostalgic picture series brings you a spectacular set of aerial images. From the magic of the old Wembley in the 1920s, through to the newly rebuilt Maracana, we take you on a journey around some of the game's hallowed homes. There's the old Highbury and Manchester City's Maine Road, a television cameraman at Filbert Street and Hackney Marshes playing fields in east London in the Sixties. If these pictures bring back any memories for you, please feel free to share them in the comments section beneath this article. And we'll return with more photographs from football's archives next week. We begin with an aerial view of Wembley here in 1928, as the teams line up for a Home International between England and Scotland. It was to prove a joyous day for the visiting team, with Alex Jackson scoring a hat-trick in a 5-1 Scottish win at the five-year-old stadium . The Centenario in Montevideo plays host to the very first World Cup final in 1930 between Uruguay and Argentina. The hosts claimed a 4-2 win in front of a crowd of 68,346. Only 13 teams - including seven from South America and four from Europe - took part in that tournament . An aerial picture of Manchester City's famous old Maine Road home, for a visit of Sheffield Wednesday in 1934. City played at the ground for 80 years, between 1923 and 2003.

A view from above here of some of the 51,000 fans attending Arsenal's first match of the 1956-57 season at Highbury, a game against Cardiff that ended in a 0-0 draw. This picture tells us as much about a street scene in 1950s London as it does about a football stadium . A fabulous picture here of the first match to be played at Wembley under floodlights, an Inter Cities Fairs Cup clash between London and Frankfurt in October, 1955. The lights were installed at a cost of £22,000. Surprisingly, it wasn't until November 1963 that England played their first full match under the lights, when they beat Northern Ireland 8-3 .

'The problem we have is that some people have tunnel vision. They still want to paint us as just wanting to kick people. 'But we're a good team that passes the ball.

"Mark Hughes is mindful that Bojan runs the risk of burnout over the festive period but insists the Spaniard won’t receive any special treatment this month. The 24-year-old, billed as world football’s next superstar while a teenager at Barcelona, has never had to deal with England’s festive football, given clubs on the continent enjoy a winter break. Bojan, whose side injury sustained during Saturday’s draw isn’t a worry, has become the focal point of a Potters side. Hughes admitted having spoken about giving the playmaker a rest in the coming weeks but wants him starting as much as possible. Stoke boss Mark Hughes says he will keep playing in-form striker Bojan over the busy Christmas period . The young Spanish star was taken off by Hughes after 55 minutes against Crystal Palace on Saturday . James McArthur scored his first Premier League goal since netting for Wigan in a 3-2 win at West Brom in May 2013. ‘He’s really enjoying his football and playing week in, week out,’ the Stoke boss said. ‘If we can ride that wave to a certain extent, he’s happy with what he’s doing and how he’s playing. I think we just go with it. ‘We’ll see how it goes and we’re mindful of the fact that it you’ve not been through it before it can be a hard period for players.’ Stoke were poor at Selhurst Park and Hughes reasoned that they missed Bojan’s presence after he departed just after the break. Goalscorer Peter Crouch is thriving alongside him, adding: ‘He can create a bit of magic and in these games that’s what you need, someone to unlock it.’ Neil Warnock knows he needs ‘two or three’ new signings in January but is upset at the lack of urgency of some players, including striker Dwight Gayle. ‘He hasn’t pushed himself into pole position in training,’ the manager said. ‘I was disappointed when he came on. He’s not really knocked my door down in training.’ Stoke goalscorer at Selhurst Park Peter Crouch says Bojan can 'create a bit of magic' Neil Warnock criticised Dwight Gayle's minimal impact after coming off the bench on Saturday .","Mark Hughes mindful Bojan runs the risk of burnout in first season .

"Tottenham and Manchester United fought out a post-Christmas stalemate as Hugo Lloris starred for the hosts in goal while Radamel Falcao struggled to show his predatory best up front. United boss Louis van Gaal considered the result the loss of two points while Spurs' Mauricio Pochettino will feel fortunate to have salvaged a point from the scoreless draw. Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai was at White Hart Lane and assessed all of the players' performances. Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris made the difference with saves such as this from Robin van Persie . TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR (4-2-3-1): . Hugo Lloris – Saved by Chiriches in first half but solid, as always. A number of fine saves, the best of which was his acrobatic swipe at a Young shot. Never faltered on the routine stops. Made the difference. 8 . Vlad Chiriches – Superb last-ditch clearance off the line in first half after Mata free-kick came back off the post, but struggled to contain Young. 6 . Fearless star man Lloris made a number of fine saves and was faultless on routine stops . Federico Fazio – Still capable of passing to no-one when under little pressure, but managed a number of decent challenges. 6 . Jan Vertonghen – Not helped by Pochettino’s high defensive line and part of a unit that failed to win enough balls into the box. 6 . Ben Davies – Had an easier afternoon than Chiriches and dealt comfortably with Valencia. Solid but rarely allowed to utilise his ability to get forward. 6 . Ben Davies was solid for Spurs at left back but was rarely able to impose himself going forward . Benjamin Stambouli - Booked for first-half foul on Carrick and kicked out at Jones after the break. Along with Mason, never got hold of midfield. 5.5 . Ryan Mason – Good in the tackle, but too wasteful in possession. When he was teed up by a lovely Kane pass in second half, he was way off target. 5.5 . Andros Townsend – Impressive start and made a good chance for Kane, but faded badly. Needed to offer Chiriches more help in dealing with Young. Booked for fouling Young. 6 . Andros Townsend started impressively and made a chance for Harry Kane but faded badly at the end . Christian Eriksen – Barely noticed he was on the pitch until late free-kick that at least got De Gea moving. Improved in second half but needed to look for ball more. 5.5 . Nacer Chadli – Replaced by Lamela after an ineffective performance. Had scope to target a suspect defence but lacked service and made little use of ball when it did come. 5 . Harry Kane – One reasonable first-half chance from a Townsend pass that he failed to connect with properly, but played a superb ball for Mason late on which could have settled it. 6 . A rare day for Harry Kane in that it came without a goal and almost won it for Spurs with an assist . Substitutes: Lamela for Chadli (78), Dembele for Townsend (79) Subs not used: Walker, Paulinho, Soldado, Vorm, Dier . Manager: Mauricio Pochettino - His side improved, but odd to see him do so little when United were dominating the first half. His defence and its high line looked at times like an accident waiting to happen. 6 . MANCHESTER UNITED (3-4-1-2): . David De Gea – Sharp but generally untested. Saved from Townsend in first half and also kept out Eriksen’s late free-kick. 6 . Keeper David de Gea makes what is eventually a routine save in a match where he was rarely tested . Phil Jones – Not much to do at the back and had a goal ruled out at the other end. Fine challenge to deny Fazio in second half. 6.5 . Paddy McNair – Not convincing in possession and played himself into trouble in first half. Silly booking for body-checking Kane and replaced by Luke Shaw. 5 . Jonny Evans – Targeted early on by Townsend but held his own well. Replaced by Smalling. 6 . United defender Phil Jones (right) made a fine second-half challenge on Fazio (left) in the second half . Antonio Valencia – Quiet first half and replaced by Rafael Da Silva at half-time. Never tested Davies. 5.5 . Michael Carrick – Lofted an utterly magnificent pass into Van Persie path at the end of the first half. Always composed and always looking for runs. 7.5 . Wayne Rooney – Excelled in his deep role in first half, having plenty of possession and a great source of tempo for United. But fluffed a first-half header and struggled to get in game in second half. Lucky not to conceded penalty for grappling Kane in the box. 6.5 . Wayne Rooney excelled in his deep role but fluffed his lines when he had good opportunities in attack . Ashley Young – His revival continues. Thrived in the space created by Tottenham’ s high defensive line and forced a stunning first-half save from Lloris. Some good work defensively, as well. Booked for tripping Chadli. 7 . Juan Mata – Stunning free-kick deflected off wall onto post in first half and showed his usual excellent range of passing. 7.5 . Radamel Falcao – Disappointing. Frequently lost possession because of poor touches and sent a weak shot straight at Lloris in first hald. For such a renowned predator, he never looked dangerous. Booked. 4 . For such a renowned predator, Radamel Falcao never looked dangerous up front for United . Robin van Persie – Nearly scored a Bergkamp-esque goal in first half after bringing down Carrick pass on his toe but failed to get a shot off. Also ballooned a volley over early in second half. 5 . Substitutes: Da Silva for Valencia (45). Booked. Shaw for McNair (76) Smalling for Evans (72) Subs not used: Lindegaard, Fletcher, Pereira, Wilson. Manager: Louis van Gaal - Curiously, the Dutchman only introduced defenders from the bench, perhaps because his side was tiring so noticeably in the second half. 6.5 .","Hugo Lloris made a series of fantastic saves for Spurs in scoreless draw .

"Ashley Williams has warned Swansea they will continue to drop points unless they find a way to take the strain off Wilfried Bony. Bony has been their standout player this season, netting eight times after a stunning 25-goal debut season. No other Swansea player has scored more than three Premier League goals and Williams admitted there is a concern that not enough players beside the Ivorian are taking their chances. VIDEO Scroll down to see Wilfried Bony in goal scoring action for Vitesse . Wilfried Bony (left) celebrates after scoring against Tottenham at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday . Asked if it was a worry, Williams said: 'It is. We need to chip in with more goals as a team. We need to find goals from other places on the pitch.' It's been a peculiar season for Swansea. They have been comfortably within the top 10 until now but have coughed 16 points from winning positions. They never led in the 2-1 defeat against Tottenham on Sunday but wasted numerous chances, with Williams believing they need to be more clinical in front of goal. Bony cancelled out Harry Kane's fourth minute opener buy a late Christian Eriksen goal secured the win . He said: 'All of us, Wilf included, get a lot of chances and if we go 2-0 up I a sure that we can win the game. We have got this record from losing from winning positions, but I’m pretty sure that all of them have been one goal and there have been games where we’ve had a lot of chances after we scored the first goal. 'It’s pretty simple really - we need to convert the chances but I don’t know how we do that, how we change that, it is what it is. I just think the chances we get, the positions we find ourselves in, we have to take them. 'I don’t think we have scored from a set pieces ourselves. We have got a lot of height in team and we all have to do better. When you say we have to take our chances you do look at the guys up front as that’s what they do, but as a team we need to share the goals around.'

"Chelsea striker Fernando Torres is closing in on a return to Atletico Madrid, according to the Spanish club's assistant coach German Burgos. Torres, 30, joined AC Milan on a two-year loan deal in August but the Spain forward yet to rediscover his best form, scoring just once in 10 Serie A appearances. 'It (the Torres deal) is on the verge of completion and we are waiting for things to firm up,' Burgos was quoted as saying in the Spanish media. Fernando Torres is set to swap AC Milan for his first club Atletico Madrid as he bids to find form once again . Spain striker Torres, 30, who is on loan from Chelsea, has scored once in 10 appearances for Milan . 'He will be a very important reinforcement for the second half of the season. 'We will get the best out of him, the same as everyone, and he knows where he is coming to.' Atletico’s Italy winger Alessio Cerci will move to Milan on loan as part of the deal, which will run until the end of the 2015-16 season. Cerci said on his Facebook page on Saturday that he had not yet signed with another club. Torres scoring for Atletico Madrid against Barcelona back in 2006, during his first spell with the club .

'I am an Atletico Madrid player and together with the club I am considering the best solution for both,' he added. 'I think that is right and normal.' A World Cup and double European Championship winner with Spain, Torres joined Atletico at the age of 11. Known as 'El Nino' (The Kid), he made his first-team debut as a 17-year-old in 2001 when Madrid’s second club were in the Spanish second division. When he left for Liverpool in July 2007 he pledged to return and is hoping a second stint at Atletico will help resurrect a career that has largely been a disappointment since he joined Chelsea for £50m in January 2011. Atletico’s next match is a La Liga game at home to Levante on January 3 before they host Real Madrid in the first leg of their Copa del Rey last 16 tie on January 7.

"CLICK HERE to see the full Match Zone stats package from the Capital One Cup clash at Anfield . So it wasn't the quiet night Brendan Rodgers wanted. With the League Cup back on the agenda, Liverpool's manager expressed his wish for 'something less eventful' than last month's drama against Middlesbrough. What he got was anything but. Though there was no epic penalty shootout on this occasion, the spectacle was no less enthralling as Liverpool managed to extricate themselves from a bleak position against 10-man Swansea, turning a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 win in injury time. And it was thanks, in no small part, to Mario Balotelli. Yes, him. For once, Liverpool's enigmatic striker came up trumps when it was required, finding himself in the right place at the right time to convert a searching Fabio Borini cross, seven minutes after coming on as substitute. Balotelli was only on the field 16 minutes in total but that did not stop him becoming a key figure in the narrative, even managing to get involved in a jostling match with Jonjo Shelvey after Dejan Lovren had risen highest at the back post to score  the winner. Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren roars after his injury-time header sealed a 2-1 win against Swansea in the Capital One Cup .

Liverpool: Jones 6, Manquillo 6, Toure 6, Lovren 6.5, Johnson 6, Lucas 7, Henderson 6, Markovic 5 (Lallana 6.5), Coutinho 7, Borin 7.5, Lambert 6.5 (Balotelli 7) Subs not used: Moreno, Mignolet, Can, Skrtel, Rossiter.

Att : 42,582 . Rodgers, for good reason, was sheepish as his players celebrated in front of the exultant Kop, appreciating that his side had benefitted from the harsh sending-off of Federico Fernandez for a robust challenge on Philippe Coutinho, that led to the free-kick from which Lovren scored. In the other technical area, Garry Monk – Rodgers' former captain at Swansea – was incandescent at the decision; that his side had frittered away a place in the last eight after looking set to cruise through following Marvin Emnes 65th-minute opener added salt to the wound. For Rodgers and Balotelli, however, this was a welcome change of fortune. A second defeat to a team wearing all-white at Anfield in the space of week, after Real Madrid's brutal lesson in the Champions League, would have set the alarm bells ringing but, perhaps, this is what they needed. 'That is Mario,' said Rodgers' assistant Colin Pascoe. 'He is working hard and he got his just rewards. He nearly missed the game because he felt his knee in the warm up, so it was a good thing we had him. But I never thought we were out of it. I thought we were unfortunate to be 1-0 down.' Monk, unsurprisingly, did not agree. Once they overcame a sluggish start, Swansea, inspired by Shelvey's drive, determination and use of the ball, impressed in the second half and should have taken advantage of Liverpool's frailities when Emnes put them in front. 'I am disappointed at the end,' said Monk. 'Hopefully (referee Keith Stroud) will rescind the red card. These decisions are happening, we have to take it on the chin. The players are upset with the decision, upset with the goal but we should have taken that into extra time. 'We should be clever enough to deal with that. We didn't deserve that. I'm not talking rubbish, I'm talking sense. I was emotional at Stoke, I'm emotional again but it is not getting me anywhere. I watched it about 30 times before I came into talk to you. I hope he will rescind that.' Even if Stroud does, it will be scant consolation. Swansea were so close to repeating the trick they pulled at this stage of the competition two years ago and only naivety cost them. Until then, they had coped with everything Liverpool had thrown at them. Liverpool's play in the opening period was nice enough but lacked punch and only Fabio Borini looked capable of breaking the deadlock; he had the two best efforts, one with a left-foot drive that fizzed past the post, the other forced a fine save from Gerhard Tremmel.

Part of Liverpool's problems in recent weeks has been how they have lost their way in games when things have not gone as they would have wanted them to, so this was going to be a test of their character as much as anything else. Swansea sensed as much. A sense the tide was turning arrived on the hour when, from another precise Shelvey corner, Bafetimbi Gomis wriggled away from Lovren and thumped a header straight at Jones. It was a sign of things to come. Moments later, Shelvey again started driving Swansea forward but when his ball was cut out, Neil Taylor latched on to it and ushered it forward into the path of Emnes, who had taken full advantage of the fact Lovren had gone to sleep. With plenty of time and space, Emnes took gleeful delight in thumping a volley beyond the exposed Jones to send the visting hordes wild and push Rodgers and Company to a place were they had to begin considering the impact of what defeat would have on their season. Then came the grandstand finish. First Balotelli, on for Rickie Lambert, came good, turning in Fabio Borini's cross before one final attack culminated with Lovren peeling off at the back post and turning in his header, atoning for his earlier mistake. Rodgers afforded himself a small smile but nothing more. They are into the last eight and his ambition to win silverware is intact. It isn't getting any easier.
