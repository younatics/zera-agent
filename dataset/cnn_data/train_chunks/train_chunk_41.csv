"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- High in the hills above the Haitian capital, artist Levoy Exil paints at his terrace studio. The man who began a career using beets, carrots, tomatoes and black beans for paint creates vibrant abstractions of life and nature. A year ago, he infused a celestial oil painting with hues of purplish red -- symbolizing blood -- after he gazed outward and for a moment the verdant landscape turned to black. He knew then that something bad was coming. He saw the blood he had imagined on the streets of Port-au-Prince on January 12 when the earth heaved and 150,000 people perished. It's now apparent that among the earthquake's widespread destruction were museums, galleries and other places that contained Haiti's artistic treasures, including Exil's work. They were a troubled nation's legacy, a key source of economic trade with the rest of the world -- and undeniable symbols of hope. Lost, perhaps, forever. The earthquake's blow to Haitian art is staggering: The Centre d'Art, which launched the Haitian arts movement in the 1940s, is severely damaged. The Musee d'Art Nader, which housed more than 12,000 pieces from the largest private collection in Haiti, collapsed. Murals in the Trinity Cathedral, assembled by some of Haiti's best-known artists, came crashing down. ""There is no art museum run by the government of Haiti,"" said Georges Nader Jr., who runs a gallery near the Nader museum opened by his father. ""This is for me like patrimony for Haiti. We were holding this collection for future generations. What will happen now? I don't know."" The significance of art in Haiti may be hard for outsiders to understand. But with few functioning institutions, few outlets of expression, Haiti's brightly colored depictions -- some laced with spiritual traditions of voodoo culture -- of sun and sea, people and animals serve as memory for a country that has suffered under dictatorships and failed governments and is today the poorest in the Americas. With unemployment as high as 85 percent and a majority of Haitians reeling in abject poverty, art has also emerged as an economic lifeline. ""They're painting their lives. They're recording their history,"" said Camille Scully, executive director of Iowa's Waterloo Center for the Arts and co-president of the Haitian Art Society. ""And they're very accessible because of the colors and style. Everyone who sees Haitian art tends to buy it because they respond to it."" Scully said efforts are under way to enlist conservationists to help Haiti, and a flurry of e-mails shared by collectors, curators, gallery owners and other interested parties show the urgency people are feeling to support the arts community. One key figure who's been weighing in on the need to save what can be saved is Gerald Alexis, a leading Haitian art historian, critic and curator. Haiti has a long enough history of not conserving its art, Alexis said from his Quebec City, Quebec, home. An earthquake in colonial times, fires and hurricanes, as wells as riots, revolutions and government-mandated raids of voodoo temples, destroyed much of the creativity that pre-dated the 1940s artistic boom. For this reason, salvaging art, including the oldest piece in Haiti -- an 1822 painting buried in the national palace -- matters. Haiti's art ""will tell future generations who they are and where they come from,"" Alexis said. ""It's our heritage. And although people think that in poor countries such concepts are unnecessary, they are indeed the only thing we have. Our cultural heritage is our pride."" In Port-au-Prince, Nader has been frantically trying to rescue the thousands of pieces his father lovingly collected over four decades. Among the masters: Hector Hyppolite. Philome Obin. Prefete Duffaut. Wilson Bigaud. Nader pulled out an oil-on-cardboard floral still-life painted by Hyppolite in 1945 that now looks more like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing. Some of the artworks housed in the Centre d'Arts, which was in a wooden structure, will be more repairable, he said. What do you do when cement gouges cardboard or canvas? ""This? Only cement can do this,"" he said, picking up some of his punctured pieces. On the day of the quake, Nader's 79-year-old parents were in their bedroom on the top floor of the building that houses the museum. They were pulled from the rubble after the museum collapsed. Nader could not hold back tears when he thought of the suffering around him and stopped the conversation to recompose himself. The cultural loss can hardly compare. ""At that time, the paintings were my last concern,"" he continued. ""There were lives at stake."" But since then, he has been going back to the rubble every day to salvage what he can. He knows he has to -- for the sake of his country. On the second floor of his gallery, he and his staff have been collecting damaged pieces, their vibrant colors dulled by the dust. ""This is like a hospital for paintings,"" he said, watching his staff strip off frames and backings. He picked up a damaged portrait of a fruit vendor by Antonio Joseph. He grew to manhood looking at the painting on his bedroom wall. It's one of his favorites. So far, Nader has rescued about 1,000 pieces; 70 percent need restoration. That was one room in the museum. Kent Shankle, the curator for Iowa's Waterloo Center for the Arts, which houses the largest public collection of Haitian art in the United States, said he hopes there is a silver lining to the tragedy. ""Hopefully this is raising awareness and shedding light on both the beauty of Haiti and its people, as well as the incredible needs there,"" he said. And, perhaps it will fuel a new wave of art that reveals the resilience of people here. ""We've survived. It's a blessing,"" said artist Jean Louis Maxan. Maxan depicted Jean-Bertrand Aristide's exit from Haiti in 2004, an acrylic-on-canvas painting of ""American Air"" waiting to take the disgraced president away. Now, he said, he will paint people screaming, piles of bodies and tents blanketing the city's open spaces. High above the misery, Exil, too, said he will paint again. When nature tells him it is right. ""It's a great loss for all of us,"" Exil said of the earthquake. ""But life continues and we will continue to create."" He will rely on the lush, undulating landscape before him. The sun and the moon. And the distant sea. He will make beauty blossom from the ugliness below. For the future of Haiti.

"WUGANG, China (CNN)  -- Authorities in China's south-central Hunan province are associating disgruntled parents of children stricken by lead poisoning with the outlawed spiritual group Falun Gong. A mother feeds her child in a village near the Wugang Manganese Smelting Plant in Hunan province. ""Citizens of the Wugang area have received phone calls from members of the Falun Gong over the past several days,"" said Wugang Deputy Spokesman Zhen Zhaoxin. ""Any resident who receives any calls or information about the Falun Gong activities are encouraged to report to the police."" He said the government, along with police, are investigating to determine the calls' origin. But villagers said they have suffered enough and the government's accusation is ""insulting."" The friction comes after residents in Wenping township, governed by the city of Wugang, last month protested pollution from an area factory that left more than 1,000 children with lead poisoning. That was one of three separate lead poisoning incidents reported in August that affected large numbers of Chinese children.  Watch more about the lead poisoning Â» . Residents of Wenping and nearby Simachong village denied any connection to Falun Gong. They said they were not even familiar with the religious sect. They just wanted their children to be well again. China banned Falun Gong in 1999 and has cracked down on practitioners. An August 26 public notice warned villagers to beware of Falun Gong members and instructed people to watch for ""reactionary propaganda"" sent online and by phone. The Wugang government issued similar information on its Web site. The villagers said the government wants them to keep quiet, but they are worried. ""They are insulting us,"" said one woman, holding up the public notice. ""They said we are spreading the rumors."" The villagers' lives were shattered when, one by one, children began to fall ill. So far, 1,354 have tested positive for abnormal levels of lead in their blood. Many have stopped eating and are constantly fatigued. Others are not growing hair. Some parents worry they will not be able to provide medical care for long-term problems. Lead poisoning can cause irreversible damage in the nervous and reproductive systems and cause high blood pressure, memory loss and loss of appetite, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Xiao Aijun, the father of two sick children, was angered by the government's claims. ""My baby's been in the hospital for more than 20 days,"" he said of his 10-month-old daughter, Xiao Junmei. ""We have to go back in the month. Look at her hair, look at her hair. ""They said we're Falun Gong,"" he said. ""What is this all about? I have no idea. I don't even know what that is."" Some villagers told CNN that 15 parents who protested factory pollution had been detained by police. CNN could not reach local police for comment, but Zhen, the Wugang spokesman, denied the reports. ""We would not detain parents. After all, they need to be with their children at this time,"" he said. ""This is definitely not the case."" The lead poisoning in Wenping stemmed from the Wugang Manganese Smelting Plant. Similar incidents were reported in northern Shaanxi province, where 851 children were affected, and in southwestern Yunnan province, where 200 children were sickened. China's Ministry of Environmental Protection has dispatched inspectors to examine the plants in Shaanxi and Hunan. Wugang government officials say children who live as far as 20 kms (12.5 miles) from the polluting factories in Wenping and Simachong have been affected. One mother, whose son was hospitalized, said she would have moved long ago if she had known. Another Wugang government spokesman, Lei Zanning, said authorities are keenly aware of environmental protections. ""We can't sacrifice it for the sake of economic development,"" he said. But lead poisoning is a serious problem in China, according to Steven Ma of Greenpeace. About 10 percent of the nation's arable land and 12 million tons of annual food crops are contaminated with lead, he said.","Spokesperson: Citizens of Wugang area received calls from members of Falun Gong .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- New data released Thursday suggests that the Arctic Ocean will be ""largely ice free"" during summer within a decade. As the Arctic sea ice melts, polar bears face extinction. The report, complied by the UK-based Catlin Arctic Survey and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), is the latest research into ice thickness in the Arctic. Researchers predict that within 20 years ice cover will be completely gone during the warmer months. The expedition, which was completed in May, was led by UK explorer Pen Hadow. He and his team collected data by manually drilling into the ice and noting its thickness along a 450-kilometer route across the northern part of the Beaufort Sea. They found that the area surveyed was comprised almost exclusively of first year ice. Scientists think this is significant because traditionally the region has been made up of much older, thicker ice. ""Discovering this area of younger ice provides another body of information that supports the rapidly emerging scientific consensus that it's going to be nearer 10 years from now that we will see roughly 80-85 percent free waters in the Arctic Ocean,"" Hadow told CNN. Measurements taken by Hadow and his team report that the ice-floes were on average 1.8 meters thick -- which, according to scientists, is too thin to survive next summer's ice melt. Professor Peter Wadhams, head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group at the UK's University of Cambridge said: ""With a large part of the region now first year ice, it is clearly more vulnerable. The area is now more likely to become open water each summer, bringing forward the potential date when the summer sea ice will be completely gone."" Professor Wadhams, who has analyzed the expedition data, added: ""The Catlin Arctic Survey data supports the new consensus view that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer within about 20 years, and much of that decrease will be happening within 10 years.""  Click here to see pictures of the expedition Â» . Martin Sommerkorn from the WWF International Arctic Program believes that the changes in sea-ice cover in the region are likely to increase global temperatures further. ""Such a loss of Arctic sea ice has recently been assessed to set in motion powerful climate feedbacks which will have an impact far beyond the Arctic itself,"" Sommerkorn said. ""Arctic sea ice holds a central position in our Earth's climate system. Take it out of the equation and we are left with a dramatically warmer world,"" he added. Hadow fears that the current climate models developed by scientists may not be extreme enough. But he is hopeful that this new data will spur world leaders into action. ""We are now in a loss period,"" Hadow told CNN. ""Maybe losing this sea ice, this roof on the top of our planet in going to be an important moment, a big visual aid to the science that in combination can bring about some sort of global agreement on emissions.""","New report says Arctic sea ice will largely disappear in summer within a decade .

"(CNN) -- Rape has turned into a weapon of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the number of attacks on women having grown threefold over the past few years, human rights activists said Friday. A Congolese rape victim, left, at the Heal Africa clinic in Goma on August 8, 2009. Anneke van Woudenberg, senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told Christiane Amanpour that 200,000 women and girls have been raped in Eastern Congo since 1998, and the condition of women has become more dire as the Congolese army has pressed a military campaign against armed groups in the countryside. ""Rape is being used as a weapon of war in eastern Congo. So we notice and we have documented that when armed groups walk into town, they will rape the women and girls, sometimes publicly, sometimes privately, in order to punish the local population,"" she said. ""It's the easiest way to terrorize a community."" Congo has witnessed one of the worst humanitarian crises since World War II, with a death toll estimated at more than 5 million. Most of the dead have come not from direct violence, but the consequences of the fighting: disease and starvation. While the war formally ended six years ago, fighting persists in eastern Congo, and women are paying a high price.  CNN visits a devastated community Â» . ""One of the other sad realities is that the majority of those who are raped are adolescent girls, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds. Their lives are often ruined by this. And I think we've got to take more seriously -- protection of civilians is not just protecting them from death. It's protecting them from rape,"" van Woudenberg said. Listen to more from van Woudenberg . There have also been reports of members of the Congolese army, particularly high ranking officers, attacking women. In May, the United Nations handed over the names of five top military officers accused of rape. Two of the senior officers are being detained in the capital of Kinshasa and the three others must report to authorities under close observation. They are awaiting trial. Still more must be done, aid groups say, starting with the establishment of a special court made up of Congolese and international judges and prosecutors to investigate rape allegations. ""I think they've got to start holding to account the generals and colonels who are either themselves responsible or who allow their troops to rape. And so far, those are the guys that have been untouchable,"" said van Woudenberg. ""No general has yet been held to account in Congo for rape, and it's high time that that changes."" Congo has taken some measures to try to curb the sexual violence. In 2006, its parliament passed a law criminalizing rape, with penalties ranging from five to 20 years. Penalties are doubled under certain circumstances, including gang-rape and if the perpetrator is a public official. Kabila's wife, Olive Lemba Kabila, has launched a public campaign speaking out against rapes of the nation's women and girls. The army has also started a zero-tolerance campaign in which commanders have emphasized to troops that they must respect human rights and protect civilians from harm, according to the U.N. The United Nations maintains in Congo its largest peacekeeping force anywhere in the world. But the forces have been ineffective at stopping rape. Jean-Marie Guehenno, the former head of U.N. peacekeeping, told Amanpour that the international forces face a serious problem: Too few troops assigned to the vast inaccessible reaches of eastern Congo. ""In the Kivu provinces, there are 10 million people,"" Guehenno said. ""If one applied the counterinsurgency ratios that the U.S. Army thinks of -- say, 20 per 1,000 -- that would mean 200,000 troops in Congo -- 200,000 accountable troops."" ""The U.N. is in a tough spot, to be frank, because if it did not give any support to the Congolese army, probably the Congolese army might prey even more on the population,"" Guehenno said. Part of the problem stems from the tactic applied by the Congolese government to quell previous armed rebellions against Kinshasa by incorporating insurgents into the ranks of the national army, leading to a military that paid scant attention to human rights, and the rights of women in particular. ""What needs to be done is to have a state in Congo that can control its territory and that has the confidence of the people,"" Guehenno said. ""The violence in the Kivu, the violence in Ituri, it is the result of a vacuum, the fact that there is no administration, there is no credible state, there is no justice. And so that vacuum is being occupied by various militias. ""And, unfortunately, when the Congolese army integrates a militia without sorting between the killers and those who could be integrated, it just adds to the problem."" Van Woudenberg called for international pressure to force the Congolese army to bring abusers to justice. ""My worst fear is that we're going to continue to see those individuals responsible for rape being promoted. My hope is that the women and girls of -- of eastern Congo in particular -- will continue to speak out. I think we've seen immense courage from those women and girls to say, 'No, we've had enough.'""","Human Rights Watch: 200,000 women, girls raped in Eastern Congo since 1998 .

"(CNN) -- Forty years ago this week, three men in a tiny spacecraft slipped their earthly bonds and traveled where no one else had before, circling the moon 10 times and bringing back an iconic image of a blue-and-white Earth in the distance, solitary but bound as one against the black vastness beyond. Host Nick Clooney (left) and astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders answer questions in October. The voyage of Apollo 8 from December 21-27, 1968, marked humans' first venture to another heavenly body. ""We were flying to the moon for the first time,"" said Jim Lovell, one of the three astronauts aboard the historic flight. ""Seeing the far side of the moon for the first time. Coming around and seeing the Earth as it really is -- a small fragile planet with a rather normal star, our sun."" But beyond the monumental aspects of such a scientific achievement, the feat was a major psychological and emotional boost for many Americans at the end of a particularly bad year in U.S. history. The Tet offensive in January 1968 had left many Americans shocked and doubting that victory in Vietnam was possible. In April, the Rev. Martin Luther King was assassinated, and streets throughout the nation erupted in fire and fury. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was gunned down two months later. That summer, the nation watched in horror as police and anti-war protesters battled in the streets of Chicago during the Democratic National Convention. The launch of Apollo 7 in October was a major victory for NASA, putting the space program back on track after a 22-month interruption because of a launch pad fire that had killed three astronauts in January 1967. Then came Apollo 8.  Gallery: Images of the Apollo 8 mission Â» . ""Providence happened to put everything together at the end of the year to give the American public an uplift after what had been a poor year,"" Lovell told CNN on Monday. Reaching the moon was ""a big psychological step,"" said Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham. ""The public said, 'Hey, human beings are going to another body in the solar system,' "" Cunningham told CNN in a telephone interview from his home in Houston, Texas. The mission produced one of the most famous photos from the space program, showing a large chunk of gray moon in the foreground and a dappled blue-and-white, three-quarter Earth rising in the distance. Apollo 8 also produced what to many was one of the most inspirational and soothing moments in history when Lovell and crewmates Frank Borman and William A. Anders took turns reading from the Book of Genesis. It was Christmas Eve and the whole world was watching. NASA said at the time it was expected to be the largest TV audience to date. The astronauts signed off with these words: ""And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a merry Christmas and God bless all of you, all of you on the good earth."" The timing could not have been better, Lovell said. ""It happened that it all jelled,"" he said by telephone. ""The fact that we circled the moon on Christmas Eve. A screenwriter couldn't have done a better job."" The success of the mission also gave the United States a major boost in its race against the Soviet Union to see who would get to the moon first. The United States would land two men on the moon in the summer of 1969 on Apollo 11, beating the Soviets and fulfilling a goal set by former President John F. Kennedy at the beginning of the decade. ""There was a great psychological significance of sending a spacecraft to the moon,"" Cunningham said. ""It was not a psychological leap for any of us [astronauts] to go to the moon."" The astronauts, he said, were used to taking risks and knew they could do it. But NASA officials had some tough choices to make. ""For the people on the ground, it was a big step for them,"" Cunningham said. ""Making life-and-death decisions about somebody else's life is a lot more difficult than making one about your own."" For astronaut Edgar Mitchell, the sixth person to walk on the moon, the Apollo 8 mission signified a major milestone in human history, much like when the Phoenicians started exploring the Mediterranean Sea nearly 3,000 years earlier. ""We became citizens of the galaxy, as opposed to citizens of the planet,"" Mitchell said Monday. ""For my parents' generation, it was aviation,"" said Mitchell, who is 78. ""My generation went off the planet altogether. We became the first generation of spacefarers."" For the astronauts, most of them former test pilots, going to the moon was just another job. Were they fully aware of the significance of what they were accomplishing, Lovell is asked. ""No,"" he says immediately. ""We were focused on trying to do the right thing. Focused on trying to accomplish something."" Lovell went on to fly another historic mission, Apollo 13 in April 1970. That flight, which he commanded, became famous when an oxygen system aboard the craft blew up and the three astronauts had to limp around the moon and back to Earth using makeshift and improvised systems. Their triumph over adversity was immortalized in the movie ""Apollo 13,"" in which Tom Hanks played Lovell. Lovell was supposed to land on the moon that time, but did not make it. ""Twice a bridesmaid, never a bride,"" he said with a laugh, admitting that for years he harbored resentment that the mission had been a ""failure."" It was only in later years, Lovell said, that he fully realized what a success that mission had been, as he and his two crewmates returned safely to Earth. ""It is mind-boggling in some respects,"" he said Monday.","Apollo 8 came at end of difficult year in world history, 1968 .

"(CNN) -- In Mexico City, the government ran out of surgical masks after handing them out to one of every five residents. A mother and son wear face masks as protection from swine flu at Sydney international Airport in Australia. Manufacturers and pharmacies in Europe are also reporting a surge in demand for face masks. And a Texas-based surgical mask producer says it's ramping up to meet demand and expects a shortage of masks. But their real value seems to be in keeping people who are already ill from spreading the virus, rather than protecting healthy people, experts said. Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday in a press briefing that the ""evidence is not very strong"" for masks' value outside of health care settings, and outside of settings in which people come into face-to-face contact with a person with an infectious disease. ""We would not recommend that people generally wear masks in their workplace as a precautionary measure,"" he said.  Watch for more on staying safe from swine flu Â» . The World Health Organization (WHO) also warns against relying on face masks, especially for those not infected with the virus. ""They are mainly useful for people who are already sick, to prevent spreading. Not so much to stop people from catching the virus,"" Sarah Cumberland of the WHO told CNN. The United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency also told CNN that the use of face masks was not necessary or recommended for protection against the swine flu virus. Although it's not known for sure how much benefit a surgical mask has in preventing the transmission of swine flu, people who have the illness may consider wearing one as a way to reduce the amount they cough and sneeze onto others, said Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of the epidemiology division at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. ""I think that this is a perfectly reasonable thing for someone with a respiratory illness to do,"" he said. More effective than soft surgical masks is the N95, which is an example of a ""respirator."" This kind of tight-fitting face covering protects people against breathing very small particles, which may contain viruses. The downside is that it's more expensive, uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and has to be custom fit, Reingold said, so it's suited for people working in high-risk laboratories. Masks carry both physical and psychological benefits, said Dr. Julio Frenk, former health minister of Mexico and current dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. Masks are a ""reminder to people that they should avoid close contact with other persons,"" he said. ""They also have this effect of isolating people and reminding them that they should not be kissing people, shaking hands, things like that."" For health care workers, it's important to have high-efficiency masks, which protect better against infectious diseases, he said. But people in the United States should generally not have to wear masks because the cases are localized, he said. By contrast, it is more of a widespread problem in Mexico, especially in the capital city, a ""huge urban conglomeration."" Measures such as closing schools are the most effective in stopping the spread of the disease, he said. Mexico's schools are closed until at least May 6. By early Tuesday, the swine flu outbreak in Mexico was suspected in 152 deaths and more than 1,600 illnesses, the country's health minister said. Swine flu has reached  phase 4 (out of 6) on the pandemic scale, according to the WHO guidelines, but has not yet attained the status of global pandemic. During a flu pandemic, people should consider wearing a face mask if they are sick with the flu, live with someone who has the flu or need to be in a crowded place, the CDC Web site says. If you are caring for a person thought to have pandemic flu or will be close to someone who may have it, consider a respirator, for example an N95 or high-filtering face piece respirator, the CDC Web site says. Some health care workers, such as nurses and doctors, use respirators when dealing with patients who have airborne diseases, the CDC said. iReport.com: Worried about swine flu? In the current swine flu situation, rather than masks, the CDC is pushing hand-washing, covering coughs and refraining from ""giving somebody that little kiss of greeting,"" Besser said. ""If you're in an infected area or if you have the swine flu, it's probably best not to, to not give a kiss, but we're not recommending an end of affection during the period. It's a period of time when we need a little more affection, but doing it in a way that isn't going to transmit a respiratory disease would be a CDC approach,"" he said.","Manufacturers and pharmacies are reporting a surge in demand for face masks .

"(CNN) -- Six Nations winners Ireland ended the year unbeaten after defeating world rugby champions South Africa 15-10 in Dublin on Saturday thanks to an assured kicking performance from newcomer Jonathan Sexton. The fly-half, playing only his second international ahead of the veteran Ronan O'Gara, landed five penalties as the Irish overcame conceding the game's only try to Schalk Burger in the 16th minute. The injury-hit Springboks, who won the southern hemisphere's Tri-Nations title this year, were left to lament three missed kicks at goal by fly-half Morne Steyn and one by substitute Ruan Pienaar. The Irish fielded nine players who toured South Africa with the Lions earlier this year, when flanker Burger was banned for eight weeks for eye-gouging Luke Fitzgerald. Sexton landed an early penalty from long range, but Steyn helped to send blindsider Burger over the line and added the extras, before making it 10-3 with a drop-goal. Sexton reduced the deficit before halftime as Steyn three times missed from considerable distance. Ireland moved 12-10 ahead with two more Sexton goals despite struggling at the scrums, and the visitors started to wilt after Pienaar hit the post with a penalty attempt. New Zealand ended their northern hemisphere tour unbeaten after crushing France 39-12 in Marseille, running in five tries to none. The All Blacks have suffered an uncharacteristic four defeats this year -- three of them to the Springboks -- but took the chance to avenge the shock 27-22 home loss to Les Bleus in June. The Kiwis, who had earlier beaten Wales, Italy and England on tour, led 22-12 at halftime as backs Sitiveni Sivivatu and Mils Muliaina crossed for tries along with back-row forward Jerome Kaino. Winger Cory Jane and center Conrad Smith went over in the second half and mercurial fly-half Dan Carter kicked a total of 14 points while orchestrating the All Blacks' most free-flowing performance of the tour against a side who had earlier beaten South Africa and Samoa. New Zealand captain Richie McCaw was named the International Rugby Board's player of the year after the match, becoming the first to achieve the honor twice following his 2006 award. Scotland crashed back to earth following last weekend's first win over Australia in 27 years, losing 9-6 at home to bogey side Argentina. The visitors came back from 6-0 down at halftime in Edinburgh, where they have not lost for 19 years, and inflicted the first defeat on Scots coach Andy Robinson. Phil Godman kicked two penalties to give Scotland hope of winning all their November internationals for the first time since 2002, but paid the price for lock Nathan Hines' second-half sin-binning as Martin Rodriguez leveled with two kicks of his own. Rodriguez then landed a drop-goal two minutes from time to give the Pumas a fourth straight win at Murrayfield and their first victory on this tour. Australia, however, relieved the pressure on coach Robbie Deans by crushing Wales 33-12 in Cardiff, avenging last year's 21-18 defeat. Matt Giteau missed a last-gasp conversion against the Scots which would have won the match, but was to the fore this time as the Wallabies ran in three early tries. Center Digby Ioane, lock James Horwill, flanker David Pocock went over in the first 16 minutes, while Wales lost Shane Williams, try-scorer Leigh Halfpenny and Matthew Rees to injury as they surrendered a 23-12 halftime deficit. Substitute hooker Tatafu Polota-Nau crossed in the second half while Giteau kicked 13 points in total to hand Wales coach Warren Gatland, a New Zealander, his heaviest home defeat in front of a 74,339 crowd. Italy beat the touring Samoa team 24-6 for their first victory in four encounters with the Pacific Islanders, who had Henry Fa'afili sent off for a high tackle on first-half tryscorer Luke McLean.","Six Nations winners Ireland ended the year unbeaten after defeating South Africa 15-10 .

The troops are targeting ""hundreds of hardened al Qaeda and Taliban in dug-in positions,"" said officials familiar with the intelligence. The operation started two days ago in the region, where al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was once thought to be hiding. The Bush administration has been criticized for not sending enough ground forces to Tora Bora in December 2001 to capture the militant after the invasion that toppled the Taliban. ""U.S. and Afghan forces engaged al Qaeda and other violent extremist fighters in eastern Afghanistan during a combined arms assault using precision munitions. There have been no substantiated reports of civilian casualties in this engagement,"" said Capt. Vanessa R. Bowman, a U.S. Army spokeswoman. ""The targets were carefully chosen to pinpoint enemy positions and eliminate the likelihood of harming innocent civilians,"" she said. ""This region has provided an ideal environment to conceal enemy support bases and training sites, as well as plan and launch attacks aimed at terrorizing innocent civilians, both inside and outside the region."" Also Wednesday, a manager at a private British security firm in Afghanistan was shot and killed in the capital Kabul, a spokesman for the company said. ""We did lose a manager today in Kabul to unknown assailants,"" Christopher Beese, spokesman for ArmorGroup International, said Wednesday. He said next of kin have been notified and an inquiry into the incident has begun. The name of the man, a British national, was not released. ""It's bad news. He was a very well-respected man,"" Beese said, noting that the victim had experience in Afghanistan going back to the early 1980s. Beese -- who said the man's role was to run the administration of the 1,200-person-strong security presence in the country -- described the man as a ""logistics manager"" and ""all things to all people."" The firm, which has been operating in Afghanistan since 2002, mostly provides diplomatic protection and has contracts with the British and American governments. The man recruited and trained Afghan guards and was the most senior administrator at the company's Kabul base, Camp Anjuman, the company said. E-mail to a friend .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Wearing a plaid green A-line spring skirt from her new fashion line, paired with a black patent leather belt and black leather gladiator sandal stilettos, ""Sex and the City"" actress Kristin Davis is the perfect combination of sweet and fierce when we meet up after her fashion show at the Belk department store in Atlanta, Georgia. Kristin Davis surrounded by models and Belk store official Arlene Goldstein. It's a look that totally says her character, Charlotte, with a little bit of screen pal Carrie. Davis is so much like her character, adorable and upbeat, I expect Carrie or Samantha to drop in on our conversation and say something to shock her. As any true fan knows ... OK ... as every woman knows, watching ""Sex and the City"" was like being front row at a fashion show with a plot. TV show and movie costume designer Patricia Field dressed the characters in haute couture as they skipped down the streets of New York City in $600 stilettos. But is this reality? Most sane women wouldn't choose to walk even one city block in high heels. And most women certainly can't spend a month's rent on a belt or bag, even if they have a truly fabulous party to wear it to. So, what about us, the fashionistas on a budget? Are we to be ignored, forced to wear boring clothing and practical shoes? Luckily, no; designers are catching on. Target features affordable lines from high-end designers like Alexander McQueen and Isaac Mizrahi. All of the pieces in Sarah Jessica Parker's clothing line Bitten cost less than $20 before the clothing store that carried them went under. Davis is the latest celebrity to jump on the clothing label bandwagon, designing a line for Belk department stores. Will she meet the same fate as Parker? Davis has the following to be successful. Although her character was by far the most conservatively dressed (Carrie strolling through town in just a bra top, anyone?), she had the most wearable wardrobe, and Davis became a fashion icon along with the rest of the ladies. Her favorite piece from her line? ""I can't decide, impossible to choose!"" she says. So I choose for her: definitely the gladiator heels. ""It's important for women to have a strong shoe,"" she says. ""Then you can wear anything on top. With a strong shoe on, you're good to go."" She admits she didn't have a defined style before meeting Field, who bluntly told her that ""Sexy Secretary"" was going to be her look. Davis' philosophy is a good one: Stick with what works. She takes the look that Field defined for her ""Sex and the City"" character. Original it's not, but everything coming down the runway is something the stylish Charlotte York would definitely wear. Davis is in touch with all of us real women out there, saying, ""I don't want to make clothing that only skinny actresses could wear."" Her solution? Dresses, shoes and swimsuits worthy of a ""Sex and the City"" episode that you don't need Park Avenue pockets to afford. It's versatile enough to look good on every body type. ""Everyone has body issues. I really wanted to create pieces that looked good on different kinds of bodies. I had all of my family members trying on the outfits!"" she says with a laugh. Davis won't spill any secrets from the scripts of the ""Sex and the City"" movie sequel, which comes out in May 2010, but she admits it's a ""happy"" movie. She does hint that our famous foursome might have to cut back a little on their clothing expenses as art imitates life. And she's willing to share some fashion tips: How to look like you stepped out of the wardrobe room on the set of the next ""Sex and the City"" movie? Green. ""It's THE color"" she says. And hey, who doesn't need to save some green? It all works out perfectly. I left the meeting with Davis to check out her displays. Then I skipped out into the streets of Atlanta, in a pair of her new gladiator stiletto sandals. That I got on sale, of course.","""Sex and the City"" actress Kristin Davis says women need strong shoes .

"(CNN) -- An aircraft carrier named after the first President Bush was commissioned Saturday in Norfolk, Virginia. Former President George H.W. Bush waves aboard the aircraft carrier named after him Saturday. ""Those who are sitting out there, where I was, 65 years ago, preparing to serve aboard your new ship, I wish I was sitting right out there with you,"" the carrier's 84-year-old namesake told sailors at the commissioning ceremony. ""As you prepare to man this ship, I do know that you take with you the hopes and dreams of every American who cherishes freedom and peace, and you take with you the undying respect and admiration of the entire Bush family,"" he said. The 1,092-foot, 20-story USS George H.W. Bush was decorated with red, white and blue banners for Saturday's ceremony at Naval Station Norfolk.  Watch video of the aircraft carrier Â» . The 41st president joined the Navy at 18 and served as an aviator in World War II. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and three Air Medals for his Navy service in the Pacific during the war, according to the Department of Defense. His time in the Navy ended after about four years. About 17,000 people were expected to attend Saturday's ceremony. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Vice President Dick Cheney and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine were there, as was Bush's son President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura. ""Laura and I are thrilled to be here to help commission an awesome ship and to honor an awesome man, President George H.W. Bush,"" the president said. ""So what do you give a guy who has been blessed and has just about everything he has ever needed? Well, an aircraft carrier."" The ship, comprising 47,000 tons of structural steel and about 500 tons of aluminum, is the last of the Nimitz class of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The ship's construction began in 2003. It was finished nearly three years later. The vessel will carry about 6,000 Navy personnel, the Department of Defense said. After the ceremony, the president left Norfolk for Maryland's Andrews Air Force Base on what was probably his last Air Force One flight. From Andrews, he was expected to take a helicopter to Washington. White House spokesperson Dana Perino said the president wasn't aware that it was his last scheduled flight on Air Force One until he was told by an interviewer.

"Editor's note: Journalist Karl Penhaul spent several weeks tracking the gangs of the Mexican underworld, the corrupt officials who support them and the cops trying to halt the violence. This is the last of three exclusive reports. The first focused on the violent rules gangs live by and the second looked at  how gangsters are honored in death. Forensic investigators and federal police dig bodies out of mass graves in the desert near Juarez. JUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Heat waves shimmer over the desert. A team of forensic experts clad in white overalls excavate three shallow graves. The sand gives up nine bodies -- seven men and two women. At least one of the victims' hands were cuffed behind their back. Others had been trussed up with duct tape. The stale stench reveals that the corpses had been dumped there several days earlier and were decomposing fast. That grisly find in mid-March came a week after thousands more soldiers had been deployed to Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. The arrival of the soldiers and more federal police agents had coincided with a short lull in the killings. Snapping photos of the scene from behind the police line was Lucio Soria, photographer for Juarez's main newspaper, El Diario de Juarez, and its sister paper, PM. PM is a perfect example of Mexico's so-called ""red press,"" newspapers that specialize in covering violence. Soria seems like a perfect ambassador. ""I've gone for a week and a half without taking pictures of dead people. I was thinking 'Hell, what am I going to do?' At this rate I'll end up taking pictures for the social pages,"" he said. Soria realizes snapping pictures of blood and gore may seem heartless. But he stays cheerful, cracking dark jokes with colleagues, all while listening to police communications on a radio scanner and searching for clues about where to find the next drug war victim. ""It might seem ugly, but that's our job,"" Soria said. He and fellow photographers have been busy in recent months. Last year, Juarez became the poster city for Mexico's narco-violence, with more than 1,600 gang killings.  Watch musicians play ""narco-ballads"" honoring hitmen Â» . This year, Mayor Jose Reyes is trying to turn a page on the killings and make Juarez a showcase for solutions. Military and federal police convoys patrol the streets around the clock. Cops armed with AR-15 assault rifles, identities obscured by ski masks, hang off pickup trucks that speed around in twos and threes.  Watch cops round up gang suspects Â» . Soldiers strike a warlike pose behind heavy machine guns mounted on American-made Humvees. Whether it's working depends on whom you ask and how hard you read between the lines. ""I think this is very effective because it closes transport routes for the movement of [cartel] personnel and weapons,"" said a state officer, assigned to guide us, at a federal police checkpoint. The officer, known only by his call sign Trojan One, seemed confident. The agent in command of the checkpoint was less convinced. ""Of course organized crime is trying to avoid us. I'm not sure what methods they use to operate. We don't know how they work,"" said the officer, identifying himself only as Aztec One. On another day we ran into a three-truck federal police operation staking out a house in a middle-class Juarez neighborhood.  See photos of police, gang life in Mexico Â» . The commander said his men believed they had made what he termed a ""major"" cocaine bust. When I met him they had already been waiting almost 24 hours for a judge to issue a search warrant. When they gained access they discovered some 500 half-gram bags of cocaine. In Juarez those bags sell for around $8. Now do the math, 500 half-gram bags at possibly 60 percent purity means around 150 grams of pure cocaine -- hardly a major strike in the drug war. Reyes' solution has been to hand the military all civilian police functions, even down to traffic control. Mexico's military has little experience in urban warfare, little experience in policing and has been unable to shake a decades-old reputation for human rights abuses. When I bump into Reyes at a transfer-of-command ceremony at city hall I ask him what he's doing about alleged corruption and complicity among politicians and businessmen, who permit the cartels to move their shipments and help launder the proceeds. ""My opinion in Juarez is that that kind of political corruption does not exist,"" he said adamantly. Two weeks later, in Monterrey, I caught up with outspoken lawyer Raquenel Villanueva. She knows a thing or two about politicians colluding with Mexico's mafia.  Watch how drug lords pay tribute to a highway bandit, looking for luck Â» . Mexican media have dubbed her the ""devil's advocate"" for her role in defending a string of senior cartel figures and their hitmen. Last year, she was detained for 90 days, accused her of being a member of the Gulf Cartel. She was freed without charge. Throughout her career, she's survived four assassination attempts and taken 10 bullets, two of them in the head. Her office is crammed with religious iconography: crosses, paintings of the Virgin of Guadalupe and a four-foot-high wooden statue of Saint Jude Thaddeus. Two bullets are encrusted in the effigy after the last attempt on her life in 2000. ""I know about official corruption and exactly who is doing what because my clients tell me,"" she said. ""To win the drug war you have to tell the Americans to take better care of their young people, tell them to stop being so cold and materialistic,"" Villanueva lectured. ""Then you have to end corruption and that means changing the government cabinets of half the countries in the world.""","Border city of Juarez last year had more than 1,600 gang killings .

"(CNN)  -- In order to maintain peace at home, President-elect Barack Obama might want to have some very important talks with his wife and mother-in-law before moving into the White House. President-elect Barack Obama's mother-in-law Marian Robinson joins him on stage on election night. Like some 4 million other multigenerational U.S. households Barack Obama's mother-in-law, Marian Robinson, will join the Obamas at the family's private quarters at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In about 1.3 million American homes where the parents are head of the household, at least one grandparent lives with the family. Having a grandparent living with a family can be a wonderful and beneficial addition to the family, says psychologist Elaine Ducharme, but only if everyone can navigate the boundaries. The key issues that need to be discussed between grandparents and parents are privacy and the discipline of the children, says the psychologist, who practices in Hartford, Connecticut. Dannee Brown agrees and says having those discussions and setting ground rules ahead of time is better than making it up as you go along because then feelings can get hurt. Brown always knew her parents, Bill and Mary Lou Wade, would one day live with her and says she couldn't have survived without them after she and her husband separated. But disagreements over the disciplining of her two children sparked conflict. ""We've had some knock-down, drag-outs about discipline -- especially with my dad,"" the Fredericksburg, Virginia, woman says, ""I finally had to say, 'I'm the mom -- you're not -- don't tell me how to raise my kids.' "" On the flip side, Brown's mother would like to be just a grandmother who spoils Noelle and Ethan -- instead of having to play disciplinarian while Brown is working as a nurse-anesthetist. The Wades have a separate apartment in the lower level of Brown's home, but spend winters at their own home in Florida. That gives them all a break from each other. Brown describes it as a ""four-month time to really appreciate them"" for all the cooking, cleaning and home maintenance her parents do along with the childcare. She and the children miss the grandparents so much during this time that they usually make one trip to Florida so they can spend time with ""Nanny and Pop."" The 'Aaah, go away!' effect . Along with establishing guidelines for everyone's role, Ducharme says both the parents and grandparents need to address privacy issues. ""I think privacy is key -- making sure that everybody has a place where they can have some privacy,"" says Ducharme. Brown says she sometimes wishes she could have a little more privacy in the evenings now that she is working days. She gets home from work and spends the evening with her children and after they go to sleep she looks forward to some time by herself. But sometimes her mother comes upstairs to chat. ""That's when I want to say, 'Ahhh, go away!"" says Brown. ""I don't say that, but I'm thinking it."" And even if everyone agrees on a plan ahead of time, it would be wise to expect irritations to pop up every now and then, the therapist says. ""Trying to live together is really about problem solving,"" Ducharme says. She tells her clients if they all focus on finding a solution to the problem and making it a win-win for everyone involved, it takes the emotions and hurt feelings out of the equation. Clearing the air . Ducharme suggests holding a family meeting where either party could say he or she is feeling stressed about an issue or someone lacks enough privacy. But watch out for red flags during discussions prior to inviting your mother or mother-in-law to move in. ""If you really don't communicate well with this person, and when you try to communicate your feelings and ideas it always ends up in a battle -- then it's probably not a good plan to have them move in with you,"" says Ducharme. Stephanie Ware knows family meetings are a good place to clear the air and discuss problems. She had asked her mother, Betty Carradine, to move in to help her with childcare upon her return to work. But her mom moved in earlier than planned after granddaughter Kennedy arrived by Caesarean section. The Atlanta, Georgia, paralegal and her husband, Michael Ware, had discussed many issues with her mother and everyone laid out their expectations of each other, with the couple telling her mother that they would handle all the household expenses. But the Wares called another family meeting after Carradine moved in because they felt she was trying to help too much. ""We let her know that we wanted her here to just help us with Kennedy and she didn't necessarily have to do any housework as far as cooking or cleaning or fixing our lunches."" Ware also makes sure Kennedy's bottles are prepared so that her mother's day goes a little smoother and grandma is not so busy while tending to her seventh grandchild. Ware says she thanks God daily for her mother's help because it gives her extra time to spend with her baby daughter in the morning. And Stephanie can carry Kennedy down the hallway to her mother's room instead of dressing the infant, and packing all her supplies and bottles into a diaper bag and driving her to daycare. Ware says she, her husband and her mother took several trips together while she was out on maternity leave. And every other weekend, her mother stays with Stephanie's sister's family. In the five-bedroom Ware house, personal space and privacy is not an issue. And the couple tries to get out once a month for ""date night."" The only problem Ware is having with her mother living with her is Carradine's cooking: ""She is a great cook, and it's hard,"" Ware says with a laugh, ""but I'm staying very disciplined.""","Michelle Obama's mother is moving into White House with first family .

"(CNN) -- Jen Bucala has a lot of faith in her family's ""lucky"" numbers. ""I've been playing, or around playing, the lotto all my life,"" she says. She rattles off her numbers, citing family birthdays, and recounting numerical coincidences. ""Me, my husband, my father-in-law ... all our birthdays are in November. Just a week apart from each other,"" says Bucala, 31. One number that did surprise her was $10,000. After some quick figuring,  Bucala estimates she has spent that amount on scratch off games and Megamillions since she started playing a decade ago. For Bucala, a Lindenhurst, New York, resident who works three jobs -- as a sales associate, an Avon Rep and a bridal consultant -- that is a lot of money. ""That ten grand could have gone toward a million and one bills I have -- my mortgage, car payments,"" Bucala says. ""We spend thousands of dollars every month on bills. I don't have kids either. That [lotto] money could have been a whole month for me for bills,"" she says. But like a lot of people, Bucala thinks $1 is a small price to pay for a dream. ""You gotta play in order to win. That's part of lotto. You never know,"" says Bucala. One of the seductive features of the lotto is the low entry fee says Frank Farley, a psychology professor at Temple University. ""It can be exciting, checking those winning numbers,"" says Farley. ""Maybe something big might happen. There's not a whole lot of other things in your life where you put a small amount of money in and maybe something big will happen. It gives you a sliver of hope that you could turn your life around."" And sometimes there are winners. Mineola Oaks, is retired and living in Washington Heights, New York. She has played lotto every day, spending $3-$5 a day (and more on Tuesday) for over 20 years. (Just $4 a day for 20 years adds up to almost $30,000.)  Two years ago she won $100,000. And with that money she paid off her bills and did some remodeling on her second home in Virginia. Oaks still buys lotto tickets, but she cautions that there's always something else you can put the money towards. ""I take care of things first,"" she says. ""Food, rent -- Then you can go out and spend a dollar on the lotto."" Just don't expect to win. Let's take Powerball for example. Your chances of winning the jackpot is one in 195,249,054 says Michael Orkin, a statistician and dean of business, math and science at Laney College in Oakland, California. Let's say you buy 50 Powerball tickets a week, you'll win the jackpot about once every 75,000 years, he says. Cold, hard numbers aside, the lotto is entertainment. ""Almost everyone spends money on entertainment,"" says Stephen Brobeck of the Consumer Federation of America. ""People spend hundreds of dollars going to a sports event. Others spend a thousand dollars a year on premium cable channels. Purchasing a lotto ticket -- it's excitement and there's always the possibility, however slim, that they will strike it rich and win,"" he says. Cost of fleeting excitement adds up . Sodanys Paulino, 21, of Washington Heights, stood outside a lottery terminal one rainy Friday night. She bought two scratch off tickets and a mega millions ticket. When asked what else she could be doing with that money, she laughs. ""Two dollars? You can't buy anything for two dollars,"" she says. But $2 a week is about $100 a year. And $100 can buy you something. The problem is opportunity costs, says Farley. ""What opportunities are lost because you are putting discretionary income into the lottery when you could be putting it into something else?"" he asks. ""A small amount of money can be spent on dental floss,"" he says. The lotto sends the wrong message, says Farley. ""It's hard work versus chance. The lotto says success can be built on chance."" A 2005 study by the Consumer Federation of America says 38 percent of people with incomes below $25,000 think that winning the lottery represents the most practical way for them to accumulate several hundred thousand dollars. ""Lower income people think their chances of winning are slim. And they think that the probability [for them to win] is greater than being able to accumulate savings over time. The lotto advantage . Peter Tufano, a Professor at Harvard Business School, harnessed this idea that people would rather have a small probability of a large payout when he came up with the ""Save to Win"" idea. It's part savings, part raffle ticket. And it's had major success in Detroit, Michigan, where eight credit unions have been offering it since January. Here's how it works. You open up a one-year certificate of deposit and for every $25 you save, you get the chance to win a $100,000 prize. Hank Hubbard, the director of Communicating Arts Credit Union in Detroit, Michigan, says when his credit union offered a 10 percent interest rate on a one-year CD, no one signed on, but with Save to Win, 14 percent of their membership signed up. ""I am surprised at the extent of the success. We really are showing people that they can afford to save,"" he says. And in the very worst case even though someone may not win the grand prize, at least they've already accumulated some savings. But when it comes to playing the real thing -- old habits die hard. ""I'm still going to buy my scratchoffs,"" says Bucala. ""I'm not going to go cold turkey,"" she says. ""No way! It's too exciting ... knowing you have the chance to win.""","Jen Bucala likes to buy lottery tickets; an estimated $10,000 in 10 years .

"PALO ALTO, California (CNN)  -- Sharing the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize helps underscore the urgency of the climate crisis, said former Vice President Al Gore on Friday. ""This is a chance to elevate global consciousness about the challenges that we face now,"" said Al Gore. Gore's comments came hours after the Nobel committee announced he would share the award with the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their work to raise awareness about global warming. ""This is a chance to elevate global consciousness about the challenges that we face now,"" Gore said, speaking to reporters in Palo Alto, California. ""It truly is a planetary emergency, and we have to respond quickly."" The former vice president said he would donate his half of the $1.5 million prize to the Alliance for Climate Protection, an organization he founded to persuade people to reduce global warming by cutting pollution. ""That amount is very small compared to the enormous challenge that lies ahead,"" Gore said, including organizing a massive grass-roots movement and a mass advertising campaign focused on ""trying to change the way people think.""  Watch Gore describe what he calls a 'planetary emergency' Â» . Earlier Friday, a White House spokesman said President Bush was pleased that Gore, Bush's opponent in the 2000 presidential race, had won the award. ""Of course, he's happy for Vice President Gore, happy for the International Panel on Climate Change scientists, who also shared the Peace Prize,"" White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said. ""Obviously it's an important recognition, and we're sure the vice president is thrilled."" Fratto said Bush would not be under any pressure to adopt mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions, a policy Gore has advocated. Gore's ex-boss, former President Clinton, also said he's ""thrilled by this well-deserved recognition,"" and credited Gore with ""warning and educating us about the dangers of climate change for decades. He saw this coming before others in public life."" The Nobel committee's announcement cited Gore and the IPCC ""for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change."" The award ceremony will be held December 10 in Oslo, Norway. In recent weeks, Gore has been the target of a campaign to persuade him to enter the 2008 presidential race. A source involved in Gore's past political runs told CNN that he definitely has the ambition to use the peace prize as a springboard to run for president. But he will not run, because he won't take on the political machine assembled by Sen. Hillary Clinton, said the source. If the senator from New York had faltered at all, Gore would take a serious look at entering the race, the source said. But Gore has calculated that Clinton is unstoppable, according to the source. Gore repeatedly denied he has any plans to run again, but this week a group of grass-roots Democrats calling themselves ""Draft Gore"" took out a full-page ad in The New York Times in a bid to change his mind. Watch Gore discuss global warming and politics . ""Your country needs you now, as do your party, and the planet you are fighting so hard to save,"" the group said in an open letter. ""America and the Earth need a hero right now, someone who will transcend politics as usual and bring real hope to our country and to the world."" The Nobel committee praised Gore as being ""one of the world's leading environmentalist politicians."" ""He is probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted,"" said Ole Danbolt Mjos, chairman of the Nobel committee. In making the announcement, Mjos said, ""Through the scientific reports it has issued over the past two decades, the IPCC has created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming. ""Thousands of scientists and officials from over 100 countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming."" Said Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the U.N. panel: ""This is an honor that goes to all the scientists and authors who have contributed to the work of the IPCC."" Renate Christ, secretary of the panel, called the award ""the most significant recognition that the IPCC has received."" The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established in 1988 to study climate change information. The group doesn't do independent research but instead reviews scientific literature from around the world. The U.N.-sanctioned group was formed by the World Meteorological Organization and U.N. Environment Program. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was ""delighted"" with the news that Gore and the IPCC will share in prize. The Nobel caps a series of prestigious awards associated with Gore, including two  Oscars this year for the 2006 documentary film, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" which followed him on a worldwide tour publicizing the dangers of climate change. Last month, he also picked up an Emmy -- the highest award in U.S. television -- for ""Current TV."" The show, which Gore co-created, describes itself as a global television network giving viewers the opportunity to create and influence its programming. Previous American recipients of the peace prize include former Presidents Carter in 2002, Wilson in 1919 and Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. In 1973, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shared the award with North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. received the honor in 1964.  See more on 2007 Nobel winners Â» .

"(CNN) -- Basketball legend Michael Jordan has caused a furor at the President's Cup golf tournament after the former Chicago Bulls player was snapped smoking a cigar at the Harding Park course in San Francisco. Michael Jordan smoking a cigar at the Hardin Park golf course. Jordan -- who is acting as the honorary assistant captain for the U.S. team at the event -- puffed while playing a practice round despite the city's ban on smoking at public golf courses. Pictures were published in the San Francisco Chronicle of the 46-year-old flouting the rules, a move which prompted city officials to request the PGA Tour to remind Jordan of the law. ""It was sort of a gentle nudge reminding them that smoking is illegal and that we would appreciate their support,"" Recreation and Park General Manager Phil Ginsburg told the Chronicle. The breaking of the smoking ban carries a $100 fine, however, Matt Dorsey, the spokesman for City Attorney Dennis Herrera, told the newspaper: ""Just don't expect me to ask him for it."" Fred Couples invited Jordan to be an honorary assistant captain at the Presidents Cup, and the Hall of Famer spoke to reporters on Monday about his smoking.

British Open champion Stewart Cink backed Jordan despite the outcry suggesting the cigar was unlit: ""The tobacco usage did become a little bit of a story out there, because I saw Michael with a cigar in his mouth that was unlit. ""He's trying to set a good example for the rest of the people who see on TV what we are doing out there, just try to set a good example and try to chew his tobacco instead of smoke it.""","Presidents Cup golf tournament is being held at the Harding Park course .

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN)  -- There's more to wearing the ""niqab"" -- the austere, all-covering veil favored by ultra-religious Muslim women -- than meets the eye. Cairo University students wearing niqab stand outside a university dormitory on Oct. 7 unable to enter due to the new rules preventing admission to niqab wearers. A recent declaration by a leading Egyptian cleric that women will not be allowed to wear the niqab in university areas frequented only by women has sparked demonstrations by female students in Cairo determined to wear the all-encompassing veil wherever they go. Egypt's Al-Azhar university, the highest seat of Sunni Islam, recently convened an all-male committee to rule on what women can wear at Egypt's public universities. The Shaikh of Al-Azhar, Shaikh Tantawi, announced after the meeting that a ban on the niqab, also known as the burqa, would apply to such university areas as female dormitories and all-women classes. Do you think Muslim women should wear the niqab? Tell us below in the SoundOff box . Even though that was a step down from a statement he made earlier that the niqab would be banned in all public universities, his ruling sparked controversy with the growing number of women in the country who choose to stay covered. The initiative from Al-Azhar is seen by many in Egypt as an attempt to counter the growing appeal of the strictest interpretations of Islam. An increasing number of young women in Egypt are turning to the niqab. The niqab is worn by many Muslim women throughout the Arab world and beyond and is most common in the countries of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. It is also commonly worn in Pakistan. ""The niqab should be worn under two circumstances,"" a cleaning lady who works at Al-Azhar, told CNN recently. ""A very beautiful woman should wear it to prevent men from fighting over her, and an ugly woman should wear it to hide her face."" There is no consensus among Muslim scholars regarding the wearing of the niqab, the piece of cloth that covers a Muslim woman's face. Women who wear it usually also cover their hands. It is widely believed to be a tradition that comes from the Arabian peninsula, introduced to more liberal countries like Egypt by people who have lived and worked in ultra-conservative countries like Saudi Arabia. There's not much about it in the Koran, Muslim's holy book. The Koranic verse that applies to female head covering translates loosely as:  ""O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks all over their bodies."" And so consequently, there are plenty of interpretations. And all sorts of opinions in the Egyptian parliament. The opposition-led Muslim Brotherhood opposes the niqab ban. ""It's unacceptable that the niqab is treated as something bad that needs to be suppressed,"" Brotherhood member of parliament Muhamed Baltagi told CNN. ""It's unacceptable to violate private matters in this way."" In Baltagi's opinion, it's a matter of personal choice and should not be dictated by the shaikh of Al-Azhar. Appointed by the president of Egypt, the shaikh of Al-Azhar is viewed as little more than an appendage of the authoritarian Egyptian government, and thus scorned as a state puppet by both religious and secular critics of the regime. Since the 1960s the shaikh of Al-Azhar has been appointed by the Egyptian president. In Europe, wearing the niqab has become a controversial issue too. Recently, French President Nicolas Sarkozy banned it from French classrooms. And British Justice Minister Jack Straw also recently asked women to remove them in his consituency office. In Cairo's main shopping district, the message on the niqab is decidedly mixed. The few niqabs on display are vastly outnumbered by far more risque outfits, including no shortage of mannequins sporting evening dressings with plunging necklines and naked arms. There are a few niqabs on display, but lots of less conservative clothing is on the shelves too. Outside Cairo University, some women go without any head covering at all. Most wear headscarves -- usually quite colorful ones. Those who choose to wear the niqab say the religious scholars should have asked a woman what she thought of the ban first. ""He should have taken at least one woman's opinion,"" said student Muna Abdel Fatah. ""Because the decision will impact on her."" Daniela Deane contributed to this story.","Recent ban on wearing the all-encompassing veil sparked demonstrations .

"(CNN) -- The space shuttle Endeavour docked with the international space station early Wednesday, completing a three-day orbital chase. ""Capture confirmed,"" the Johnson Space Center in Houston said at 12:06 a.m. ET. The delicate docking maneuver took place while both spacecraft were circling the globe at about 17,500 mph (28,165 km/h). Endeavour lifted off from Kennedy Space Center early Monday. During the two-week mission, the six-member crew will deliver an Italian-built Tranquility node and a seven-windowed cupola to the station, which will be used as a control room for robotics. The mission also will include three spacewalks. The space station will be about 90 percent complete once the node and cupola are added, NASA said.","Shuttle docked at 12:06 a.m. ET, according to the Johnson Space Center in Houston .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- If you stared at empty seats around your Thanksgiving dinner table, Robert DeNiro's newest film could help. Parents who want their kids home for Christmas may do well by persuading them to see ""Everybody's Fine,"" which opens next Friday in U.S. theaters. ""I'm hoping it might catch the moment, and it might catch the Christmas spirit and the Thanksgiving spirit,"" director-writer Kirk Jones told CNN over coffee in Hollywood. The movie is targeted at people with parents, brothers, sisters or children, Jones said. ""Pretty much everyone,"" Jones said. ""It's about family."" The story centers around a cross-country journey by DeNiro's character struggling to bring together his grown children for Christmas, several months after their mother's death. DeNiro reveals a sensitive, aging father who imagines that ""everybody's fine"" -- a solace for his lonely suffering. Each stop reveals how his wife had sheltered him from bad news about his kids -- played by Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell -- and how they did not know how to communicate honestly with him. His children were not living the lives he had fantasized for them. ""It's easier not to face up to the truth,"" Jones said. Audiences emerged from preview screenings thinking about their own parents or children, Jones said. ""People are coming out of the movie, almost without exception, saying 'I've got to ring my mom, I've got to ring my dad,'"" Jones said. The strongest reactions have come from people between 24 and 35, many of whom told Jones he's ""scratched a nerve,"" he said. ""They were saying 'That's me. That's my dad. Those are my parents.'"" ""Most people have got regrets,"" he said. ""When they leave their parents, everyone looks back and thinks, 'I should have invited them on holiday with us that time or I should have made it that weekend or I should have just called them more often.'"" It's a remake of Giuseppe Tornatore's 1990 Italian film ""Stanno Tutti Bene"" -- English translation: Everybody's Fine. But Jones, a British director best known as the writer-director of the 1998 surprise hit ""Waking Ned Devine,"" made this into an American story. Jones took his own trip for inspiration before writing the screenplay, traveling by train and bus across the United States. He realized the telephone wires he saw, stretching from pole to pole for hundreds of miles along the tracks and highways, serve as a metaphor for his story. ""It's like a wave, a musical rhythm,"" Jones said. Frank -- DeNiro's character -- spent his life manufacturing the protective coating for the telephone lines. ""He protected the line of communication,"" Jones said. But decades of exposure to the chemicals made him ill, as did his years of insulation from honest communications with his family. ""The irony is, when he's traveling, the children are talking about him through his wires,"" Jones said. A personal irony for the director is that, for the 14 months Jones was making this movie about family togetherness in the United States, he was away from his own family in England.","""Everybody's Fine"" is targeted at ""pretty much everyone,"" director Kirk Jones told CNN .

"(CNN) -- This is always a frightful time of year, but this year it got a bit scarier. You may have been prematurely spooked by an ""illegal alien"" costume threatening Halloween thrill seekers with an extraterrestrial countenance, orange prison garb and a green card. There's also a version with a baseball cap and droopy moustache. Frankly, I'm surprised the manufacturer, Forum Novelties, is not offering other stereotypical accessories, like low-rider flying saucers and glow-in-the-dark lawn mowers. The costume reflects ominous trends: the deterioration of the immigration debate, the rise of anti-immigrant hostility as a form of racism and the need for greater empathy to bridge the gap between those who view such attacks as harmless humor and those who are demeaned and hurt by them. According to a CNN.com article: ""Political satire and Halloween often merge. Costumes depicting former well-known political figures are often seen alongside those depicting Batman or Wonder Woman."" But what if the inspiration for the satire is a group of disenfranchised people? When is a costume clever and funny and when is it an expression of uglier truths inside us? The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, California, joined the League of United Latin American Citizens and the United Farm Workers of America in condemning the costume, calling on retailers to drop it. Target was among those stores that quickly stopped selling it, while others, including BuyCostumes.com, chose ""trick"" over ""treat."" ""Wearing this costume shows poor taste and ignores the painful reality -- for millions of immigrants who must live through constant taunting,  discrimination and now mocking,""  the Coalition's director of communications, Jorge-Mario Cabrera, told me. ""The costume is a sign of the decaying dialogue on immigrants as a community in the U.S."" Dreadfully, this costume contest also illuminates the evolution of discrimination in America. The Pew Research Center recently reported that 55 percent of adults say ""there are 'very strong' or 'strong' conflicts between immigrants and people born in the United States"" while ""39 percent believe there are serious conflicts between blacks and whites."" The Pew report concludes that: ""Disagreements between immigrants and native-born Americans emerge as the most prevalent and serious type of social conflict."" What we are witnessing this season is a metamorphosis of racism, from anti-black to anti-immigrant. It's like Darth Vader slipping into Voldemort gear. Still spine-chilling. But not all trick-or-treaters are repulsed by the specter of prejudice masquerading as freedom-loving, tongue-in-cheek revelry. William Gheen, of Americans for Legal Immigration, said he is buying the costume. ""The only people getting upset are the hypersensitive, over-politically correct, pro-amnesty, illegal alien-supporting nuts."" he said. ""You can't attack people's freedom in this country."" This reaction highlights the polarization of the immigration debate in America and the widely divergent views on discrimination among different social groups. According to the Pew survey, blacks, Latinos and women are significantly more likely than whites and men to say major conflicts exist between groups. Some of the widest perception gaps exist between blacks and whites on whether black/white conflict persists: 53 percent of blacks said ""yes"" compared with 35 percent of whites. Gaps also exist between Latinos and whites on whether conflict exists between immigrants and native-born Americans: 68 percent of Latinos said ""yes"" compared with 53 percent of whites. It's interesting that racism and immigration-related conflict is most perceived by those experiencing its negative effects rather than those either perpetrating the prejudices or simply floating through life oblivious to them. What may be dismissed as a non-issue or joke by some tastes bitterly like insult and injury to others. It depends on who wears the costume and who is the butt of the joke. So before people brandish their right to ridicule and belittle entire ethnic groups, before such frivolous freedoms help stoke anti-immigrant fervor, let's pause and reflect. Just because we have a right doesn't mean we must exercise it. Even if we believe all undocumented immigrants should be shipped back to their nations of origin, we needn't mock their plight or demean their humanity. We don't have to don a costume that strips 12 million people of their dignity just for a few cheap laughs. Which America do we hope to see in the mirror when the Halloween party's over? How about trying to put ourselves in the shoes of that ""illegal alien""? for no matter how you dress it up, it's cruel. So what are you going to be this Halloween? I have this suggestion -- and it goes for manufacturers, retailers, shoppers and activists on all sides of the immigration issue. This year, don't get a costume; get a conscience. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rudy Ruiz.","Rudy Ruiz: ""Illegal alien"" costume has alien's face, wears prison garb, carries green card .
Ruiz: Just because we have a right, we needn't demean people or mock their plight .

"(CNN) -- A polygamist sect member arrested following last year's raid of a west Texas ranch was sentenced Tuesday to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting an underage girl, authorities said. Raymond Jessop was found guilty last week of assaulting a girl under 17, with whom he had entered into a ""spiritual"" marriage, said Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for the state attorney general. Jessop also received an $8,000 fine, said Sheriff David Doran, of Schleicher County, Texas. The victim in the case was one of 400 children seized from the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, in April 2008 by state child welfare workers. The children were returned after the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the state had no right to remove them and lacked evidence to show that they were in danger of abuse. Jessop belongs to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The church -- a 10,000-member offshoot of the mainstream Mormon church -- openly practices polygamy on the ranch, as well as in Arizona and Utah. Critics of the sect say young girls are forced into ""spiritual"" marriages with older men and are sexually abused. Sect members have denied any sexual abuse. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Raymond Jessop sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexual assault of teen ""bride""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Thousands of Muslims gathered Friday on Capitol Hill for a day of prayer that organizers said was intended to inspire American Muslims and non-Muslims alike. People traveled from all over the United States to attend the Capitol Hill event, organizer Abdul Malik said. ""America is not perfect,"" Abdul Malik, an organizer of the event called Islam on Capitol Hill, told the crowd. ""But I will say something it took me my whole adult life to come to: America is not perfect, but I want to tell the truth: It is one of the best places in the world to live."" Organizers had hoped that 50,000 people would show up for the Friday afternoon prayer session, which took place at the foot of the U.S. Capitol. There were also anti-Muslim protesters near the event. Earlier, Malik said, ""This is not a protest, it is a day of prayer, of devotion, hoping that we can work ... for the betterment of the world community."" He added, ""We can come together and work together for the common good."" He said that Muslims in the United States have a ""unique responsibility"" and that the event seeks to inspire Muslims and all Americans. ""America represents, still, a beacon of hope,"" he said. Malik said conversations about the event began only a few months ago. ""It's amazing,"" he said. ""The Web site has gotten more than 3 million hits already."" Friday's event was focused on a 1 p.m. prayer, and a reception and banquet were planned afterward. Malik said attendees were traveling from all over the United States -- including Texas, Florida and Georgia -- as well as from other countries, such as Britain and Canada. ""The beautiful thing ... about this, is that we have a good representation of the uniqueness and beauty of what Islam stands for,"" he said. Besides the protesters, the event drew other criticism. Malik said he had received some ""very nasty e-mails."" And one Christian leader warned of a strategy to ""Islamize"" American society. ""It is important for Christians to understand that Friday's Muslim prayer initiative is part of a well-defined strategy to Islamize American society and replace the Bible with the Koran, the cross with the Islamic crescent and the church bells with the Athan [the Muslim call to prayer],"" the Rev.

"(CNN) -- Seiji Ozawa is Asia's most successful conductor, a maestro in a quintessentially Western art form, and a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan. But the affable 74-year-old is used to crossing cultural boundaries. Born in Manchuria during the Japanese occupation - his father a Buddhist, his mother a Presbyterian - he was raised in Tokyo, and greatly influenced by western culture and a Christian upbringing. His love of music was first explored through the church, but later he studied at the Toho School of Music in Tokyo. A career as a pianist was curtailed when the 16-year-old sports-loving Ozawa broke two fingers during a rugby match. From Toho he traveled to Europe and New York to further his studies. It was a steep learning curve where he learnt how to deal first-hand with other cultures and prejudices. ""I have many problem, beginning. Um... maybe now, I don't know, but beginning especially. It was difficult. Some people ask me, 'You came from China, you came from Japan, do you really understand Bach or do you really understand Mozart?'"" he told CNN. After years abroad, his return to Japan in 1962 to conduct the NHK Symphony Orchestra for six months was far from a happy homecoming; the orchestra rebelled and refused to play for him. ""I made mistake, and I think it was too soon [for me] to take a professional orchestra for six months and at the end I think they had enough. ""I think I was a little bit stuck up... I mean, I was conducting the best orchestra in Japan already I'm still 26 or 27. Very young. And I think I'm sure during rehearsal I say something not so nice. And in Japan very bad if conductor say something not so nice. But I learned, so I become more careful and I think I started more studying, so not make mistake. ""But in a way, it may sound very strange, but really it did me good that boycott."" It meant Ozawa explored opportunities outside of Japan, directing festivals and orchestras across Europe, Canada and the U.S. He became musical director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra a post he held for 29 years until 2004. He left Boston for Vienna to embrace a new challenge with the State Opera. As well as the challenge of a new city and repertory, Ozawa believes it was a move that rounded out his musical education, even if he was 68-years-old at the time. When a young conductor his interest in opera had been fostered by his early tutor Herbert von Karajan. ""He said if you don't study this, one half of Mozart you'll never touch and almost 99 percent of Wagner, almost 100 percent of Puccini and Verdi, you know, half of Mozart is gone."" While Ozawa will step down from his position at the Vienna State Opera next summer, he will remain active in directing, conducting and educating the next generation in classical music. ""I have big hope all Asiatic people and countries... everybody love music basically,"" he said. ""Teaching has become, I think, more and more important my life, really.""","Seiji Ozawa was musical director of Boston Symphony Orchestra for 29 years .

"(CNN)  -- Mary Travers of 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary, has died, according to her publicist. She was 72. Mary Travers performs at the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston, Massachusetts. Travers died from side effects of treatment from a bone-marrow transplant after battling leukemia, publicist Heather Lylis said. The singer was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in November 1936 and grew up in New York's Greenwich Village. As a teenager, she performed in a Broadway review, but stepped on to the folk music scene in the 1950s. She emerged as an iconic folk singer while performing with Peter Yarrow and Noel Paul Stookey. Peter, Paul and Mary came together while singing ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" in Stookey's New York City apartment. They went on to play gigs at coffee houses and later on the radio. ""As a performer, her charisma was a barely contained nervous energy -- occasionally (and then only privately) revealed as stage fright,"" Stookey said. Their music reflected the 1960s and the 1970s, a time of turmoil as the civil rights and anti-war movements moved into full swing. Travers applied her recognition to rally behind those progressive movements. In 1963, the trio performed its hit song ""If I Had a Hammer"" at the Washington march where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famed ""I Have a Dream Speech,"" her publicist said. ""We've learned that it will take more than one generation to bring about change,"" Travers once said. ""The fight for civil rights has developed into a broader concern for human rights, and that encompasses a great many people and countries. Those of us who live in a democracy have a responsibility to be the voice for those whose voices are stilled."" Travers advocated against U.S. government moves in Central America in the 1980s. She went on a mission to El Salvador and later spoke out against the country's regime. She also opposed American funding of a militant group in Nicaragua set on overthrowing an elected government there, according to her publicist. Peter, Paul and Mary recorded hits still recognized now, including ""Leaving on a Jet Plane,"" ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" and ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone."" They performed together for nearly 50 years, winning five Grammys and releasing 13 Top 40 hits, six of them in the Top 10 charts. Their debut album, ""Peter, Paul and Mary"" was on the Top 10 chart for 10 months. Travers also recorded four solo albums in the 1970s. ""Her talent was huge ... Mary was the difference maker,"" said Joe Smith, former head of Warner Brothers Records. ""Super bright, super talented, and a pleasure to know and work with."" Their last performance was in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on May 20. Those closest to Travers say she valued her friendships. ""Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of my relationship with Mary Travers over the last almost 50 years is how open and honest we were with each other, and I include Noel Paul Stookey in this equation,"" Yarrow said in a statement. ""Such honesty comes with a price, but when you get past the hurt and shock of realizing that you're faulted and frequently wrong, you also realize that you are really loved and respected for who you are, and you become a better person."" She is survived by her husband, Ethan Robbins; her daughters Alicia and Erika; her sister, Ann Gordon; and her granddaughters Wylie and Virginia.","Mary Travers was a member of the 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pilot error was to blame in the April 2006 crash of an unmanned aircraft, despite the fact no pilot was on board, the National Transportation Safety Board said in its accident report issued Tuesday -- the NTSB's first-ever investigation into an incident involving a drone. A drone similar to this one crashed near Nogales, Arizona, on April 25, 2006. The agency also issued 22 safety recommendations for unmanned aircraft. It ""is an indication of the scope of the safety issues these unmanned aircraft are bringing into the National Airspace System,"" NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said in a statement. The unmanned aerial vehicles have been touted as a possible solution to several issues facing the United States, from drug trafficking to illegal border crossings. But, as the NTSB report shows, integrating them into the nation's airspace raises questions regarding their safety status -- and whether they should be held to a different standard than manned aircraft. On April 25, 2006, a turboprop-powered Predator B, operated on a surveillance mission by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, crashed in a sparsely-populated area near Nogales, Arizona. There were no injuries, but the aircraft, which has a 66-foot wingspan, was ""substantially damaged,"" the NTSB said. The probable cause of the accident was the failure of the pilot -- who was operating the aircraft remotely -- to follow checklist procedures when switching operational control from a console that had locked up, the agency said. That resulted in the fuel valve's being inadvertently shut off and a total loss of engine power to the aircraft. Another cause, the NTSB said, was the lack of a flight instructor in the ground control station. But in a meeting Tuesday, the board highlighted areas of interest including the design and certification of unmanned aircraft; pilot qualification and training; and audio records of all UAV operations-related communications, among others. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn't require a pilot's certificate to operate a drone. ""This investigation has raised questions about the different standards for manned and unmanned aircraft and the safety implications of this discrepancy,"" Rosenker said in the statement. ""Why, for example, were numerous unresolved lock-ups of the pilot's control console even possible while such conditions would never be tolerated in the cockpit of a manned aircraft?"" The pilot, the NTSB noted, was not proficient in emergency procedures. ""The pilot is still the pilot, whether he is at a remote console or on the flight deck,"" Rosenker said. ""We need to make sure that the system by which pilots are trained and readied for flight is rigorous and thorough. With the potential for thousands of these unmanned aircraft in use years from now, the standards for pilot training need to be set high to ensure that those on the ground and other users of the airspace are not put in jeopardy."" Also, there is no equivalent of a cockpit voice recorder at a pilot console, the board said, and the pilot's communication with air traffic controllers and others was not recorded. The NTSB has recommended the FAA require all conversations, including telephone conversations, between pilots of unmanned aircraft and others be recorded and retained. Other recommendations, sent to the FAA and Customs and Border Protection, include: . â¢ Requiring all unmanned aircraft operations to report incidents of equipment malfunctions that affect safety to the FAA , and require analysis of the data. â¢ Requiring pilots be trained on the expected performance and flight path of an unmanned aircraft any time communication with the aircraft is lost. â¢ Identifying and correcting the causes of the lockups in the pilot's control console. â¢ Requiring that a backup pilot or another person who can provide an equivalent level of safety as a backup pilot be readily available during the operation of a UAV system. Board members also voted to convene a two- to three-day public forum on the safety of UAV operations and investigative procedures.

"(CNN) -- Winter travelers trek thousands of miles to the frozen north each year seeking the sky's ""dancing lights,"" which provoke awe, excitement and, some say, sex. CNN iReporter Bruce Barrett shot this rare red aurora in Canada's Whitehorse, Yukon. Scientists call the natural phenomenon aurora borealis: cascading beams of greens, yellows, blues, purples or reds -- which paint a breathtaking backdrop across the wilderness and attract thousands of tourists annually. ""Usually it starts slowly as kind of a hazy greenish color -- like a mist -- building up in frequency dancing across the sky ... and to me that's religion,"" said photographer Dave Brosha of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, who's seen more than 100 Canadian auroras. ""It's just one of the most incredible feelings a person can have -- sitting there watching that."" To the west in Canada's Yukon province, tour operator Torsten Eder likes to tell a story about a marriage that was forged under the glowing curtains of light.  See spectacular photos of auroras Â» . ""I had one guy from Mexico, and he wanted to surprise his girlfriend by proposing marriage with a ring under the northern lights,"" said Eder from his office in Whitehorse. ""We got lucky and the lights were visible ... so our guest went down on his knee and proposed to his girlfriend and she was totally blown away. The funny thing was -- she wouldn't wear gloves for the first three days -- so she could show the ring off."" The otherworldly lights also have provided inspiration for almost sacred pilgrimages, Eder said. Guests who said they were going blind or battling cancer told him they wanted to view the auroras at least once in their lives. ""It puts enormous pressure on us,"" said Eder. ""You can't guarantee that the lights will be visible because it's a natural phenomenon."" The display is generally visible at least every three days, he said. Scientists say the northern lights are created by the sun's super hot atmosphere, which blasts particles into the protective magnetic field surrounding the Earth. The magnetic field forces the particles toward the north and south poles. About 60 to 200 miles overhead, the particles bump into the Earth's atmosphere and become electrically ""excited"" -- throwing off light of various colors, said Prof. Dirk Lummerzheim of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. ""The forecast for this winter is a continued quiet sun, in general,"" he said. The sun is on the upswing of an 11-year cycle. ""Maybe we will have a few periods once a month where the aurora can get a little bit more active."" Although the phenomenon occurs around the clock, the lights are only visible at night. The best time of year to see them is during winter, when darkness in the upper latitudes stretches up to 24 hours.  See map where northern lights can be seen Â» . Eder's Northern Tales tour company picks up guests at their hotels about 10 p.m. and takes them to an area about 20 minutes outside Whitehorse's city lights. There, travelers can enjoy nature's colorful show from a heated, walled tent until around 2 a.m. ""We almost take it for granted sometimes,"" said Brosha. ""No matter how many times you've seen the aurora borealis -- when they really dance, when you get some really unique colors -- you just kind of say, 'Wow, I'm so lucky to see that.' "" A warmer way to enjoy the northern lights is a shallow, natural rock lake at Chena Hot Springs outside Fairbanks, Alaska, which allows bikini-clad guests to enjoy the lights in temperatures of 106 degrees Fahrenheit. ""I mean, honestly, it's the best way to see them,"" said spokeswoman Denise Ferree. ""Because you're warm and toasty and you're watching the northern lights above."" Chena's owner, Bernie Karl -- who's often as colorful as the lights themselves -- said the auroras sometimes spark the libido. ""Having sex under the northern lights -- it's an awesome experience,"" Karl said. ""Have you ever been out in nature at 35 below zero with northern lights bouncing over your head and your bare ass? Well, you need to try it."" If the hot springs aren't for you, Chena also takes guests up a nearby mountain to observe the auroras from heated Mongolian-style tents called yurts. The resort prides itself on its environmental initiative, which has led to the generation of clean electricity from geothermal heat produced by the hot spring. ""Iceland is probably one of the best places to see the northern lights,"" said Reykjavik tour guide Arni Magnusson of AM Tours. That's especially true as the U.S. dollar gains value against the Icelandic krona -- offering some attractive hotel and shopping opportunities. Guests are picked up at their hotel for a 20-minute drive outside the city to view the lights from higher elevations. ""People say they feel closer to Earth and to the forces of nature,"" said Magnusson. ""The lights totally overwhelm them."" Dan Hershman's life changed dramatically after he photographed a spectacular aurora in Washington state in 2000, which was a peak year in the solar cycle. ""These things are just dynamic and they seem just alive and organic,"" said Hershman, who at the time was a high school music teacher. The photo was unique enough to attract the attention of NASA, which ran the image on its Web site, Hershman said. This spurred his interest in photography and soon, as Hershman put it, ""my hobby became my profession and my profession became my hobby."" Now Hershman performs as principal bassoonist in local orchestras as a hobby -- and he teaches high school photography in Federal Way, Washington, as his profession. The trick to photographing the auroras, Hershman said, is choosing to take the picture when the lights aren't moving as much. ""Otherwise it looks like nothing but a big blob,"" he said. IF YOU GO .

"(CNN) -- Do not go backstage at Cirque Du Soleil. It will only hurt your self-esteem. Anthony Gatto says he's been in training since he was 3 years old and performing since he was 8. In the performers' tent for the touring show ""Kooza,"" there are the chiseled men catapulting their partners onto each other's shoulders from a giant see-saw and the woman doing contortions on children's-sized blocks. You can only take so much of this before your ego needs normal. Normal might be that man in the corner, wearing a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers throwing balls in the air. How hard can that be? Your self-worth will be quickly dashed again when the man picks up a soccer ball, bounces it on his head and jumps rope at the same time. Moments later, he's juggling six or seven orange rings (they move so fast, it looks like a blur) and then does a pirouette -- while all the rings are in the air -- and then catches them on his arm.  Watch the juggler in action Â» . You could say Anthony Gatto went into the family business. But his stepfather wasn't a farmer or a doctor. He was a juggler. ""By the time I was 8, I was entered into a juggling competition, and incidentally, that was the same competition that Patrick Dempsey, the actor, was in,"" Gatto said. ""He used to be a juggler. We competed against each other. I took first, he took second. Now he's a big actor and here I am, juggling."" Gatto is being modest. In fact, he didn't audition for ""Kooza."" The show went looking for him. ""I have right now 11 juggling world records,"" he said. ""Some of them I've held since I was 16 years old and they have yet to be beaten."" Imagine a wearable disco ball. That's not too different from the form-fitting outfit Gatto wears onstage. Backstage, it's a long-sleeve T-shirt, gym shorts and sneakers. But there's nothing casual about his daily routine. He typically works out and practices six to seven hours a day to prepare for his 10 minutes in the spotlight. In fact, he is practicing until moments before he runs on stage. ""Juggling is something that is so delicate, you have to have a really good feel, you can lose that in minutes,"" he said. ""There are so many variables that can affect you. If it's a humid day, it's a very difficult task to get through the number that I do. The wind, if there's any air current in there and you're expecting to catch a ring and it blows an inch, you miss it."" But he rarely misses -- at least not in his act. This performer, who relies on coordination and concentration 350 shows a year, admits his most embarrassing moment has nothing to do with balls, clubs or rings. It's acting that trips him up. ""I have fallen as the delivery-man character in the show. In fact, I have done this a few times,"" he said. ""I like to think it's because I put my heart and soul into the characters I'm portraying."" Surrounded by all this talent and precision, there is some comfort in knowing one of the best -- maybe the best juggler in the world -- is also a klutz.","Cirque Du Soleil's ""Kooza"" went looking for juggler with 11 world records .

"(CNN) -- Scientists have discovered the first confirmed Earthlike planet outside our solar system, they announced Wednesday. An artist's impression shows what the planet may look like in close orbit with its sun. ""This is the first confirmed rocky planet in another system,"" astronomer Artie Hatzes told CNN, contrasting the solid planet with gaseous ones like Jupiter and Saturn. But ""Earthlike"" is a relative term. The planet's composition may be similar to that of Earth, but its environment is more like a vision of hell, the project's lead astronomer said. It is so close to the star it orbits ""that the place may well look like Dante's Inferno, with a probable temperature on its 'day face' above 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius) and minus-328 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 200 degrees Celsius) on its night face,"" said Didier Queloz of Geneva Observatory in Switzerland, the project leader. Hatzes, explaining that one side of the body is always facing the star and the other side always faces away, said the side ""facing the sun is probably molten. The other side could actually have ice"" if there is water on the planet. ""We think it has no atmosphere to redistribute the heat,"" Hatzes told CNN from Barcelona, Spain, where he is attending the ""Pathways Towards Habitable Planets"" conference. The astronomers were stunned to find a rocky planet so near a star, he said. ""We would have never dreamed you would find a rocky planet so close,"" he said. ""Its year is less than one of our days."" The planet, known as CoRoT-7b, was detected early last year, but it took months of observation to determine that it had a composition roughly similar to Earth's, the European Southern Observatory said in a statement. Astronomers were able to measure the dimensions of the planet by watching as it passed in front of the star it orbits, then carried out 70 hours of study of the planet's effect on its star to infer its weight. With that information in hand, they were able to calculate its density -- and were thrilled with what they found, Hatzes said. ""What makes this exciting is you compare the density of this planet to the planets in our solar system, it's only Mercury, Venus and Earth that are similar,"" Hatzes, of the Thuringer observatory in Germany, told CNN. They were helped by the fact that CoRoT-7b is relatively close to Earth -- about 500 light years away, in the constellation of Monoceros, the Unicorn. ""It's in our solar neighborhood,"" Hatzes said. ""The thing that made it easier is it's relatively close, so it's relatively bright. If this star was much much farther away, we wouldn't have been able to do these measurements."" At about five times Earth's mass (though not quite twice as large in circumference), it is the smallest planet ever spotted outside our solar system. It also has the fastest orbit. The planet whizzes around its star more than seven times faster than Earth moves, and is 23 times closer to the star than Mercury is to our sun. The planet was first detected early in 2008 by the CoRoT satellite, a 30-centimeter space telescope launched by the European Space Agency in December 2006, specifically with the mission of detecting rocky planets outside the solar system. At least 42 scientists at 17 institutions on three continents worked on the project. They are publishing their findings in a special issue of the Astronomy and Astrophysics journal on October 22 as ""The CoRoT-7 Planetary System: Two Orbiting Super-Earths.""","The planet, known as CoRoT-7b, was detected early last year .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- A defense lawyer for Amanda Knox made an impassioned plea to the jury Wednesday as the high-profile case neared its conclusion. Knox is the American student accused of killing her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, at the villa they shared in Italy. ""We suffer at the memory of Meredith. But we look at the future of Amanda,"" Luciano Ghirga said in his defense summation. ""Meredith was my friend,"" he quoted Knox as saying, rejecting the notion that she hated her roommate, who was fatally stabbed in November 2007. Prosecutors say Kercher died during a twisted sex game in which Knox taunted Kercher, and two men -- Knox's then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 26, and acquaintance Rudy Guede -- sexually assaulted her. The prosecution says a knife found in Sollecito's house had Knox's DNA on the handle and Kercher's on the blade, among other pieces of evidence. But Ghirga rejected the accusations against Knox on Wednesday. He attacked the way police and prosecutors had treated the defendant, giving them a symbolic ""red card"" -- a referee's sign in soccer that a player is being expelled from the game for breaking the rules. Ghirga concluded an emotional oration -- sobbing as he came to the end -- by asking the judge and jury to acquit Knox, because her mother asked him to request it, because her family asked it. Knox's father, Curt, said Wednesday she had been a victim of ""character assassination,"" and expressed hope she would be found not guilty. Members of Kercher's family have declined repeated CNN requests for comment on the case. But prosecutor Giuliano Mignini accused the defense of ""lynching"" the Italian police who worked on the case. He defended the work of the police and the credibility of the prosecution witnesses as he responded to Ghirga's arguments Wednesday. And he called again for life sentences for Knox and Sollecito if they are found guilty. Italy does not have the death penalty. The jury is expected to begin deliberations on Friday, after the prosecution completes its summary. Another Knox attorney on Tuesday said the prosecution's theory doesn't fit the facts of the case and there is not sufficient evidence to find her guilty. Calling Knox a victim herself, Carlo della Vedova said the police had rushed to judgment following the murder, leaving Knox to fend off a myriad of false media reports regarding the crime. The lawyer showed photos published in the media, purportedly showing the crime scene, that weren't authentic -- including a photo of the bathroom -- and said false allegations and rumors about Knox's character created a bias from the start. Della Vedova also questioned the change in what prosecutor Mignini said was the motive for the murder. In preliminary hearings, Mignini argued Knox, Sollecito and Guede slashed Kercher's throat during a sexual misadventure as the two men vied for Knox's attention. In recent days, Mignini has focused more on what he says was a hatred between the two roommates. Defense lawyers have staunchly disagreed, claiming the two women were friends. Ghirga on Wednesday said the two had gone to a chocolate festival together days before Kercher was killed. The defense has argued that Guede, who was convicted in a separate fast-track trial and is currently appealing his conviction, was the sole killer.  The defense has said there is no evidence tying the three suspects together or proving they planned Kercher's murder. Della Vedova also focused during closing arguments on the lack of evidence tying Knox to the crime scene. As defense lawyers have throughout the entire trial, he cast doubt on DNA evidence that prosecutors claim shows Knox's DNA on the handle of the alleged murder weapon. The defense has said the knife doesn't match Kercher's wounds or an imprint of the knife left on a bedsheet, and the DNA sample is too small to be conclusive. During the first day of closing arguments for Knox's lawyers, della Vedova stressed to the eight-member jury that they should also keep church law in mind as they decide whether to find Knox and Sollecito guilty or not guilty. He told the jury they needed to be ""morally certain of their decision."" ""If you have the minimum of doubts, you must absolve this young girl -- a girl that is merely 22 years old,"" he said. Knox and Sollecito, who both deny any role in the murder, have been jailed for more than two years since they were arrested on charges of murder and sexual violence. Their trial began in January.

"(CNN) -- A celebrity gossip Web site has caught Maria Shriver a third time apparently violating California's law against using a cell phone while driving. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says ""swift action"" will be taken on wife Maria Shriver's driving ""violations."" Web site TMZ posted a 17-second video Tuesday showing the California first lady apparently speaking into a cell phone while turning a corner in Brentwood in a black SUV. She puts the phone down part way through the video, but it's not clear whether she did so because she had finished her conversation or because she noticed cameras following her. The site also photographed Shriver allegedly chatting while driving on Sunday and on June 12. Shriver's husband, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, last year supported and signed into law a ban on using handheld communication devices while driving. Enforcement of the ban began July 1, 2008; it carries a $20 fine for a first violation; $50 for each subsequent offense. A similar law banning texting while driving took effect January 1 this year. Watch Shriver driving while on her cell phone . By the end of September, the California Highway Patrol had issued tickets for about 150,000 cell phone infractions, said Chris Cochran, spokesman for the California Office of Traffic Safety. No one keeps track of infractions cited by county and local departments, he said.  See where laws limit cell phone use in cars Â» . Shriver has not been cited. In Los Angeles County, where Brentwood is, the Superior Court has set the cost at about $93 for the first ticket and $201 for the next one, meaning Shriver would owe at least $300 in fines and court fees had she been caught by police, CNN affiliate KTLA-TV reported. On Tuesday, Schwarzenegger sent a Twitter message to TMZ editor Harvey Levin: ""Thanks for bringing her violations to my attention. There's going to be swift action."" What that action might entail was not specified. Shriver on Wednesday issued an apology: . ""I'm sorry,"" she said in a statement. ""I will be donating my favorite old cell phone to my Women's Conference partner Verizon through their HopeLine program that helps domestic violence shelters. I invite anyone else who wants to recycle their old phone to join me. That's my version of swift action with a higher purpose."" The traffic office referred questions about Shriver to the governor's office, which declined to comment. ""We don't really think that hand-held bans have a whole lot of impact,"" said Jonathan Adkins, spokesman for the Governors Highway Safety Association in Washington. The association urges drivers not to use phones, including hands-free devices, while driving, but does not support laws banning them, he said. The attention to Shriver ""alludes to a bigger problem, and that's the fact that everybody does it,"" Adkins said. ""Not only are public officials doing it, but we have to educate the highway safety community. ... Cops frequently are on their cell phones when they drive. ""The Shriver case really underscores the scope of the problem. We have a lot of educating to do."" Shriver's most recent alleged violations come on the heels of AAA Northern California's ""Heads Up Driving Week,"" during which the auto club urged motorists to get in the habit of driving without distractions such as cell phones, fast food and tuning the stereo. ""We hope that by driving distraction-free for a week, people can pick up the habit for life,"" AAA spokesman Matt Skryja said in a news release. Seven states and the District of Columbia ban all handheld cell phone use by drivers. Several other states allow localities to set their own limits on cell phone use.","NEW: Shriver apologizes and says she will donate her cell phone to charity .

"(CNN) -- Manager Jose Mourinho was sent off as Italian leaders Inter Milan crashed to a 2-1 defeat at title hopefuls Juventus on Saturday night. Second-placed AC Milan are now four points adrift of their city rivals after a 3-0 home crushing of Sampdoria, who remained in fifth. Ten-man Juve went third, five points behind Inter, after ending the defending champions' eight-match unbeaten run in Serie A. Brazil midfielder Felipe Melo was credited with the 20th-minute opening goal in Turin as he deflected in a free-kick from compatriot Diego, and Mourinho was ordered from the dugout following his protestations about the foul being awarded in the first place. Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o leveled six minutes later with a header from Dejan Stankovic's cross, but new Italy international Claudio Marchisio gave the home side victory in the 58th minute after goalkeeper Julio Cesar blocked a shot by midfielder Mohamed Sissoko. Melo was sent off with three minutes left for his second yellow card after aiming an elbow at Mario Balotelli, who was also booked for his theatrical reaction. The defeat was a blow to Inter's confidence ahead of Wednesday's Champions League showdown with Russia's Rubin Kazan at the San Siro, with the winner earning a place in the knockout stages. AC Milan scored all three goals in the first half as striker Marco Borriello, who used to play for Sampdoria's city rivals Genoa, headed the opener in the first minute from Ronaldinho's cross. The Brazilian was in fine form, and also set up the second goal for Clarence Seedorf in the 21st minute as he threaded a neat pass to the veteran Dutch midfielder. Ronaldinho's compatriot Alexandre Pato made it 3-0 just two minutes later with his seventh goal of the season, netting at the second attempt after goalkeeper Luca Castellazzi blocked his initial effort following a header on by Borriello. It was Milan's fifth successive victory, with coach Leonardo taking Ronaldinho off at halftime as a precaution due to a slight knee problem ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to FC Zurich, which will determine whether the Rossoneri qualify for the knockout stages. Sampdoria slumped to a third defeat in a week, having been knocked out of the Italian Cup by lowly Livorno in midweek following the embarrassing 3-0 derby defeat to Genoa last weekend.","Jose Mourinho sent off as Italian leaders Inter Milan lose 2-1 at Juventus .

"(CNN) -- With all of the recent deadly storms in the news, it may seem has though this year as been more active than a normal year. Since September 1 we have seen eight tropical cyclones, five of which became typhoons, two reaching Super Typhoon status, the strongest classification of tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific. A Philippines scientist points to a screen monitoring Tropical Storm Parma and Typhoon Melor. But when we look at the numbers, 2009 has actually been slightly below average. So far we have seen 19 tropical storms in the Western Pacific, which is slightly behind the pace needed to reach the yearly average of 27. Named storms, however, are a notoriously poor metric for measuring the ferocity of tropical seasons. Take this year in the North Atlantic for instance. Yesterday, Tropical Storm Henri became the eighth named storm, coming only a week after the National Hurricane Center would normally name the eighth storm on an average year. So while 2009 may contain an average number of storms, no one will argue that 2009 has so far been a dud of a hurricane season in the Atlantic. This is largely due to the fact a majority of the storms so far this season have been weak, short-lived, and not made landfall (Tropical Storm Grace did not even last one day). A better way to measure hurricane and typhoon seasons is with Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE), a surprisingly simple mathematic calculation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a U.S. scientific agency that studies oceans and the atmosphere, uses ACE to approximate the energy contained in each cyclone. ACE is continuously monitored all around the globe by Ryan Maue, a doctoral student at Florida State University, and according to Maue's numbers the West Pacific is 20 percent below average for the season. For comparison, the North Atlantic is 50 percent below average for the year. Go here to see Maue's research . Despite the fact that 2009 has been below average for the season, the past month has been remarkable, with five of the eight storms making direct landfall in Asia. Typhoon Melor made landfall in central Japan early Thursday. In the Philippines, people are still recovering after two typhoons hit the nation in less than two weeks. Typhoon Parma made landfall last weekend, killing at least 16. Filipinos were still recovering from Typhoon Ketsana, which hit the country in late September. Hundreds of people were killed from that storm, primarily in the Philippines and Vietnam. Earlier in the summer, more than 600 people died in Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot struck in August. Also in August, Typhoon Etau killed more than a dozen in Taiwan after it brought flash floods and landslides. What is behind this recent uptick in activity and why are all the storms seemingly coming at once, and late in the season? The answer may be El Nino, which refers to a periodic change in the atmosphere and ocean in the Pacific. During El Nino, the waters in the central and eastern Pacific are warmer than normal, and the effects on global weather can be drastic and far-reaching. According to Maue, we see more cyclones later in the season during El Nino years in the Western Pacific, and they tend to form farther east. With the warmer sea surface temperatures during an El Nino event, this would allow these storms more time over open water to grow into large and powerful typhoons. In fact, we tend to see more ""Super Typhoons"" during El Nino years, and this is true again this year, as Choi-Wan and Melor both reached Super Typhoon status. El Nino also is a likely culprit for the inactivity in the North Atlantic, since El Nino can cause more wind shear in the upper atmosphere, a condition that limits the ability of Tropical Cyclones to survive.","Spate of deadly storms have hit East Asia in recent weeks .

"Washington (CNN) -- Six days before the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed a joint meeting of Congress on Tuesday and challenged U.S. lawmakers to tear down other walls. ""Today's generation needs to prove that it can meet the challenges of the 21st century. In a sense, we are able to tear down walls of today,"" she said. What that means, Merkel said, is ""creating freedom and security, creating prosperity and justice. And it means protecting our planet."" Merkel, the first German chancellor to address a joint meeting of Congress, emphasized the need for an agreement on global warming. ""Icebergs are melting in the Arctic. In Africa, people become refugees because their environment has been destroyed,"" she said. ""We need an agreement on one objective: Global warming must not exceed 2 degrees Celsius."" She said she hopes that agreement will be reached at a the climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, next month. Merkel also touched on the global financial crisis, saying that the ""near collapse of the markets has shown what happens when there is no underpinning order."" ""A globalized economy needs a global order ... a global framework of rules,"" she said. ""Without global rules and transparency and supervision, we will not gain more freedom, but rather risk the abuse of freedom and thus risk instability."" Merkel also recalled her years in East Germany before the wall fell. The United States, ""the land of unlimited opportunity was for me, for a long time, impossible to reach,"" she said. ""The wall, barbed wire and the order to shoot at those who tried to leave limited my access to the free world,"" she said. Merkel said she and her countrymen owed the United States for its friendship and support. ""To put it in just one sentence, I know, we Germans know, how much we owe to you, our American friends, and I personally shall never ever forget this,"" she said. Earlier, President Obama welcomed Merkel and thanked her for her country's ""sacrifice"" in Afghanistan. He also called her a leader on the issue of climate change. He said her opportunity to speak to the joint meeting of Congress was a ""great honor."" ""It is, I think, a very appropriate honor that's been bestowed on Chancellor Merkel,"" he said. In 1957, German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer addressed the House and Senate separately, Merkel said.","Angela Merkel is first German chancellor to address a joint meeting of Congress .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- He got a standing ovation before the orchestra even played a single note. Gustavo Dudamel has been compared to the legendary Leonard Bernstein by one critic. For weeks now, anticipation has been growing for the arrival of fiery young Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel to take over the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the crowd couldn't wait to roar its approval at his arrival. Dudamel, 28, engenders a passion among music lovers that is entirely new to the world of classical music. Tickets for his Saturday debut as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic disappeared within minutes -- the fastest sellout in the history of the 18,000-seat Hollywood Bowl. ""He is a phenomenon,"" said Mark Swed, Los Angeles Times music critic. ""He generates excitement the likes of which hasn't come around in a very, very long time -- maybe since Leonard Bernstein.""  Watch the exciting Dudamel wield the baton Â» . Swed was in the audience two years ago when Dudamel conducted the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, delivering a reading of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony that left fans delirious. ""I haven't seen that kind of reaction from a crowd since I saw the Beatles at Dodger Stadium,"" Swed said. Dudamel's face has been a common sight for months in Los Angeles. His billboards look down on freeway commuters. He adorns city buses. At the famous Hollywood hot dog stand Pink's, there is even a dog named in his honor -- the ""Dude Dog,"" piled high with jalapeno peppers, guacamole and tortilla chips. While it's not exactly Venezuelan cuisine, in Los Angeles, there can be no surer sign that the conductor known as ""The Dude"" has arrived. So where did Dudamel get this musical magic? He said at least a part of his talent is inherited. ""I started studying music when I was 4,"" he said. ""I wanted to play trombone like my father."" Soon young Gustavo entered into El Sistema, Venezuela's state-financed music education program. Hundreds of thousands of children have received instruments and music instruction through the nation's massive system of youth orchestras. ""You cannot imagine,"" said Dudamel, ""how it changes the life of a kid if you put a violin or a cello or a flute [in his hand]. You feel you have your world. You have your life there, and it changes your life. This happened to me."" As music director of the philharmonic, Dudamel said he hopes to spread a little of the El Sistema magic in Los Angeles. He already has organized one youth orchestra in the run-down neighborhoods of south Los Angeles. Those music students opened for the orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl. The concert also featured student musicians playing alongside jazz legend Herbie Hancock. Cuban pianist Alfredo Rodriguez and bluesman Taj Mahal rounded out an eclectic bill designed to pull in a broad cross-section of music lovers. But it was Dudamel and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony that brought the crowd to its feet at the concert's end. It was a promising beginning for a man many are hailing as the savior of classical music. They hope Dudamel can bring a whole new audience to symphonic music, and believe the Los Angeles Philharmonic is the perfect podium for the young maestro. ""He fits in with this town in a lot of ways,"" Swed said. ""Obviously being Spanish-speaking in a city where the majority of people either speak Spanish or understand some Spanish ... you know he fits in. The youth culture? He is young. He is also great, which doesn't hurt.""","Gustavo Dudamel, known as ""The Dude,"" brings Beatles-like frenzy to Los Angeles .

"New York (CNN) -- Like most people, I'd given some thought to what meat actually is, but until I became a father and faced the prospect of having to make food choices on someone else's behalf, there was no urgency to get to the bottom of things. I'm a novelist and never had it in mind to write nonfiction. Frankly, I doubt I'll ever do it again. But the subject of animal agriculture, at this moment, is something no one should ignore. As a writer, putting words on the page is how I pay attention. If the way we raise animals for food isn't the most important problem in the world right now, it's arguably the No. 1 cause of global warming: The United Nations reports the livestock business generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all forms of transportation combined. It's the No. 1 cause of animal suffering, a decisive factor in the creation of zoonotic diseases like bird and swine flu, and the list goes on. It is the problem with the most deafening silence surrounding it. Even the most political people, the most thoughtful and engaged, tend not to ""go there."" And for good reason. Going there can be extremely uncomfortable. Food is not just what we put in our mouths to fill up; it is culture and identity. Reason plays some role in our decisions about food, but it's rarely driving the car. We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn't ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts. And although there are many respectable ways to think about meat, there is not a person on Earth whose best instincts would lead him or her to factory farming. My book, ""Eating Animals,"" addresses factory farming from numerous perspectives: animal welfare, the environment, the price paid by rural communities, the economic costs. In two essays, I will share some of what I've learned about how the way we raise animals for food affects human health. What we eat and what we are . Why aren't more people aware of, and angry about, the rates of avoidable food-borne illness? Perhaps it doesn't seem obvious that something is amiss simply because anything that happens all the time -- like meat, especially poultry, becoming infected by pathogens -- tends to fade into the background. Whatever the case, if you know what to look for, the pathogen problem comes into terrifying focus. For example, the next time a friend has a sudden ""flu"" -- what folks sometimes misdescribe as ""the stomach flu"" -- ask a few questions. Was your friend's illness one of those ""24-hour flus"" that come and go quickly: retch or crap, then relief? The diagnosis isn't quite so simple, but if the answer to this question is yes, your friend probably didn't have the flu at all. He or she was probably suffering from one of the 76 million cases of food-borne illness the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated happen in America each year. Your friend didn't ""catch a bug"" so much as eat a bug. And in all likelihood, that bug was created by factory farming. Beyond the sheer number of illnesses linked to factory farming, we know that factory farms are contributing to the growth of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens simply because these farms consume so many antimicrobials. We have to go to a doctor to obtain antibiotics and other antimicrobials as a public-health measure to limit the number of such drugs being taken by humans. We accept this inconvenience because of its medical importance. Microbes eventually adapt to antimicrobials, and we want to make sure it is the truly sick who benefit from the finite number of uses any antimicrobial will have before the microbes learn how to survive it. On a typical factory farm, drugs are fed to animals with every meal. In poultry factory farms, they almost have to be. It's a perfect storm: The animals have been bred to such extremes that sickness is inevitable, and the living conditions promote illness. Industry saw this problem from the beginning, but rather than accept less-productive animals, it compensated for the animals' compromised immunity with drugs. As a result, farmed animals are fed antibiotics nontherapeutically: that is, before they get sick. In the United States, about 3 million pounds of antibiotics are given to humans each year, but a whopping 17.8 million pounds are fed to livestock -- at least, that is what the industry claims. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that the industry underreported its antibiotic use by at least 40 percent. The group calculated that 24.6 million pounds of antibiotics were fed to chickens, pigs and other farmed animals, counting only nontherapeutic uses. And that was in 2001. In other words, for every dose of antibiotics taken by a sick human, eight doses are given to a ""healthy"" animal. The implications for creating drug-resistant pathogens are quite straightforward. Study after study has shown that antimicrobial resistance follows quickly on the heels of the introduction of new drugs on factory farms. For example, in 1995, when the Food and Drug Administration approved fluoroquinolones -- such as Cipro -- for use in chickens against the protest of the Centers for Disease Control, the percentage of bacteria resistant to this powerful new class of antibiotics rose from almost zero to 18 percent by 2002. A broader study in the  New England Journal of Medicine showed an eightfold increase in antimicrobial resistance from 1992 to 1997 and linked this increase to the use of antimicrobials in farmed chickens. As far back as the late 1960s, scientists have warned against the nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in farmed-animal feed. Today, institutions as diverse as the American Medical Association; the Centers for Disease Control; the Institute of Medicine, a division of the National Academy of Sciences; and the World Health Organization have linked nontherapeutic antibiotic use on factory farms with increased antimicrobial resistance and called for a ban. Still, the factory farm industry has effectively opposed such a ban in the United States. And, unsurprisingly, the limited bans in other countries are only a limited solution. There is a glaring reason that the necessary total ban on nontherapeutic use of antibiotics hasn't happened: The factory farm industry, allied with the pharmaceutical industry, has more power than public-health professionals. What is the source of the industry's immense power? We give it to them. We have chosen, unwittingly, to fund this industry on a massive scale by eating factory-farmed animal products. And we do so daily. The same conditions that lead at least 76 million Americans to become ill from their food annually and that promote antimicrobial resistance also contribute to the risk of a pandemic. At a remarkable 2004 conference, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) put their tremendous resources together to evaluate the available information on ""emerging zoonotic diseases"" or those spread by humans-to- animals and animals-to-humans. At the time of the conference, H5N1 and SARS topped the list of feared emerging zoonotic diseases. Today, the H1N1 swine flu would be the pathogen enemy No. 1. The scientists distinguished between ""primary risk factors"" for zoonotic diseases and mere ""amplification risk factors,"" which affect only the rate at which a disease spreads. Their examples of primary risk factors were ""change to an agricultural production system or consumption patterns."" What particular agricultural and consumer changes did they have in mind? First in a list of four main risk factors was ""increasing demand for animal protein,"" which is a way of saying that demand for meat, eggs, and dairy is a ""primary factor"" influencing emerging zoonotic diseases. This demand for animal products, the report continues, leads to ""changes in farming practices."" Lest we have any confusion about the ""changes"" that are relevant, poultry factory farms are singled out. Similar conclusions were reached by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, which brought together industry experts and experts from the WHO, OIE and USDA. Their 2005 report argued that a major impact of factory farming is ""the rapid selection and amplification of pathogens that arise from a virulent ancestor (frequently by subtle mutation), thus there is increasing risk for disease entrance and/or dissemination."" Breeding genetically uniform and sickness-prone birds in the overcrowded, stressful, feces-infested and artificially lit conditions of factory farms promotes the growth and mutation of pathogens. The ""cost of increased efficiency,"" the report concludes, is increased global risk for diseases. Our choice is simple: cheap chicken or our health. Today, the factory farm-pandemic link couldn't be more lucid. The primary ancestor of the recent H1N1 swine flu outbreak originated at a hog factory farm in America's most hog-factory-rich state, North Carolina, and then quickly spread throughout the Americas. It was in these factory farms that scientists saw, for the first time, viruses that combined genetic material from bird, pig and human viruses. Scientists at Columbia and Princeton Universities have actually been able to trace six of the eight genetic segments of the most feared virus in the world directly to U.S. factory farms. Perhaps in the back of our minds we already understand, without all the science, that something terribly wrong is happening. We know that it cannot possibly be healthy to raise such grotesque animals in such grossly unnatural conditions. We know that if someone offers to show us a film on how our meat is produced, it will be a horror film. We perhaps know more than we care to admit, keeping it down in the dark places of our memory -- disavowed. When we eat factory-farmed meat, we live on tortured flesh. Increasingly, those sick animals are making us sick. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jonathan Safran Foer.","Jonathan Safran Foer: Inhumane way we raise animals for slaughter poisons us all .

"(CNN) -- The news editor of the Zambian newspaper The Post has gone on trial for allegedly circulating obscene material to politicians, the newspaper states on its Web site. Zambia President Rupiah Banda has branded the childbirth photos pornographic. In early June, Chansa Kabwela wrote to the country's vice president, health minister and several non-governmental organizations to highlight problems in the country's health-care system -- especially the problems pregnant women faced during a strike by health-care workers. In her letter, Kabwela included several photos of a woman giving birth in a parking lot outside a hospital from which she had been turned away, according to Reporters Without Borders. The country's president, Rupiah Banda, branded the photos pornographic and called for Kabwela's arrest and prosecution, according to the press freedom organization. ""Kabwela's arrest is shocking and the grounds are ridiculous,"" the organization said in a statement on its Web site after the arrest. Now the trial into the alleged obscene photos has begun in the Lusaka magistrate's court, the newspaper Web site says. One of the first witnesses, Kenneth Ngosa, a senior private secretary to the vice president, told the court he was immediately disturbed by the pictures he found inside the letter, according to the paper. The Post described the courtroom as ""packed to capacity"" and said ""people from all works of life including musicians and opposition political party members"" had come to support Kabwela. Defense lawyer George Chisanga has asked the court to look into whether the president's order to arrest and prosecute Kabwela could influence the course of justice. A joint statement from several Zambian media organizations, published on The Post's Web site, calls for the government to amend the law on obscenity to clarify what constitutes obscenity and material that can corrupt morals. The statement concedes that the pictures were in bad taste, but notes that they were sent on behalf of a good cause: to end the strike. CNN efforts to obtain comment from both The Post and the Zambian government have been unsuccessful. According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization, in 2004 the mortality rate of children under 5 years old in Zambia was 182 per 1,000 live births. In the United States, under-5 mortality rate was 8 per 1,000 live births in 2006. Skilled health personnel attended only 43 percent of childbirths in Zambia in 2002, according to the health organization.","News editor of Zambian newspaper on trial for circulating obscene material .

"(CNN)  -- There was no mistaking the target: the eight huge cooling towers at Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station, sending plumes of steam high into the watery blue sky of the English Midlands. A mix of peaceful protest and direct action took place at Ratcliffe-on-Soar, England. Instead the question in the minds of an estimated 1,000 protestors gathered in the surrounding woods and scrubland was how could they get in and shut it down. Surrounded by electrified fences, coils of razor wire and hundreds of police, this coal-fired power station run by German energy firm E.On was the target of environmental activists campaigning to stop climate change. Organizers of the protest, an amorphous group called the Camp for Climate Action, claim the plant is one of the UK's largest sources of CO2 emissions and had named last weekend's protest, ""The Great Climate Swoop"". ""Climate change is one of the most important and urgent problems facing us,"" one protestor called Emma, told CNN. ""Our politicians are not doing enough. We have to take action."" ""We need to increase the pressure on [UK prime minister] Gordon Brown until he changes his mind about coal,"" said another called Magoo. ""I wouldn't be here if I thought we couldn't make a difference today."" Many protestors were upbeat following a recent decision by E.On to shelve plans for a new coal powered power station at Kingsnorth, in southern England, and the site of a similar protest in 2008. E.On told CNN that the decision was ""purely economic"", and ""due to a marked fall in demand for electricity during the recession"", although many activists were claiming it as a victory for them. Determination to act . There was no doubting the activists' dedication. The weekend began peacefully enough with a procession snaking up from the East Midlands Parkway train station accompanied by a pedal-powered sound-system and a band. Several officers told CNN they were glad to be policing this event rather than a local football derby on the same day. Yet over 24-hours police say 57 protestors were arrested and both police and activists were injured in violent scuffles. The protest at Ratcliffe-on-Soar was the latest from a movement that has quickly come to define environmental activism in Britain, mixing elements of the mid-1990s road protest movement with the more targeted, professional approach of groups like Greenpeace and the mass civil disobedience modeled by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Although leaderless and non-hierarchical it has shown determination, organization and direction. There were several families with young children at the protests, as well as individuals of all ages, although the bulk were twenty- and thirty-somethings. While some wore bandanas to hide their faces, others were in dressed as clowns or scarecrows and seemed content to picnic within sight of the plant. Peaceful protest and police . In the spring James Hansen a climate modeler for NASA and prominent scientist lent his support for direct action, telling The Guardian newspaper: ""The democratic process doesn't quite seem to be working... I think that peaceful demonstration is not out of order, because we're running out of time."" The first action by Climate Camp for Climate Action was at Drax coal power station in 2006, followed by Heathrow airport in 2007 and Kingsnorth coal power station in 2008. In 2009 there have already been three events: a protest at the European Climate Exchange in London, to coincide with the G20; a camp on Blackheath, London, in August -- the site of the 1381 Peasant's Revolt - and now the protests at Ratcliffe. All have been characterized by a mix of peaceful protest around a ""camp"" that is intended to model low-carbon living, alongside militant direct action - and an increasingly tense relationship with police. At Kingsnorth a huge police presence carried out over 8,000 searches according to an official report by the National Policing Improvement Agency, which also criticized tactics as ""disproportionate and counterproductive"". The death of Ian Tomlinson after being pushed to the ground by an officer at the G20 protests this April led to a storm of criticism, and seems to have brought about some changes in police tactics -- arresting activists before they act, rather than confronting them in the field. Last week ten people intending to come to Ratcliffe-on-Soar were held by police on suspicion of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass, according to Police. Others have claimed they were phoned and told they would be arrested if they came -- something the police deny. Willing to be arrested . Some of the most dramatic scenes came on Saturday afternoon came when hundreds of protestors mobbed around the perimeter fence on the north side of the plant and attempted to pull it down. Ropes were attached to fence posts, with protestors clasping their hands over them as officers tried to cut the cords with knives and secateurs, as the crowd heaved down the fences. Others climbed up and hung on -- including one man and his young daughter. It was in this moment that a division seemed to emerge between those ready to confront the police head on, and those holding back. Above the few dozen actually at the fence were many more holding back, cheering, but wondering what to do, obviously frightened of being arrested. ""Come down!"" came the cry from one man at the fence. ""This is not a spectator sport!"" But few did. While the movement prides itself on inclusivity, and commitment is welcome at any level, it clearly needs people ready to be arrested. Whether the weekend's protests will inspire more of those who came to greater militancy next time around -- or scare them away - remains to be seen. But as dusk fell on Saturday night and camp was set the protestors were claiming victory -- and the next target was already clear As they packed up tents and sleeping bags the next day after a chilly night under the stars, cell phones chirruped as a message arrived: ""We did it! 24 hrs of truly inspirational action! Fences down, gates blockaded, railway occupied, a camp in the woods. ""Now onwards to Copenhagen!""","Eco activists gathered at power station in UK to protest against climate change .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A Swiss diplomat was released from jail Thursday after being arrested on a sex charge, the Iranian media reported. The first secretary of the U.S. Interests section of the Swiss Embassy in Tehran had been in an ""indecent sexual relation"" with an Iranian woman in his car, Iran's Press TV reported, citing Iranian police. Police spotted the car with diplomatic plates in a parking lot and caught the diplomat. The woman was ""improperly dressed and in an obscene situation,"" Press TV said. The ""sexual relation"" occurred after the diplomat, who was not named, promised he would marry the woman, Press TV reported. Both were released on bail. It was not clear what charges were filed against the woman. Press TV said it had contacted the deputy head of the U.S. Interest Section in Tehran, Elizabeth Bucher, but she would not comment on the report. The suspect is a Swiss diplomat who represents the United States in Iran in the absence of a U.S. presence.

The gun, aboard the USS Ramage, a Navy destroyer, is used to defend the ship in close combat. Navy officials said a crew member was cleaning the weapon when it accidentally discharged. The incident happened as the ship was in port after returning from an international exercise in the Baltic Sea. It was preparing to leave later that day, the Navy said. Polish military police boarded the ship to investigate, and Navy officials said the crew of the Ramage fully cooperated. No U.S. sailors were taken into custody by Polish authorities, Navy officials said. There was no immediate word of a U.S. Navy investigation into the incident.","Crew member cleaning a machine gun that fires into city of Gdynia .

"OAKLEY, California (CNN) -- The black box sat inside a cabinet. Philip Garrido had given it to a friend for safekeeping, and that's where the friend kept it. The black box has jacks for plugging in headphones. Philip Garrido claimed it could speak his thoughts. ""He feels he can speak to you and me and everyone else using this box,"" said Garrido's friend and former business client, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""He was a whack job, but he was a whack job who sounded like he had a really good heart,"" the friend added. Garrido and his wife, Nancy, were arrested last month and charged on more than two dozen counts, including kidnapping and rape. Authorities say the Garridos held Jaycee Dugard, 29, captive for nearly two decades in their backyard. Both have pleaded not guilty. Authorities have said Garrido, a registered sex offender, fathered Dugard's two children. A few days before his arrest, Garrido delivered some documents touting the device to the FBI. The black box is simple, with a handle, a metal switch and jacks for plugging in headphones. But it provides some insight into the mind of 58-year-old Garrido. Garrido told his friend and customers of his printing business that the box allowed him to communicate without speaking. ""He would move his lips and not speak ... and you would be able to hear his voice through the headphones,"" the friend said. Three years ago, Garrido demonstrated the box for clients of his printing business. The clients, some of them at least, went along with his claims for the device. ""I didn't want to tell him you're a kook and you don't know what you're talking about,"" said Tim Allen, who owns a glass shop in Antioch. Even so, Allen and several other former Garrido clients signed declarations saying the device worked. ""People believe in things. I didn't think it was my place to shoot him down,"" Allen said. Garrido so believed in the power of his invention that he wanted to have the device patented, so he solicited the help of a private investigator last year. ""He was speaking normal, dressed normal, acting normal,"" said Ralph Hernandez, who spent 30 years in law enforcement before becoming an independent private investigator. Hernandez said he agreed to help Garrido verify the testimonials that the product actually worked, but he never saw the box. Garrido told him it would be best if he didn't, the investigator said. Hernandez said he provided all the requested information to Garrido. ""This was like the last part before he would take whatever he had had to a lawyer to prepare for patenting,"" Hernandez said. Documents obtained by CNN include a news release that Garrido produced: . ""A Bay area man has made a major discovery concerning the phenomenon of voice,"" the release says, accompanied by a photograph of Garrido. Read the news release . Though it's not known whether Garrido hired a patent attorney, there's no record at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of a patent application or a patent granted to him. But 48 hours before he was arrested, Garrido gave the device to his friend for safekeeping. ""I can only guess that he knew something bad was going to happen,'' he said. Meanwhile, investigators will begin excavating part of the Garridos' California property Monday afternoon after two sheriff's dogs trained to find human remains alerted authorities of possible buried bones, officials said. The search is in the same area as a canine alert last week, said Lt. Chris Orrey of the Hayward, California, police department. Ground-penetrating radar also found an ""anomaly"" in that area, Orrey said Monday. Investigators have already found bone fragments at the property in unincorporated Contra Costa County but have not said whether they are human.","Phillip Garrido told people box allowed him to communicate without speaking .

"Forget about 20/20. ""Perfect"" vision could be redefined by gadgets that give you the eyes of a cyborg. The surface of the eye can be used to measure much of the same data you would get from blood tests. The tech industry calls the digital enrichment of the physical world ""augmented reality."" Such technology is already appearing in smartphones and toys, and enthusiasts dream of a pair of glasses we could don to enhance our everyday perception. But why stop there? Scientists, eye surgeons, professors and students at the University of Washington have been developing a contact lens containing one built-in LED, powered wirelessly with radio frequency waves. Eventually, more advanced versions of the lens could be used to provide a wealth of information, such as virtual captions scrolling beneath every person or object you see. Significantly, it could also be used to monitor your own vital signs, such as body temperature and blood glucose level. Why a contact lens? The surface of the eye contains enough data about the body to perform personal health monitoring, according to Babak Parvis, a University of Washington professor of bionanotechnology, who is working on the project. ""The eye is our little door into the body,"" Parvis told Wired.com. With gadgets becoming increasingly mobile and powerful, the technology industry is seeing a steady stream of applications devoted to health. A few examples include a cellphone microscope used to diagnose malaria, surgeons honing their skills with the Nintendo Wiimote, and an iPhone app made for diabetes patients to track their glucose levels. A contact lens with augmented-reality powers would take personal health monitoring several steps further, Parvis said, because the surface of the eye can be used to measure much of the data you would read from your blood tests, including cholesterol, sodium, potassium and glucose levels. And that's just the beginning. Because this sort of real-time health monitoring has been impossible in the past, there's likely more about the human eye we haven't yet discovered, Parvis said. And beyond personal health monitoring, this finger-tip sized gadget could one day create a new interface for gaming, social networking and, well, interacting with reality in general. Parvis and his colleagues have been working on their multipurpose lens since 2004. They integrated miniature antennas, control circuits, an LED and radio chips into the lens using optoelectronic components they built from scratch. They hope these components will eventually include hundreds of LEDs to display images in front of the eye. Think words, charts and even photographs. Sounds neat, doesn't it? But the group faces a number of challenges before achieving true augmented eye vision. First and foremost, safety is a prime concern with a device that comes in contact with the eye. To ensure the lens is safe to wear, the group has been testing prototypes on live rabbits, who have successfully worn the lenses for 20 minutes at a time with no adverse effects. However, the lens must undergo much more testing before gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration. A fundamental challenge this contact lens will face is the task of tracking the human eye, said Blair MacIntyre, an associate professor and director of the augmented environments lab at Georgia Tech College of Computing. MacIntyre is not involved in the contact lens product, but he helped develop an augmented-reality zombie shooter game. ""These developments are obviously very far from being usable, but very exciting,"" MacIntyre said. ""Using them for AR will be very hard. You need to know exactly where the user is looking if you want to render graphics that line up with the world, especially when their eyes saccade (jump around), which our eyes do at a very high rate."" Given that obstacle, we're more likely to see wearable augmented-reality eyeware in the form of glasses before a contact lens, MacIntyre said. With glasses, we'll only need to track where the glasses are and where the eyes are relative to them as opposed to where the eyes are actually looking. And with a contact lens, it will be difficult to cram heavy computational power into such a small device, even with today's state-of-the-art technologies, Parvis admits. There are many advanced sensors that would amplify the lens' abilities, but the difficulty lies in integrating them, which is why Parvis and his colleagues have had to engineer their own components. And when the contact lens evolves from personal health monitoring into more processor-intense augmented-reality applications, it's more likely it will have to draw its powers from a companion device such as a smartphone, he said. Layar, an Amsterdam-based startup focusing on augmented reality, shares University of Washington's vision of an augmented-reality contact lens. However, Raimo van der Klein, CEO of Layar, said such a device's vision would be limited if it did not work with an open platform supporting every type of data available via the web, such as mapping information, restaurant reviews or even Twitter feeds. Hence, his company has taken a first step by releasing an augmented-reality browser for Google Android smartphones, for which software developers can provide ""layers"" of data for various web services. Van der Klein believes a consumer-oriented, multipurpose lens is just one example of where augmented-reality technology will take form in the near future. He said to expect these applications to move beyond augmenting vision and expand to other parts of the body. ""Imagine audio cues through an earpiece or sneakers vibrating wherever your friends are,"" van der Klein said. ""We need to keep an open eye for future possibilities, and I think a contact lens is just part of it."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(Mental Floss) -- People have been eating pickles ever since the Mesopotamians started making them way back in 2400 B.C.E. Here are some even more important things you should know about them. Pickles have gotten credit for health and beauty and winning football games. 1. In the Pacific Islands, natives pickle their foods in holes in the ground lined with banana leaves, and use them as food reserves in case of storms. The pickles are so valuable that they've become part of the courting process, helping a man prove he'll be able to provide for a woman. In Fiji, guys can't get a girl without first showing her parents his pickle pits. 2. Cleopatra claimed pickles made her beautiful. (We guess it had more to do with her genes.) 3. The majority of pickle factories in America ferment their pickles in outdoor vats without lids (leaving them subject to insects and bird droppings). But there's a reason. According to food scientists, the sun's direct rays prevent yeast and mold from growing in the brine. Mental Floss: 8 disastrous product names . 4. In the Delta region of Mississippi, Kool-Aid pickles have become ridiculously popular with kids. The recipe's simple: take some dill pickles, cut them in half, and then soak them in super strong Kool-Aid for more than a week. According to the New York Times, the sweet vinegar snacks are known to sell out at fairs and delicatessens, and generally go for $.50 to a $1. 5. Not everyone loves a sweet pickle. In America, dill pickles are twice as popular as the sweet variety. 6. The Department of Agriculture estimates that the average American eats 8.5 lbs of pickles a year. 7. When the Philadelphia Eagles thrashed the Dallas Cowboys in sweltering heat in September 2000, many of the players attributed their win to one thing: guzzling down immense quantities of ice-cold pickle juice. Mental Floss: 31 unbelievable high school mascots . 8. If it weren't for pickles, Christopher Columbus might never have ""discovered"" America. In his famous 1492 voyage, Columbus rationed pickles to his sailors to keep them from getting scurvy. He even grew cucumbers during a pit stop in Haiti to restock for the rest of the voyage. 9. Speaking of people who get credit for discovering America, when he wasn't drawing maps and trying to steal Columbus' thunder, Amerigo Vespucci was a well-known pickle-merchant. 10. Napoleon was also a big fan of pickle power. In fact, he put up the equivalent of $250,000 as a prize to whoever could figure out the best way to pickle and preserve foods for his troops. 11. During the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, H. J. Heinz used pick-shaped pins to lure customers to his out of the way booth. By the end of the fair, he'd given out lots of free food, and over 1,000,000 pickle pins. 12. Berrien Springs, Michigan, has dubbed itself the Christmas Pickle Capital of the World. In early December, they host a parade, led by the Grand Dillmeister, who tosses out fresh pickles to parade watchers. Mental Floss: Curious, bizarre and storied state symbols .

"(CNN) -- A high-ranking al Qaeda leader has called on China's minority Uyghurs to prepare for a holy war against the Chinese government. Security has been increased recently on the streets of Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital. ""There is no way for salvation and to lift this oppression and tyranny unless you ... seriously prepare for jihad in the name of God and carry your weapons against the ruthless brutal invader thugs,"" Abu Yahia Al-Libi said Wednesday in a video on an Islamist Web site. He delivered his message in Arabic. The Uyghurs are Muslims in western China's Xinjiang province. Some Islamists refer to the region as East Turkistan. Al-Libi's proclamation was in reaction to the violence that has recently shaken Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital. There, long-simmering resentment between minority Uyghurs and majority Han Chinese erupted into riots and left more than 200 people dead in July. The following month, a series of stabbings -- with syringes used as weapons -- added to the unrest. ""What we saw and heard in the recent events in Turkistan was not accidental and didn't happen overnight. This is an intifada (an uprising) and a usual response to the decades of oppression, the organized cleansing and the systematic repression until the people had enough,"" Al-Libi said. ""This was not the first uprising that the oppressed Muslim people carried out, because they keep grieving and struggling to preserve their identity against the aggressors."" Chinese officials could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. Al-Libi regularly produces video messages and has, in the past, called on Pakistanis and Somalis to resist their ""apostate"" governments. He is considered one of al Qaeda's top strategists and one of its most vocal leaders in its propaganda campaign . In his latest message, Al-Libi called on Muslims worldwide to support the Uyghurs. And he vowed that China will suffer the same fate that the former Soviet Union did when it invaded Afghanistan in the 1980s -- only to be thwarted by Islamist fighters. ""To you, the state of atheism and obstinacy: You are coming to an end and you will face the same fate of the Russian bear of disintegration and division,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Greek voters will go to the polls to elect a new government two years early, Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis announced Thursday. Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis says he wants to enact reforms in response to the international financial crisis. He called the early elections in response to pressure from the opposition Socialist Party, which threatened to block the election of a president in February if there was no general election first. Karamanlis is also seeking a mandate from the voters for reforms in response to the international financial crisis, he said. ""It's up to the citizens to decide who has the right plan to govern and face the economic challenges,"" he said in a speech to the country. ""We have two very difficult and critical years ahead of us,"" he said in the speech on Wednesday. ""There is only one path that offers hope and potential: We take -- without delay, without procrastination -- take all necessary measures to address these problems. By design and desire. We need to build the solid foundation that will ultimately get us out of this crisis stronger."" He said the country needs ""stringent control on public spending,"" ""war on tax-evasion"" and ""bold structural reforms."" The new elections will be held October 4, Karamanlis announced Thursday after meeting President Karolos Papoulias, who officially dissolves parliament. Karamanlis' term was not due to expire until September 2011. But Socialist party leader George Papandreou insisted on new elections before the end of Papoulias' term as president in February. The Greek constitution requires the two major parties to agree on the election of a president, giving either party an effective veto. Karamanlis called Papandreou's stance ""blackmail."" Parliament will be dissolved on September 7, Karamanlis said on his Web site. Karamanlis' conservative New Democracy party suffered a sharp setback in European elections in June, when the Socialists matched New Democracy's tally of eight seats, with 36 percent of the vote. That election was seen as a litmus test for Karamanlis at a time of political and economic uncertainty with the economy shrinking and the country staring at a recession after nearly 15 years of high-profile growth. CNN's Efty Katsareas and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis announced elections Thursday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Israeli military action in Gaza is comparable to that of German soldiers during the Holocaust, a Jewish UK lawmaker whose family suffered at the hands of the Nazis has claimed. A protester confronts police in London last weekend at a demonstration against Israeli action in Gaza. Gerald Kaufman, a member of the UK's ruling Labour Party, also called for an arms embargo on Israel, currently fighting militant Palestinian group Hamas, during the debate in the British parliament Thursday. ""My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town of Staszow. A German soldier shot her dead in her bed,"" said Kaufman, who added that he had friends and family in Israel and had been there ""more times than I can count."" ""My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza."" Kaufman, a senior Labour politician who was raised as an Orthodox Jew, has often opposed Israeli policy throughout his career. Israel has said it initiated the operation into Gaza -- which is controlled by Hamas -- to stop rocket fire on its southern cities and towns. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died in the operation in Gaza and from rocket strikes on southern Israel, according to the Israeli military. More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed, including many civilians, Palestinian medics said. During Thursday's debate, Kaufman also said that Israel needed to seek real peace and not peace by conquest, which would be impossible. He also accused the Israeli government of ""ruthlessly and cynically exploiting the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians."" But Kaufman added that while it is necessary to talk to Hamas, which had been chosen by an electorate, it nevertheless is a ""deeply nasty organization."" Bill Rammell, the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, said the UK government backed an EU presidency statement calling Israeli action disproportionate. But he also criticized Hamas rocket attacks on Israel during the cease-fire between June and December 2008, adding that the militant group's ""whole ethos is one of violence"" and that it had ""made a brutal choice to step up attacks against innocent civilians."" ""Nothing, not the restrictions on Gaza nor its frustration with the peace process, justifies what Hamas has done and continues to do,"" Rammell said. ""In December, I was in Ashkelon near the Gaza border, and I heard the sirens. The fear was palpable: This is daily psychological and actual warfare."" Rammell added that Hamas has ""committed acts of terrorism, it is committed to the obliteration of the state of Israel, and its statement last week that it was legitimate to kill Jewish children anywhere in the world was utterly chilling and beyond any kind of civilised, humanitarian norm."" The debate came on the day that Saeed Siam, Hamas' third-ranking leader in the territory, was killed by an Israeli airstrike, the Islamic militant group reported. The United Nations' main relief compound in the territory was also hit and set on fire, which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon blamed on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed sorrow over the incident but said Israeli forces were responding to militant fire near the complex. UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the shelling of the compound  as ""indefensible,"" media agencies reported. Speaking to Ban during a call, Brown said the UK would increase its calls for a cease-fire and also deliver aid to Gaza once a cease-fire took hold. Britain has witnessed several demonstrations since the conflict in Gaza began late last month. Last Saturday, up to 20,000 people gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in London, Metropolitan Police said. Later, parts of the crowd began pelting officers with sticks, rocks and pieces of metal barriers, police said. A similar protest Sunday was peaceful. Rallies were also held in London and Manchester last weekend in support of Israeli action against Hamas.","Jewish UK lawmaker calls on Israel to talk to Hamas, a ""deeply nasty organization""

"(CNN) -- ""Saturday Night Live"" was formed in the crucible of the mid-1970s, when Watergate brought respect for politicians to all-time lows, the counterculture was taking over comedy, and many television viewers were seeking out something fresh and bold. Fred Armisen played Barack Obama in a talked-about sketch Saturday night on ""Saturday Night Live."" It was a powerful combination -- and after 34 years, the combination of ""SNL"" and politics can still strike sparks among political observers. The most recent example came this past weekend when Fred Armisen, as President Obama, chided ""those on the right"" for saying that he was ""turning this great country into something that resembles the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany."" Not true, said Armisen as Obama. ""When you look at my record,"" he said, ""it's very clear what I've done so far -- and that is nothing.""   Watch the sketch -- and the reaction Â» . The sketch has caused a rumble among the inside-the-Beltway chattering classes and New York news nabobs. Wrote Washington Post blogger Jonathan Capehart, ""When your 'friends' start talking about you like this -- and friends with a huge megaphone and a feel for the national mood -- the White House should listen."" ""Humor with some truth in it is always dangerous. Make no mistake, a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president,"" added CNN political contributor Ed Rollins in a column. The White House had no comment when asked about the sketch by CNN. ""SNL"" cast members weren't available for interviews, an NBC representative said. ""SNL"" creator Lorne Michaels also turned down an interview request but has said the show doesn't take sides. ""I think 'SNL's' role is, the moment they're in power, we're the opposition,"" he told CNN's Alina Cho last year. ""We're not partisan. We're not, you know, we're not putting on anything that we don't believe is funny.""  Video gallery: ""SNL"" takes on presidents through the years Â» . The recent sketch is indicative of the end of Obama's honeymoon, Syracuse University pop culture professor Robert Thompson says, but he doesn't want to read more into it than that. ""Comedy is about going after the people in power,"" he said. The president has also taken recent shots from ""The Daily Show"" and ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" ""What this says is that the comedy-industrial complex has turned its sights on the reigning president of the United States,"" he said. But, he added, ""I wouldn't put this into the meme category,"" referring to concepts that travel so quickly they take on a life of their own, such as Tina Fey's Sarah Palin sketches from last year. ""The [Obama] sketch wasn't that funny."" Indeed, the show's overall impact is often mixed, observes Slate columnist and Rutgers media studies professor David Greenberg. It can ""capture or intensify"" a storyline that's being passed through the news media, but the show is more a barometer that can change with events. ""It's not incapable of influencing things,"" he said, noting the show's slash-and-burn '70s satire and Fey's Palin parody. ""But since the early '80s, those moments are pretty rare. ... You'll see good impersonations but not the underlying critique you had with, say, Dan Aykroyd as [Richard] Nixon."" Besides, he added, the Obama sketch may have titillated the politico-media crowd, but he wonders whether its impact went any wider. ""I'm a political junkie,"" he said, ""and this is the first I've heard of it."" Indeed, the ratings for the episode were a far cry from last year's Palin-fest -- from a 7.3 rating for the same week in 2008, to 4.7 -- and the Armisen sketch didn't get the frenzied online dispersion the Palin sketches did. iReport.com: 'SNL' won't hurt Obama . However, Obama should be concerned about one thing, observes Thompson. In general, ""SNL"" mocked previous presidents' personal characteristics, such as Clinton's outsized appetites or George W. Bush's struggles with spoken English. With Obama -- who lacks the same kind of easily caricatured traits, Thompson says -- the show went after his record. ""In some ways,"" Thompson said, ""he's vulnerable to more serious damage.""","Recent ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch attacked President Obama .

"(CNN)  -- Stonehenge, an enigma to visitors and scientists alike for so many years, became less of a mystery after a discovery announced to the world this week. A stone circle discovered near Stonehenge may suggest the prehistoric monument was part of a funeral route. Archaeologists have unearthed a new stone circle near Stonehenge that lends credence to the theory that the famous prehistoric monument in Britain was part of a funeral complex. University of Bristol archaeologist Joshua Pollard described the new find as ""incredible"" because it establishes Stonehenge as part of a larger ceremonial complex linked to the nearby River Avon. ""No one could have predicted there was another stone circle so close by,"" said Pollard, co-director of the excavation project that began in 2004. This, he said, changes the perception of the popular tourist destination 90 miles west of London. The new find, dubbed ""Bluestonehenge"" after the color of the 25 Welsh stones of which it was once composed, sits along the Avon a mile away from its famous sister circle, Pollard said. Neolithic peoples would have come down river by boat and literally stepped off into Bluestonehenge, Pollard said. They may have congregated at certain times of the year, including the winter solstice, and carried remains of the dead from Bluestonehenge down an almost two-mile funeral processional route to a cemetery at Stonehenge to bury them. ""It could be that Bluestonehenge was where the dead began their final journey to Stonehenge,"" said Mike Parker Pearson, an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield who co-directed the project with Pollard. ""Not many people know that Stonehenge was Britain's largest burial ground at that time,"" he said. ""Maybe the blue stone circle is where people were cremated before their ashes were buried at Stonehenge itself."" Proof of life artifacts -- pottery, animal bones, food residues and flint tools used in the Stone Age -- are decidedly absent at Stonehenge but were found upstream in a village discovered by the excavation team in 2005, leading researchers to believe that Stonehenge was indeed a burial ground. But people have debated the purpose of Stonehenge for decades. Known for its orientation in relation to the rising and setting sun, the circle of stones represented a prehistoric temple to some. Others argued it was an astronomical observatory. Or that it was a marker of time. But Pollard is sticking to his theory. He said others have not based their suppositions on archaeological finds. Archaeologists began the latest excavation with the hope of tracking the course of the avenue that led to Stonehenge. They had no idea they would stumble upon a second circle that would help uncover the mystery of Stonehenge. The stones at Bluestonehenge were removed thousands of years ago, Pollard said, but the sizes of the remaining pits, about 33 feet in diameter, point to giant blue stones from the Preseli Mountains of Wales, about 150 miles away. Pollard said that Neolithic people dragged the pillarlike blue stones along the processional route to Stonehenge to incorporate them in a major rebuilding that took place around 2500 B.C. Archaeologists know that after 2500, Stonehenge consisted of about 60 Welsh stones and 83 local sarsen stones. Some of the blue stones that once stood on the river's edge probably now stand within the center of Stonehenge, Pollard said. Scientists plan to use radiocarbon dating techniques to better understand the history of the entire site. Stonehenge remains as striking as ever. But with each new find, the enigma fades just a little.","Discovery of lost stone circle sheds new light on Stonehenge's purpose .

"(CNN) -- The young man's call echoed throughout the remote village in northern Nigeria -- the marriage ceremony was about to begin. Umar Ahmed and his wife wait for anti-HIV drugs at a hospital in Nigeria. Under the dusty sun, the fathers of the bride and groom agreed to the marriage and this ancient Muslim tradition proceeded as it has for hundreds of years. But unknown to the gathered villagers, the couple is hiding a modern secret. Both bride and groom are HIV-positive and marrying with the support of a local government program that encourages such ""HIV-marriages"" in the hope of preventing the virus from spreading. After the ceremony and away from the village, the husband agreed to speak with CNN as long as he was not identified. ""The woman I marry loves me -- I love her,"" he said. ""And we promised that we can keep ourselves healthy and clean."" According to the United Nations, Nigeria has the third-largest HIV population in the world, with about 3.1 percent of its 148 million people infected. Officials working for the Bauchi State Agency for the Control of AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, known as BACATMA, hope to put a dent in those numbers -- not just by treating HIV-positive people with free antiretroviral drugs but, they say, by helping more than 100 HIV-positive couples marry. The agency offers to pay for the dowry, provide counseling and even employment within the agency. BACATMA officials hope that, by keeping HIV-positive couples together, they will keep AIDS from spreading to anyone not infected. ""If someone having HIV marries another HIV-AIDS person, that means there will be no HIV transmission to another negative person,"" said Rilwanu Mohammed, the BACATMA chairman. However, UNAIDS, the UN agency tackling HIV and AIDS, has its doubts, arguing such marriages do not prevent the spread of AIDS. ""There are better methods to address the prevention of HIV and AIDS rather than encouraging that kind of union,"" said Warren Naamara, the UNAIDS Nigeria coordinator. ""We have made it very clear from UNAIDS that the best way to address HIV infection is universal access to prevention, treatment and care."" There is no evidence that such marriages stop the spread of AIDS. However, for many of the couples, the marriages support their personal fight against AIDS and the stigmatization it often brings from society, friends and family. That stigmatization can lead HIV-positive people to become outcasts, discriminated against and sometimes physically abused. Queuing for their antiretroviral drugs at a local hospital, Umar Ahmed and his wife said they married last year and have since had a child. ""Before, I was lonely,"" Umar said. ""Being with my wife, I feel great -- because we stay together, we discuss different issues together."" For those couples who decide to have children, BACATMA tries to reduce the odds that the child will be born infected with HIV by ensuring that the parents have antiretroviral agents and medical advice. Still, the decision to have a child is a controversial one when the parents who decide to do so are sick and unlikely to be able to raise the child.","Local agency will pay dowry, offer counseling, to get HIV-positive couples to wed .
The goal is to keep HIV from spreading to people not already infected .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A government school in southern India has tested pupils' karate skills by running over their outstretched arms with a motorcycle. K. Devarajan, the director of elementary education in Tamil Nadu state, told CNN that the event, held recently, was organized with the consent of parents. State education authorities have now asked schools not to carry out such activities because they violate safety guidelines, which he claimed were already in place in state educational institutions. Devarajan said officers visited the school after learning about the controversial show. Newspaper pictures Tuesday showed a motorcyclist driving over the limbs of a row of schoolchildren lying with their faces down in the state's Villupuram district. It also showed smiling adults standing behind the young children. The act aimed to show the strength the students had gained from their karate classes, Devarajan said. Nobody was injured, said P. Perumalsamy, a senior state education official. The students involved were aged between six and 13, he added.","Indian schoolchildren run over by motorcycle in karate exercise .

"(CNN) -- Six Uyghurs who were imprisoned in the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were transferred Saturday to the South Pacific island nation of Palau, the Justice Department said. Ahmad Tourson, Abdul Ghappar Abdul Rahman, Edham Mamet, Anwar Hassan, Dawut Abdurehim and Adel Noori were resettled in Palau, the Justice Department said in a statement Saturday. Seven Uyghurs are still at Guantanamo Bay, where 215 prisoners remain. Uyghur is an ethnic group from western China. Since January, 25 detainees have been transferred to other countries. The United States has coordinated with Palau ""to ensure that the transfers take place under appropriate security measures and will continue to consult with the Republic of Palau regarding the individuals,"" the Justice Department said. The 13 Uyghurs were accused of receiving weapons and military training in Afghanistan. Some of them have been cleared for release since 2003, and other Uyghurs have been released to other countries. The United States said it would not send them back to their homeland because of concern they would be tortured by Chinese authorities. The Chinese government has said no returned Uyghurs would be mistreated and has repeatedly warned other countries against taking the men. Beijing officials this summer again urged the United States to hand over all remaining Uyghurs instead of sending them elsewhere. China alleges the men are part of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a group the U.S. State Department considers a terrorist organization, that operates in the Xinjiang region. East Turkestan is another name for Xinjiang. On October 20, the Supreme Court tentatively agreed to accept an appeal from the 13 Uyghurs to be released into the United States from American military custody.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Seeking to identify the man who shot dead another man outside a store in Naples, Italy, in the spring, an anti-mafia prosecutor distributed on Thursday a video showing the execution. The surveillance-camera video, shot May 11, shows a man wearing a baseball cap, dark jersey, blue jeans and running shoes entering a store, walking to the back and looking around, then walking out. As he exits, he pulls a pistol from his right front pants pocket and shoots a man standing outside the store. As the victim buckles to his knees and then sprawls headlong on the pavement, the killer approaches him from behind and squeezes off a second round into the back of his head, turns and strides unhurriedly out of camera view. Passers-by appear unfazed. One woman tries to lift the victim's head in an apparent attempt to see whether she knows him; a man steps over the body. ""Indeed, it is ugly to see people behaving as if that was not a dead body and going on their daily routine,"" a police spokesman said. ""Unfortunately, this is not an anomaly in Naples and in that neighborhood."" He said fear led people to behave that way. The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said anti-mafia prosecutor Sergio Amato released the video to the media in hopes that someone would recognize the killer and his apparent accomplice: a man who had been standing next to the victim and walked off just before the shooting. Police said no motive has been determined for the killing, which took place in the poor neighborhood of Rione Sanita, where Camorra -- the name for organized crime in Naples -- is strong. The victim was a bank robber, the spokesman said. Italian Minister for Equal Opportunities Maria Rosaria Carfagna called the video ""tragic."" ""It shows us, finally, without any censorship, a disgusting side of the Camorra, which along with all the rest of its disgusting faces, has forced a city, a region, a territory, to be ashamed of itself and to hide its real face. ""A street homicide, in broad daylight, in the center of a great European city cannot be considered normal and even less be accepted by the conscience of all Italians as if it were a TV show,"" she said. ""The police forces are waging a battle against organized crime, as the number of arrests shows us. The state is there and in strong force. But, and I speak here as someone from the Campania region, Naples and all of Campania need not only a strong political force but the courage of all its citizens."" Roberto Saviano, author of the book ""Gomorrah,"" which details the Camorra, called the video ""shocking."" ""What is shocking about this video is the absolute serenity of the people around the victim,"" he told the daily newspaper La Repubblica. Saviano, who has lived under police protection since shortly after his book was published in 2006, added, ""Unfortunately, though, when a city is at war, its citizens undergo and live almost with normal indifference."" Italy's Green Party is offering 2,000 euros ($2,963) to whoever helps investigators identify the suspects. ""The Camorra pays them to keep quiet; we pay them to speak,"" said Francesco Emilio Borelli, head of the Green Party in the Campania region. The police spokesman said Camorra has been blamed for about 60 killings this year in Naples and its surrounding county.","Video shows man shoot another man twice outside Naples store during day .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has been named the best player in Europe, becoming the first Argentine to win the prestigious Ballon d'Or award on Tuesday. Last year's winner Cristiano Ronaldo came second, with Messi's teammates from Barcelona's historic 2008-09 treble-winning side -- Spain midfielders Xavi and Andres Iniesta plus Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o (now at Inter Milan) -- rounding out the top five. The 22-year-old Messi helped the Catalan giants to the Spanish La Liga and European Champions League titles as well as the Copa Del Rey, while his Argentina side scraped into the World Cup finals after finishing fourth in their South American qualifying campaign. Messi told France Football magazine, organizers of the award, that he knew he was ""among the favorites because Barcelona had a profitable year."" ""For me it's a big honor to win -- but also to become the first Argentinian in history to receive the trophy,"" he said. ""I dedicate it to my family, they were always present when I needed them and sometimes felt even stronger emotions than me."" Messi is the first Barcelona player to win the award since Brazilian forward Ronaldinho took it in 2005, and the sixth to have won it while at the club. He dominated the Ballon d'Or voting, polling 473 votes compared to second-placed Ronaldo's 233, and 27 more than the Real Madrid and Portugal winger received when he won it in 2008 for his exploits while with Manchester United. The rest of the top-10 was completed by: Brazil playmaker Kaka, Real Madrid's summer signing from AC Milan; Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who joined Barcelona from Inter in the off-season; England forward Wayne Rooney of United; Chelsea's Ivory Coast frontman Didier Drogba; and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard of England. The award was only open to European players before 1995, and that year AC Milan's Liberian star George Weah became the first from outside the continent to win it. Argentina-born Alfredo Di Stefano was named Europe's top player twice in the 1950s while at Real Madrid, but had acquired Spanish citizenship by that time.","Barcelona and Argentina forward Lionel Messi crowned the 2009 Ballon d'Or winner .

"(CNN) -- Scientists say a very rare find of some 20 fossilized pterodactyls has produced the first clear evidence of a controversial theory of evolution. This image shows the fossilized skeleton of Darwinopterus which was found in north-east China earlier this year. The fossils were found in northeast China earlier this year, embedded in rock dating back 160 million years, and have been called ""Darwinopterus"" after the renowned naturalist Charles Darwin. The creature's discovery has astounded scientists because their age puts them within two recognized groups of pterodactyls -- primitive long-tailed forms and advanced short-tail forms -- and they display characteristics of both. The combination of features indicates that the primitive pterodactyls evolved relatively quickly, and that certain groups of features changed at the same time. Traditional evolutionary theory suggests that one feature -- a tail for instance -- would slowly evolve over time. ""Darwinopterus came as quite a shock to us,"" said David Unwin, from the University of Leicester's School of Museum Studies, which identified the creature, along with researchers from the Geological Institute of Beijing. ""We had always expected a gap-filler with typically intermediate features such as a moderately elongate tail -- neither long nor short -- but the strange thing about Darwinopterus is that it has a head and neck just like that of advanced pterosaurs, while the rest of the skeleton, including a very long tail, is identical to that of primitive forms,"" he said. By comparing the fossil with others from earlier and later periods, scientists have been able to sketch a rough timeline of the pterodactyl's progression. ""The head and neck evolved first, followed later by the body, tail, wings and legs,"" Unwin said. The researchers say more study is needed to substantiate the idea of that evolution could occur relatively quickly, and that whole parts of a plant or animal's body could change at once. The fossils indicate Darwinopterus was about the size of a crow, with long jaws, sharp, pointed teeth and a flexible neck. It had ""hawk-like"" qualities, scientists say, which allowed the creature to kill and eat smaller, feathered dinosaurs which would later evolve into birds. Pterodactyls were prevalent during the Mesozoic Era between 220 and 65 million years ago. The research has been published in the ""Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.""","Researchers say rare fossil find provides evidence of one theory of evolution .

"(CNN) -- Suspected Somali pirates hijacked a Greek-owned bulk carrier Wednesday with 22 crew members aboard, according to the European Union's Naval Force for Somalia. MV Filitsa was seized in the early morning about 460 miles (740 kilometers) northeast of the Seychelles as it headed toward Durban, South Africa, according to a news release from EU NAVFOR Somalia. The Marshall Island-flagged carrier -- with three Greek and 19 Filipino crew members -- ""has now turned around and is heading north,"" it said. The bulk carrier has a deadweight of more than 23,000 tons. There have been more than 100 pirate attacks and at least 39 hijackings off the east Africa this year, according to EU NAVFOR. In late October, Somali pirates seized a private yacht in the Indian Ocean, taking Paul and Rachel Chandler hostage. They have demanded a $7 million ransom for the British couple's release, but the government has refused to pay as a matter of long-standing policy. Two vessels were attacked the day after the Chandlers set sail. One of them -- a cargo ship -- was successfully boarded and seized off the Seychelles, while the other fought off its attackers near the Kenyan coast. Pirates are still holding a Spanish fishing boat, the Alakrana, which they seized on October 2 off Somalia's coast. Days later, they transferred three of the fishing boat's 36 crew members to land. Two pirate suspects had left the Alakrana in a small vessel heading toward land, authorities said, and the Spanish military swooped in to stop them on the high seas. They were later brought to Madrid, where a judge has charged them with piracy and kidnapping. The pirates holding the crew have demanded Spain release the two suspects. Spain is part of the European Union task force against piracy in the Indian Ocean off Somalia. The Spanish parliament last January agreed to increase Spain's presence with up to 395 troops and assets, including a frigate and aircraft.

"SPRING HILL, Tennessee (CNN)  -- General Motors idled its Spring Hill, Tennessee, facility as part of its bankruptcy plan Monday, leaving hundreds of employees -- and thousands of residents who rely on the plant's economic thrust -- in limbo. Johnny Miranda is trying to stay positive about the plant where he has worked for 16 years. Spring Hill, about 35 miles south of Nashville, is a town built on the jobs that the plant provides. The town has seen its population jump more than 1,600 percent in the almost 20 years since GM sent the first Saturn down the assembly line in June 1990. ""I want to think positive,"" said autoworker Johnny Miranda, who left a GM plant in Van Nuys, California, 16 years ago to work in Spring Hill. ""It could bring you down. It could really mess you up if you be thinking they're going to close it and you're going to lose your job."" The future is uncertain for the plant's 3,000 employees. GM could shut down, phase out or sell the plant. Local media outlets report that the plant will end production toward the end of this year and that assembly of the Chevrolet Traverse will be moved to Lansing, Michigan.  Watch Spring Hill residents share concerns Â» . The Spring Hill facility ceased building Saturns more than two years ago as sales slumped. After a yearlong retooling, it started pushing out Chevy's crossover sport utility vehicle instead. Saturn had originally billed itself as a ""different kind of car company,"" and GM had hoped the business plan and fuel-efficient vehicles would allow it to snatch sales away from its Japanese rivals.  Watch GM workers ponder future Â» . GM made Saturn a separate division, built an innovative plant, embraced no-haggle buying, opted for plastic over metal for many of the vehicles' parts and brokered an agreement with the United Auto Workers that fostered teamwork between the union and management. For years the company enjoyed a cult-like following. Self-confessed ""Saturnistas"" attended ""homecomings"" on the Spring Hill campus. Web sites and fan clubs popped up across the country. One of the sites, saturnfans.com, garnered thousands of signatures on its ""Save Saturn"" petition in the months leading up to GM's bankruptcy. Ultimately, GM's aspiration to sell a half million of the cars a year didn't pan out. It sold only 8,000 Saturns in November 2008 and fewer than 200,000 for the entire year.  Watch what drove GM to this point Â» . But Saturn's waning popularity was just one of a litany of problems facing the auto giant, which filed for bankruptcy and announced specifics of its restructuring Monday. In addition to shedding the Saturn brand, GM also plans to end its Pontiac, Saab and Hummer lines, as well. The company shut down a dozen facilities and put three, including the Spring Hill plant, on standby. It also will cut ties with about a third of its 6,000 U.S. dealerships.  See which plants are closing Â» . Visit Spring Hill and it's tough to find anyone not affected by the plant's suspension. Every resident appears to know at least one person whose job is on the line. ""My father-in-law works for GM. He's worked for GM ever since the day he graduated college,"" Will Barnes said at a T-ball game Sunday.  See GM's history Â» . Barnes' father-in-law is anxious, like thousands of GM employees, and has resorted to yardwork to calm his nerves, he said. ""He's cut his yard five times this week because this is the level of uncertainty for him, and I hate to see him in that situation,"" Barnes said. John Stansbury, 55, told The Daily Herald in Columbia, Tennessee, he has been working for GM since he was 18. His father spent 40 years with the automaker.  Watch how the U.S. auto industry has risen, fallen Â» . Because of the Spring Hill plant's flexibility following its recent revamp and the competitive local labor agreement, Stansbury said he remains optimistic but uneasy. ""The mood of the whole plant is really unsure,"" he told the newspaper. ""We are all tense."" iReport.com: What next for GM? When the Spring Hill plant opened in 1990, the town's population was 1,464, according to the Census Bureau. The latest count, from 2007, is closer to 24,000. In that time, numerous subdivisions have been constructed to accommodate the plant's workers. Economic officials told The Daily Herald that at least 5,000 jobs are tied to the plant. That's in addition to the restaurants, shops and other businesses that rely on autoworkers' dollars.  Watch how the bankruptcy will have a ripple effect Â» . The Spring Hill plant also gives local governments more than $2 million in lieu of taxes, the newspaper reported. Though the fate of the plant remains contingent on market conditions, few are under the illusion that GM employees and Spring Hill residents will remain unscathed by changes to the city's lifeline.

"New York (CNN) -- The new Navy assault ship USS New York steamed into New York harbor Monday, cutting through the water with a bow built using seven and a half tons of steel recovered from the wreckage of the World Trade Center. Its crew stood at attention and a 21-gun salute greeted the ship. Firefighters, bagpipers, and those who lost loved ones on 9/11 lined the shore to watch the emotional arrival. The docking holds special meaning for many families of those who died in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. ""What better way for our young men and women that are going to be on the USS New York to feel the spirit of our country than to have this ship have the steel in the bow that represents not the bad but the good of our country,"" said Lee Ielpi, who lost his firefighter son, Jonathan, on 9/11. The memory of the attacks is etched on the crest of the ship, which features a phoenix rising from the twin towers with the words, ""Never Forget."" Watch USS New York sail up the Hudson . The ship weighs more than 25,000 tons and is as long as two football fields. Thirteen percent of the 361 crew members hail from the state of New York. Former New York Gov. George Pataki received special dispensation to name the $1 billion ship USS New York; only submarines normally can be named after states. Can you see the USS New York? Send your photos or videos . It is the first ship assignment for Ensign Timothy Gorman, who said, ""Of any ship in the Navy, this is one ship that you can be proud of commissioning, to remember on a daily basis why we are here and why the ship is so special. The steel in the bow, we are very mindful that we are representing victims of 9/11 and the families and the people that died that day."" Howard Lutnick takes great pride in the new ship. He is CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, whose offices were in the World Trade Center. The ship, he said, is a memorial to his brother and 658 of his employees who died on that day more than eight years ago. Lutnick said he lives with the loss every day. Watch how steel from World Trade Center became the ship's bow . ""I really like the idea of people going out and avenging what happened to us and protecting us so that it should never happen again, because the pain that we went through, we want no one, no other family to have to go through it,"" Lutnick said. The ship also will be used to ferry disaster relief when needed.

"(CNN) -- Iran tested a missile-launching system and several types of short- and medium-range missiles Sunday, the state-run Press TV said. A short-range missile is test-launched during war games in Qom, Iran, south of Tehran, on Sunday. Earlier, the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had said it would stage missile exercises beginning Sunday to promote the armed forces' defense capabilities. The tests, which are expected to last until Monday, are code-named ""Payghambar-e Azam 4"" or ""The Great Prophet 4,"" Press TV said. The missiles, fired at targets around the country Sunday, included the Fateh-110, a short-range ground-to-ground missile, and Tondar-69, a short-range naval missile, the station said. Several models of medium-range Shahab missiles were tested at night, Press TV reported.  Watch Iranian missile tests Â» . The final stage of the tests will be held Monday morning, when Iran plans to test the long-range Shahab missile, the station said. In May, Iran said it tested a surface-to-surface missile that is capable of reaching parts of Europe. At the time, a White House official said actions in Iran were noteworthy. ""Of course, this is just a test, and obviously there is much work to be done before it can be built and deployed. But I see it as a significant step forward in terms of Iran's capacity to deliver weapons,"" said Gary Samore, special assistant to the president on nonproliferation.

"(CNN) -- A silent, invisible battle is being fought against roadside bombs in Iraq. Though the military doesn't like to advertise their use, electronic jamming systems are playing a key role in neutralizing the threat. Smoke billows from tires of a U.S. military truck hit by an IED near the Iraqi-Syrian border in October 2005. ""Any weapon we had against IEDs, [improvised explosive devices] was utilized including jamming technology,"" said Jason Spencer, 29, an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, engineer who served with the Army in Iraq in 2005. Vehicle mounted electronic jammers attempt to block a signal going to a radio-controlled IED. The military also uses portable backpack jammers. ""The sophistication of IEDs definitely increased during my time in Iraq,"" said Spencer. ""There was a definite increase in remote detonation."" A signal going to a remote-controlled IED operates on a radio or infrared frequency. Jamming devices, known as Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare, or CREW systems, attempt to intercept or block a signal before it reaches its intended target, preventing detonation. One common method is barrage jamming, which knocks out a broad range of radio signals. However, it also knocks out communications used by U.S. troops putting them at increased risk. ""Ideally what you want to be able to do is have something that can grab very precise signals, capture the signals and render them irrelevant without knocking out your own communication,"" said CNN military analyst retired Army Brig. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks. These technologies represent the last line of defense, Marks said. ""We don't want to give our potential enemies an understanding of what we are doing to counter their efforts,"" he said. Along with jammers, troops use air surveillance, robots, blast-resistant vehicles and mine rollers as countermeasures.  See counter-IED technologies in Iraq Â» . IEDs are the No. 1 source of U.S. and alllied casualties in Iraq, according to the Department of Defense. From July 2003 to July 2007, 1,565 coalition forces were killed by IEDs, according to iCasualties.org.  See the casualty toll inflicted by IEDs Â» . ""We dealt with hundreds of IEDs while in theater,"" said Spencer. ""IEDs were always on our minds during every patrol."" Spencer says IEDs come in a variety of shapes and sizes. ""From a simple mortar round on the side of the road with a fuse and a wire running to a push-button, to complex explosives poured into concrete (shaped like curbs) with remote detonators and booby traps."" Most roadside bombs are remotely detonated using common household devices: cell phones, garage door openers, burglar alarms, key fobs, doorbells, or remote controls for toy cars.  Learn more about the IED threat Â» . ""Our enemy hides in plain sight. He buys his bomb parts in stores. It's standard commerce,"" said Marks. U.S. forces are dealing with an adaptive, innovative and flexible enemy, according to the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, or JIEDDO, which is leading the counter-IED effort for the military. As insurgents modify their devices to outwit the military, the military in turn adapts its own jamming technologies. Many companies have been tapped to supply jammers to coalition forces. JIEDDO is interested in technologies that can be used in the field within two to eight months -- ""light speed"" in Defense Department terms. The Army's main CREW system is the Warlock Duke, a vehicle- mounted radio jammer developed by Syracuse Research Corporation. It's capable of jamming most radio-controlled IEDs, according to the Pentagon. The Navy, which oversees the CREW program, contracted BAE Systems to produce 3,800 wearable jammers to be fielded in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2008. Canadian firm Med-Eng is building jammers for the Marines, reports military contractor General Dynamics. By the end of 2007, JIEDDO will have funded more than 30,000 jammers for Marine and Army units. They have spent $1.6 billion on jamming technology for this fiscal year. ""This gear saves lives every day,"" wrote retired Gen. Montgomery Meigs, director of the Joint IED Defeat Organization, in a column titled ""On the Offensive: The Battle Against IEDs."" One in six IEDs causes casualties in Iraq, JIEDDO reports. To remain effective the enemy ""must expose himself more and take higher risks to do his ugly work,"" Meigs said. In January, the Government Accounting Office launched a review of JIEDDO and its efforts to counter IEDs. The Defense Science Board criticized the agency for focusing too much on defensive countermeasures ""to which the enemy quickly adapts, making these efforts less effective,"" in an April 2006 report. JIEDDO is fully cooperating with the GAO, said Col. Dewey Ford, director of strategic communications for JIEDDO. He added that Congress has long supported eliminating the IED threat. JIEDDO said it is aggressively going after the bomb makers, working to destroy their networks. The agency acknowledges that the mission won't be achieved merely by technical means. ""The best way to counter the IED threat is through understanding the network that allows an IED to even be assembled,"" said Marks, who supports JIEDDO's work. ""I'd rather have the guy who is going to put that IED in place get killed long before he's even part of the network. And I don't want him to know how I found him out because I want to find out where all his buddies are and kill them too.""

"(CNN)  -- A Tennessee detective's keen eye may have nabbed a serial killer. Tennessee police say trucker Bruce Mendenhall implicated himself as a serial killer. A long-distance truck driver gave statements implicating himself in six slayings in four states after Detective Sgt. Pat Postiglione discovered what appeared to be blood inside the cab of his rig, police said. Bruce Mendenhall, 56, an independent truck driver from Albion, Illinois, is facing  homicide charges in the shooting death of Sara Nicole Hulbert, 25. Her body was found June 26 in the parking lot of a Nashville, Tennessee, truck stop, authorities said. Mendenhall made his first court appearance Thursday via closed-circuit television. A judge declined to set bond. Heading to the crime scene Thursday, Postiglione saw a tractor-trailer rig on the road that matched the description of a truck sought in the investigation. The rig pulled into the truck stop and stopped.  Watch police search Mendehall's truck Â» . Postiglione knocked on its door. While talking with Mendenhall, Postiglione noticed what appeared to be blood on the inside of the driver's door. Mendenhall gave the detective permission to look inside the truck. Postiglione found ""some more evidence that I considered incriminating,"" he said. Mendenhall was detained, police said, because he gave statements implicating himself in Hulbert's slaying. Knowing that the slaying was similar to other recent homicides in the South, Postiglione questioned Mendenhall about those as well, police said. Mendenhall implicated himself in the death of Symantha Winters, 48, of Nashville, who was found shot to death June 6 in a trash container at a Lebanon, Tennessee, truck stop, police said. He also implicated himself in a homicide in Alabama, one in Georgia and two in Indiana, the statement said. Those victims were not named.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military said Tuesday that its forces have taken over a Taliban stronghold during the ongoing ground offensive in the tribal region of South Waziristan. Pakistani security forces have secured Sararogha and have started to clear the town of weapons and ammunition, the military said. It comes a day after its forces gained control of Kaniguram, another key Taliban stronghold, which the military says its forces have now completely secured. According to the military, 21 militants and one Pakistani soldier died in the past 24 hours of fighting -- most of them in the raid on Sararogha. The military is trying to rout Taliban insurgents operating along the Pakistan-Afghan border. The restive and largely ungoverned region of South Waziristan is the headquarters of the Pakistani Taliban. Pakistan's military suspects its leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, is still in the region backed by up to 8,000 militant fighters. Pakistan's army has launched three similar offensives in Kaniguram and Sararogha since 2004 without success, sometimes agreeing to peace deals that eventually fall apart. Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas recently told CNN that this time a peace deal is not an option. ""Certainly there is no scope of a peace deal,"" Abbas told CNN. ""It is a fight to the finish."" The military began its ground offensive in South Waziristan three weeks ago, however the region has been affected by a broader anti-Taliban offensive that has uprooted more than 180,000 people this year, according to the United Nations. Many of those people -- more than 94,000 -- have fled South Waziristan since June, the U.N. said last week. In recent weeks, Pakistan has been relentlessly rocked by a wave of attacks as Islamic militants retaliate against the military campaign. On Monday, the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Rawalpindi were hit by separate suicide bombings. A suicide attacker believed to be on a motorcycle targeted people outside a bank in Rawalpindi who were lined up to pick up their monthly checks, police said. That attack killed 30 people, police said on Tuesday. The attack happened in the Cannt area of Rawalpindi, close to Pakistan's military headquarters where the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, was meeting with Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani on Monday. It was unclear if he was there at the time of the attack. Hours later, two suicide bombers detonated their explosives at a police checkpoint in Lahore, injuring 17 police and civilians.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has been called ""The King of Hearts"" by many of his countrymen, referring to what they believe are his compassionate attempts to reform his ultra-conservative kingdom. He used his power Monday to overturn a criminal court sentence of 60 lashes and a two-year travel ban imposed on female journalist Rosanna al-Yami. Under the travel ban, she could not have left Saudi Arabia. Al-Yami was sentenced for her work on an episode of the television show ""A Thick Red Line"" that featured a Saudi man who bragged about sexual escapades. The controversial show explores social taboos. It is carried by the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., for which al-Yami works as a coordinator and guest booker. ""King Abdullah's swift revocation of this punishment sends an important notice to the Saudi judicial system that it should not go after journalists for exercising free speech,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director for Human Rights Watch. ""King Abdullah should also overturn the sentence against the man at the center of the case, who had spoken about sex on a television show, and initiate reforms to strengthen the rights to freedom of expression and to a fair trial,"" Human Rights Watch said in a written statement. In the episode, the Saudi man, Mazen Abdul Jawad, 32, bragged about his sex life. Saudi authorities put him on trial and sentenced him to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes. Shortly afterward, the court sentenced al-Yami. Jawad's attorney, Suleiman al-Jumeii, said al-Yami was not involved in setting up the episode in which his client appeared. The lawyer said he is attempting to pursue an appeal for his client and get the case heard in a special court that deals only with media matters. ""A Thick Red Line"" caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where sharia, or Islamic law, is practiced. Pre-marital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle. Saudi authorities shut down Lebanese Broadcasting's offices in Jeddah and Riyadh after the interview aired a few months ago. The king's pardon of al-Yami was unusual, but it was not the first time he has stepped in. In late 2007, the king pardoned a woman who, although she had been gang-raped, was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for appearing in public with an unrelated male, who also was pardoned, according to the Saudi justice minister. The king concluded in a letter pardoning the woman that her male companion, who was abducted along with her, had suffered torture along with her. Details of what happened to the two were not disclosed. Octavia Nasr, senior editor for Middle East affairs, contributed to this report.","Saudi king overturns journalist's sentence of 60 lashes, two-year travel ban .

"(CNN) --  On the first anniversary of the historic 2008 election, retired Gen. Colin Powell, the first African-American secretary of state, talks one-on-one with CNN's Don Lemon for Essence Magazine about the most pressing issues facing black men in the age of President Obama.  Don Lemon: President Barack Obama issued a national call to service. Do you think African-Americans have answered that call? Colin Powell: I really don't know that I know the answer to that question. I do know that in the work that I do and my wife does as the chair of America's Promise, we are seeing more and more people step forward to try to deal with the problems that we have, to include African-Americans and Hispanics stepping forward. But it's not just a one-time thing. You can't just have, let's have a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday or a day of service. We've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year. We need more African-American men, for example, to step forward and serve as mentors to young kids who don't have a responsible, caring adult male in their lives. If I could snap my finger and do one thing, I would make sure that every young American boy or girl, but especially African-American [children], have a responsible, caring adult in their lives. Hopefully, it's their parents, even if it's a single parent. ... But without that kind of family support, then we need Boys and Girls Clubs. We need Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We need mentors. Otherwise, these kids will find bad adults to copy from, and we're going to lose them. Lemon: I recently reported on youth violence and gangs in Chicago, Illinois. Most of the young men didn't have role models at home. Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men? Powell: Of course it would. President Obama has spoken out rather clearly about this: Fathers have got to start doing their jobs. Every child has a father, and some of those fathers don't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father. Whether it's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home, that father is a father and owes that child financial support, owes that child companionship, owes that child an example in life. Those of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play. If it hadn't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood, I wouldn't have made it. But they had a level of expectation for me. Lemon: How do you convince African-American men, especially, that service is a worthwhile effort? Powell: You tell them that without that effort, all of our achievements over the last 50 or 60 years are being put at risk. The statistics are frightening. Fifty percent of our African-American youngsters are not graduating from high school. And of that 50 percent, a higher percentage of boys are not graduating than girls. And when they get out of high school, if we can get them into the college, you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college. And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys. This is a moral disaster for the African-American community. This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched. We didn't do it so that these kids could fail because they don't have adults in their life, teaching them how to succeed. We've got to teach them that you've got to behave. You've got to learn what it means to ""mind"" somebody. You've got to read to your kids. You've got to act like responsible fathers. Lemon: How did you become involved in President Obama's Renew America Together initiative, and what is your role? Powell: The president-elect was aware of the work that Alma and I had done together on America's Promise. As part of the transition effort, he intended to make this an important part of his administration, and he wanted to get started earlier. The White House asked if I would work with transition officials to launch his first initiative, which was called Renew America Together. I launched that for him on the 9th of January, 11 days before the inauguration. We also announced the Web site where people could sign up to get involved in service to their community.

It's a word that's not used enough anymore. I tried to observe people who were successful in life. In the black community, we didn't have that many in those days. You had Joe Louis, Jackie Robinson, Ralph Bunche, Willie Mays, a lot of athletes. ... You had Gen. Benjamin O. Davis Sr., the first black general in World War II. But it was still a country where people of color could not reach the heights.   I was nevertheless inspired by these folks who did the best they could in the time in which they lived and showed that if you do your very, very best, you will be recognized and rewarded for it. I entered the Army five years after the last segregated unit was closed down. I entered in 1958, and at that time, the Army was fully integrated, the most integrated institution in American society.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's deputy minister of transport has been arrested after investigators taped him taking a $100,000 bribe, the Iraqi Integrity Commission said Monday. It's the latest sting aimed at what many Iraqis say is rampant corruption in the country. The anti-corruption body said Monday this was the first time such a high-level Iraqi official was caught in the act of taking a bribe. The announcement, made on the commission's Web site, said investigators detained Deputy Minister Adnan al-Obaidi last Wednesday. A spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Aqeel Kawthar, told CNN on Monday that the deputy minister took office August 10, and his arrest came as a surprise to the ministry. He said there were no indications that al-Obaidi might be corrupt before this incident, but he said the Ministry of Transport ""supports and congratulates"" the Integrity Commission's work. A foreign security firm had approached the Integrity Commission alleging that al-Obaidi had asked for a bribe of $500,000 to renew the firm's contract, the commission said. ""The deputy minister was supposed to receive the full amount first, but the scenario was changed into him receiving $100,000 [in U.S. dollars] as a down payment, and the rest of the money would be delivered after the renewal of the contract,"" according to the commission's account. ""Orders were issued to security forces to deploy undercover in Karrada district"" in central Baghdad.  Watch more about Iraq's war against corruption Â» . The statement said the security forces did not know who the target was and their orders were in coordination with the Integrity Commission's operations room. The commission said that five minutes before the arrest, the head of the commission, Judge Rahim al-Agili, informed Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that a high-ranking government official had taken a bribe. The commission said al-Maliki responded by saying: ""I do not want to know his name, carry out the operation even if the wanted individual is Nuri al-Maliki. ... Whether he is from the Dawa party, a Sadrist, or a member of ISCI [all Shiite political parties, including that of the prime minister], he is only known to me as a bribe taker ... "" The Integrity Commission said the sting was caught on videotape, which it said would be posted soon on its Web site. ""The arrest of of the deputy minister of transport was a professional operation with no political dimensions to it, and we have not heard any political or parliamentary bloc objecting to it ... "" the commission's account said. ""The operation was carried out within 56 hours of continuous, nonstop, work. The head of the secret informant department and the men of the special operations branch [of the Integrity Commission] played a major role ... and the commission dedicated all its advanced capabilities to document and follow this."" According to the monitoring group Transparency International, Iraq is one of the top three most corrupt countries in the world, along with Somalia and Myanmar. A recent report from the group said almost half the people it surveyed in Iraq had paid a bribe in the previous year. When CNN talked to people coming and going from Iraq's Interior Ministry, complaints were frequent. ""The employee inside said he will only finish my ID for an extra $40,"" one man said. Another said, ""You can't even talk to the janitor in a government office unless you're paying a bribe."" Judge al-Agili told CNN his office is kept busiest by the Interior Ministry, but it is investigating 8,000 allegations of corruption against people through all departments and all levels of government. Al-Agili said he believes corruption is part of Iraq's culture, stretching back long before Saddam Hussein's regime. But he said he believes it can be beaten slowly, and that's why he set up the undercover special operations unit to carry out sting operations. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Phil Black contributed to this report.","Integrity Commission says videotape shows Transport official taking $100,000 bribe .

"Fort Collins, Colorado (CNN) -- The lawyer of a Colorado father accused of carrying out a bizarre hoax involving his son and a huge balloon said Monday that official charges in the case could be filed next week. Authorities announced that Richard Heene and his wife, Mayumi Heene, face several felony charges, but David Lane said the sheriff was overreaching with the charges. ""It's piling on and it's using charges that really aren't designed to fit this sort of allegation,"" Lane said on ""Larry King Live."" ""The attempt to influence a public official fraudulently, that's bribing a public official. That's not what happened here."" The Heenes face charges of conspiracy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and attempting to influence a public servant, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said Sunday. The family also probably will be charged with filing a false police report, which is a misdemeanor, Alderden said. Lane has said that the couple is ""not running from the law"" and deserves the presumption of innocence. ""The sheriff having a press conference saying that they're guilty does not make them so,"" Lane told CNN's ""American Morning."" Authorities say the event -- in which the tearful couple said their 6-year-old might have been trapped in the drifting balloon -- was staged. Richard and Mayumi Heene had met in a Hollywood acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality TV, Alderden said. Lane, asked Monday by CNN about his client's state of mind, said it was ""what you would expect someone's state of mind to be after law enforcement searched your house, seized your property, held a press conference announcing you're about to be charged with felony criminal charges. Your state of mind would be rather upset and you would feel somewhat under siege, which is exactly how the family feels at this point."" During the incident Thursday, as millions worldwide watched live TV coverage of the contraption floating above northern Colorado, authorities did not pick up on any deceptive behavior, Alderden said. But that night, during an interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" the boy, Falcon, gave authorities an ""Aha! moment,"" Alderden said. ""You guys said we did this for the show,"" Falcon said in the interview, when his father asked him why he had not come out from hiding when his parents were looking for him. Richard and Mayumi Heene said their son was simply confused. Lane said on ""Larry King Live"" on Monday that he thinks Falcon was referring to his demonstration to reporters of how he hid from view. But authorities enacted a game plan to get the truth, Alderden said. The plan included misleading the media on Friday when Alderden said authorities still believed the incident was not a hoax. They wanted to keep the couple's trust, the sheriff said. Investigators pursued separate interviews and polygraph tests with the Heene parents Saturday, then searched the couple's home early Sunday for computer records, phone records, video recordings and other potential evidence, Alderden said. ""The sheriff put both of them on a box, and they have not shared with us whether or not they passed or failed,"" Lane told ""American Morning"" on Monday. Polygraphs are not admissible in court, Lane added. Alderden said that, under Colorado law, authorities cannot announce whether polygraph tests were taken -- only that authorities pursued them. He added that authorities plan to seek restitution for the expenses incurred in the wild goose chase for Falcon. Because authorities aren't required to share evidence until charges are filed, Lane said he could not lay out the Heenes' defense. ""Until that point ... I'm shooting in the dark,"" he said, adding, ""If they have probable cause to make an arrest, then make an arrest and give me the evidence."" iReport.com: ""Outraged"" over balloon hoax . Alderden, speaking at a news conference Sunday, said authorities are concerned about the safety of all three Heene children, ages 6, 8, and 10. Authorities spoke with Mayumi Heene about domestic violence and the children's safety, the sheriff said. ""But we didn't have enough that would allow us or child protection services to physically take the kids from that environment."" A 9-1-1 call from the home earlier this year led authorities to a ""suspicious circumstance"" that the sheriff said might have involved ""domestic violence, perhaps against the wife."" Lane told CNN affiliate KMGH on Sunday that he has ""no reason to believe they're anything but loving parents."" iReport.com: ""Balloon boy saga is symptom, not disease"" Speaking to CNN on Monday, Lane said the Heene children were in his office Sunday, and that by his observations as a father of three, ""They seem to be perfectly, normal, happy, well-adjusted kids that are being insulated from this process as much as possible."" During a round of live TV interviews Friday morning, Falcon was sick, which many speculate was because he was upset about the incident. One of the questions that remains unanswered is where Falcon was as the balloon drifted. On Friday, Alderden said it had been determined that the boy was hiding in an attic in the garage. Now, authorities are unsure. Alderden said the boy might not have even been in the home. The Heenes have previously appeared on the ABC program ""Wife Swap."" Richard Heene also chases storms, brings his family along and takes videos. TLC, which produces the show ""Jon & Kate Plus 8"" -- told CNN that the Heenes had ""approached us months ago"" about a possible show, ""and we passed."" Heene has been described as a meteorologist, but his education ended at the high school level, Alderden said. The sheriff said investigators want to interview researcher Robert Thomas, who worked with Heene for about two months this past spring. Thomas, 25, was paid by the gossip site Gawker.com to write about his experience with Heene for a story published on Saturday. In an interview arranged with the help of Gawker, Thomas told CNN that at one point they talked about the Roswell UFO incident of the late 1940s, when Heene said it would be easy to cook up ""a media stunt that would be equally profound as Roswell, and we could do so with nothing more than a weather balloon and some controversy.""","Authorities say story of boy in runaway balloon a hoax .

"New York (CNN) -- Jazz master Wynton Marsalis says the blues is the true American music -- the heartbeat and unifying principle of jazz, country, R&B, gospel and other styles -- but it's been relegated to the back of the bus by greed and the legacy of racism. Marsalis grew up in New Orleans, Louisiana, son of Dolores and Ellis Marsalis. He was a trumpet prodigy, surrounded by top-notch musicians and steeped in the city's eclectic music. He was encouraged to excel by his father, a jazz pianist who instilled in his son a love of musical excellence and integrity. Marsalis plays classical and jazz music with equal mastery. He is artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center  and has won nine Grammy Awards and the Pulitzer Prize in music. He will be awarded the French Legion of Honor on November 6. In an interview Tuesday, Marsalis talked to CNN.com about the primary position of the blues in American music. The blues is our root music, American born-and-bred, but it's been treated like a stepchild of dubious origin, granted only secondary status, in Marsalis' view. It suffuses Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, rock 'n' roll, country-western, gospel, bluegrass and more, but never got its financial due or the respect it deserves. Marsalis says that's because of racism -- it was the music of a whole people granted only secondary status -- and its inability to make a lot of money. He also talks about his father, how slavery has affected the nation, and some lessons to be learned from jazz. CNN: You have a DVD out called ""Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis Play the Music of Ray Charles."" That's jazz, country and R&B. What do those styles have in common? WYNTON MARSALIS: The blues. It runs through all American music. Somebody bending the note. The other is the two-beat groove. It's in New Orleans music, it's in jazz, it's in country music, it's in gospel. The other is the down-home sensibility that's sophisticated. That's why Louis Armstrong could play with Jimmy Rogers. Ray Charles is actually the embodiment. He and Willie Nelson came 'round in young manhood at a time in the late '40s early 1950s when all of the American music, root music, was all combined. It became segregated in the mid- to late-'50s. Carl Perkins had a hit in 1955 -- ""Blue Suede Shoes."" It was on the R&B charts, it was on the country charts, it was No. 1 on the rock and roll charts. [It was] basically the same music, so there was an intersection point. It's like in cuisine, that would be like fried chicken and red beans and rice, it would be like potato salad and barbecued ribs. Someone in Texas not going to eat barbecued ribs? CNN: What led to the compartmentalization of these kinds of music, that came from the same roots? MARSALIS: Money and racism. I don't know which one came first. CNN: Why was blues not regarded as something of value in this country? MARSALIS: It came from who we didn't like. That's what it was -- it wasn't that we couldn't see it. Who it came from, we did not like them. CNN: So do you include African-Americans in that? So black people didn't appreciate it? MARSALIS: They didn't appreciate it. They don't now. That's part of the whole kind of self-hatred that comes from that type of slavery that the black American still labors under. That racism was heavy. The legacy of it -- it wasn't just 50 years. It was seven generations, and if a generation is 33 years, ... seven or eight [generations]. That's a long time. And to recover from it has proven to be very difficult. CNN: So is that what's going on with rap? MARSALIS: No question. Rap is the repetition of the minstrel show. But it's not going to go away, it was too many people. If it had been 100,000 people, it can go away. ... But it can't be millions of people and their descendants. [Slavery] was a very powerful and successful system. And it went on for a long time. In the aftermath of slavery ... there was a retrenching, and [it turned into] the type of racism that was experienced by people who came to the North. That consciousness has begun to shift, in the last 30 years. And that's 20 or 30 years of just thawing and shifting that's attached to 330 years [of slavery], and the thought you can get up and you will be better ... that's just asinine, it's absurd. CNN: But didn't the blues come from this, being marginalized? MARSALIS: The blues was like a solution to that, an antidote to it. But the blues is not only Afro-American music. CNN: So, you've written that it's not just African, it's American. What about America gave rise to the blues? MARSALIS: It is America. It's that combination, those tensions, the east-west tensions, the kind of tension of being a slave in the land of freedom, and the land of freedom itself, the Western mind, the concept of soloing across time, the call-and-response of democracy, direct call and response, the kind of optimism that is American in nature, is in the blues. There are elements in it that are African and there are elements of the American take on Europeanism. It's integrated, it's like a person whose DNA is integrated. You start to try to figure it out -- but you can't. That's how the blues is, that's why it fits with everything, country-western, bluegrass -- everybody's playing the same music. CNN: You write that jazz leaves room for individual creativity, but you have to listen and allow the other musicians to participate equally. So what's the lesson for the nation? MARSALIS: We have to have an overall cultural objective, which we don't have. ... We then fight under the flag of a position, the left or the right, black or white, old or young. It's very simplistic. We don't know our cultural history, we don't know we are together, and because we don't know we are together we can't act in that way. And that's the main thing our music, and the history of our music, can teach us as a nation. The one concept that has to be at the heart of the American experiment is integrity. The integrity of the process is very important. If you come up on the bandstand you have to be at least trying to swing. If you don't really want to swing or play with the musicians, there's nothing they can do, because you have the freedom to destroy it. CNN: Your father set an example. It sounds like you got a lot of your ideas about integrity from him. MARSALIS: Yes, he sure did. From him. He wasn't segregated about any music, he didn't care, you could play pop music, funk, he'd say ""right, great man."" He was a jazz musician. He wasn't uptight and always railing about somebody. What he did was very clear, and what he thought about being a man, he didn't look at a boy like that. I remember he sat in with our funk band one time. ... We'd go to his gig, there'd be six people. We'd go to our gig, there'd be thousands of people, dancing having a good time. We were playing a dance at a high school, he didn't know any of the music, but he played all of the music we had. We were laughing, we said, my daddy didn't know any of the music and he didn't know any of the tunes but he was playing better than us. CNN: When you were playing in a funk band in high school, did you look at your jazz musician dad as old school? MARSALIS: No, no, never, I never suffered from that misconception, because he was so much hipper than the people I was around. Philosophically, he knew more than we did. I'd bring people to see him. He never tried to act like a child, like a kid. I never thought I knew more than him, he was on the case. CNN: What are the components of jazz? MARSALIS: The main three components are the blues, improvisation -- which is some kind of element that people are trying to make it up -- and swing, which means even though they're making up music, they're trying to make it up together. It feels great, like you're having a great conversation with somebody. Sometimes you get in a good coordinated groove, and it just continues to happen.

"(CNN) -- The 63-year-old bearded fireplug of a man erupted in tears, pulled a white handkerchief from his back pocket, carefully unfolded it and pressed it into his eyes, pulled it away, pressed it again to his eyes, this time with more force, pulled it away again just long enough to take a sip of water, then rubbed them again. Lula da Silva gets a kiss from bid committee president Carlos Arthur Nuzman after the announcement Friday. ""I've never won a gift before,"" Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters. ""The first gift I ever had in my life I had to buy. It was an old bike with a broken belt and I had to fix it. Today, people who don't even know me gave me the greatest gift that a president could have: to host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Rio deserves this because Rio is a city that has suffered."" For Lula da Silva, Friday's announcement in Copenhagen, Denmark, that Rio de Janeiro will host the 31st Olympiad in 2016 signified a major achievement not only for his hemisphere (no city in South America has ever before hosted the games) but for him -- a former autoworker and union organizer who defied dizzying odds to become president. Lula da Silva was born to a peasant family in one of northeastern Brazil's most impoverished areas and migrated as a young man to a city near SÃ£o Paulo, where he worked as a metalworker, losing his left pinky finger in the process. In the 1970s, he became a union leader, said Luiz Valente, chairman of the department of Portuguese and Brazilian studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. During the years of military rule from 1964 until 1985, the government cracked down on unions. But Lula da Silva acquired a reputation as a public figure by leading a successful strike in SÃ£o Paulo, Valente told CNN in a telephone interview. ""He was able to negotiate a favorable contract for his union but, from a political standpoint, he demonstrated that worker strikes were possible again in Brazil,"" Valente said. During the early 1980s, as the military rulers' grip on control loosened, Lula da Silva helped found the leftist Workers' Party. In the late 1980s, he ran for Congress and won, but he chose not to run for re-election. Instead, he set his sights on the top job, waging a losing presidential campaign in 1989, the country's first presidential election since 1960. Successive tries in 1993 and 1997 were unsuccessful, but in 2001, he won and quickly surprised many observers. ""When he began, he was perceived as someone very much on the left,"" said Valente. ""He was perceived as being a socialist. However, he has not governed as a socialist. Instead, his economic policies were a continuation of the previous administration's."" In fact, Brazil's economic policy has been ""pretty much middle of the road, some people would say pretty conservative,"" said Valente, who added that he has never voted for Lula da Silva. But Lula da Silva has worked to help the country's poor, introducing populist measures intended to lower the incidence of poverty and making other moves, Valente said. ""As a union leader during the military dictatorship, he learned how to negotiate with the so-called enemy,"" Valente said. ""So Lula is going to try to reach some kind of consensus, and he did. What he did was not a product of ideology but of a pragmatist attitude of the government of Brazil."" Lula da Silva's moderate modus operandi has gained him popularity at home, where he has made no moves toward abolishing the term limits that preclude his running for a third term next year, Valente said. That pragmatism has served him well on the international front, where he is on good terms with the leftist governments of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador as well as with the United States and the European Union. ""Lula knows how to play the game,"" Valente said. Like Brazil's president, Rio did not succeed on its first try, having been rejected in an earlier bid -- which inspired planners to be meticulous, Valente said. ""They were very well-prepared,"" he said. Indeed, the city two years ago hosted the Pan-American Games, which officials looked on as a trial run for the Olympics, he said. ""Everything ran without a hitch,"" said Valente. ""It was just a beautiful event."" Lula's waterworks were no surprise to his countrymen, the professor said. ""He's a very emotional guy and Brazilians tend to be emotional. They're certainly not ashamed of showing their emotions ... It's not unusual for Brazilian men to cry in situations like that. Brazilians actually like to see men cry. They think it's good to show your emotions.""  Watch the reaction as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is named host city for the 2016 Olympics Â» . ""He always cries when he talks of his mother, who never saw him become president,"" said Fabiana Frayssinet, CNN's correspondent in Rio de Janeiro. ""He's a man who cries, who gets mad. He's an emotional man who says what he thinks whenever he wants."" Emotions were on display Friday on Copacabana beach in Rio, where thousands of people flocked on the first sunny day after two weeks of rain and atypically cold weather. ""It was a mix of the end of a football championship with a ... carnival and all the Brazilian festivals,"" Frayssinet said.","Lula da Silva calls announcement ""the greatest gift that a president could have""

"(CNN) -- Pirates seized control of a cargo vessel near the Seychelles Thursday, one of two attacks that took place within minutes of each other off the coast of east Africa, according to the European Union Naval Force. The International Maritime Bureau say attacks off the east coast of Africa have increased this year. The EU maritime patrol responded to the early morning attacks, along with the Seychelles Coast Guard. The crew of the Panama-flagged MV Al Khaliq said two pirates had boarded the vessel before communication was cut off with the crew. The EU force confirmed that six pirates have boarded the 180-meter long bulk carrier, with two attack skiffs in tow. They hoisted the ""mother skiff"" onto the vessel with a crane, the EU force said. A second attempted hijacking took place at approximately the same time, but the Italian-flagged cargo ship evaded the attack, the EU said. Armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, pirates opened fire on the MV Jolly Rosso about 460 miles (740 km) east of Mombasa, Kenya. A Belgium warship, part of the EU force, responded to the attack, which caused no casualties. The 200-meter MV Jolly Rosso continued its voyage. Pirate attacks off the coast of east Africa have significantly increased this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes. But successful attacks have gone down as a result of a strong presence of international monitors. The first nine months of this year has seen more pirate attacks than all of last year, the bureau reported on Wednesday. From January 1 until September 30, pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks, compared with 293 in all of 2008, it said. More than half of this year's attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia. Out of those attacks, Somali pirates successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages. Eight others were wounded, four more killed and one is missing, the bureau said. On Monday, pirates hijacked a Chinese merchant ship and its 25-member crew about 630 miles (1,000 km) northeast of Seychelles. The pirates appeared to be heading toward Somalia, the European Union Naval Force said. China plans to make ""every effort to rescue"" the crew members, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu, told reporters. The bulk carrier De Xin Hai is one of four ships that Somali pirates are holding for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages, the International Maritime Bureau said Wednesday. Maritime authorities say two recent trends have led to a rise in piracy: access and opportunity. As global commerce picks up, more and more of the world's fuels, minerals and other crucial commodities travel by ship. Ninety-five percent of America's foreign trade, for instance, moves by water, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. That cargo is an easy target for robbers in countries that lack the resources to secure their shorelines, such as Somalia. Somalia's transitional government, which has a tenuous grip on power, has been unable to stop the pirates -- many of whom are based in the country's port cities. This has prompted Europe and other Western countries to step up maritime patrols. ""In the Gulf of Aden, the number of attacks have gone up. But because of the presence of naval vessels, the success rate of the pirates have decreased,"" said Cyrus Mody, manager of the International Maritime Bureau. ""The navies are responding very very effectively."" Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms. Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. With the ransoms they collect, pirates can earn up to $40,000 a year, analysts say. That's a fortune for someone from an impoverished country. Some analysts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the piracies. ""Yes, the ransoms have probably caused the piracy to become a bit more rampant. But at the same time, from the owner's point of view, there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo,"" Mody said. ""It's basically a cycle."" CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report .","Pirates have taken control of cargo vessel near the Seychelles off east cost of Africa .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- An employee of a luxurious New York hotel has been arrested in connection with the slaying of a woman in one of the hotel's residential condominiums, police say. The Jumeirah Essex House is a landmark on Central Park South in New York. Derrick Praileau, 29, faces second-degree murder charges in connection with the death of Andree Bejjani, 44. Police said Bejjani, who was originally from Lebanon, had moved to New York from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and had been staying in a residential condominium at the Jumeirah Essex House since August. Bejjani's nude body was found Saturday afternoon on the 10th floor of the hotel on Central Park South. Her throat was slashed, authorities said. Police have not revealed a suspected motive for the slaying. ""This incident occurred in one of the private condominiums at The Essex House complex,"" the hotel said in a statement provided to CNN. ""Our sincere condolences go out to the victim's family and we have offered our full support during this difficult time."" The statement continued: ""We understand that a hotel employee has been arrested pending charges in conjunction with this incident. We continue to fully cooperate with the police throughout their investigation."" A message left with Praileau's defense attorney was not returned. The hotel referred to Praileau only as an employee, but the New York Daily News said he was its housekeeping manager, citing Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. The 44-story Essex House opened in 1931, a landmark Art Deco building. It recently underwent a $90 million renovation. The hotel has more than 500 luxury rooms and suites, along with several privately-owned residences. One six-room unit is currently on the market for $8.25 million.","Lebanese native Andree Bejjani, 44, found dead in condo Saturday .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian protesters are vowing to continue their anti-government demonstrations into Wednesday night, despite violent crackdowns and arrests. Witnesses in Tehran tell CNN the demonstrators number in the tens of thousands. The protests are timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy. Iran celebrates the embassy takeover as an official holiday, and tens of thousands showed up to hear anti-American speeches in front of the building that once housed the U.S. diplomatic corps. Many chanted ""Death to America."" The anniversary was also an opportunity to reignite the anti-government protests that were sparked in June, following a disputed presidential election. Thousands of protesters ignored warnings from Iranian authorities to stay home, many chanting ""Death to the Dictator"" and others saying, ""Obama - Either you're with us or with them,"" referring to the U.S. president. Riot police and pro-government Basij militia turned out in force to quash anti-government protests. ""We were running from the police in the alleys off of the main streets,"" said Soheil, an opposition protester, who gave only one name for security reasons. ""Strangers were opening up their garages so we could hide until the police went away. I ran into a garage for about 15 minutes. When I went back into the main street, I saw riot police arresting a group of young men, then putting them inside a bank and locking the door. ""Only God knows what will happen to them after that."" iReport: Iranians take to the streets . Soheil, like many other of the demonstrators, took part in the protests this summer. As with previous demonstrations, many images of Wednesday's protest were uploaded to the Internet on the site YouTube.com -- including video of protesters walking over an image of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Another clip showed a group of women being beaten by what appeared to be Iranian security forces. Witnesses said many Iranian women took part in Wednesday's demonstration, and were frequently targeted by the Iranian security forces -- which is what also happened during the summer protests. Video posted on YouTube showed many protesters beaten on the head with batons. Iranian reformists have chosen key anniversaries to protest the hardline government -- the same anniversaries chosen for government-sanctioned anti-American rallies. Wednesday's was the biggest annual anti-American observance of all. On November 4, 1979, Islamic students stormed the U.S. Embassy. They held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. There were also small pockets of protest on Wednesday in the southwest Iran city of Shiraz, according to a resident who witnessed the protests. Demonstrators marched down the main street of Shiraz, yelling ""Death to the dictator"" and ""We will not stand down to you, together we are united,"" according to Najmeh, who only gave her first name for security reasons. There was strong police presence on the streets, and the police force seemed much more organized than past occasions, she said. Earlier in the day, opposition supporters marched defiantly in Tehran's Haft-e-Tir Square, witnesses said. Many held up their hands in V-signs. Others shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great,"" which has become a slogan of protest. Police blocked all roads leading to the square, creating massive traffic jams. Witnesses described helmet-clad security personnel beating demonstrators with batons and firing tear gas at Haft-e-Tir Square and in a neighborhood a few kilometers north. ""I had never seen that many riot police and security personnel,"" a witness told CNN. ""They were brought in by the busloads. As soon as crowds gathered somewhere, riot police were there within minutes."" The opposition showed Wednesday that even after five months of government crackdown, people were still willing to take risks. The disputed June 12 presidential election triggered Iran's most serious political crisis since the Islamic revolution toppled the shah. Led by opposition candidate Mir Houssein Moussavi, thousands of Iranians protested what they believed was a rigged vote that returned hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office for a second term. In the election aftermath, the Iranian government arrested more than 1,000 people and accused reformists Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi of spreading anti-government propaganda and fueling anger among the public. But despite warnings from the government, Iran's reformists have largely refused to back down. They released the names of 72 protesters they say were killed in the unrest that followed the election -- more than double the government's official number. Both Moussavi and Karrubi were prevented from attending Wednesday's rallies, according to a reformist Web site, Norooz News. Karrubi's son told the Web site that his father tried to reach the Haft-e-Tir Square rally on foot, but he was blocked by anti-riot police, sparking clashes with his followers. Police fired tear gas toward Karrubi, hitting one of his guards on the head, and causing Karrubi and some of his supporters to fall to the ground, according to Norooz News. Karrubi and his followers returned to their vehicles and drove away when, at one point, security forces attacked and damaged Karrubi's vehicle, the Web site said. Video posted on YouTube showed Karrubi briefly opening his car door to a crowd of cheering supporters, who chanted, ""Honorable Karrubi, help the people of Iran."" Iranian authorities had warned Karrubi to not participate in the marches, saying he might be the victim of a suicide attack, according to Norooz News. Moussavi was unable to join the demonstration after his car was prevented from leaving his office, according to his Facebook page and a report on a reformist Web site. Cell phone and Internet connections were cut in the area where his office is located, and dozens of plainclothes motorcycle riders blocked the entrance and chanted slogans against Moussavi, the Web sites said. Read analysis from Hamid Dabashi, author of ""Iran: A People Interrupted"" In Washington, President Obama said the world continues to bear witness to the Iranian people's ""calls for justice and their courageous pursuit of universal rights."" ""Iran must choose,"" he said in a statement late Tuesday. ""We have heard for thirty years what the Iranian government is against; the question, now, is what kind of future it is for. ""It is time for the Iranian government to decide whether it wants to focus on the past, or whether it will make the choices that will open the door to greater opportunity, prosperity, and justice for its people,"" he said. Obama noted how the embassy takeover reshaped U.S.-Iranian relations. ""This event helped set the United States and Iran on a path of sustained suspicion, mistrust, and confrontation,"" he said. ""I have made it clear that the United States of America wants to move beyond this past, and seeks a relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran based upon mutual interests and mutual respect."" Obama said America has demonstrated willingness to work with Iran over nuclear issues by recognizing its right to peaceful nuclear power and accepting a recent proposal by the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency. ""We have made clear that if Iran lives up to the obligations that every nation has, it will have a path to a more prosperous and productive relationship with the international community,"" Obama said.

"(CNN) -- It says something about the popularity of ""Dancing With the Stars"" that the show's professional dancers have become almost as famous as the celebrities they're paired with. Mark Ballas and Shawn Johnson celebrate after winning last season's ""Dancing With the Stars."" Take Mark Ballas, who last season waltzed and tangoed his way to a first-place finish with Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson -- his second mirror ball trophy since he joined the hit series in 2007. At just 23, Ballas is already recognized on the street, he's in a band with fellow ""Dancing"" pro Derek Hough, and he's thinking about branching out into acting. For the new season of ""Dancing With the Stars,"" which begins Monday, Ballas is paired with Melissa Joan Hart, best known for her roles in the television series ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" and ""Clarissa Explains It All."" Ballas spoke to CNN about his new celebrity partner, his training routine and whether former ""American Idol"" judge Paula Abdul could find a new home on the show. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: What is Melissa Joan Hart like as a dancer? Mark Ballas: She's doing really well so far. I think she's going to shock a lot of people, and I think they will love her personality. She's really bright and bubbly. CNN: Does she have any dancing experience? Ballas: No, she's never danced before. I mean, she took a couple of ballet classes when she was a child, but everyone's done that. She's never danced like this before, so it's been a bit of a learning curve for her, but hopefully she'll smooth it out. CNN: Did you know who she was before you were matched? Ballas: Oh, yeah. I used to watch her shows all the time when I was younger. I would watch ""Clarissa Explains It All"" and ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch"" after school. CNN: Do you get any input in what celebrity you are paired with? Ballas: No, we get no choice whatsoever. It's basically [dependent on] whether they think our personalities will be compatible and also on height. You have to be the right height, because if someone is 6 feet and your partner is 5 feet, it won't work out. CNN: How do you choreograph dances? Do you like to use certain routines over again? Ballas: I start fresh every time. Having a good song is definitely helpful, and when you get a new song, it's really inspiring and makes you want to move, and that's the fun of it. You always want to keep things fresh, and I always keep challenging myself, like how can I outdo what I did last time? CNN: The facial expressions seem so important in ballroom dancing. How do you teach that to your celebrity partners? Ballas: That's something you can't teach. Obviously, you explain what the dance is and how you have to act and what you should be thinking, but you don't choreograph facial expressions. That's got to come from the heart and the soul, and you just have to feel it. CNN: If you have a celebrity partner like Kim Kardashian, who was criticized for being wooden on the dance floor, is there anything you can do? Ballas: The best thing to do is to make them feel comfortable. Kim got very shy when the cameras were on, and she would always dance a lot better off camera. But sometimes, dancing just isn't for certain people. Kim and I had a great time together and still are good friends to this day. But dancing wasn't her thing, she just didn't take to it. CNN: Do you keep in touch with your former partners? Ballas: Yes, I talk to Shawn [Johnson] and Kristi Yamaguchi all the time; I talked to Kim Kardashian about an hour ago. We stay good friends. Kristi Yamaguchi was amazing to work with -- great temperament, really eager to learn, she was like a machine. Kim Kardashian was a doll. We talk all the time, we hang out when we can, she's a lot of fun. Shawn Johnson was just a joy to work with, from start to finish. Just an absolute sweetheart. We had a lot of fun, we laughed a lot. CNN: A lot of people were surprised that actor Gilles Marini didn't win last season. What's your take on that? Ballas: I definitely feel that Shawn was the better dancer. Gilles was a great performer, but technically -- if you were looking at technique and you're looking at dancing -- Shawn was the stronger dancer. Her routines were a lot harder, her technique was a lot stronger ... especially in the last four weeks. I definitely feel like it was a fair result. CNN: Your father, Corky Ballas, who is also a professional dancer, made quite a splash when he was paired with 80-something Cloris Leachman on ""Dancing"" last year. Is he coming back to the show anytime soon? Ballas: I hope so. It was a lot of fun having him around, and I thought he was amazing, of course. They were a great team, absolutely hilarious. I'm sure if they ask him back, which I'm hoping they do, that he would definitely come back. CNN: There were some suggestions that Paula Abdul might join the show as a judge. What do you think about that? Ballas: I think that Paula would be great as a contestant. If she wanted to be on our show, she should come on to compete and be partnered with one of us. As far as the judges, I love our judges. I think our judges are great, and I think we've got a great system, and I don't think there would be any need for an extra judge. I love Paula -- I've met her several times because ""American Idol"" is right next door to us. I would love for her to come on the show and be my partner. CNN: Are you recognized on the street? Ballas: I have loads of people come up to me. They ask questions about the season. It's really nice, and I really appreciate it. CNN: Your fellow pros on ""Dancing,"" Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Karina Smirnoff, broke off their engagement recently. Is that going to affect the show in any way? Ballas: We're all very professional. These things happen. It will definitely not affect the show, we'll keep on dancing. You won't even be able to tell. I've talked to Max several times. He's doing OK. These things are never easy, and Max is a dear, dear friend of mine. I've known him for 13 years. CNN: What are your career goals beyond dancing? Ballas: I'm actually a guitar player and a singer/songwriter. I studied musical theater and music and vocals. Anything to do with music is definitely a big goal of mine. I've studied acting for 10 years, so I'd love to do film at some point as well.","Professional dancer Mark Ballas is paired with Melissa Joan Hart this season .

"(CNN) -- Huddled on the top floor of her home after waist-deep water inundated the lower story, Doranne Lim is bothered by the debris -- and the smell. Residents remove mud from a home Monday as waters recede in Marikina City, suburban Manila. ""My house is super, super messy,"" she said, speaking from her home in the eastern Manila suburb of Pasig City. The mud left behind by receding floodwaters -- caused when the nearby river flooded its banks -- is ""really smelly."" Her car won't start, probably because the engine is flooded. Her microwave and refrigerator won't function. Most of her possessions have been moved upstairs. Still, as one of the more than 1.8 million affected by recent floods, the 28-year-old Lim is counting her blessings. Her power is back on and she believes she can salvage most of her furniture. In addition, people she knows are still searching for missing friends and relatives in the flooding.  Are you there? Share your story or pictures . ""My office mate, she lives in a village with actually really nice houses,"" Lim said. ""She was sitting on her roof for 15 hours. They didn't save anything, nothing."" The floodwaters were beginning to subside in some areas Monday after a weekend that saw Manila hit with torrential rainfall caused by Typhoon Ketsana, which has since strengthened into a typhoon. Officials said the Philippine capital saw its heaviest rain in more than four decades. The water swallowed whole houses and buses. At least 240 people are dead, officials say.  See incredible images of the flooding Â» . Lim said she is cleaning up the smelly mess, but no one she knows has begun fixing the damage -- because another typhoon could be bearing down on the island nation in several days. Tracking maps show Tropical Storm Nineteen approaching the Philippines later this week. Lim submitted a photo to CNN's iReport site of people traveling down a flooded road -- a main thoroughfare -- in Pasig City. Some are wading through thigh-deep water; others are being pulled on rafts. Some opportunists are charging others money to pull them on rafts, she said. At the end of the road is a church and a market, she said. The market is not flooded, but is ""really, really muddy,"" she said. ""Most of the vendors in the market said they are going to sleep in the market tonight because they don't have any place to go."" Manila, on the island of Luzon, and the nearby province of Rizal bore the brunt of the storm. People like Lim's office mate huddled on rooftops Sunday waiting on army helicopters to pluck them to safety. Others used ropes to wade through waist-deep muddy waters.  Watch how people of Manila are coping Â» . Power and water supply failed in some areas. Roads were rendered impassable, making rescue efforts challenging. Rescue crews were handing out food rations. ""Right now the challenge is to find out how many people have actually died and how many people we have to take care of in terms of people who've been displaced,"" said Richard Gordon, the chairman of the Philippines National Red Cross. He estimated up to 300,000 people have been displaced on the island of Luzon alone. Another Pasig City resident, Arturo Fidelino, said 80 percent of his village was flooded. He counts himself lucky that his home was not inundated, but his family had to evacuate and move in with his in-laws because nearby streets were impassable. Fidelino said he and his wife have to get to work, and their 14-year-old daughter has to get to school. Fidelino said his family was stuck in their home for two days, before a relative who owns heavy machinery was able to remove them. ""It's our first time to experience that kind of flood,"" he said, estimating it could take about a month for the waters to completely recede. He said many of his neighbors remain stuck in their homes, as the homeowners' association organizes a removal effort. Other Pasig City residents were evacuated to temporary shelters set up in a municipal hall or gymnasium, he said. Officials worried that if the rains return, they could bring more floods if reservoirs burst. ""We're hoping that there will be no more breaching of the dams,"" Gordon said. ""That's one of the things that are very disconcerting to many people right now."" Fidelino said many Filipinos aren't sure if the flooding was caused by the typhoon or by the opening of dams. ""It was so sudden,"" he said. ""It was sort of a flash flood."" The floodwaters contained all sorts of animals as well -- snails, snakes, Lim said. Two crocodiles escaped from the zoo, she said -- ""it's funny, but it's scary."" ""I'm happy that I'm a lot better off than so many other people I see on TV, clinging to electric posts, electric wires, so they won't be carried away (by the water),"" she said. ""I have friends who are still missing their siblings, missing their dogs."" Both she and Fidelino said residents have banded together to help one another. Lim said that after her electricity was restored, she got on Facebook, where she saw numerous posts from people seeking missing friends or loved ones. Members of the media and even the government were trying to help on the social networking site, asking them to send more information. Some people are putting together ""relief bags"" of food and other items to distribute to those in shelters, while others were bringing canned goods, Lim said. ""Everyone is united right now to help feed everyone,"" she said. Others are just trying to feed themselves. John Gonzalez, 11, has been pushing a trolley through his flooded neighborhood in Manila's Marietta Romeo village for two days. ""The flood went above the height of a man,"" he said. ""Way above our heads. Today, the water just comes to my mouth. That's why we are out looking for food.""

"DALLAS, Texas (CNN)  -- Texas terrorism suspect Hosam Smadi recorded a seven-minute video message for al Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden before his arrest on charges of plotting to blow up a Dallas building, an FBI agent testified Monday. Hosam Maher Husein Smadi said through his lawyer that he understood the charges Friday. No details of the message were provided in court. But FBI Special Agent Thomas Petrowski said the video was recorded in a hotel room with the assistance of undercover FBI operatives and Smadi intended for it to be delivered to or seen by bin Laden, the fugitive leader of the terrorist network behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Smadi, a 19-year-old Jordanian living in the United States illegally, is charged with plotting to set off a bomb at the base of the 60-story Fountain Plaza office tower in downtown Dallas. He was arrested September 24 after federal agents said he tried to trigger an improvised bomb attached to a vehicle at the base of the building. At a brief hearing in Dallas on Monday, Magistrate Judge Irma Ramirez ordered Smadi bound over for future hearings. Peter Fleury, the public defender representing Smadi, told reporters that his client remains held under immigration law, with no bail set. Fleury called his client ""a scared 19-year-old kid held away from his family,"" who could face additional charges from a grand jury. Prosecutors don't have to share the evidence against Smadi until after a grand jury acts, so lawyers don't know the full extent of the case against him, Fleury said. ""We have got a lot of work to do,"" he said. ""They have had the case since March. We just got the case. We're way behind them."" Friends in the town of Italy, Texas, about 45 miles south of Dallas, said Smadi was outgoing and friendly -- but one told CNN last week that the teen started showing signs of depression about six months ago, around the same time the FBI started believing he was serious about carrying out a bomb plot. CNN's Tracy Sabo contributed to this report.","FBI: Suspect recorded video in hotel; intended for Osama bin Laden to see it .

"(CNN) -- Indigenous Indians located nine survivors of a plane that crashed in a river in the Amazon rain forest with 11 people onboard, according to the Brazilian air force. The nine passengers were in good health, the air force said Friday. Of the two people missing -- a passenger and a crew member -- one is believed to be dead. The air force did not provide further details. The plane was on its way to deliver health supplies Thursday when it crashed. It had taken off from Cruzeiro do Sul in Acre state and was headed to Tabatinga in Amazonas state. The plane landed in the Itui River between the tribe settlements of Aurelio and Rio Novo. Indians of the Matis tribe, who live in Aurelio, initially located the plane and alerted the Brazilian air force, which sent search planes to the site. Before the passengers were located, at least eight aircraft had been dispatched for the search operation, the air force said. Members of the Matis, an indigenous tribe of about 300, live deep in the rain forest. Other area tribes were helping in a search for the two missing passengers along the shores of the Itui.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The U.S. State Department has sold its London embassy building to a Qatari real estate company, the embassy announced Tuesday. The signing of the deal is another major step in the embassy's plans to relocate from its longtime headquarters in central London to a new site in Wandsworth, on the south bank of the River Thames. It wasn't immediately clear how much Qatari Diar Real Estate paid for the embassy building in Grosvenor Square, whose 1960s facade was recently given listed status, meaning its design can't be changed. The embassy will continue to operate from the current building until the new one is completed in 2016 or 2017, the embassy said. Construction is expected to begin in 2012 or 2013. It was a year ago that the embassy announced it was looking for a new site that is more modern, open, and secure than the current building in London's West End. It has now settled on a site in Wandsworth and is having a design competition for the new building. When the embassy does move to Wandsworth, it will mark the end of a more than 200-year association with Grosvenor Square, in the historic and exclusive neighborhood of Mayfair near Hyde Park. John Adams, who later became U.S. president, lived on the square from 1785 to 1788, when he was the first U.S. minister to the Court of St. James. The building in which he lived still stands in the square's northeast corner. The embassy moved to various locations in the West End before returning to Grosvenor Square in 1938. For years, it occupied a building on the east side of the square -- a building that now houses the Canadian High Commission. During World War II, the square was known as ""Little America"" because the embassy was on one side and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters were on the other. The embassy moved to its current site, occupying the entire west side of the square, when the building was completed in 1960. The concrete, four-story structure was designed by Eero Saarinen, who also designed the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, and the U.S. Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the embassy has caused controversy locally by installing blast walls in a wide perimeter around the building. Neighbors complained the walls were unsightly, and the walls caused the road in front of the building to be closed to traffic. Sitting atop the building at the front is a huge gilded aluminum eagle with a 35-foot wingspan. It is not clear whether the eagle will be considered part of the building's listed status, meaning it will have to stay on the facade, or whether it can be moved to the new location, according to a spokesman for the realty firm Cushman and Wakefield, which advised the United States on the sale.","Qatari firm buys landmark U.S. Embassy building in Grosvenor Square .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating how an international flight into Atlanta's major airport landed on a taxiway instead of a runway early Monday. FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said Delta Flight 60, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, was cleared to land about 6:05 a.m. Monday on Runway 27R but landed instead on Taxiway M, which runs parallel to the runway. The flight had 194 passengers and crew aboard, according to CNN affiliate WXIA. No other aircraft were on the taxiway, and there was no damage to either the taxiway or the plane, a Boeing 767, Bergen said. A runway or taxiway collision, particularly with one plane preparing to take off and carrying a full fuel load, would be catastrophic. Bergen said she isn't sure whether or when other aircraft have ever landed on the taxiway at Hartsfield. Both Runway 27R and Taxiway M are 11,890 feet long, Bergen said, but the runway is marked with white lights while the taxiway is marked with blue lights. Delta spokesman Anthony Black said the airline is cooperating with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board in their investigation, as well as conducting an internal investigation. The pilots of the flight have been relieved from active flying pending the completion of these investigations, Black said. Bergen and Black said a medical emergency was reported on the plane, but neither offered any details. The incursion came just two weeks after the FAA announced that serious runway incursions were down 50 percent from the year that ended September 30, 2008, over the year ending on the same date this year. The FAA said there were 12 serious incursions in 2009 and 25 in 2008. Only two of the serious incursions involved commercial airliners in 2009, compared with nine in 2008. The FAA defines a serious incursion as one in which a collision is narrowly avoided, or there was a significant potential for collision that resulted in the need to take quick corrective action.","Plane landed on taxiway instead of runway Monday morning, FAA says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Los Angeles firefighters and city crews worked for several hours Tuesday to rescue one of their own: a 22-ton firetruck that was nearly swallowed by a water-logged sinkhole. Two firefighters crawled out of the truck's windows after it sank Tuesday morning. No one was injured. The incident happened after four firefighters took the truck to the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Valley Village, where flooding had been reported after a water main break, just before 6 a.m. PT. After seeing running water in the road, a fire captain instructed the rig's driver to back up and had two firefighters get out of the truck to direct it. That's when the ground gave way and the front of the truck began quickly sinking. The driver and captain crawled out of the truck's windows to escape. The four firefighters were not injured. Workers had to simultaneously pull and lift the truck to get it out of the sinkhole. Watch workers pull truck from sinkhole .

"London, England (CNN) -- It may run contrary to the conventional image of a sport obsessed with the latest technological improvement but, from Stockholm to Shanghai, players are turning back the clock to take part in the latest craze -- hickory golf. The game, which involves using 19th century wooden-shafted clubs, has proved a hit as national championships in the United States, Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Sweden and Finland have blossomed. Companies too have been attracted to the format as a way of motivating staff. ""Golfers love a challenge,"" says Gavin Bottrell, who runs hickory golf days in Britain. ""There's a saying about modern golf clubs that you can buy any shot out of the shop. Playing with hickory makes people think more about their swing and be clever about their shots."" Hickory clubs were used widely until the 1930s, when manufacturers turned to more modern materials for construction. However, despite their lesser performance, the attraction of dressing up in old-fashioned golfing garb and hacking around 18 holes with mashies, niblicks and cleeks -- the evocative names given to the clubs used by Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen and Henry Cotton -- has endured. The format has a huge following in the U.S. where devotees gather at historic courses to play an ""authentic"" round of golf. Hampton Munsey, who organizes the U.S. Hickory Open in Morganton, North Carolina, says the size of the field has almost doubled since the event was first held in 2008. This year's tournament already has entrants from Sweden and Germany, with players' ages ranging from 20 to 70. ""The camaraderie is almost as important as the game itself,"" says Munsey, a member of the Society of Hickory Golfers. ""People feel a certain level of pride at being able to play with the old clubs and do well with them."" Bottrell, a university researcher, has been buying and selling hickory clubs since 1995. He now has 60 full sets, which he rents out to companies as a package for $934. Recently, he has noticed an increase in interest from abroad, with amateur golfers from Germany, South Korea and Australia all wanting their own slice of hickory history. But Bottrell's profit margins are nothing compared to one Scottish collector. In April last year, Edinburgh antiques dealer John Dixon sold 7,000 clubs to a Chinese entrepreneur for $193,500.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich stayed level on points with German Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen after beating Borussia Dortmund 3-1 in Saturday's late match. Unbeaten Leverkusen had defeated defending champions Wolfsburg 2-1 earlier in the day, but Bayern joined them on 48 points after 22 matches as Bayern came from behind with a victory that left the two teams separated by just one goal on for-and-against differential. Third-placed Schalke will seek to reduce their six-point deficit on the leaders with victory at home to Cologne on Sunday. Leverkusen took the lead three minutes after halftime at their BayArena ground as Stefan Reinartz pounced to score after veteran goalkeeper Andre Lenz spilled a free-kick by Toni Kroos. The hapless 36-year-old handed Leverkusen a second goal 20 minutes later in unfortunate circumstances as home striker Eren Derdiyok's header from another Kroos set-piece hit the bar, rebounded onto Lenz's leg and into the net. Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko pulled a goal back in the 79th minute but his side could not force an equalizer, and have now slumped to 14th place -- 23 points behind the leaders. Borussia Dortmund took a fifth-minute lead against Bayern Munich as Egypt's Africa Cup of Nations winner Mohamed Zidan profited from a mistake by defender Daniel Van Buyten. Bayern could already have been 2-0 down at that stage as Martin Demichelis and Mark Van Bommel cleared two shots off the line by Sven Bender. Van Bommel leveled in the 21st minute as the Dutch midfielder beat Dortmund goalkeeper Marc Ziegler  from 20 yards, then compatriot Arjen Robben made it 2-1 five minutes after halftime when he was set up by France playmaker Franck Ribery, making his first start this year following injury problems. Ribery was again the provider as striker Mario Gomez sealed Bayern's ninth successive league victory in the 65th minute, cutting in from the left to beat Ziegler on the angle. Hamburg went three points clear of Dortmund in fourth place with a 3-1 win at Stuttgart as new signing Ruud Van Nistelrooy scored his first goals for the club. The veteran Dutch striker came off the bench in the 65th minute with the score at 1-1 to make his second outing since arriving from Real Madrid, scoring two typically opportunist efforts in three minutes as Stuttgart boss Christian Gross suffered his first defeat since taking the job in December. Sixth-placed Werder Bremen crushed third-bottom Hannover 5-1 away, scoring four times in the first half, while Bochum moved eight points clear of the bottom three with a 2-1 win at home to mid-table Hoffenheim. Basement side Hertha Berlin came from behind to earn a 1-1 draw at home to eighth-placed Mainz, but are still four points behind second-bottom Nuremberg, who lost 2-1 at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday night.","Bayern Munich stay level on points with German Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen .

"(CNN)  -- Police met a wayward jet that overshot the runway by 150 miles -- while not responding to control tower communications -- and said the pilots were ""cooperative, apologetic and appreciative."" Authorities are reviewing the plane's cockpit voice recorder as well as its flight data recorder. The Minneapolis-St. Paul [Minnesota] Airport Police report on the incident, released Friday, said officers asked flight attendants to keep passengers in their seats while they checked out the cockpit, where, they said, ""the door was standing open."" The police report identified the pilot as Timothy B. Cheney and the first officer as Richard I. Cole. ""The pilot ... indicated they had become involved in conversation and had not heard radio communications,"" the report said. ""They indicated there had been no involvement from anyone in the cabin."" ""Both volunteered to a preliminary breath test with the result being .000 for both parties,"" the report said. The lead flight attendant, the report said, told officers that she was unaware there had been an incident aboard. Northwest Flight 188 -- carrying 144 people and five crew members -- flew past the Minneapolis airport during a mysterious 78 minutes of radio silence beginning about 7:56 p.m. ET Wednesday night. The Airbus A320 was carrying 147 passengers and an unknown number of crew members, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Air traffic controllers re-established radio contact after the plane had flown about 150 miles past its destination.  Watch how Flight 188 drama unfolded Â» . The National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident, is hoping the plane's cockpit voice recorder will either confirm the pilot's account or provide evidence of another possible explanation, including whether the captain and first officer had fallen asleep. However, approached outside his home Friday, the first officer told CNN affiliate KGW that ""nobody was asleep in the cockpit and no arguments took place."" Cole was referring to NTSB's earlier statement that said, ""The crew stated they were in a heated discussion over airline policy and they lost situational awareness."" ""There's a lot of misinterpretation going on,"" Cole said, though he refused to comment further. The voice recorder is capable of recording only 30 minutes of audio, federal accident investigators said Friday. The plane was in the air for another 45 minutes after radio contact was restored, meaning that if the recorder was working properly, anything the pilots would have said during the time they were not answering radio calls would have been recorded over. But a former accident investigator told CNN the voice recorder may still provide valuable information, because the pilots could have discussed the earlier events on the way back to Minneapolis. The separate flight data recorder also could prove valuable because it would have recorded actions taken by the pilots during the 78 minutes they did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers, the former accident investigator said. The safety board said Friday afternoon that experts were reviewing the solid-state voice recorder. It said only that the recorder ""captured a portion of the flight that is being analyzed,"" and added there would be no further comment. Watch as former NTSB official calls long silence ""unacceptable"" Â» . Meanwhile, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which scrambled fighter jets for the wayward plane did not launch them, said it was reviewing procedures for launching the fighters to track potentially hijacked or suspicious aircraft. At issue, according to a senior U.S. official directly familiar with the timeline of the incident, is the FAA's apparent delay in notifying NORAD that the Northwest jet was not in contact with controllers. The official, who declined to be identified because both the military and the FAA are reviewing the entire incident, said that the FAA's request for military involvement came after the plane passed the Minneapolis airport. NORAD scrambled fighter jets at two locations. But as they approached the runway for takeoff, the FAA reported being back in contact with the Northwest flight, and the fighters stayed on the ground. ""My real question is why we did not know of the 'radio out' situation from the FAA sooner,"" the officials said. ""The FAA is also looking into that,"" the official told CNN. Since the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, NORAD has regularly launched fighter jets to track aircraft in unusual situations such as when they deviate from flight plans, lose radio contact or enter restricted airspace. According to a second U.S. official, NORAD is in constant contact with the FAA so it can respond when situations arise. Reported instances of two pilots falling asleep are rare. In August, the safety board concluded its investigation into a February 13, 2008, incident in which two pilots aboard a Go airlines flight fell asleep and traveled 26 miles beyond the destination of Hilo, Hawaii, before waking and contacting air traffic controllers. Northwest Airlines is part of Delta Air Lines, which issued a statement Thursday, saying it is ""cooperating with the FAA and NTSB in their investigation, as well as conducting our own internal investigation. The pilots have been relieved from active flying pending the completion of these investigations."" It said Flight 188 landed safely in Minneapolis just after 9 p.m. Delta suffered another major embarrassment this week when a Delta pilot landed a passenger jet on a taxiway at Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport instead of the runway. The  NTSB is investigating that case as well. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Airport police report identifies pilot and first officer .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A court order issued Monday blocks five Americans arrested in Pakistan last week from being deported or being handed over to the FBI, officials said. ""All the government functionaries, including federal government or provincial governments are directed not to hand over the alleged detainees [Americans] to any American agencies, or any other foreign agencies,"" the order said, according to Faisal Zaman, attorney for the government of Pakistan's Punjab province. The five were arrested Wednesday amid suspicion that they were plotting terrorist attacks. They were transferred Saturday from Sargodha, a small town where they were seized, to a more secure location in Lahore, police said. The court order was a response to a petition from Khalid Khawaja, a former Pakistani intelligence official and founder of an organization called Defense of Human Rights of Pakistan. Under Pakistani law, any citizen can file a petition with a court. The Lahore High Court scheduled a hearing for Thursday and ordered the government to respond to Khawaja's petition. A police report on the interrogation of the American suspects, dated Thursday, focused on one identified as Ahmed Abdullah Minni, a 20-year-old born in Virginia. The report said he regularly goes online to watch attacks on the U.S. military in Afghanistan and that he left comments praising the actions. That caught the attention of militants, and he eventually was contacted by a person named Saifullah, the report said. After contact had been made, a Yahoo e-mail account was set up so the men and militants could communicate, the report says. E-mails were never sent from the account, but people would leave messages in the draft section of the e-mail account and delete them after reading them, the Pakistani police report said. ""This mode of communication enabled them to pass on messages without fear of interception by the FBI,"" the report said. It said the suspects made a plan with Saifullah to go from Pakistan to Afghanistan. They gathered in Karachi and left for Hyderabad on December 1. They tried to hook up with two militant groups, Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, but neither of them showed interest. The FBI said Pakistani authorities detained the men -- four of whom it said were found to have American passports. Along with Minni, there were snapshots and brief profiles of four others -- Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan and Ramy Zamzam -- all from the Washington area. Police in Sargodha took a sixth man -- Khalid Farooq, father of Umar -- into custody, and he was undergoing questioning at a safe location. Authorities have said Khalid Farooq has not been considered a suspect. CNN's Samson Desta and Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Pakistani court order bars deportation of five Americans .

"(CNN) -- Hondurans divided over an ongoing political crisis agree on one thing -- they don't think very highly of their leaders, according to a new survey. Almost half of Hondurans polled -- 48 percent -- said they disapproved of the job President Jose Manuel Zelaya was doing before he was ousted in a coup on June 28, said the 2009 Latinobarometro survey. The man who assumed power after the coup, de facto President Roberto Micheletti, received a disapproval rating of 65 percent for how he has handled the crisis, according to the survey. The annual Latinobarometro survey, named after the Chile-based non-profit company of the same name, is among the most highly regarded polls in the region. This year, the poll asked a number of questions that shed light on how Hondurans and other Latin Americans viewed the political crisis in Honduras. A new Honduran president, Pepe Lobo Sosa, was elected last month, though the international community is split on whether to recognize him because the vote took place under the rule of the de facto government. An agreement between negotiators for Zelaya and Micheletti had been reached earlier, but lost much credibility when its implementation didn't go as planned. Zelaya, who remains holed up inside the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital ever since covertly sneaking back into his country in September, has called the plan dead. Several attempts to find a resolution failed, despite strong international criticism of the coup. ""It can be said that the force of rejection of all the international organizations, which were raised in a singular voice against the coup and in favor of the restitution of the constitutionally elected president, were ineffective against the local political forces that had expelled Zelaya in an ignominious manner,"" the survey said. The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya's desire to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president. The country's congress had outlawed the vote, and the supreme court had ruled it illegal. Micheletti and his supporters say Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup. According to Latinobarometro, 58 percent of Hondurans disapproved of the coup, while another 28 percent said they approved of Zelaya's ouster. Those more heavily in favor of the coup included those with a higher education and the elderly, the survey found. Of those with university degrees, 40 percent approved of the coup, compared with 27 percent approval among those with only a basic education, the survey said. Zelaya faced long odds of returning to the presidency because the supreme court and congress, including lawmakers from his own party, were against his calls for the referendum that led to his ouster. These political power brokers, and in general, the Honduran elite that backed Micheletti, likely account for the discrepancy between education level and views of the coup. In Honduras, the elite are more likely to have completed university than others. The low approval ratings for Zelaya point to his thin election victory in 2005, according to Latinobarometro. The leftist Zelaya was elected with just under 50 percent of the vote. That margin hardly gave him a mandate to push the sweeping constitutional reforms he wanted, the survey said. ""Manuel Zelaya wanted to implement reforms that were beyond what the majority supported,"" the report said. Outside of Honduras, 24 percent of respondents in the other Latin American countries approved of the coup, the Latinobarometro survey found. Asked to rate Honduran democracy on a scale of 1 to 10, those outside of the country said the Central American nation merited a 5.2, the survey said. It was the first time that the firm asked for people to give their perception of democracy in a country that was not their own. Latinobarometro also asked respondents in the region whether they believed a coup was possible in their own country. The highest affirmative responses came from countries that have left-leaning presidents. Ecuadorians (36 percent), Brazilians (34 percent) and Venezuelans (30 percent) said a coup was possible in their country.","The annual Latinobarometro survey is a highly regarded poll .

"MORROW, Georgia (CNN) -- Jobless for nearly a year, Michael Rivers was about to walk out of his house a few weeks ago to catch the bus for another daylong employment hunt when a radio announcement stopped him. With Ludacris at her side, single mom Joya Montgomery, 26, proudly displays keys to her car Sunday. ""This is Ludacris, and I'm giving away 20 free cars. ..."" The famous rapper was pulling an Oprah in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. The rapper announced that if listeners were able to pay the taxes, registration, tags and insurance, they should go to his nonprofit Ludacris Foundation Web site and write 300 words about why they deserved new wheels. ""And make it good,"" Luda warned.  Watch Ludacris talk about his ""stimulus"" plan Â» . Four thousand people took him up on his challenge, and in a few days, more than 2,000 essays poured into the Nissan South dealership in Morrow, Georgia, that had teamed with the rapper on the used-car giveaway.  See and hear the winners tell their stories Â» . Rivers' essay was among them. ""I didn't even wait; I just continued out that door to the community center, sat at a computer and let all my emotions come out,"" he said. Rivers described riding the city bus with his 14-year-old daughter to make sure she arrived safely at school and how he recently celebrated the small victory of getting his 17-year-old autistic son, who can't tolerate crowds, to stand calmly for a few moments outside the bus stop. He doesn't live near a grocery store so he has to bring home the food he can carry on the bus. Rivers was laid off from his job as a court clerk in the summer of 2008, and making job interviews on time isn't easy when the bus is often late. But on Sunday afternoon, Rivers was giddy, slightly bouncing as he spoke. He stood shoulder to shoulder among the 20 winners and their friends and families waiting to see their cars. ""I don't care what it is,"" Rivers said. ""I'm grateful for any car with four wheels because it beats two heels."" Winners received 30 days of free gas, which will be a big help to Joya Montgomery, a 26-year-old single parent of a 4-year-old, 8-year-old and 3-month-old. She has been waking before 5 a.m. and walking to the bus stop, while it's dark, with her children to begin a long journey to her job and to drop them off at school or a friend's home. ""It was scary at times,"" she said. ""You don't even know who's out there. I was always looking over my shoulder. ""I just can't believe I won. I'm real happy."" In the parking lot, the crowd was dancing. But the bass of Ludacris' latest single blasting from the dealership's loudspeakers was secondary inspiration for one Atlanta grandmother. Fifty-one-year-old Vermelle Jackson was so excited to have a 2005 Mercury Sable to drive around grandchildren, nieces and nephews that she swiveled her hips around and dipped it shockingly low to the ground. ""Lord Jesus. ... He brought this car to me, baby!"" she shouted, arms raised. ""This is God's work!"" Actually, the giveaway idea came from Chris White, the jovial, hand-shaking manager of Nissan South. ""I knew someone who knew someone who knew Luda and, you know, we just made it happen,"" White said. The concept seemed like a winner for everyone. Like many dealerships, Nissan South has not yet been reimbursed for the money it spent upfront during the federal government's Cash for Clunkers program that allowed customers to trade in older cars for $3,500 or $4,500 credit. When the popular program ended August 24, the car dealer didn't want to turn away customers who kept streaming in, expecting to get the same discounts. So Nissan South continued giving customers identical low rates and taking their used cars. The Cash for Clunkers program and the continued discounts totaled nearly $800,000 in the hole for the dealership, said owner Scott Smith. ""We're grateful for the Clunkers program because it really helped business, but it's a lot of money to be without,"" he said. At the end of the year, the cars given away under the Luda program, which were not technically acquired during the Clunkers program, may be eligible as charity tax write-offs. ""We like to think of it as not being about the write-offs,"" White said. ""It's more like we had a chance to do something positive in the community that is going through a really hard time right now."" White helped place a few radio spots and within two days, more than 2,000 essays had been sent in. That number quickly shot to close to 4,000. Ludacris and his mother, Roberta Shields, who directs his foundation and helped give away the cars Sunday, and the rapper's foundation staff of about a dozen helped read the essays. To validate the stories they found most compelling, they made phone calls and interviewed people who knew the finalists. ""We ended up calling a homeless shelter to reach one gentleman whose cell phone had gone out, and he was recharging it,"" Shields said. ""We didn't know if we'd get ahold of him, but we finally did. All he wanted was a car to help him go out for job interviews."" Ludacris was particularly moved by the story of a Sudanese refugee who has experienced every hardship imaginable, the least of which was a broken-down car. The two sat down Sunday and had a long talk. ""That's one of those stories that really had me like, man, I thought I had faced some adversities in life,"" the rapper said in a quiet moment away from the crowd. ""But I've not faced adversities at all compared to what he's been through. I cannot imagine going through what he's gone through and still be that strong."" Mading Duor, who escaped civil war and was providing for his four children on a school maintenance worker's salary, was crossing a street in Decatur, Georgia, when a driver ignored a crosswalk and hit and killed his 4-year-old son. Karen McCrea, who attends church with Duor, wrote the winning essay. ""I don't expect anyone to understand [what I have been through], but I know that people come to me with a good heart now,"" he said. ""I couldn't believe it when she called me to tell me. I said, 'You are kidding! It cannot be!' "" Neither McCrea, from Atlanta's affluent Buckhead area, nor Duor, neatly dressed in a shirt buttoned to the collar, seemed like Ludacris' demographic. They nodded their heads to his music anyway, smiling. ""Oh, I know his music, I know it, yes,"" Duor said. ""I will play it [in my car].""","Some 4,000 essays received after dealership partners with rapper for giveaway .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A 219-year-old document that stemmed from alcohol tariffs to pay off Revolutionary War debts -- and signed by Alexander Hamilton -- became the property of The National Archives on Thursday. This document, signed by Alexander Hamilton, discusses tools for customs agents to determine alcohol content for imported spirits. The historic letter, which has been the property of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) for the past 35 years, chronicles the federal government's earliest efforts to regulate alcohol. In the document, Hamilton, the first United States secretary of the Treasury, discusses tools for customs agents to determine -- for tax purposes -- the alcohol content of St. Croix rum and other imported spirits. Historians said the document is a notable footnote in American history. In 1789 and again in 1790, Congress imposed alcohol tariffs to pay Revolutionary War debts. In response to the tax on imports, Americans began distilling their own spirits. And when the federal government began taxing those beverages, citizens staged the ""Whiskey Rebellion,"" harassing and threatening federal agents in several cities. But in 1794, the government squelched the uprising, helping to establish the federal government's authority in disputes with individual states. Even non-historians might appreciate the timelessness of the dog-eared document, given its skillful use of bureaucratic language to deliver bad news. One eye-glazing, 76-word sentence probably can be summarized as follows: ""We don't have the thermometers you'll need, so for now, use the ones you've got."" The document, dated Dec. 18, 1790, is an original draft of a ""circular letter,"" an official memo that would have been hand-copied and sent to customs officers, historians said. ""In this circular letter, Hamilton attempts to provide customs officers with new tools to more efficiently do their jobs,"" said Kenneth Melson, acting director of ATF. Hamilton notes that he is sending a hydrometer -- used to determine the specific gravity or density of liquids -- to ports so that customs officers can determine the proof of imported beverages. Hamilton says he intends to provide two hydrometers to every port; one to be used as a standard or check. ""But it is not possible in the first instance to send both. Hence one only will accompany this letter,"" he writes. In a postscript, he adds that he is also sending a ""Tin Cylinder"" to hold liquor while its alcohol content is being measured. Archivists said the early history of the Hamilton circular is not known. But in the mid-1970s, an ATF spokesman and autograph collector -- Howard Criswell Jr. -- came across the letter in a catalog from an autograph dealer in New York City. He purchased it for about $100, intending to use it in an ATF bicentennial exhibit. Criswell, now 84, is retired and lives in Maryland. The document remained in an ATF safe until it was rediscovered by ATF employees during a relocation of its headquarters building in 2005. ATF officials said they had once planned to frame the letter, but were told that it would be damaged by exposure to light. The National Archives said the document will become part of its permanent holdings and will be preserved in a locked, temperature and humidity-controlled stack area at its facility in College Park, Maryland.","Document chronicles the federal government's earliest efforts to regulate alcohol .

"Yabuli, China (CNN) -- Insulated in designer skiwear against a temperature of -15Â° Celsius, three of China's burgeoning ski set bundle into a gondola headed to a wind-swept mountaintop in Heilongjiang province, Northeastern China. These new members of China's skiing elite had traveled from Harbin three hours drive away for a day's skiing at Sun Mountain, Yabuli, and clearly relished hurtling downhill at one of the country's newest high-end resorts. ""Control your speed"" is good advice for any novice skier, but it could be equally applied to the growing number of businesses aiming to tap into the nascent Chinese skiing industry. Skiing is just the latest market in China touted to ""boom"" as an increasingly affluent middle class finds new ways to spend their wealth and leisure time. The China Ski Association put the number of skiers in China at 5 million in 2005, up from just 200,000 in 2000. The association predicts 20 million skiers by 2014. ""But around 80 percent will probably never do it again, because the experience is so bad,"" says Graham Kwan, CEO of Melco China Resorts the developers of Sun Mountain, Yabuli. It's a factor that has held back the momentum of the Chinese ski industry, where the image is still one of bumpy nursery slopes crowded with first-time skiers snow-ploughing into one another. ""The industry isn't developing as fast as it should,"" says Justin Downes, president of Axis Leisure, a Beijing-based resort industry consultancy. ""Ninety percent of skiers are still considered beginners and rent their equipment. The quality of the product and safety has often been questionable, service has been poor."" Kwan hopes Sun Mountain will provide Chinese skiers with a five-star destination resort that keeps novices coming back to the slopes. Others developers are following suit. French resort company Club Med plans to open a dedicated ski village in China at the end of the year, the first of five the company plans to open by 2015. China's Wanda group have plans on a resort in the mountains bordering North Korea, and a resort called Beijing Secret Garden is being developed outside of Beijing near the Great Wall. Since opening last year Sun Mountain has gained accolades, including TIME Magazine's Best Resort Make-over in 2009. Yabuli was also the site of the World University Games in 2009, with a reported $400 million invested by the government in updating the facilities and improving transport links to the area, making it the base for China's national ski team. For Kwan, however, transforming a sleepy town with one aging hotel at the bottom of a mountain has been far from a smooth ride. ""To be perfectly honest, it's been a struggle,"" says Kwan. ""It's easy to have a mountain in China. People often ask, 'Why did you put [the resort] here?' There are beautiful mountains [elsewhere], but too far from the market. Chinese people travel like Europeans; they're North-South travelers."" With over $100 million invested in Sun Mountain, Kwan hopes it will be the centerpiece of the new face of skiing in China, offering more than just well-groomed slopes and aprÃ¨s-ski with a Chinese twist. ""It's a combination of operations and real estate, you can't sell luxury homes if you don't sell luxury products,"" says Kwan. A new boutique hotel at the top of the 1000-meter mountain will open next year and capacity eventually expanded to 15 hotels. But it is the resort's real estate that will be just as important to how fast the area develops. Around 75 houses are already built with almost a thousand more nestled on the mountainside planned for the next 10 years. ""The concept of buying a recreational home in the mountains when it's -20Â° Celsius is not something the Chinese have grasped yet,"" says Downes. ""The ski market [in China] is so small that you can't expect to put $100 million into a project and hope to recoup that any time soon off your ski operations. But the leisure real estate market is also immature in China."" As well as selling the resort as an investment opportunity, nurturing the culture of skiing is part of the development. Its absence is something that Downes believes is really hampering the market. ""When I went to work in a ski resort it's because I wanted to ski all day and party all night. The people who go to work in Chinese ski resorts don't have any aspirations to do any of those things,"" says Downes. A few gold medals by Chinese skiers at the Winter Olympics could help create a buzz around the sport itself, but for Kwan and Downes, presenting a gold-standard lifestyle is just as important. ""All their gear is high-end, because of course it represents their status. And that's why we've chosen to go higher end, because those kinds of customers want to be with us,"" says Kwan, who plans to add VIP gondolas with heated seats and sound system at Sun Mountain, as well as slope-side tea service. ""You can't just pick up a Whistler or Three Valleys pop it into China and expect it to be successful,"" adds Downes. ""Because while Chinese skiers want all the positive trapping they also want something that is theirs -- food and cultural elements, but delivered at a much higher level. ""The younger generation is getting money, traveling and getting more adventurous, they're the ones who are going to define the industry.""","China's ski industry seen as a huge growth market for up-scale resort developers .

"(CNN) -- A Saudi court on Wednesday sentenced a man who caused uproar by bragging about his sex life on television to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes, according to Ministry of Information officials. Mazen Abdul Jawad talked openly about his sex life on the controversial show. Mazen Abdul Jawad, a 32-year-old airline employee and divorced father of four, spoke openly about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14. He made the comments on Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, which aired the interview a few months ago. Saudi authorities shut down LBC offices in Jeddah and Riyadh after airing the interview on an episode of its popular show ""A Thick Red Line."" Jawad was arrested shortly after the program aired and charged with violating Saudi Arabia's crime of publicizing vice. On the program, Jawad is also shown in his bedroom, where he holds sexual aids up to the camera. The room is decorated with Mickey Mouse and stuffed bears in sexually suggestive positions. The cameras gave audiences a glimpse of the room's nightclub-like chandeliers mixed with seafood-shaped wall sconces, perfume bottles and a book in Arabic, ""101 Questions About Sex,"" that Jawad calls his ""reference."" Jawad, wearing a red shirt, explained that he put his phone number and details about his car -- a red Mini Cooper -- on his mobile phone's Bluetooth. He says women usually call him to ask if the car is for sale but, he boasts, ""some go out with me that same night."" The episode ended with him cruising the streets of Jeddah in his car looking for women. The show that aired Jawad's story is as popular as it is controversial in the Middle East. It tackles taboos sometimes never discussed in public. In one instance, a guest admitted he put up his children for sale and tried to justify why he continued to look for the highest bidder even though his kids were begging him to change his mind.

Speaking about promiscuous acts ""is a violation of the sharia regulations on the one hand and against Saudi customs on the other,"" police spokesman Suleiman Al-Mutawae told Arab News, an English-language daily newspaper in Saudi Arabia. Before Jawad's detention, Arab News reported that he initiated a damage-control campaign, apologized for his comments and was considering filing a complaint against the show's producers for presenting him ""in the worst possible manner by taking two hours of footage and condensing it down to a minutes-long segment."" Jawad's lawyer could not be reached for comment. The ministry officials spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity.","Mazen Abdul Jawad, divorced father of 4, spoke openly about sex escapades .

"Camp Lejeune, North Carolina (CNN) -- On a base accustomed to deploying Marines into some of the most hostile war zones, you would expect some hesitancy when units from here were asked to surge into some of the worst fighting since the start of the war in Afghanistan. This week, the first of 1,500 Marines will be part of the initial wave of President Obama's surge plan to head to Afghanistan's restive provinces to support Marines and soldiers fighting a dug-in Taliban force. However, many Marines we talked to in this coastal, scrub pine-covered North Carolina base are more than excited to go, despite the dangers that await them. ""I'm absolutely ecstatic about the situation. I've got a good group of Marines that are behind me, so I'm real excited about the deployment,"" said Sgt. Jason Bendett of the 3rd Platoon, A Company, 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, based at Lejeune. But combat deaths in Afghanistan are up -- 305 this year, from 155 during 2008 -- giving pause to even the most motivated Marines. ""I think I wouldn't be human if I wasn't worried, obviously this being my first combat deployment, but the Taliban are an experienced group of fighters, and I'm not taking that for granted,"" 2nd Lt. John Auer, also of the 3rd Platoon, said during some of his final rifle range training before he deploys. Members of this unit say they have been waiting and waiting as they watched fellow Marines deploy ahead of them this year, and they say they are more than ready to go. They were supposed to go to Iraq in June, but as priorities shifted, they were reassigned to Afghanistan's Helmand province, where Marines are in daily battles with the Taliban. ""Having months to train and putting Marines out in the elements in Southern California, where we train, gives them a chance to see what the atmospherics are going to be like and to work as a team, so this is perfect, and we are really looking forward to this,"" Auer said. ""These guys have a lot of training under their belts, more than Marine units typically get in this situation. Senior military leaders have a lot of big expectations for this team,"" said the unit's first sergeant, Ronald Neff. Last week, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, gave some of the deploying Marines an impassioned speech about what they will face. ""We don't have a lot of time. The slope on this insurgency is going in the wrong direction, and it has picked up, three years, each year to a significant degree,"" Mullen said, describing the deteriorating security situation. ""I believe the strategy that the president laid out, the decision that he's made, is the right decision. Both those are right, and we will now move out, given our orders, and we'll carry them out. And again, I couldn't be more confident and more pleased that you are going to be at the core of that,"" he told the hundreds of Marines in attendance. Many of the Marines there are young and are facing their first combat deployment. Although all the bravado of a newly minted Marine ready for combat looks and sounds ready to fight, their eyes showed worry and concern for the unknown as they listened to Mullen. ""Best thing you can hope for is that you personally know yourself, that you're not going to freeze up,"" Lance Cpl. Matthew Jenkins said after Mullen's speech. ""We'll see how I react when it goes down in a couple weeks,"" said Lance Cpl. Joshua Williamson. Questions remain, however, about how so many Marines without combat experience in Afghanistan can jump into a heated combat zone. Mullen admitted some concerns. ""We're obviously not in an ideal situation with respect to that. I understand that, but I have a huge amount of confidence in our Marine Corps based on their ability to adapt, what they did in Iraq,"" he said. There seems to be little worry among unit leaders in the 3/2nd LAR, who have been training and watching their troops grow in skills and confidence in recent months. ""One thing about the Marine Corps is that you always have experience wherever you go,"" Auer said. ""So we've got Marines that have done deployments before and the training they have given me, I'm confident to where I can lead my platoon, but I'm also relying on staff NCOs (non-commissioned officers) that have years of experience. ""That experience we have from the different deployments in Iraq, I'm relying on all the NCOs to carry their weight, and with that I don't think there is anything that can get in our way,"" Auer continued. For the families of these Marines, deployments are never easy, especially when they know that their husbands and wives are moving to a region known for its hostility. ""I'm glad he's going where he's needed. It would be a waste for him to go where he's not needed and not be able to do his job,"" said Kim Durbin, wife of deploying Marine Lt. Dan Durbin. ""It's just not him in the Marine Corps, it's our family, and we are proud to be a part of it,"" she said. Kim Durbin and her three kids, ages 1, 3 and 5, will watch Dan Durbin leave for Helmand province on his first combat deployment in a few weeks. She appears strong for a young mother, but all the preparations a family does can sometimes bury reality. ""Well we're thankful he's going to be with us for Christmas, so we just want to enjoy the time we have together."" But Kim Durbin's eyes close, and she fights back tears that become a sob. ""I think when we actually say goodbye, it's going to be hard, but we'll get through it, and we want to enjoy the time we do have together,"" she said. Families on this base are their own support system. Wives of Marines with husbands who have deployed numerous times help younger families get through the first deployments. ""It's very difficult, I think, for people outside the military community to understand what they have to go through,"" said Marine Capt. Eric Maedor, who returned from his third combat deployment to Afghanistan weeks ago. His wife, Teresa Maedor, a veteran of keeping the family together while Eric is away, agrees. ""I don't think when you have 'X' number of deployments under your belt that it makes it any easier; you just know what to expect. You know what to expect next time as far as how you need to manage things. Sometimes you worry about them more; sometimes you worry about them less,"" she said.","Marines, part of initial wave of Obama's surge plan, to head to Afghanistan this week .

"Washington (CNN) -- At the House Republican strategy session in January, I stood before the Republican Conference and said, ""I am your worst nightmare."" It was a figure of speech, of course, but my point was that our campaign helped change the political equation for winning elections. No longer is it enough to have big-name identification and big money to win. We demonstrated that principles and policy matter, and if you combine that with hard work and dynamic new media, young upstarts can beat incumbents in a big way. (I beat a 12-year incumbent in my own party, winning by 20 points.) In order to survive in the current political climate, it's paramount to be on the cutting edge of technical trends. As a young freshman, it is challenging to distinguish myself among 434 other members. If I want to be relevant and productive, I have to work hard to get my message across. Using social media is a great way to do just that. I stay in contact with people through Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Other members of Congress have also jumped aboard the Online Express. These days, even John McCain is all-a-twitter over new social media. See the latest episode of ""Freshman Year"" Granted, my ""tweets"" will not replace town hall meetings or direct mail, but social media is an important outreach supplement. People like feeling connected to their elected officials. Residents of my district want their voices to be heard and want to be a part of the political process. It has been very important to me that my constituents don't have to wade through layers of bureaucracy to reach me. My Facebook page, for example, hosts hundreds of interactions each week from ""supporters."" I post frequently and engage in the comments. I never outsource this type of communication to staff. It's done entirely by me. That kind of attention builds trust with people. They know what I really think, and they develop a connection with me -- even if we disagree. Twitter has become a particularly useful tool for me. I often tweet several times a day. Followers get an inside look at not only my job, but also my personality -- and sometimes my appetite. When I came to Washington as a newly elected member of Congress, I got a few headlines for bringing a cot to sleep on in my office. Taking my inspiration from FDR's Fireside Chats in the 1930s and '40s, I began producing ""Cotside Chats"" that are featured on my Web site. These chats give me the opportunity to talk directly with my constituents about the issues I think are important. Social media is a two-way street. It's a great way to deliver a message, and it's free. It also provides me with opportunities to listen to what is going on in the real world in real time. With today's easy Internet access and the surging popularity of social networking, there's no excuse for politicians to remain in the 20th century. For me, embracing new media and increasing the accessibility for my constituents is a winning formula. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Chaffetz.","Rep. Jason Chaffetz: Campaigns today are driven by use of social media .

"(CNN) -- Hashim Amla compiled his first double century after Jacques Kallis again fell short of the landmark as South Africa continued to punish India's bowlers on day two of the first cricket Test in Nagpur. Amla was unbeaten on 253 when the tourists declared on 558-6 in the final session on Sunday, then India safely reached stumps at 25-0 in a clash between the top two teams in the five-day format. It is the highest score made by a South African No. 3 batsman, and the highest by any from his country against India. Amla extended his third-wicket partnership with Kallis to a South African record of 340 before his senior partner fell for 173, having added just 14 to his overnight tally in a subdued second part of his innings. It was the first time any pair have put on a triple century in any matches between the two nations. Kallis edged a delivery from off-spinner Harbhajan Singh onto his pads, and Murali Vijay took the catch at short leg to end a 351-ball knock that put the all-rounder into third equal on the all-time Test century-scoring list with 34. Amla then added another 108 with A.B. De Villiers, who made a brisk 53 off 88 deliveries, and rode his luck as he was dropped twice on 149, as they broke South Africa's record for the fourth wicket in matches between the two teams. De Villiers fell to part-time bowler Virender Sehwag and then Harbhajan removed J.P. Duminy for just nine to have the Proteas 476-5, but then Mark Boucher contributed 39 to a stand of 78 with Amla before becoming Zaheer Khan's third victim, and captain Graeme Smith called the innings to a close with 40 minutes left in the day. India openers Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag survived four overs from pace bowlers Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel with some positive batting, and will start Monday's play on 12 and nine respectively as they seek to make inroads into a massive first-innings deficit. They will do well to take the lead of Amla, who was steady throughout his 473-ball innings, hitting 22 boundaries and scoring 55, 45 and 38 in Saturday's three sessions. While India relied heavily on Harbhajan and Amit Mishra, who on a helpful pitch bowled only six maidens between them in 99 overs for combined figures 2-306, Smith has only one specialist spinner in Paul Harris plus all-rounder Duminy, with the medium pace of Kallis backing up Steyn, Morkel and rookie fast bowler Wayne Parnell. Meanwhile, Australia crushed the West Indies by 113 runs in the opening match of their one-day series in Melbourne on Sunday. Batting first, the hosts reached 256-8 in their 50 overs as opener Shane Watson top-scored with 56 in his 100th match, while captain Ricky Ponting made 49. All-rounder Kieron Pollard took 3-45 for the Windies, while seamer Ravi Rampaul claimed 2-43. The tourists then slumped to 143 all out in just 34.2 overs as opening bowler Ryan Harris and spinner Nathan Hauritz claimed three wickets each. Doug Bollinger also snared two early victims, including the key scalp of big-hitting captain Chris Gayle, as the West Indies were left reeling on 12-3. Pollard, signed for $750,000 in the Indian Premier League auctions last month, top-scored with 31 from 35 deliveries.","Hashim Amla compiles his first double century as South Africa declare on 558-6 in Nagpur .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth announced a public inquiry Wednesday into allegations that Iraqis were killed and abused after a firefight more than five years ago in the southern part of the country. The allegations center around the aftermath of a fight in May 2004 at the so-called Danny Boy checkpoint in Maysan Province. Former detainees and the family of a slain Iraqi contend at least 20 people were killed and others were abused at Camp Abu Naji after a fight between British soldiers and Iraqi insurgents. That claim has been denied by the UK Ministry of Defence -- which says the 20 people died in battle and people detained were not mistreated. The probe is called the Al Sweady inquiry -- named after the family of the dead Iraqi. Thayne Forbes -- who retired from the High Court Bench last year -- will chair the inquiry into allegations. The inquiry will look into allegations of ""unlawful killings"" and the ""ill-treatment of five Iraqi nationals detained at Camp Abu Naji."" Even though the probe will focus on five detainees, attorneys claim nine people were detained and abused. The defense ministry disputes those allegations. ""We have found no credible evidence that those detained, as a result of the attack on British troops and the prolonged firefight at Danny Boy checkpoint, were mistreated,"" the defense ministry said in a statement. The release of a photo published in British media and obtained by CNN about the incident shows an armed soldier standing near four people face down on the ground with their hands bound behind their backs and their faces covered. Attorneys for the men say they were beaten and evidence shows a breach of the Geneva Conventions prohibiting humiliating and degrading treatment of prisoners. But, the defence ministry disputes that. ""It is important to remember that our first priority at the end of such attacks is to protect our personnel from further threats,"" the ministry said. CNN's Atika Shubert and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","UK to hold public inquiry into allegations Iraqis were killed and abused after firefight five years ago .

"(CNN) -- At least 30 people died and 70 were wounded in shelling on a marketplace in the Somali capital of Mogadishu Thursday, according to journalists and emergency services. Members of Islamist militia Al-Shaabab patrol Bakara Market in Mogadishu, Somalia, earlier this month. A local journalist called the rocket fire on Bakara market ""unprecedented."" ""This was the most brutal shelling,"" according to an ambulance service representative who said they had picked up 61 wounded, but expect the number to climb. Other victims were being brought to hospitals by family and friends. The source of the shelling could not immediately be determined. Journalists saw shell fire coming from AMISOM -- the African Union Mission in Somalia -- strongholds in a fortified district of the capital and from near the airport. AMISOM is the only force in the area believed to have the firepower capable of such an intense attack. However, AMISOM denied any involvement in the incident. The African Union has a 3,400-member peacekeeping force in Somalia, made up of troops from Burundi and Uganda. It operates under a U.N. mandate to support Somalia's transitional federal government. The peacekeeping force is charged with protecting key government and strategic installations in Mogadishu, including the port, airport and presidential palace. It is the de facto military force of the weak, transitional Somali government. African Union forces have been battling an al Qaeda-linked Islamist militia in Somalia called Al-Shaabab. The United States is supporting the Somali government's fight against the insurgents, including providing weapons to government forces. Al-Shaabab is on the U.S. list of terror organizations because of its ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. The United States is concerned that Somalia's weak government could fall to the Islamist insurgency, as it did in 2006 before Ethiopian forces ousted the militants from power in early 2007. Ethiopia invaded Somalia with the support of Somalia's weak transitional government. Journalist Mohamed Amiin Adow contributed to this report.","30 people killed after shelling in Somali capital Mogadishu according to reports .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An investigation into an attack that killed eight U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan last year said the combat outpost was an ""attractive target"" because protection improvements hadn't been made and intelligence assets had been diverted. These were main points in the findings released Friday by the U.S. military into the probe of the October 3 attack on Combat Outpost Keating in the Kamdesh district of Nuristan province. The attack killed eight U.S. service members and wounded 22 others. Based on the recommendations in the investigation, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top coalition military commander in Afghanistan, ""took appropriate action regarding Army personnel involved."" The report also praised soldiers of B Troop, 3rd Squadron, 61st Calvary for repelling the assault by a force of 300 militants. Commanders must regularly assess ""the value and vulnerabilities"" of combat outposts, said the report, which ""made several recommendations to improve coalition tactics."" The base had been scheduled to be closed before the attack occurred, and ""needed force protection improvements (which) were not made"" because of the imminent closure. ""Critical intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets which had been supporting COP Keating had been diverted to assist ongoing intense combat operations in other areas,"" the report said. It also said ""intelligence assessments had become desensitized to reports of massing enemy formations by previous reports that had proved false."" All of these factors ""resulted in an attractive target for enemy fighters."" The military says militants had been planning the attack for days, hiding mortars, rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains. The assault started around dawn as bullets and rockets peppered the remote outpost October 3 and lasted for 12 hours, pinning down the exhausted troops. One soldier said afterward the insurgency was so fierce that the troops couldn't get to their weapons to fire back. They called in air support to help thwart the militants. ""They were under heavy enemy contact,"" Sgt. Jayson Souter said. Four servicemen -- Souter, a fellow soldier, an Apache helicopter pilot and a gunner -- talked to a military reporter about their roles during the Keating attack in an interview posted by the Department of Defense on Facebook and NATO's International Security Assistance Force YouTube Channel. Chief Warrant Officer Ross Lewallen, an Apache pilot, said a few aircraft were damaged in what was a ""time-consuming endeavor"" governed by tough terrain. He said the morning battle was ""significant,"" but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons. ""One of the primary reasons for the fight taking so long is that it is an extreme terrain,"" he said in the interview. The report said the troops killed 150 enemy fighters and ""found that the soldiers and junior leaders fought heroically in repelling an enemy force five times their size. ""Members of B Troop upheld the highest standards of warrior ethics and professionalism and distinguished themselves with conspicuous gallantry, courage, and bravery under the heavy enemy fire that surrounded them.""","Lack of protection improvements made combat outpost an ""attractive target""
Intelligence failures also made the base vulnerable to a strike from militants .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- The trial of controversial Zimbabwean politician Roy Bennett took a new twist Tuesday when prosecutors told the judge they wanted to impeach their star witness. The prosecution called arms dealer Michael Peter Hitschmann to the stand to implicate Bennett in the procurement of the arms. Bennett is a senior official of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and Zimbabwe's deputy agriculture minister-designate. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism and inciting people to carry out terrorism. He could face the death penalty if convicted. The MDC -- led by Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai -- says the case against Bennett is politically motivated and was aimed at keeping him out of the unity government it formed with President Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party last February. Under questioning from Attorney General Johannes Tomana, Hitschmann testified he had seen Bennett on television and then had met him at a public gathering. But Hitschmann told the fully packed courtroom that he was not aware of some of the weapons the prosecution claims that he bought with the financial support of Bennett. In addition, Hitschmann -- who appeared relaxed throughout the proceedings -- cast doubt on the authenticity of e-mails that were produced in court which the prosecution said had been retrieved from his laptop and which allegedly reveal that he and Bennett were planning to commit terrorism. ""None of the contents was retrieved from my laptop in my absence or in the presence of my legal counsel (in 2006 when he was arrested),"" he said, adding, ""I don't know here they came from."" After that, Tomana started questioning Hitschmann as if he were a hostile witness and not the star witness for the prosecution. Bennett's lawyers objected, saying the prosecution was trying to ""confuse"" people. At that point, Tomana indicated that he was in the ""preparatory stage"" to ""to lay evidence that Hitschmann was being inconsistent."" ""The witness -- who is an accomplice witness by the way -- is getting to be a witness in favor of the accused; we are entitled to start impeachment procedures when the state witness starts showing that he is being unfavorably indisposed in favor of the accused,"" he added. Bennett's lawyer, Beatrice Mtetwa, said the prosecution had never indicated that it had e-mails which were purportedly written by her client and Hitschmann. She said Hitschmann had submitted an affidavit saying he does not want to testify against Bennett, adding that the statements about conspiracy that were purportedly made by him were done under ""traumatic and unfriendly circumstances"" in 2006, when he was arrested and later charged with terrorism himself. Mtetwa said the prosecution was attempting to take a statement Hitschmann made to the army and turn it into a statement against her client. ""That is an army-procured statement. What legal basis is there to change it to a witness statement? The statement was made when he was an accused facing conspiracy charges,"" said Mtetwa. ""During that time the prosecution did not indicate that he had acted in common purpose with the accused (Bennett)."" Hitschmann was acquitted of terrorism charges in 2006 but served a jail sentence for the lesser charge of possessing weapons without a license. The weapons allegedly included six sub-machine guns and two machine guns, which the prosecution produced in Bennett's trial as part of the state's exhibits. The judge in the case, Justice Chinembiri Bhunu, who resumed the trial after adjourning it last November, is expected to rule Wednesday whether the state can proceed to impeach its own witness. Throughout the court proceedings, Bennett -- clad in a blue suit, matching blue tie and a light blue shirt -- sat motionless, gazing into the sky once in a while. He laughed out loud when Hitschmann said he first saw Bennett on television punching the justice minister in parliament.","Attorney General tells court that prosecution wants to impeach star witness .

"(CNN) -- ""Precious,"" a movie about a 1980s-era Harlem teen who strives to overcome abuse, neglect and illiteracy, pulled five Independent Spirit Award nominations Tuesday morning. Stars Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique were both recognized for their portrayals of a mother and daughter in a dysfunctional relationship, with a best female lead nomination for newcomer Sidibe and a best supporting female nomination for Mo'Nique. The film's success is not entirely a surprise, considering that the Oprah Winfrey- and Tyler Perry-backed Sundance darling has earned $27 million at the domestic box office and was received well by audiences during its slow rollout in cities across the nation in November. Sidibe's work in ""Precious"" has been one of the breakout roles of the year, and the young actress is rumored to be the star of a new series, ""The C Word."" However, it hasn't been all smooth for ""Precious"": The film earned zero nominations for the Gotham Independent Film Awards, which were given out Monday night. The Gotham awards are a New York-based indie film honor. ""The Hurt Locker,"" by contrast, took home two Gotham awards Monday night, one for best picture and the other for best ensemble. There were no Independent Spirit Award nominations for this Iraq war drama, however, as it was nominated last year. For the Spirits, ""Precious"" is facing off against the Zooey Deschanel-driven ""(500) Days of Summer,"" ""Amreeka,"" ""The Last Station"" and ""Sin Nombre"" for best picture. ""Summer"" also snagged a nomination for best male lead, a nod for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On top of the best picture nomination, ""The Last Station"" -- a biographical piece about Leo Tolstoy featuring James McAvoy, Helen Mirren and Paul Giamatti -- is up for best director, best screenplay, best female lead and best supporting male lead. Christian McKay, another relatively unknown actor in the United States, has gotten lots of love from critics for his portrayal of Orson Welles in Richard Linklater's ""Me and Orson Welles,"" and the Spirit Awards noticed, giving the British actor a nomination for best supporting male performer. In order to be considered, all films had to be 70 minutes long with a budget under $20 million, and had to have screened at one of the major film festivals, such as Sundance or Toronto. The awards ceremony is typically held the Saturday before the Academy Awards, but since the Spirit Awards are celebrating their 25th anniversary in 2010, they're moving out from under Oscar's shadow and will air live on the Independent Film Channel on March 5.","""Precious"" and ""Last Station"" both lead Independent Spirit Award nominations .

"This year marks the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Solferino which led to the creation of the International Committee of the Red Cross. The ICRC is using the date to launch an awareness campaign of its work in conflict-affected countries, featuring photos taken by five award-winning photojournalists. This week we're bringing you stories from some of the world's most troubled countries, as told by the ICRC. CITÃ SOLEIL, Haiti (ICRC) -- Roudeline Lamy was 23 when she was shot in the stomach. The impact of the bullet sent the small baby she was holding tumbling to the ground. Roudeline Lamy shows the scar from her bullet wound. At 26, she's a widow after losing her husband to gangland violence. Roudeline still suffers from stomach pains and her daughter, now three years old, is paralyzed from the waist down. The mother and child sleep on the concrete floor of a shack that floods every time it rains. Since Roudeline's husband was killed by the gangs, she has had to rely on the charity of friends and her faith that God will not abandon her. With very few State services, God is all the poor in Haiti's sprawling seaside slum of CitÃ© Soleil can believe in. Two schools and one state hospital serve the ever-expanding population, with aid agencies and religious groups trying to plug the gap. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been in Haiti since 1994 and in CitÃ© Soleil since 2003. Rob Drouen, head of the ICRC delegation, explains, ""Haiti is a fragile state where armed gangs can be used to stir up trouble for political reasons and abject poverty fuels discontent.""   See photos taken by award-winning photojournalist Ron Haviv Â» . Even among the children. In CitÃ© Soleil, a dozen street children start pummeling a young girl. It's not known why. But within seconds word has spread that a fight is on. Hordes of children with matted hair and ragged clothes race to the scene, glad of anything to relieve the monotony of yet another day with nothing to do. Weary parents pull their children away, leaving the shaken girl to escape. This is a far cry from the days when families ran for cover from daily gun battles. A few years ago, CitÃ© Soleil was one of the most dangerous and destitute places on earth -- a shanty town torn apart by a vicious gang war for control of the area. United Nations troops have stabilized the security situation in Haiti, the western world's poorest country, and many gang members are either dead or behind bars. Nevertheless, violence still surrounds the 300,000 residents of CitÃ© Soleil, fueled by hunger and the frustration of trying to survive on less than a dollar a day. I sidestep the brawling children and enter the home of a woman who has suffered more than most. A long-standing resident of CitÃ© Soleil, 83 year old Elevanise Tidor was first caught in gangland crossfire in 1993. In 2004 she stepped into harm's away again when she was shot in the breast and stomach. As she undoes her faded dress to show the scars from her mastectomy, she tells me she was later hit by a car and now can hardly walk.  Watch Elevanise Tidor tell her story Â» . Confined to a sparsely furnished corrugated iron shack, she worries about how her children and grandchildren are going to make ends meet. ""My body took the bullets, but my family has been hit the hardest,"" she says. ""I can't work or do anything for them. My grandchildren often go to bed crying with hunger."" That the victims of violence can suffer for years after the event is well-known, but in CitÃ© Soleil the suffering can last a lifetime. With the help of the ICRC, a group of victims of the violence is aiding fellow sufferers. In 2007, Pierre Wilber founded REVICIS (Regroupement des victimes de CitÃ© Soleil) after gang members beat him up for political reasons. REVICIS has already identified 300 victims and is now trying to get funds for social, psychological and legal help. ""There are so many social problems in CitÃ© Soleil that everyone here is a victim,"" he says. ""But we give priority to people visibly scarred by violence, because they have suffered a double blow."" Brice Osmer is one of the rare victims who can still work. In April 2005, he was caught in a shoot-out between UN troops and gang members. He was hit three times and lost an arm. Since then he walks the streets selling mobile phone time cards and bags of water. ""On a good day I earn a dollar, but it's thanks to my wife who sells food from dawn to dusk that my children don't starve."" In 2004, at the height of the gang warfare, the Red Cross ensured that people had safe access to water. Previously, they had been risking their lives crossing frontlines to fill up their buckets. Today, the ICRC works with the water board, maintaining and running 53 communal water points across CitÃ© Soleil, turning them on for a couple of hours 20 days a month.

"(CNN) -- A leading Muslim-American civil rights group is advocating intense grassroots engagement among police and U.S. Muslim neighborhood leaders to thwart the emergence of homegrown Islamic terrorists. A report, issued Friday by the Muslim Public Affairs Council, reflects the shock among American Muslims over the Fort Hood massacre, the arrests of five American Muslims in Pakistan suspected of plotting terrorist attacks, and the arrests of eight Somali-American men on charges related to what prosecutors said were efforts to recruit youths to fight for a Somali guerrilla movement. Titled ""Building Bridges to Strengthen America: Forging an Effective Counterterrorism Enterprise between Muslim Americans and Law Enforcement,"" the paper stresses a division of labor and a collaboration between police and community groups. Police should fight crime, including terrorism, and neighborhood leaders should deal with the causes of radicalization, it says. At the same time, both need to work hand in glove, the paper said. ""We will capture the narrative from those who seek to misguide the young people,"" said Haris Tarin, the head of the council's District of Columbia office. He was speaking Friday at a news conference in Washington that introduced the 32-page paper. ""One incident of violent extremism is one too many,"" said Alejandro J. Beutel, the author of the report and the group's government liaison. ""Our community needs to develop more sophistication in dealing with this challenge."" Beutel, who also spoke at the news conference, said there needs to be a greater emphasis on community policing, an idea that calls for closer ties between neighborhood residents and cops on the beat. Developing closer relations with local Muslims would help police tap ""unique cultural and linguistic"" skills that can spot and head off trouble. The study said police must surmount community distrust, which it says is common and calls ""an automatic barrier to police community outreach."" ""Unfortunately, in the current political climate, the actions of certain law enforcement agencies -- whether spying on peaceful activist groups and houses of worship without reasonable suspicion, or religious profiling -- have added to difficulties,"" the report said. Such a ""heightened sense of fear and grievances also creates a greater pool of alienated people terrorists can tap into for recruitment,"" Beutel's report said. Tarin and Beutel said concern about radicalism in the Muslim community isn't new: Books have been published about the subject, and imams at mosques have raised the issue for many years. Speaking at the news conference, Tarin said that Muslim leaders need to ""think outside the box"" and engage young people in cyberspace, on social networking sites and in other social circles where they are coming together. And both men said that all Muslim groups need to work together to help confront problems like the emergence of radical thought and identify sources of discontent. Beutel said the U.S. Muslim community can learn from the experience of the British Muslim community. While there was initial surprise that local Muslims were involved in the July 7, 2005, London bombings, Muslims there later realized that militant leaders were tapping into the problems caused by youthful alienation and social issues such as racism, drug use and premarital sex. Beutel cites a study that says many militants had been secular before they embraced radical Islam, but they typically lacked mainstream religious knowledge. He said making communities ""religiously literate"" would help fight radicalism. ""Muslim communities must do their part to reach out and continue to assist law enforcement to bring real terrorist perpetrators to justice,"" Beutel wrote in the report. ""The role Muslim communities should play is in counterradicalization efforts through better religious education, social programs and long-term constructive political engagement.""","Group wants police, U.S. Muslim leaders to thwart emergence of homegrown terrorists .

"(CNN) -- Anjali Thakur is living in fear in India. She is a mother afraid for her son. ""We are all having sleepless nights,"" Thakur says. Sourabh Sharma -- one of the Indian students attacked in Melbourne. Her son isn't in a war zone or even a country known to be dangerous. He is a student in Melbourne, Australia. ""Three years back when we sent him,"" she says, ""it was one of the safest places for the children to go."" The Australian government says it is still safe but a spate of vicious attacks on Indian students in recent weeks has parents like Thakur and hundreds of students shaken and angry. From Melbourne to Victoria to Sydney Indian students say they are targets of racially motivated attacks. At least 10 Indian students have been attacked over the past month, the most severe case left an Indian student in a coma, another student was stabbed in the stomach, and a third left with a nasty black eye. So far more than a dozen arrests have been made. Australia authorities say they don't believe the attacks and robberies are racially motivated but instead crimes of opportunity against soft targets: students who typically travel alone at night on public transportation. But hundreds of Indian students see it differently. They have reacted with protests in at least three Australian cities. Police say at one point Indian students decided to take the law into their own hands and retaliate which has been condemned in both India and Australia. The situation has gotten so much attention Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has made several statements on the matter, insisting the attacks are isolated incidents. In an interview on Australian radio he said: ""Every city has violence, let's put this into perspective, and Australia I'm advised on the statistics is one of the safest countries in the world for international students."" In India though the perception of a safe Australia has been shattered partly due to the widespread publicity of the recent cases. The story has been front page news for days while local television media has been going with breaking news every time it receives a report of an Indian student attacked anywhere in Australia. Political tension has even bubbled up between India and Australia with India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressing the attacks and asking Australia does something to safeguard India's young people. Australia has responded with a 10-point action plan to help safeguard students. A helpline has also been set up. As for Anjali Thakur, she says her son has lived in Australia for three years and never experienced violence; in fact she says he didn't even know about the attacks in Melbourne where he lives until she called him to warn him. But Thakur has been watching the news in India and seeing a totally different picture of Australia. ""It's a lovely beautiful peaceful country,"" Thakur says, ""but now what you see on TV and what you hear, that's a total contrast to what we know of Australia."" The Thakur family has responded by refusing to let the youngest son study in Australia and keeping their eldest son from enrolling in a master's program at his university. If that kind of sentiment spreads, it could have serious consequences for Australia's $12.6 billion-a-year education export industry. More than 80,000 students from India study in Australia. ""Any parent will tell you,"" Thakur says, ""they are not going to send a child for the best education in the world at the cost of his life.""","Spate of attacks on Indian students in Australia makes headlines in India .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A woman who helped raise a child with her female partner in Vermont before the pair split can visit the girl in Virginia even though that state doesn't recognize same-sex unions, a court ruled Friday. Janet Jenkins with Isabella, the daughter she helped raise with former partner Lisa Miller. Virginia's Supreme Court ruled that Janet Jenkins and Lisa Miller's civil union in 2000 gave Vermont, and its law on same-sex unions, jurisdiction over their subsequent custody and visitation disputes. Miller moved to Virginia with the child in 2003, and a Vermont court granted Jenkins visitation rights. But Miller took the case to a Virginia court, which ruled that Jenkins had no such rights there. The case was considered by legal experts to be the first conflict between two state courts over a major legal question arising from same-sex unions. Jenkins' attorney, Joseph Price of the Washington law firm Arent Fox, said Friday's ruling ""just affirms the old principle that when these kinds of custody and visitation disputes begin in one state, that's where they should remain."" ""You can't shop them around to another state,"" Price said. ""Virginia really had no choice but to enforce judgments and judicial orders from Vermont."" Vermont is one of the few states that allow same-sex partners to enter into a civil union. Two years after Vermont recognized Miller and Jenkins' relationship, Miller gave birth to a daughter, Isabella, conceived through artificial insemination. The relationship deteriorated, and Miller and the baby moved to Virginia. A Vermont court later granted Miller a dissolution of the civil union and granted custody of the child to her and visitation rights to Jenkins. Miller then asked the courts in Virginia -- which does not recognize same-sex unions or marriages -- to take jurisdiction of the dispute. A Virginia state judge eventually ruled that Jenkins had no ""parentage or visitation rights."" The Virginia high court ruling Friday returned the case to Vermont's control, meaning Jenkins can visit the girl, who is now 6. Miller's attorney, Mathew Staver, said he was ""disappointed the state sidestepped the larger legal questions."" ""This case shows that one state is not an island in the same-sex marriage dispute, and underscores having state laws that protect traditional one-man, one-woman marriages,"" said Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, a law firm that fights on behalf of what it calls ""traditional families."" Miller said in 2005 that she was doing what was best for her daughter and was no longer a lesbian. ""I am Isabella's mom. I did conceive her; I birthed her,"" she said. ""I'm raising her. And in my opinion, Isabella needs to stay with me 100 percent of the time, because I am the only person that she identifies as a mom."" Miller lives with Isabella in Winchester, Virginia. Jenkins did not offer an immediate reaction to the ruling but said in 2005 that she was only fighting for her rights as a parent. ""Justice will be served for Isabella,"" she said. ""I believe that. And I'll do whatever it takes. I'll be with her for as long as I can, or I'll be without her for as long as I have to, but I'm her mom. ""She's born here [in Vermont]. She's always here."" Price said Jenkins, who lives in Fair Haven, Vermont, was supposed to visit Isabella last weekend, but Miller didn't appear with the girl. Friday's ruling comes a week after the California Supreme Court's refusal to delay its recent decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the state. Massachusetts also allows same-sex marriages; Vermont and three other states permit civil unions, and 12 other states give gay and lesbian couples some legal rights. Virginia amended its constitution in 2007 to decree that marriage is defined as a union between one man and one woman.","Virginia ruling gives Vermont court jurisdiction over case .

"(CNN) -- South Africa pace bowler Dale Steyn ripped through India's batsmen on the third day of the first cricket Test in Nagpur, taking eight wickets as the hosts were forced to follow on. Steyn took a career-best 7-51 as India, resuming on 25-0 overnight, were skittled for just 233 to concede a massive first-innings deficit of 325 runs. The 26-year-old, whose previous best figures were 6-49, then took the wicket of first-innings centurion Virender Sehwag as India reached 66-2 at stumps on Monday. The haul took Steyn to 193 wickets in his 37th Test and gave South Africa a great chance of winning the two-match series against a side who usurped their No. 1 ranking in the five-day format late last year. He claimed five wickets in less than four overs after tea as India collapsed from 221-4. ""We actually had the ball changed when we came out after tea because the seam had popped open on the old one,"" Steyn told reporters. ""We hoped to get a bit of reverse swing -- it worked in our favor."" Steyn's strike partner Morne Morkel set the tone when he had Gautam Gambhir caught by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher with his first delivery of the day, with the opener not adding to his overnight score of 12. Steyn then bowled Murali Vijay for four as the No. 3 failed to play a stroke, and he took the vital wicket of Sachin Tendulkar, the highest run-scorer in Test history, when he tempted the veteran to edge a drive to Boucher for just seven. The belligerent Sehwag then added 136 with debutant Subramaniam Badrinath as he smashed his 18th Test ton before giving away his wicket to Wayne Parnell with an easy catch to J.P. Duminy deep in the cover field. Sehwag hit 15 boundaries in 139 deliveries -- the same amount that the 29-year-old Badrinath faced in making 56, who took India safely to tea along with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. But Dhoni fell to left-arm spinner Paul Harris in the first over of the final session, and Steyn had Badrinath caught at midwicket before running through the tail. Proteas captain Graeme Smith made the Indians bat again, despite Boucher not being able to take the field due to a back injury. Morkel again accounted for Gambhir as the opener misjudged an inswinger and had his castle wrecked after shouldering arms, and Steyn had Sehwag caught by Smith at slip for 16. Vijay (27) and Tendulkar (15) added 44 in the remainder of the 23 overs scheduled to be bowled before stumps, but will face a massive task to prevent India going 1-0 down in the series. Meanwhile, New Zealand took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the one-day series against visiting Bangladesh, winning the second match by five wickets in Dunedin on Monday. The tourists managed only 183-8 in their 50 overs as Mushfiqur Rahim top-scored with 86, and the Kiwis reached their target from only 27.3 overs with Ross Taylor smashing 78 off in a 52-ball innings featuring five sixes.","South Africa paceman Dale Steyn takes eight wickets on third day of first Test in Nagpur .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- England doesn't yet swing in the transporting, ruefully tender coming-of-age drama ""An Education."" Carey Mulligan and Peter Sarsgaard star as a couple in ""An Education."" It's 1961, and Jenny (Carey Mulligan), a bright 16-year-old schoolgirl in a tidy London suburb, nurtures aspirations of sophistication that involve smoking cigarettes and dreaming of the day she can sit in a Paris cafe. Beatles-era grooviness and sexual liberation haven't yet reached this corner of the Empire, where cautious, 1950s-style postwar provincialism still prevails -- the same squareness the gents across the pond in ""Mad Men"" are just beginning to bend. Jenny's dad (Alfred Molina) is fearful and fussy; Mum (Cara Seymour) is resigned. So the good student studies her Latin, grinding for admisson into Oxford University. Life lessons don't begin until she meets David (Peter Sarsgaard), who's in his early 30s, and Jewish, and suave. He's so charmant, he even dazzles Mum and Dad. Being included in David's exotic, if mysteriously shady, universe -- the travel, the jazz clubs that hint at wider horizons, and, oh yes, the sex -- is like a crash course in worldliness. And as this picture of times that were a-changin' demonstrates with quiet, though conventionally built, artistry, worldliness has its discontents. ""An Education"" is the vivid story of how one girl became a woman -- and how Olde England morphed into the youthquake center of '60s yeah yeah yeah. None of which would be quite so vivid without the beguiling performance of newcomer Mulligan. She's very much an It Girl, with her natural elegance in a brunet upsweep Ã  la Audrey Hepburn. And she's protectively partnered by Sarsgaard in the tricky job of playing sweet yet suspect, a balance he sustains with nonchalance. Equally important players: Dominic Cooper and the divine Rosamund Pike as David's ever-so-knowing pals, Olivia Williams as a teacher who hates to see her prize pupil make poor choices, and Emma Thompson, steaming forth like a battleship as Jenny's headmistress. The movie, in a palette of cloudy blues, is adapted from a vivid memoir by British journalist Lynn Barber and directed by gifted Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig from a screenplay of economical empathy by ""High Fidelity"" novelist Nick Hornby.

"(CNN) -- An additional 440,000 Honda vehicles are being added to a recall initially announced in November to repair a potential defect in airbag inflation systems, American Honda Motor Co. said Friday. The 2001 Honda Civic is among the vehicles covered by the recall. The recall involves driver-side airbags in certain 2001-02 Honda Accords, 2001 Civics and 2002-03 Acura TLs, the company said in a news release. The affected vehicles will require the replacement of the steering-wheel-mounted airbag inflator. ""In some vehicles, airbag inflators can produce over-pressurization of the driver's [front] airbag inflator mechanism during airbag deployment,"" the release said. ""If an affected inflator deploys, the increased internal pressure may cause the inflator casing to rupture. Metal fragments could pass through the cloth airbag cushion material, possibly causing an injury or fatality to vehicle occupants."" Honda spokesman Chris Noughtan said the potential defect has resulted in six known injuries and one known death. The company will send a recall notice in the mail over the next few months, the release said. Owners may check their car's recall status by visiting the Honda ""Owner Link"" Web site at www.owners.honda.com/recalls or the Acura ""My Acura"" Web site at www.owners.acura.com/recalls.

"(CNN) -- An infant falls to his death from a second-story window while his parents are making love. Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe star in the Lars von Trier drama ""Antichrist."" The mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is consumed with grief and guilt. She's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband (Willem Dafoe), a therapist, insists she return home. He gets rid of all her medications. He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him. Not a good idea for either of them, as it turns out. Halloween is nearly upon us, but ""Antichrist"" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act. The movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called ""Vows of Chastity."" It's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, ""Antichrist"" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named. The prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now,"" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.) Dafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman. Of course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against ""Hostel,"" ""Saw"" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably. Hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse. It's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: ""Chaos reigns!"" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch. This director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance. Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery. There also was a very vociferous walk-out: a gentleman who fairly barked ""You get what you pay for, folks"" as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end. That unhappy camper had a point. Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree, or he's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that's seen it all before and still demands more, more, more. Beautifully shot by Anthony Dod Mantle and acted with raw conviction, ""Antichrist"" is a calamitous atrocity from a major filmmaker, nothing more and nothing less. If you don't believe me, go ask the talking fox. ""Antichrist"" is not rated and runs 104 minutes.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice defended the Bush administration's policies on the interrogation of terrorism suspects Sunday, saying former President George W. Bush would not have authorized anything illegal. Condoleeza Rice says George W. Bush was clear that interrogations during his presidency should break no law. ""He was also very clear that we would do nothing -- nothing -- that was against the law or against our obligations internationally,"" Rice said during an appearance at a Washington school. A Senate Intelligence Committee report released in April showed Rice was among top Bush advisers who approved the CIA's use of waterboarding -- a technique considered a form of torture for centuries -- on terrorism suspects in its custody. Recently released Bush administration memos showed Justice Department officials argued that waterboarding, sleep deprivation and other coercive practices did not violate U.S. laws against torture. The disclosures have led to calls for investigations of former Bush administration officials. But Rice said Bush ""was only willing to authorize policies that were legal in order to protect the country"" after al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. ""I hope people understand that it was a struggle, it was a difficult time,"" she said. ""We were all terrified of another attack on this country because September 11 was the worst day of my life in government -- watching 3,000 Americans die because these people attacked us."" But she added, ""Even under those most difficult circumstances, the president was not prepared to do something illegal."" President Obama has banned the use of techniques such as waterboarding, which he called torture. His administration released the Justice Department memos in response to a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union, and he called the legal reasoning behind the memos ""a mistake.""

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- All that glitters may not be gold, but for Colombia's narco-molls the most important thing is that it glitters. Yovanna Guzman was 19 when she met drug  boss Wilber Varela, and she says he showered her with luxuries. Beauty queens, fashion models, actresses or regular girls made good are lovers of drug capos and above all lovers of the finest luxuries that cocaine money can buy. Few are prepared to speak publicly and even less to appear on camera. Those who date mob bosses don't want to blow their cover. It could expose their boyfriends to arrest and themselves to retaliation. In addition, it could bring anti-drug police sniffing, ready to seize ill-gotten gains. One exception is Yovanna Guzman, a former beauty queen and model, with a mane of blond hair and a pneumatic figure -- a sure passport into the narco underworld where cup size is more important than IQ. For eight years, she was the lover of one of Colombia's most ruthless cocaine traffickers, Wilber Varela. He was head of the North Valle Cartel. ""He had two faces. I saw him so tender with the ones he loved, then you see the cartel killings. He always said he was the best of friends and the worst of enemies,"" Guzman said during an interview in Bogota.  Watch Guzman describe Varela and how she met him Â» . The Colombian government accused Varela of running tons of cocaine to the United States via Central America in go-fast speedboats and to Europe in small jets. Should drugs be legalized? Sound off below . Authorities put a $5 million bounty on his head. He gained a reputation for brutality during a yearslong dispute with a splinter faction of the same cartel, led by Diego Montoya, who until his capture in 2007 was listed alongside Osama bin Laden on the FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives. Guzman was 19 when she met Varela. He told her he was a cattle rancher. She didn't ask questions and said she only found out the truth when she saw a Wanted poster with her boyfriend's mug shot. He wooed her with expensive gifts and sponsored her through Chica Med, a second-rate beauty pageant organizers concede was viewed as a cattle market by gangsters looking for new girls. Some mob bosses bought the beauty title as a gift for their molls, though it's not clear whether Varela paid for Guzman's title. ""There were the vacations, the cars and the luxury SUVs and, of course, jewelry. There was always jewelry. But there were small details too like flowers,"" she said. ""Of course, the luxuries don't make you fall in love, but they do dazzle you. When you get dazzled, you get carried away, but then you ask yourself where is the love and my principles?"" Guzman said Varela's first gift to her was a Rolex watch, followed by a Cartier watch, diamonds, jewelry, top-of-the-range sport utility vehicles and luxury apartments. She said she now realizes she was being bought and admits she sold herself. ""I feel all of us have a price up to a point. Sometimes you feel luxuries like the designer clothes, shoes and handbags are important. But afterward you realize you're empty inside,"" she said. Very quickly her drug lord boyfriend locked Guzman in a golden cage. He forbade her to do photo shoots or party with male friends, even though he had a stable of other top model girlfriends. ""He was very jealous, and what's his is his and belongs to nobody else and nobody can touch it, look at it or mess with it,"" she said. As Colombia's law enforcers stepped up the hunt for Varela, Guzman's time with him became less frequent. But she said he always seemed to know where she was or to whom she had talked. At one point, she said, a jealous Varela sent one of his lieutenants to shoot her in the leg. ""When I got shot, I was supposedly never going to walk properly again. The bullet could easily have hit me somewhere else and killed me. But I pulled myself together and I said I'm not going to be crippled,"" she said. What Guzman wouldn't explain was the reason for the punishment shooting. She giggled and promised to reveal the full details in a book she's writing. She said she hopes her experiences will serve as a cautionary tale for other young women on the trail of easy money. Whether or not they will take a leaf out of that book is another matter. Ordinary Colombians seem to have an unshakable attraction to glamorous narco-lifestyles judging by the sky-high ratings of two TV soap operas. The ""Cartel"" tells the story of the rise of the North Valle mob that Varela headed. The sequel, called ""Mafia Dolls,"" portrays women such as Guzman. One of the silicone-enhanced actresses who played a supporting role in both soaps said that since her TV appearances she has received offers from real-life drug dealers, both in Medellin and Cali. ""Those narcos watch TV and are always on the lookout for fresh meat. So I began getting the calls when I appeared in 'The Cartel,' "" she said. ""I got a phone call from a guy who is a showbiz publicist, and he told me a guy from Medellin was offering $7,500 for me to spend the evening with him."" She said she refused that overture. Days later, a new BMW X5 SUV, with a bow on top, was left outside her home by the same drug trafficker who was trying to woo her. She said she returned the gift but gave no explanation how she found out the return address, given how secretive Colombian mob bosses are. ""All those narcos care about is how big your breasts are. If they want you, the first thing they do is send you to their plastic surgeons to have silicone implants. But it's them who decide how big you should be, not you,"" she went on.

It marked the end of a nightmare she walked into with her eyes wide open. ""[When I heard the news], I didn't know whether to be happy or sad.

"(CNN) -- She is only 37 years old, but violinist Midori Goto has already spent 25 years taking center-stage with the world's best orchestras. Midori first hit center-stage when she was just 11-years-old. Born into a musical family in Osaka, Japan, in 1971 -- her mother and brother are both accomplished musicians -- her own prodigious talents were spotted at an early age by Zubin Mehta, the conductor and one-time musical director of the New York Philharmonic. Inviting Midori to play with the New York Philharmonic in 1982, he helped to propel her onto the world stage which has been such a large part of her life ever since. She moved to New York to study at the Juilliard School of performing arts and has lead a life entwined with music. Unlike some prodigiously talented people there is no hint of resentment directed toward her and the life she has led. Nor is there any notion of a stolen childhood, despite her admission that she did harbor dreams of being all sorts of other things, from an archeologist or diplomat to a zookeeper or a nun. ""This was my life, I didn't know any other. I took it and I was very happy. Being a child performer opened up opportunities. From a fairly early age I was exposed to different cultures and was traveling round the world. It was a great education,"" she told CNN. Being given the opportunity to learn more about different people and experience different places was only one part of this education. While Midori has been practicing and honing her own skills, she has also been given the opportunity to give something back. In 1992 she set up Midori & Friends, a non-profit organization that brings musical education to young people in New York City. ""I was always interested in education; not just receiving, but also helping others and being part of the community,"" she said. From Midori & Friends came Music Sharing, a similar organization in Japan, offering programs in public schools and children's hospitals. While continuing to perform across the world with renowned orchestras she took some time out to further her own education with a degree in psychology in 2000 and in 2005 received her Masters in Psychology from New York University. But music is and remains her first love and the way in which it connects people and stirs emotions is something she believes is one of the most powerful aspects of music. The world today might be unrecognizable from the world of Bruckner or Bach, but for Midori the way people feel and respond to music and emotions remains the same. ""The very basics of being human hasn't changed. We may express ourselves differently, but the fact we do respond and do feel that is something very basic,"" she said. And while there are hardships involved in being one of the world's finest violinists, it still remains a pure pleasure. ""As musicians we're trained to be self critical so we can get better. But fundamentally we love music. It's a love that drives us to practice and keep working at it. It's something I love so much and gives me so much joy. ""With that comes hardships... there's never a state of perfection. You try and you try and you try, but at the end you know you can't be perfect. It's humbling, so that it becomes a motivating force,"" she told CNN. Continuing her work outside of the concert hall, Midori was made a UN Ambassador for Peace in 2007, a role she relishes. While it presents her additional opportunities to talk about issues close to her heart, it's also a position that nourishes her inquisitive mind and another means to connect with people indirectly through her music. These experiences make the world a little more vivid than it was before. And I'm grateful for that; it's also something that motivates me to continue to do it,"" she said.","Violinist Midori Goto was child prodigy; played with NY Philharmonic at age 11 .

"(CNN) -- Real Mallorca's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League were dented by a 1-0 defeat away to Spanish strugglers Tenerife on Monday night. Gregorio Manzano's islanders dropped out of the top four following the weekend's games, and Nino's early goal for relegation-threatened Tenerife meant they stayed fifth, two points behind Sevilla. Tenerife moved up to third from bottom, still a point away from safety as they seek to avoid an immediate return to the second division, after doubling their points tally earned from the previous eight matches. Last season's top scorer Nino netted his sixth goal of the 2009-10 campaign in the 14th minute as he ran onto Mikel Alonso's pass and buried his shot from the edge of the area despite claims of offside from the visitors. Nino missed a chance from a similar position soon after, and in the second half he was denied by Israeli goalkeeper Dudu Aouate, who also did well to save Julian Omar's rising shot. Mallorca substitute Pierre Webo headed wide with 12 minutes to go as his team, who have a 100 percent home record, extended a poor away run of just one win in 12 trips. Champions Barcelona lead Real Madrid by two points following Sunday's shock defeat by Atletico Madrid, while Valencia are third a further 10 points adrift.","Real Mallorca's hopes of qualifying for Champions League dented by Tenerife defeat .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- Singer Chris Brown earned a glowing probation report six months after he was sentenced to ""labor-oriented service"" for assaulting his pop star girlfriend, Rihanna, the judge said Thursday. Brown, 20, sat silently in court Thursday afternoon as Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg reviewed his probation report. ""It looks like you're doing really, really well,"" Schnegg said. The police chief in Richmond, Virginia -- where Brown is being allowed to complete his sentence -- reported that he had worked 32 days of hard labor, she said. Schnegg said when she sentenced Brown that she wanted to see him do ""actual physical labor, as opposed to some type of community service."" The report on his court-ordered domestic violence counseling said he had completed 17 out of 52 groups sessions, she said. The agency running the sessions reported ""you are participating and doing a very good job,"" the judge said. The judge rewarded Brown by signing an order allowing him to again travel outside the United States for concerts. When Brown returns to court on May 11, 2010, for his next probation progress report, he will be ""way over halfway there"" to completing his sentence, she said. Brown was sentenced in August to serve five years probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in ""labor-oriented service"" for the assault conviction. Schnegg also put a restraining order in place, requiring Brown to stay 50 yards away from Rihanna, 10 yards if the two are at the same industry event. The judge issued a strict warning to Brown not to violate the order, which remains in place until 2014. Brown was arrested after an early morning argument inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street on February 8, 2009. According to Brown's probation report, the February argument began over an incident at a Beverly Hills party. An earlier, sworn statement by Los Angeles Police Detective DeShon Andrews said the incident began when Rihanna found a text message on his cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with."" The pair argued while in the car driven by Brown, the police statement said. It went on to describe the assault in great detail, saying Brown punched Rihanna -- identified in the statement by her real first name, Robyn, and the first initial of her last name, Fenty -- numerous times and put her in a headlock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness. He threatened to beat her and kill her, according to the statement, and he bit her ear and her fingers. Eventually, the statement said, ""Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a domestic violence emergency protective order."" The detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing. Rihanna's injuries included cuts and bruises inflicted by a large ring on Brown's right hand, which he used to punch her, the probation report said. ""Officers at the scene observed numerous contusions and abrasions to the victim's face and forehead, as well as bruising to her left arm near the bicep,"" it said. ""They also saw abrasions to her arms near both wrists and on her upper chest near her collarbone and around her neck. There were abrasions on her left leg and on the inside of her upper lips."" Rihanna declined to speak to the probation investigator, so the probation report's details were gathered from police detectives who interviewed her soon after the attack. ""He beat me up,"" Rihanna told the police, the report said. Brown made a public apology in July in a video statement posted on his personal Web site. ""I have told Rihanna countless times, and I'm telling you today, that I'm truly, truly sorry in that I wasn't able to handle the situation both differently and better,"" Brown said in the Web site statement. ""What I did was unacceptable, 100 percent. I can only ask and pray that you forgive me. Please.""","Brown has done 6 months of sentence for beating girlfriend Rihanna .

"(CNN) -- Heavy snow in northern and central China has killed 21 people since Monday, the country's Ministry of Civil Affairs said Friday, according to state-run media. Xinhua news agency said the ministry did not provide the causes of the deaths, except to note that two school canteens had collapsed in Hebei and Henan provinces since Wednesday, killing four children. The snow began to fall Monday on northern and central Chinese provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hubei and Shaanxi, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Xinhua reported. More than 9,000 buildings have collapsed since then, Xinhua said. Citing the ministry, it said the snow has caused an estimated 4.5 billion yuan (nearly $660 million) in damages. The ministry said about 159,000 people have been evacuated from their homes or stranded vehicles, Xinhua reported. Civil Affairs Minister Li Xueju has ordered local authorities to provide food, water and clothing to those who are still stranded, ""and to make proper arrangements for people who lost their homes in the snow to get through the winter,"" Xinhua reported. It said the Civil Affairs Ministry and the Ministry of Finance have allocated 20 million yuan (about $3 million) from their central budgets to Shanxi and Hebei provinces to help move those affected by the snow and to help them build houses. Heavy snow has also fallen on Beijing, but no deaths have been reported there, Xinhua said.","The snow began to fall Monday on northern and central Chinese provinces .

"(CNN) -- As Toyota recalls millions of cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that an average of 25 percent of U.S. consumers who get recall notices don't follow through and fix their vehicles. The CNN Fact Check Desk wondered: Is there a way to ensure compliance with auto recalls? Most vehicle recalls involve free fixes for the consumer. â¢ Clarence Ditlow with the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, says there is not a process to ensure that auto owners comply with recalls. The center says vehicle insurers have an incentive and a method to reach car owners who haven't complied fully with recalls. ""Insurers have the VIN [vehicle identification numbers], and they could contact the insured drivers who have failed to comply,"" Ditlow says. Because states are responsible for issuing a vehicle's registration, Ditlow sees an opportunity for state governments to force compliance. He says that states could refuse to renew registration until the manufacturer's fix has been made. However, he says, no states have taken this step so far. â¢ According to Edmunds.com, some states do require owners to make the requisite repairs before they attempt to sell the affected car. â¢ Jeanne Salvatore, with the Insurance Information Institute, says that auto insurers will pay damage claims caused by the current Toyota defects, then go after Toyota for reimbursements. â¢ CNN Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis says that new car dealers are prevented from selling a defective car. â¢ If recall communications are deemed insufficient, the NHTSA can require further efforts from the manufacturer. But there is not a mechanism at the federal level to ensure that drivers comply. â¢ Bottom line: If the NHTSA's 25 percent noncompliance figure is any indication, there could be many affected Toyota models that do not get the requisite fix under the current recall. Although there have been suggestions for how to better enforce recalls, there is no mechanism in place to force drivers to make the change. CNN's Jen Haley and CNNMoney's Peter Valdes-Dapena contributed to this report.","Most recalls involve free fixes, but NHTSA says 25 percent of consumers don't comply .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. troops routinely face the threat of roadside bombs while fighting insurgencies in Afghanistan. They need the most protective clothing the market can bear, and they're getting it -- for now. North Carolina State University College of Textiles tests the flammability of different materials at this facility. Back home, a battle is brewing in Congress over the next lucrative contract for military uniforms. The issue boils down to the raw fiber used in their construction. Current uniforms are made in the United States, in Georgia, using a fabric called Defender M made by the TenCate company. It is favored by the military for its fire-resistant and breathable properties. But the fabric is made with a type of rayon imported from Austria, which normally would violate the military's buy-American requirement. This specific rayon cannot be produced in the United States for environmental reasons, so Congress passed an amendment allowing it to be temporarily imported. The extension expires, or ""sunsets,"" in 2013, but that year's defense budget is being determined now. The idea of the sunset is to give U.S. manufacturers time to come up with a comparable product. At stake: a defense contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars. American competitors have submitted alternatives, but after independent testing at North Carolina State University College of Textiles, the Defense Department concluded that TenCate's Defender M -- with its foreign-made fibers -- is the most flame-resistant. Dr. Roger Barker, who specializes in clothing flammability at the College of Textiles, conducted a demonstration for CNN. Based on his testing, the Army says Defender M resists fire the longest of other fabrics. ""What the new heat-resistant materials are able to do is add seconds of protection, so that seconds of protection can be the difference between a severe burn or a survival burn,"" Barker said. ""Life and death,"" echoes Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, regarding those extra seconds of fire protection. He asked the Senate to extend the waiver. ""So long as it's the best available in the world to protect our soldiers, we absolutely ought to maximize the use,"" Isakson told CNN. ""There is no American competitor that can meet or exceed it,"" Isakson said on the Senate floor. ""Obviously if there were, then that waiver would go away."" The U.S. Army's uniform procurer says soldiers prefer TenCate's product. ""They have consistently exceeded our expectations. This has proven to be a valuable fabric and well-received by our soldiers,"" Jeff Myhre told CNN. In a letter to CNN, a top military official said the ability to procure the foreign rayon ""a valuable authority."" ""Our periodic review of rayon requirements within the Military Services and testing of alternative items that are available domestically continue to support the determination that satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity of rayon yarn conforming to the domestic source requirements cannot be procured as needed,"" wrote Ashton Carter, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology & logistics. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, opposed Isakson's amendment, debating on the Senate floor that it ""permanently extends this waiver and will end all efforts to produce a domestic material to make military uniforms."" Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, agrees with Graham that U.S. companies won't have an incentive to invest in research and development. He says the exception was supposed to be temporary, and ""favors foreign suppliers of rayon over our own American companies."" He argued on the Senate floor that in due time, U.S. companies would be able to demonstrate an ability to manufacture materials that meet Army requirements. He's also worried about jobs. ""Some companies, like DuPont, for example, have already lost hundreds of jobs owing to their inability to compete for Army contracts,"" he said. The Senate voted, and the nays had it. No extension, no more imports of this fabric as of 2013. What next? The House of Representatives is expected to take up the bill when members return from the August recess. Isakson is confident his argument will prevail. ""Facts are stubborn things. I think when the facts get out they'll understand it's the right thing to do. Our armed forces want it and it's the best thing for our soldiers,"" he said. Pentagon Correspondent Chris Lawrence contributed to this report.","Uniforms made in Georgia by TenCate company, using a fabric called Defender M .

"Lexington, Missouri (CNN) -- Police arrested a sixth member of a Missouri family under investigation for allegations of child sexual abuse, police said. Darrel Mohler has been charged with two counts of rape, Lafayette County Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh said at a news conference. Missouri police did not have Mohler in custody earlier. On the request of Missouri officials, Marion County authorities went to Mohler's home in Silver Springs, Florida, and caught him just before he pulled into the driveway, according to a news release from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was subsequently arrested. Mohler told police he ""was aware of what was going on in Missouri,"" and that he had not been there since the 1980s, according to the sheriff's office. Five members of the Mohler family of Lafayette County, Missouri, were arrested earlier this week after six alleged victims, who are relatives of the five suspects, made accusations of sexual abuse. A sixth person, described as an ""associate"" of the family, was arrested Thursday but released Friday, police said. The six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City. CNN does not identify alleged sexual assault victims. Police did not have enough to charge Darrel Mohler earlier, but after examining the victims' statements, obtained enough information to charge him, Alumbaugh said. He added that he does not think Darrel is on the run. Darrel Mohler, 72, is the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, according to KSHB. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47. More charges against the family members are expected next week, the sheriff said. Current charges for some of the arrested include rape, deviate sexual assault and use [of] child in sexual performance, according to Missouri State Courts online case management system. Alumbaugh said that Larry Kidd, 55, of Kansas City, Missouri -- an ""associate"" of the Mohler family -- was picked up by police following a tip, cooperated with police and has been released. The alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said earlier. The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse provided by one of the alleged victims. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said. Mohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the Independence, Missouri-based organization said in a statement. Lay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, said the organization, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children. Mohler Sr. went through the group's registered youth worker program, but ""his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,"" the statement said. Some lay ministers might help take care of the church, while others might speak at services, said the organization's spokeswoman, Linda Booth. The Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Investigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence, but there were no plans to continue the searches, Alumbaugh said Friday. He declined to comment on any evidence found. CNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","NEW: Darrel Mohler, another relative, charged with two counts of rape Friday .

"(CNN) -- American Airlines announced Tuesday it will resume commercial flights into Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Friday, making it the first airline to do so. Commercial flights ended on January 12, when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed more than 200,000 people and damaged many of the country's buildings, including some at Toussaint Louverture International Airport, in the capital. The first flight will depart Miami International Airport in Florida at 6:40 a.m., arriving at 8:35 a.m. in Port-au-Prince, American Airlines said in a news release. ""This is that crack in the dam that we so badly needed and our passengers so badly wanted, to start moving regularly scheduled traffic into and out of Haiti,"" spokesman Tim Smith told CNN Radio. ""We'll start out with three main flights a day from south Florida, two from Miami and one from Fort Lauderdale. Then we'll also fly a JFK New York flight into Haiti four days a week."" Smith said that, despite damage to the airport, the airline was prepared to deal with passengers. ""One of the things we did very soon after the earthquake is that, as we were going in carrying relief supplies, we also sent in some American employees and folks from a construction firm that we worked with on the mainland to actually begin working to repair our facilities there at the Port-au-Prince terminal."" Haitian customs officials will work out of a cargo facility because of damage at the main terminal, Smith said. ""These flights serve as major milestones toward helping the country rebuild,"" Peter Dolara, American's senior vice president for Mexico, the Caribbean and Latin America, said in the news release. ""With commercial air service restored, we can better connect loved ones and provide consistent transportation to and from Haiti."" Also beginning March 12, American Eagle will commence new service into Port-au-Prince from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and daily flights from the Dominican Republic cities of Santo Domingo and Santiago. ""We have begun our journey to recover from the catastrophic earthquake, but with support from companies like American Airlines, we hope it won't be nearly as long,"" said Ralph Latortue, consul general of Haiti in Florida. American has served Haiti since 1971 and employs more than 100 people in Port-au-Prince, according to the airline. Since the day after the earthquake, American Airlines and American Eagle have continued flying into and out of Haiti -- carrying relief workers, medical personnel, humanitarian aid and evacuating hundreds of people. A spokeswoman for Spirit Airlines, which had a daily flight from Fort Lauderdale to Port-au-Prince, said the company was working to gain approval to resume its flights beginning Friday. ""We're awaiting the response from the airport,"" said spokeswoman Misty Pinson. A spokesman for Delta Air Lines said it was working with Haitian authorities to reinstate service ""as quickly as possible."" The work on the American Airlines terminal was carried out by Odebrecht, a Sao Paulo, Brazil-based construction company that built American's terminal at Miami International Airport, said spokeswoman Renata Pinheiro. A cargo building that was undamaged by the earthquake was transformed into a terminal, and immigration and customs services were located there, she said. A terminal that suffered only minor damaged was fixed. ""It wasn't a reconstruction of the airport itself, it was really making it operational,"" she said about the effort. The company's workforce of 75 included 30 Haitian baggage handlers who ""became construction helpers,"" she said. ""Odebrecht's people trained them to do welding and painting. The really cool thing that we're super happy about is the fact that the whole thing came about in just three weeks."" Among the toughest challenges was finding construction supplies, the company said in a news release. Odebrecht solved that by obtaining materials in Puerto Rico and sending them by barge to the Dominican Republic, then moving them by truck to the Haitian capital. ""This has been a genuine labor of love, but also one of absolute commitment,"" said Antonio Pinto, Odebrecht's project executive in Haiti. ""In the most basic human terms, it is essential to reopen this airport and to reconnect the people of Haiti with their families and friends abroad."" The company's other projects include rebuilding and fortifying levees in New Orleans, Louisiana, under contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.","American will resume service Friday morning .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When Washington manicurist Lidia Schaefer returned to her native village in Ethiopia, she was troubled by what she saw: children walking three hours each way to attend classes held not in a school, but under a tree. Lidia Schaefer sold her house and car and set aside tips and part of her salary to raise money for the school. When she learned in 1998 that one of the girls she'd met -- Medhine -- had been attacked and killed by a hyena after falling behind other children during the long trek home from school, Schaefer knew she had to act. She began setting aside a third of her salary and all of her tips, and later sold her house and car, to raise enough money to build a school for the village. ""She's definitely not your average manicurist,"" says Denise Abrahams, a longtime client. ""This is the kind of thing that you hear about Oprah Winfrey doing."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes . For Schaefer, it was simply a matter of doing what felt right. ""I don't work with my head,"" she says. ""I really work with my heart.""  Watch Schaefer's clients and colleagues discuss her efforts Â» . Born in Feres Mai, a large village in northern Ethiopia, Schaefer moved to the United States in the mid-1970s when civil war broke out at home. During her troubling visit back home in the '90s, she recalls, ""I promised the children I was going to open a school for them."" But she had no idea how to tackle such a big project, especially while raising her own two children and working 12-hour days, six days a week.  Watch Schaefer speak with CNN's Larry King Â» . The motivation to fulfill her promise came with the news of Medhine's death. ""That really pushed me to do it,"" she says, ""to build a school so that wouldn't happen again."" Schaefer lobbied the Ethiopian government to donate land in a central location so the school could serve children from several nearby villages. The decision was made to build a secondary school, since the nearest one was more than 18 miles away. Back in Washington, Schaefer began setting aside money for construction of the school. ""I was working two days for the school, four days for me,"" she recalls. Her clients and co-workers rallied to help, holding raffles and making contributions. Several clients bought individual doors or windows for the school.  Watch Schaefer talk about the school Â» . But Schaefer realized it wouldn't be enough. To finish the school, she needed to do something drastic. In 2002, she gave up her symbols of the American dream, selling her home and car. It's a sacrifice that still stuns her colleagues and friends. ""I couldn't believe it,"" remembers salon manager Patty Gonzalez. But Schaefer saw nothing remarkable about her decision. ""I don't feel like I [gave] up a lot,"" she says. ""I want [the children] to learn, to get something out of their life."" Schaefer ultimately raised more than $250,000 for the school, which was completed in 2006. When she went back for the dedication, Schaefer was honored with an elaborate procession through the village. For her, it was gratifying to see what she'd accomplished. ""I was so happy, I can't even describe it,"" she recalls. Today, nearly 1,500 students are educated in the school, which boasts an eight-building campus with 16 classrooms, a science lab and library. ""It's simple, but it's nice,"" Schaefer says. Though she'd hoped to name the school in memory of Medhine, the government -- which runs the school -- instead named it the Lidia Secondary School, telling Schaefer, ""We want it to be your name so that more people [will] be like you."" Schaefer has indeed inspired many others to follow her example. When Ethiopian communities around the United States heard about what she'd been able to achieve, they launched an effort to build more schools in her region of northern Ethiopia. So far, they've raised enough money to build 12 schools, due to be completed by July 2009. Schaefer still sets aside her tips and wages to support her school and has kept up her fundraising efforts to buy supplies. A colleague at the salon designed T-shirts to raise money for desks for the students. Schaefer's next goal is to equip the school with computers.

"(CNN) -- Close to one million strollers have been recalled by their manufacturer following reports at least 12 babies or toddlers had their fingers amputated after they were caught in the hinges. British company Maclaren said the recall concerns Chinese-made models on sale in the U.S. that open with an ""umbrella"" mechanism. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said customers should stop using the strollers immediately. Maclaren said it was issuing a free repair kit make the hinges safe. The CPSC said the warning concerned models dating back to 1999 sold at stores including Target and Babies R Us. The mechanism ""poses a fingertip amputation and laceration hazard to the child when the consumer is unfolding,"" the CPSC said in statement issued jointly with Maclaren. Maclaren said its Volo, Triumph, Quest Sport, Quest Mod, Techno XT, Techno XLR, Twin Triumph, Twin Techno and Easy Traveller models -- which retail between $100 to $400 -- were affected. The manufacturer said its strollers met required safety standards, but the recall was being applied voluntarily to ""alert the operator when opening or closing the stroller of the possible risk of injury."" In a separate statement, Maclaren's European arm said that no recall was being issued in the European Union, where there had been fewer reported injuries, despite higher sales. ""We wish to reassure our customers that they should continue to use their existing Maclaren buggies since they are safe when opened and closed correctly,"" it said. ""Our advice is that consumers should take the same level of caution and care as when opening or closing a car door or any other moving part that can be found in many other baby and toddler products. ""There are a lower number of similar reported incidents amongst the considerably higher number of Maclaren buggies sold in Europe. If a buggy is folded or unfolded in line with our operating instructions the risk of injury is non-existent."" â¢ U.S. consumers can contact Maclaren at 877-688-2326 or visit www.maclaren.us/recall to receive the repair kit.","Maclaren says some of it strollers pose a risk of finger amputations .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- As Tehran approaches the 30th anniversary of the Iranian hostage crisis, in which dozens of Americans where held against their will for 444 days, the Islamic republic is firmly warning against reformists taking to the streets to protest the government. Still reeling from the massive demonstration that followed the country's disputed presidential election, Iran on Wednesday will commemorate November 4, 1979, when a group of Islamist students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 53 hostages and effectively ending diplomatic relations with the United States. While the government will allow the ""faithful"" to celebrate the anniversary of the embassy seizure, those who ""intend to gather illegally and spread lies among people who gather to peacefully participate ... will be held responsible for their actions,"" said Ahmad Reza Radan, head of Iran's security forces, according to the semi-official Iran Student Correspondent Association. The government of Iran arrested more than 1,000 people in a massive crackdown after the June 12 election, in which incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. In the aftermath of the fallout, the government accused several reformists, including opposition candidates Mehdi Karrubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi, of spreading anti-government propaganda and fueling the anger among the public. Despite warnings from Iran's hardline leaders, the reformists have largely refused to back down. They released the names of 72 protesters they say were killed in the unrest that followed the election -- more than double the government's official number. Karrubi, a former parliamentary speaker, has been especially vocal about the claims of detainee rape. He publishing a firsthand account of one alleged victim on his Web site last month. He has been scorned by government hard-liners, whose credibility and legitimacy have been publicly questioned since the elections. On Wednesday, Islamic authorities tried to pre-emptively silence anti-government demonstrations and rhetoric. According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Hossein Sajedinia, deputy of operations for Iran's security forces, said, ""The police will not allow a handful [of individuals] to disrupt the organization and safety of this day, by fooling people and the youth.""","Wednesday marks 30th anniversary of the Iranian hostage crisis .

"(CNN) -- Actress Gina Gershon is demanding a retraction from Vanity Fair after the magazine reported ""high-end Hollywood dinner-party gossip"" that former President Clinton ""has been seen visiting"" her in California. Actress Gina Gershon ""is extremely offended"" by the Vanity Fair article, her lawyers say. The lengthy article by the magazine's national editor, Todd Purdum, mentioned the actress along with several other women rumored to be associated with Clinton, all anonymously sourced. ""Todd Purdum's insinuation is a lie, and it is irresponsible journalism,"" said Gershon's publicist, Mara Buxbaum. ""We are demanding a retraction."" A letter sent by Gershon's attorneys to Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Graydon Carter, obtained by CNN, demanded a published correction and retraction and threatened possible litigation for defamation. The actress appeared in 1995's ""Showgirls"" and the more recent ""P.S. I Love You."" Gershon ""is extremely offended by the false and defamatory inference that she engaged in an adulterous relationship with the President,"" the letter says, adding that the actress has been in the same room with Clinton three times, always in the presence of at least a dozen people. ""It is apparent that Vanity Fair was intent upon publishing unsubstantiated rumors, and that it avoided learning the true facts so that the truth would not get in the way,"" the letter says. ""Such conduct is reckless and malicious, giving rise to substantial liability for defamation."" In a statement, Vanity Fair denied that the article indicates any ""improper relationship"" between Clinton and Gershon. ""The story merely examines the concerns of some of Clinton's aides about reports of his behavior,"" the magazine said. ""We don't believe that any correction is warranted."" Purdum's article, ""The Comeback Id,"" quoted multiple anonymous sources questioning the former president's behavior since leaving the White House. The article suggested that Clinton's personality had changed since his 2004 heart bypass surgery and said there were reports of Clinton ""seeing a lot of women on the road."" Clinton issued a tirade against Purdum on Monday when asked by Huffington Post writer Mayhill Fowler what he thought of ""the hatchet job somebody did on you in Vanity Fair,"" according to a recording of the exchange posted on the Huffington Post's Web site. ""[He's] sleazy,"" Clinton responded. ""He's a really dishonest reporter."" Clinton said that he had not read the article but that he was told that ""there's five or six just blatant lies in there. But he's a real slimy guy."" Calling Purdum a ""scumbag,"" Clinton said ""he's one of the guys that propagated all those lies about Whitewater for Kenneth Starr. He's just a dishonest guy -- can't help it."" Purdum ""didn't use a single name, he didn't cite a single source in all those things he said,"" the former president said, adding that the article was ""part of the national media's attempt to nail Hillary for Obama. ""Anytime you read a story that slimes a public figure with anonymous quotes, it ought to make the bells go off in your head,"" he said. Jay Carson, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton's campaign, said late Monday that ""President Clinton was understandably upset about an outrageously unfair article, but the language today was inappropriate, and he wishes he had not used it."" Purdum, a former New York Times reporter who covered the Clinton White House and is married to former Clinton press secretary Dee Dee Myers, defended his article on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" on Monday afternoon, saying he was ""very careful to say there is no clear-cut evidence that President Clinton has done anything improper."" ""I reject the notion that I'm making an insinuation,"" Purdum said. ""But I'm very comfortable quoting the people I quote because I know who they are, and I know that they are very senior people who have known President Clinton for a very long time and work for him at very high levels.""","Gina Gershon accuses Vanity Fair reporter of ""irresponsible journalism,"" lying .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani made a U-turn Saturday -- first declaring that the military offensive against Islamic militants in South Waziristan had ended, then saying there is no timeframe for its completion. The Pakistani army is conducting an intense operation to rout militants from their haven along the country's border with Afghanistan. The militants, in turn, have launched a series of deadly attacks in retaliation. Answering a question from a reporter who asked whether the government will engage in dialogue with the Taliban in South Waziristan, Gilani said the operation was over. ""There was talk of dialogue even during the Malakand Operation. But now, the operation in South Waziristan is over. In fact, at the moment, there is talk of an operation in Orakzai Agency,"" he said. Malakand is another operation that the military is conducting in another region. Orakzai is one of seven districts that make up the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. Like South Waziristan, it is also considered rife with militants. Gilani's comments, made in the eastern city of Lahore, were aired on national television. But hours later, he backtracked. ""It could have been in a different context,"" he told reporters in Karachi. These remarks were also aired on television. Gilani also declined to say when the offensive might end. ""We will take military action wherever we get information about the presence of militants,"" he said. When reached for clarification, the prime minister's office pointed CNN to the second statement. The army did not comment on Gilani's remarks. A release it sends out daily made no mention of an end to the offensive on Saturday. Instead, Saturday's release provided the usual breakdown of operations in various parts of the country, including South Waziristan. CNN's Samson Desta and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani tells reporter operation against Taliban is over .

"(CNN) -- We're reviewing two $99 turn-by-turn navigation applications for the iPhone, TomTom and Navigon. Yes, that's right, a $99 application for your phone to take the place of a stand-alone device that doesn't cost much more than that. First off, if you plan to use your iPhone as a turn-by-turn navigator, you'll need some sort of mount that keeps it in constant view of the sky (and to keep you from wrecking your car while trying to look at the screen). As I was driving around downtown Atlanta, Georgia, both applications spent a good amount of time telling me they couldn't get a good GPS lock, even after I dug out a window mount from my box of bits and pieces. Both of these applications have most of the features you would expect; basically, put in a destination, and they tell you how to get there. Both can save favorites; both even have a walking mode (though I haven't played with this enough to recommend it). Both take up a ton of space, and both currently cost $99 (though the Navigon had an early buy-in price of $69). Navigon also has the TomTom beat on features: An early update added text-to-speech, which means Navigon's app says the street you should turn on and not just ""turn left."" Navigon also just released a $24.99 (intro priced at $19.99) upgrade option that will give you live traffic information. I've asked TomTom about possible updates, and they say they're considering what features to add. My early call for the best interface goes to the Navigon app. And this held up the more I used both of them. I find it much more intuitive; things are where I expect them to be. When I want to change something on the TomTom, I often find myself repeatedly clicking through the categories, trying to find a particular setting. The Navigon's interface is better for me. An example of the interface conundrum: When I got the software, I hit the ""home"" icon to tell it to direct me to my house. Of course, I hadn't set that address up yet. The TomTom told me I had to add it from the ""manage favorites"" menu; the Navigon app asked me if I'd like to add it and let me do it right there. Bottom line . Overall, my preference for the Navigon app holds true. I like the look and feel of the maps better, how it switches to night view automatically and its on-screen and voice alerts. The TomTom, by comparison, seems very low-end -- the maps aren't as nice -- and without text-to-speech, the voice prompts fall short. I like to know what street I'm looking for without looking at the screen. The big feather (at an additional $120) in TomTom's hat is its car kit. Essentially a dock designed for your car, the device adds power, a bigger speaker and a better GPS chip. The bigger chip should help the application be more accurate with your location and provide quicker prompts when you need to turn. But at that point, you'll have spent more than $200 on a navigator that uses your iPhone as its brain. I just got my hands on TomTom's dock, and although it's nice and should improve the GPS performance, I'm not sure it's worth an extra $120. So, down to brass tacks: Is it worth it to pay $99 for a smart phone navigation application when you could buy a stand-alone model (likely with a better GPS chip) for the same or not much more? Personally, I like having it all on my phone, one unit that does everything (and I probably won't forget it in the car to be stolen). Other people will probably rather have the stand-alone. And of course, there's a big caveat: Google. The technology powerhouse has a turn-by-turn application in beta for its Android 2 operating system. It's free for phones that run Android 2.0, and word is that they're in talks with Apple to get it on the iPhone (word that brought a big hit to the stock of both GPS giants, Garmin and TomTom). Who knows what's in the future for these apps? But I'll bet they'll come up with something to remain at least somewhat viable.","TomTom, Navigon iPhone apps use GPS to give detailed street directions .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A Boston trolley operator killed in a crash last year likely had a sleep disorder and fell into a ""micro-sleep"" shortly before the collision, the National Transportation Safety Board ruled Tuesday. Since last year's trolley crash in Boston, Massachusetts, there has been another incident on the same line. The safety board, completing a 14-month investigation, faulted operator Ter'rese Edmonds for ignoring a red signal along the tracks but directed harsh criticism at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority which operates the train system. The transit authority failed to screen operators for sleep disorders while enforcing a work schedule that could prevent train operators from getting enough sleep, the NTSB said. The NTSB's conclusion that Edmonds fell asleep is partly conjecture, the board acknowledged. Edmonds, a part-time trolley operator, had an opportunity for adequate sleep the day of the wreck, although investigators were not able to determine her sleep history. In addition, Edmonds had been given a break earlier in the day, had not complained to co-workers about fatigue and was found to be free of drugs and alcohol. ""We cannot say for certain that she did have it (sleep apnea),"" board member Dr. Mitch Garber said. But the NTSB concluded there was a ""high likelihood"" that Edmonds had an undiagnosed sleep disorder, largely because she was obese and because tests showed she had taken doxylamine, an ingredient commonly found in sleep aids, suggesting she had trouble sleeping during at least one of the nights leading up to the accident. In addition, there is a lack of other evidence to explain why Edmonds failed to slow or stop the train, the board concluded. Tests showed that the stopped train could be seen at a distance of 764 feet, and that ""there were multiple opportunities to slow and stop this (advancing) train,"" NTSB investigator Wayne Workman said. ""There was not any evidence that brakes were applied."" Edmonds' westbound train was traveling at 38 mph when it struck the other train, which was traveling at 3 mph in the same direction. An estimated 185 to 200 passengers were on the two trains during the collision in the Boston, Massachusetts, suburb of Newton. Damage was estimated at $8.6 million. The board also noted that the MBTA had not installed systems on its Green Line to prevent two trains from occupying the same stretch of track, the NTSB said. The systems, known as ""positive train control"" systems, would have prevented the accident, the safety board said. One year after the fatal accident, more than 50 people were injured in another accident on the same line. The Boston accident highlights two issues that have risen to the top of the NTSB's concerns in recent years, positive train control and operator fatigue. The safety board says positive train control issues were involved in two other light rail incidents this year, a May 8 wreck on the same MBTA Green Line and a June 22 wreck which killed nine on Washington, D.C.'s Metro system. ""If technology exists... on the other (MBTA) lines, why would the Green Line not have everything possible... to prevent accidents from happening,"" NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker asked. ""I don't understand that as an operator; I just don't."" The Metro system had a form of positive train separation, but investigators are exploring whether that crash resulted from a circuit malfunction. The safety board said fatigue issues affect all forms of transportation. It noted that two pilots fell asleep during a flight over Hawaii and that sleep issues played a role in a Cosco Busan ship incident in San Francisco, California, and a fatal bus crash in Mexican Hat, Utah. Rosenker said details that surfaced in the Boston trolley crash will guide the NTSB in the future. ""Now it is up to us, because we now are the advocates for these changes,"" Rosenker said. Recommendations resulting from the Boston crash ""raise the bar of safety not only in this system, but across the United States.""","Obesity, evidence that operator was taking sleep aid leads to conjecture .

"(CNN) -- A major sponsor for Tiger Woods announced Sunday that it is dropping the golf star in light of recent controversy swirling around his personal life. Accenture, a management consulting firm, said on its Web site that ""given the circumstances of the last two weeks ... the company has determined that he is no longer the right representative for its advertising."" The move ends a sponsorship arrangement that lasted six years. Another major sponsor, Gillette, said Saturday it was ""limiting"" Woods' role in its marketing programs to give him the privacy to work on family relationships. Woods announced on his own Web site Friday that he is taking an ""indefinite break"" from professional golf. The 33-year-old golfer, who tops the sport's world rankings, has been mired in controversy since he crashed his car outside his Florida mansion late last month. In the week following the crash, Woods apologized for ""transgressions"" that let his family down, and US Weekly magazine published a report alleging that Woods had an affair with a 24-year-old cocktail waitress named Jaimee Grubbs. US Weekly's report followed a National Enquirer article before the crash that the athlete was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess -- an assertion the hostess vigorously denied, according to The New York Post. The statement Friday on Woods' site was the first time he admitted to infidelity; in a previous statement, he referred to his ""transgressions."" The golf phenomenon, who has won three U.S. Open titles and the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times, said in the statement that he will spend his hiatus with his family.

"Lexington, Missouri (CNN) -- Police arrested a sixth member of a Missouri family under investigation for allegations of child sexual abuse, police said. Darrel Mohler has been charged with two counts of rape, Lafayette County Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh said at a news conference. Missouri police did not have Mohler in custody earlier. On the request of Missouri officials, Marion County authorities went to Mohler's home in Silver Springs, Florida, and caught him just before he pulled into the driveway, according to a news release from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was subsequently arrested. Mohler told police he ""was aware of what was going on in Missouri,"" and that he had not been there since the 1980s, according to the sheriff's office. Five members of the Mohler family of Lafayette County, Missouri, were arrested earlier this week after six alleged victims, who are relatives of the five suspects, made accusations of sexual abuse. A sixth person, described as an ""associate"" of the family, was arrested Thursday but released Friday, police said. The six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City. CNN does not identify alleged sexual assault victims. Police did not have enough to charge Darrel Mohler earlier, but after examining the victims' statements, obtained enough information to charge him, Alumbaugh said. He added that he does not think Darrel is on the run. Darrel Mohler, 72, is the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, according to KSHB. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47. More charges against the family members are expected next week, the sheriff said. Current charges for some of the arrested include rape, deviate sexual assault and use [of] child in sexual performance, according to Missouri State Courts online case management system. Alumbaugh said that Larry Kidd, 55, of Kansas City, Missouri -- an ""associate"" of the Mohler family -- was picked up by police following a tip, cooperated with police and has been released. The alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said earlier. The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse provided by one of the alleged victims. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said. Mohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the Independence, Missouri-based organization said in a statement. Lay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, said the organization, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children. Mohler Sr. went through the group's registered youth worker program, but ""his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,"" the statement said. Some lay ministers might help take care of the church, while others might speak at services, said the organization's spokeswoman, Linda Booth. The Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Investigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence, but there were no plans to continue the searches, Alumbaugh said Friday. He declined to comment on any evidence found. CNN's Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.","NEW: Darrel Mohler, another relative, charged with two counts of rape Friday .

"Editor's note: This article contains profanity that some may find offensive. This is part one of a three part series showing different aspects of life inside Colombia's drug gangs. A gang member sniffs in a cloud of cocaine dust as he cuts the drug with other substances. MEDELLIN, Colombia (CNN) -- A young man with tattoos covering one arm rolls hundreds of marijuana joints in the half-light of a shack, perched on a hillside in a Medellin slum. A 9mm pistol and a .38 revolver lie on his work bench. An old battery-powered radio blares out the salsa music classic, ""Todo Tiene Su Final"" or ""Everything Comes To An End."" ""I'm getting calluses on my tongue rolling all these spliffs,"" he laughs, telling me has enough marijuana for about 1,000 joints. He and his comrades plan to sell them for about 50 cents apiece. A few doors away, two other gang members have raided their mother's kitchen for soup plates, drinking glasses and a blender. They've just taken delivery of a kilogram (2.2 pound) brick of pure cocaine. Their job now is to cut it and package it in gram bags to peddle on street corners they control.  Watch as cocaine is cut Â» . A female gang member shows up with two more bags, one containing powdered caffeine and the other lidocaine, a dental anesthetic used to dilute the pure cocaine. They mix business with pleasure. Every now and again one of the gang members pulls off the top of the blender and breathes in a cloud of pulverized cocaine. One of them coughs and keels over in the kitchen. Seconds later, he's back on his feet snorting cocaine off a spoon. ""Breathing that cocaine cloud mellows me out so I need a line to take me back up,"" he says. Standing in the background, snorting lines of pure cocaine off a pocketknife is the gang leader, a man in his mid-20s. His cohorts call him ""Chief."" He tells me they'll sell the heavily cut cocaine for $1.50 a gram. Higher purity powder goes for about $4 a gram. That's much cheaper than the $50 or $60 a heavily cut gram costs on most U.S. and European streets, according to estimates from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. I agree to conceal Chief's true identity to protect him from the police and rival gangs. As we chat, he dismantles a small caliber pistol.  Watch the gangs in action Â» . ""Around here the only law is the rules of the street,"" he explains. ""The rules don't change; they always will be the rules, here or anywhere else."" A trusted source, who made the introduction for me, tells me Chief is a ""total animal living on borrowed time,"" who has earned so many enemies he cannot risk stepping outside the few hundred square yards of his home turf. ""I'm only human, of course I get afraid,"" he says. ""Afraid my life will end suddenly before I can do anything to get out of this war."" Since the time when undisputed cocaine king Pablo Escobar held sway here, the ""northeastern commune"" district has forged a fearsome reputation as a recruiting ground for drug cartel hit men and violent gang wars. Medellin is once again in the grip of a vicious drug war. In January to September this year, city authorities say the murder rate has more than doubled with almost 2,000 killings. Officials at the Medellin public prosecutor's offices say the vast majority of victims were shot, likely victims of rival drug gangs and cocaine capos.  Watch marijuana joints being rolled by the hundreds Â» . That makes Medellin as dangerous as Ciudad Juarez, the frontier town dubbed Mexico's most dangerous city as a result of the ongoing cartel war there. Authorities in Juarez say killings are up from last year and are hitting record highs. Colombian authorities estimate there are around 130 street gangs -- known as ""combos"" -- in Medellin, totaling some 6,000 members. Their only real loyalty is to the money that drug capos dole out to hire a gang's services. Capos will supply them with drugs to retail on street corners and occasionally issue them weapons to take on rival gangs loyal to another crime boss. Until earlier this year, Medellin's drug underworld was ruled by the so-called ""Office of Envigado,"" named after a district of the Medellin metropolitan area. The ""office"" was a syndicate of the top cocaine bosses who agreed on the basic rules of doing business in the area. They shared smuggling routes and acted as the ultimate enforcers if cartel members reneged on deals or debts. But the ""office"" has been ripped apart by infighting. Some senior members were arrested, some of those already in jail were extradited and others cut cooperation deals with U.S. authorities. That left the lower ranks fighting to fill the power vacuum. It's an internal battle that is still raging.  Watch how CNN's Karl Penhaul got unprecedented access to the gangs Â» . ""The ones fueling this war are the ones from the other side. They've f***ed up Medellin,"" Chief says. ""They're from Medellin but they're traitors."" ""They want to get control of all Medellin so they're shooting up one gang then another. They're getting paid to fight. These are wars between the big capos and we're paying the price out here on the streets,"" he adds. Chief and his allies have stopped rivals intruding on their turf by strictly enforcing what they call ""street rules."" A day before our meeting, Chief says he helped bury one of his friends who had been gunned down when he ventured into the heart of Medellin with a girlfriend. ""I couldn't even bear to take a look inside the coffin,"" he began explaining. ""We don't really know who did it. But it was that crack head girlfriend who persuaded him to go down there. So we killed the bitch. ""You see that's street rules. You have to answer for our friend and the only way you can do that is pay with your life,"" he says. Chief shies away from questions about which cartel boss is bankrolling his gang. But clearly somebody has been supplying them with guns. They pose with a Czech-made .22-caliber rifle and an assortment of semi-automatic pistols -- as well as the wholesale supply of drugs they then sell on the streets. My conversation with Chief is interrupted when another gang member arrives at the improvised drug den. He mumbles to his boss that a local man has been beating up his wife. Chief authorizes his underling to go and thrash the accused man with a pool cue. ""I don't think we need cameras for this one please,"" he requests. As I get ready to leave I have one last question for Chief: I want to know if he ever had any dreams. ""I've tried to get out of this but it's never quite worked out,"" he says. ""I'd like to sail away in a sailboat. Alone and far away.""","Drug war raging in Medellin, Colombia, has seen almost 2,000 killings this year .

"(CNN) -- Nigerian footballer Stephen Worgu has been sentenced to 40 lashes after he was convicted of drinking alcohol in Sudan where he plays for first division side Al-Merreikh of Omdurman. The 20-year-old forward, who joined the northern Sudan outfit in October 2008, was found guilty of drinking alcohol and driving under the influence by an east Khartoum court. Alcohol is illegal in the Muslim north of Sudan according to Article 78 of the penal code, although it is not in the semi-autonomous and largely non-Muslim south. The court ordered Worgu to pay a fine of $20 for the alcohol consumption, $80 for driving under the influence as well as receiving 40 lashes for the incident which is said to have taken place in the capital Khartoum on August 21. The forward's lawyer has appealed against the punishment for the player who had previously admitted in interviews that he had struggled to adapt to the different culture and religious life in Sudan. Worgu, who has been a regular for the Nigerian Under-20 side, had moved to Al-Merreikh for $2.6 million from Enyimba in Nigeria ahead of Egyptian side Al-Ahly in what was one of the biggest transfers in African football. He had previously been the top scorer in the African Champions League in 2008 after he found the net 13 times but has largely struggled to recapture that form at Al-Merreikh.","Nigeria footballer Stephen Worgu could receive 40 lashes after he was convicted of drinking alcohol in Sudan .

Services took place around the world to mark the 91st anniversary of the armistice signed between Germany and the Allies on November 11, 1918. Depending on where it is celebrated, the day is alternatively known as Armistice Day, Remembrance Day, Poppy Day or Veterans Day. In Britain, Queen Elizabeth led Remembrance Day ceremonies in Westminster Abbey, a service also attended by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and other senior politicians and military leaders. The day has special resonance because the last remaining veterans, William Stone, Henry Allingham and Harry Patch, all died this year. The dignitaries joined people around the country in observing the traditional two-minute silence. The Very Rev. Dr. John Hall, dean of Westminster, began the service by talking about the moment when the guns fell silent in Europe 91 years ago. ""We remember, with grief, the gas and the mud, the barbed wire, the bombardment, the terror, the telegram; and, with gratitude, the courage and sacrifice. Never again, they said; the war to end all wars. With resolution we remember,"" Hall said. In Paris, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel held a ceremony under the Arc de Triomphe. Australians observed one minute silence at 11 a.m., in memory of those who died or suffered in all of the nation's wars and armed conflicts. ""Their loss is a reminder that there is nothing glorious about war. Those called upon to fight know that better than anyone,"" Gen. Peter Cosgrove, chairman of the Council of the Australian War Memorial, said Wednesday. ""But they also know that, when all else fails, it is necessary to fight against the tyrannies that threaten liberty. That cause transcends the ages, and it is a noble one."" U.S. military forces, especially those in Iraq and Afghanistan, also were to observe Veterans Day, keenly aware of the costs of war. In the United States, the sacrifices of the military in the raging war in Afghanistan and the winding-down war in Iraq stand front and center in the nation's consciousness. President Barack Obama paid tribute Wednesday to those who have lost their lives in the nation's wars, as well as to the men and women who currently serve. ""There's no tribute, no commemoration, no praise that can truly match the magnitude of your service and your sacrifice,"" he said in a speech at Arlington National Cemetery, on a rainy, overcast Veterans Day. Earlier, the president had laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns. Millions were killed in World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918. France, Britain and the United States defeated Germany and its allies, such as Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.","Nations honor those who sacrificed their lives in wars on Wednesday .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A 1965 Volkswagen van stolen 35 years ago in Spokane, Washington, was found by customs agents in a shipping container in the Los Angeles port last month, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said. The blue van, in pristine condition, was bound for Germany along with several vintage Volkswagens, Customs and Border Protection Port Director Todd Hoffman said. The Arizona company that was shipping the van had no idea the vehicle was stolen from a Spokane auto shop in 1974, Hoffman said. Customs and Border Protection agents routinely run vehicle identification numbers through the National Insurance Crime Bureau database for all vehicles being loaded on ships for export, he said. They recover stolen vehicles about once a week, but they usually are high-end late-model luxury cars, he said. While it was likely worth just a few hundred dollars when it was stolen, the VW is now valued at about $27,000, he said. Allstate Insurance Company, which paid the original owner for the loss decades ago, now owns the van, according to Allstate spokeswoman Megan Brunet. The insurance company has not decided if it will sell the van at auction -- which is the routine -- or put it to other use because of it's history, she said.","Van stolen in Spokane found in Los Angeles shipping container .

"London, England (CNN) -- The British government has apologized and offered compensation to hundreds of people who suffered the effects of thalidomide, a drug once prescribed to pregnant women that later was linked to major birth defects. Thalidomide sufferers and campaigners hailed the move and said it was long overdue. British doctors prescribed thalidomide for expectant mothers from 1958 to 1962 to control the symptoms of morning sickness. The drug, developed by a German firm, was used internationally as a sedative and hailed because overdose simply caused prolonged sleep, not death. Thalidomide also was combined with other drugs to create medications for asthma, hypertension, and migraine, according to the Thalidomide Trust, which supports victims. Doctors and scientists began to notice gross limb malformations in infants starting in 1960, and scientists linked it to thalidomide the next year. By then, it had affected babies from Kenya to Peru to Japan, though most of the cases were in Germany, where the drug had been available over the counter. There are currently 466 people in the United Kingdom whose mothers took the drug when they were in the womb. Most of them have two or four limbs missing, and some also can't see or hear, according to the trust. One of them is Louise Medus-Mansell, who was born in 1962 with no arms or legs. ""It is a bonus, something that we didn't think would ever happen,"" she told CNN about the government's apology. ""There's a lot of people today that have been waiting for this apology from the government that have had partners die."" Medus-Mansell, who recently had a kidney transplant, published an autobiography this year titled ""No Hand to Hold and No Legs to Dance On."" Health Minister Mike O'Brien said the British government is creating a Â£20 million ($32.5 million) fund over three years to meet the health needs of Thalidomide victims, who are between 45 and 51 years old. The money will be distributed by the Thalidomide Trust, he said, and will help reduce further degeneration of their health as the victims grow older. ""The government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected when expectant mothers took the drug thalidomide between 1958 and 1961,"" O'Brien said in the House of Commons. ""We acknowledge both the physical hardship and the emotional difficulties that have faced both the children affected and their families as a result of this drug, and the challenges that many continue to endure, often on a daily basis."" The problems caused by the drug led the British government to review the marketing, testing, and regulation of drugs, O'Brien said. That included the enactment of the Medicines Act 1968, which introduced more testing for medicines prior to licensing to make sure they meet safety standards. The Thalidomide Society, which was created in 1962 by the parents of thalidomide victims, said it welcomed the government's apology. ""I think it obviously makes a great deal of difference (to the children), but I think also for the parents who had dreadful, dreadful trouble in the very early years to convince people that something had happened and it wasn't their fault,"" said society secretary Vivien Kerr. ""For them, I think, it's something to be very grateful for and it's welcome."" CNN's Phil Black and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","There are currently 466 people in the UK whose expectant mothers took the drug .

"(CNN) -- Interim Honduran President Roberto Micheletti installed himself as leader of a new unity government late Thursday, a move that drew condemnation from ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Making a late night public announcement, Micheletti said his entire cabinet had resigned to clear the way for a reconciliation cabinet to be named. ""This cabinet is a result of an ample participation of different sectors of civil society as well as the political parties,"" he said. ""Tonight with this new government, we're answering the call for the unity of all people of Honduras."" He did not identify any of the new cabinet members. Representatives for Micheletti and Zelaya signed an agreement October 30 to form a reconciliation government that would rule until a new president, to be chosen in a November 29 election, takes office in January. The deal included the possibility of Zelaya's reinstatement to the presidency, but contained no guarantee. The pact called for the unity government to be named by Thursday. The agreement also stipulated that the nation's congress, in consultation with the supreme court and other institutions, would vote on whether Zelaya would be returned to power. That vote did not occur Thursday. Zelaya told local media that Micheletti's actions violated the accord, which he called ""a dead letter."" The reconciliation government, he said, must be led by the democratically elected president of Honduras. ""How can a person who has not been elected by anyone lead a government?"" he said. Zelaya was flown out of the country by the country's military June 28 but secretly returned to Honduras on September 21, obtaining refuge in the Brazilian Embassy. Micheletti sent Zelaya a letter earlier this week asking him for the names of people the deposed president would like to have in the unity government. Zelaya did not answer the letter. Micheletti said Zelaya's refusal to answer gave the interim president the right to name all the members of a new government. ""With this agreement, we have made an important step to strengthen our democracy,"" Micheletti said. ""Despite the fact that Mister Zelaya did not send any of his representatives ... we're still looking for an opportunity for these citizens of Honduras to be integrated in the government of reconciliation."" The Organization of American States, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated. The United States and others imposed economic sanctions, which some analysts say have started to hurt Honduras. Many nations, including the United States, also said they would not recognize the winner of this month's presidential election if the vote is held under Micheletti's rule. The United States seemed to shift that position after last week's accord. Thomas Shannon, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol this week that the United States would recognize the winner of this month's presidential election even if Zelaya is not returned to power beforehand. Shannon played a key role in obtaining last week's agreement. The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya's desire to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president. The country's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal. Micheletti and his supporters say Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup.","Interim President Roberto Micheletti announces formation of new unity government .

"Killeen, Texas (CNN) -- The civilian police officer hailed as a heroine for ending the shooting rampage at Fort Hood Army Post said Wednesday she was washing her patrol car just before she headed to the bloody scene. Sgt. Kimberly Munley was cleaning the car and topping off the gas tank, routine duties at the end of her shift, when she heard the report last Thursday that shots had been fired at the Army post, she told Oprah Winfrey via teleconference. The brief interview was taped to air later in the day on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" Police Senior Sgt. Mark Todd also responded to the scene, where he said they were directed to the Soldier Readiness Processing Center, where soldiers were preparing to deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq. Both Munley and Todd didn't know what they were about to face. ""The entire incident was very confusing and chaotic,"" Munley said. ""There was many people outside pointing to the direction that this individual was apparently located, and as soon as I got out of my vehicle and ran up the hill was when things got pretty bad."" Once inside, Munley, who has been trained in active-response tactics, began exchanging fire with the alleged gunman, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a military psychiatrist, authorities said. They said her shots disabled Hasan and halted the attacks. Thirteen people -- 12 soldiers and one civilian -- were killed. Munley suffered three gunshot wounds, in both thighs and a knuckle, and remains at Metroplex Adventist Hospital in good condition, authorities said. ""The training does take over,"" she said when asked about her quick reactions. ""In that particular incident, we didn't have much time to think."" ""When I got shot, it felt like a muscle being torn out of my leg,"" she told Winfrey, and added, ""I'm doing well."" ""Every day is a progress for me, and things are getting better day by day. And emotionally, I'm just hoping that the rest of the officers and the injured and the families of the deceased are healing as well."" Winfrey showed a clip of Metroplex's Dr. Kelly Matlock saying that Munley's first words after the shooting were, ""Did anybody die?"" The 34-year-old mother of two said she recalled asking that, and she never lost consciousness after being shot. ""I was very concerned as to who else had been injured,"" Munley said. Todd was not injured in the rampage. He said he has been a police officer for 25 years and, before that, was in the Army. This was the first time he had been forced to fire his weapon on the job, he said. He also said last Thursday began as a ""typical day"" for him, with only minor incidents. At first, when he heard the shots from Fort Hood, he thought the soldiers were practicing the traditional rifle volleys they do at memorial services. During the incident, Todd said he fired his gun over and over as he'd been trained to do. Munley, whose husband is in the Army, is 5 feet, 2 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds. Winfrey asked her where she got her nickname, ""Mighty Mouse."" Munley said her partner at a police department in North Carolina called her that after she was able to help when he was being wrestled for his weapon. The nickname stuck. Todd said he was grateful that he was able to return safely home to his family at the end of that day. ""I just thank God he missed me,"" he said.","Pair who responded to gunfire at processing center say day of shooting started as a typical one .

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Dressed in fancy clothes, she applies eye liner, dabs her nose with a powder puff and the director shouts, ""Silence, rolling!"" Avika Gor, who plays child bride Anandi in the popular but controversial show. On cue, the star of the show delivers her lines. Meet Anandi, the main character of ""Balika Vadhu,"" an Indian television serial. Twelve-year-old Anandi is a child bride who was married off at the age of eight. She now lives with her husband and in-laws, bound by customs and traditions in their home. The daily soap is just over a year old and already one of India's most highly rated TV shows. An estimated 74 million people watched it in July. The CEO of Colors, the channel the show airs on, says viewers love it because it's based on reality. Rajesh Kamat said: ""There is enough research on child marriage, the evils of child marriage. We've based our storyline on that."" Kamat added the concept the show was based on is very much real and most of the incidents depicted in the program still happen in parts of India. Even though the Indian legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, the law is often ignored. Since it's an illegal act, it's very hard to find a record of how many child marriages take place -- but according to UNICEF, 40 percent of all child marriages in the world take place in India. Critics of ""Balika Vadhu"" say the premise -- that child marriage takes place in India -- is the only real aspect of the show. The driving force behind child marriage is poverty, says Puja Marwaha, of the children's charity Child Rights and You. She says child brides are often illiterate, malnourished, considered a burden on their parents -- and their lives bear no resemblance to the glossy images seen on TV. According to Marwaha, the serial glorifies child marriage. ""To show it as harmless, is a problem."" ""Poverty is not pretty so the child is not going to be wearing party frocks and looking pretty, contented and happy because that's not what really happens. What really happens is the child is forced into adult responsibilities too early. Whether it's the responsibility of motherhood or whether it's linked to abuse, as is the case many times."" That, according to Marwaha, is the reality of child marriage. The people behind the show say its goal is not to glamorize child marriage -- but to highlight its dark side. Kamat said: ""Have we depicted it in a way that is entertaining? Yes. Is the evil of child marriage highlighted? Yes. Are the evils associated with it highlighted? Absolutely."" In between takes on the set of the show just outside Mumbai, Avika Gor, who plays Anandi, does her part to educate the audience. ""I feel very bad about what's happening to Anandi. Child marriage is very, very, very, very, very, very, very bad."" Some Indian lawmakers argued the show violated the Indian Constitution and demanded the show be banned. The government looked into it and gave it a clean chit, so the cameras continue to roll on the sets, and the show goes on.","Soap with child bride as central character is one of India's most watched TV shows .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Washington-based imam told CNN on Monday that alleged Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan approached him for help finding a wife. Imam Yahya Hendi, the Muslim chaplain at Georgetown University, said Hasan came to him at least two years ago as the cleric conducted services at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. ""He said he wanted someone to help him serve, deploy and be understandable and understanding of his own military career,"" Hendi said. ""He saw himself as someone ... continuing his service with the U.S. military till the end of his career."" The imam said he spoke with Hasan on at least two occasions about his search for a spouse. ""It's not easy to find, in general, someone who will be willing to travel with you and deploy with you every two years,"" Hendi said. ""But he did want a wife who would stand by him, is [a] loyal American, who will help him do his work and his service for the U.S. military."" The imam's comments about Hasan's search for someone who would remain with him throughout his military career were at odds with some statements by Hasan's family. Relatives have said Hasan tried unsuccessfully to leave the military early -- requests that may have come after Hasan contacted Hendi. The cleric said he did try to help Hasan in his search, thinking of women he knew to whom he could introduce the Army psychiatrist, but he never heard from Hasan again. Authorities say Hasan opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood Army Post on November 5, killing 13 people. Hasan, who was seriously wounded in the incident, was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder -- charges that make him eligible for the death penalty. Two other imams have told CNN similar stories about Hasan's search for a wife, and about his conservatism and apparent devotion to Islam -- but those accounts seem to be inconsistent with behavior Hasan exhibited in the last few months. The manager of a strip club near Fort Hood has told reporters that Hasan visited the club a handful of times, staying for several hours each time. ""You know, for me, everything that he did is against the teachings of Islam. Killing fellow soldiers, fellow citizen men and women, the shooting, the bloodshed, speaks of someone who did not understand his faith very well. Islam is against going to strip clubs, but it's also against killing fellow citizens,"" Hendi told CNN. When taken as a whole, Hasan's actions in the weeks before the attack at Fort Hood -- the giving away of his possessions, his sometimes conservative dress in white Muslim clothing, and his previous defense of suicide bombings during presentations to classmates -- seem to be those of someone who was preparing for his own death, said CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen. ""I think what he was doing was sort of a jihadist 'death-by-cop,'"" said Bergen, who based his observations on news reports about Hasan. ""Here's a guy who obviously had personal problems. He's a loner, he avoids women basically, has few friends, and then grafted onto that, he finds sort of a jihadist ideology as a way of making sense of everything, and he decides to martyr himself."" Bergen and other experts say Hasan could be someone who engaged in what they call ""self-radicalization"": the idea that militant religion might provide an answer to psychological problems that someone already has. Hasan remained hospitalized in Texas, paralyzed from the waist down, his lawyer said. He was shot by a civilian police officer, who was also wounded in the attack.","Imam:  Nidal Malik Hasan wanted wife who could deal with his military career .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Five American security contractors were detained in connection with the killing of another American contractor last month inside Baghdad's Green Zone, sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Saturday. The body of James Kitterman was found in a car in Baghdad's heavily protected Green Zone. Iraqi and U.S. personnel took the five into custody in an operation inside the Green Zone before dawn on Friday, according to an Iraqi official involved in the investigation into the killing of James Kitterman. The five, who have not yet been charged, were being held by Iraqi security forces Saturday at a jail inside the heavily protected zone, he said. The troops also confiscated weapons during the raid on the suspects' firm at about 4 a.m. (11 a.m. ET), said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The names of the suspects and the company they work for were not released. The U.S. military declined comment and referred questions to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Embassy officials did not immediately respond to request for comments. Kitterman was found bound, blindfolded and fatally stabbed in a car in the district, formally known as the International Zone, on May 22. The 60-year-old Houston, Texas, resident owned a construction company that operated in Iraq. The five suspects knew the victim, a source inside the Green Zone familiar with the investigation said. Both the Iraqi and the Green Zone sources noted that the FBI has been involved in the investigation from the start. Once the suspects are charged and referred to trial, the case would be sent to Iraq's Central Criminal Court, the Iraqi official said. If that happens, it would be the first time U.S. citizens were tried in Iraq since the United States returned the country's government to the Iraqis. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Alan Duke contributed to this report.","NEW: Weapons confiscated in raid of suspects' firm, official says .

"(CNN) -- Already hamstrung by generations of poverty, environmental catastrophe and strongman rule, Haiti will need years to recover from the devastation inflicted by last week's earthquake, according to U.S. and Canadian analysts. Haiti's struggling democracy has survived on international aid and the muscle of a U.N. peacekeeping mission since a 2004 revolt that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The magnitude-7.0 earthquake that struck outside Port-au-Prince has set back efforts to get the country back on its feet ""by many, many years,"" said Stephen Randall, a senior fellow at the Canadian International Council, a Toronto-based think tank. ""I don't think all of it is lost, but it's a very serious setback,"" Randall told CNN. President Rene Preval's government regrouped at a police compound near the Port-au-Prince airport after nearly all of government ministries suffered heavy damage in the January 12 quake. Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive put the confirmed death toll at 72,000 on Tuesday, but estimates of the total number of fatalities run more than twice that high. Mark Schneider, who led the Caribbean division of the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Clinton administration, said much has been done to build a non-corrupt police force and judiciary over the past six years. ""Of the administration and sort of on the institutional side, I think a lot can be salvaged,"" said Schneider, now senior vice president at the International Crisis Group. But he said efforts to redevelop Haiti's long-ravaged economy may have been set back by ""decades."" iReport: Search list of the missing and the found . Haiti's public infrastructure -- roads, power and sanitation systems, hospitals and schools -- was already in poor condition before the earthquake. The flimsy homes built across Port-au-Prince collapsed wholesale during the quake, and hospitals quickly ran out of medicine. Clogged roads, damaged communications and airport congestion slowed the delivery of the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of international aid pledged in the week after the disaster, leading to widespread frustration and sporadic looting around the capital. Once the challenges of feeding, housing and treating hundreds of thousands of ill, homeless and hungry people are behind them, Schneider said, Haitians from all walks of society need to reach a new ""social compact"" aimed at ending its persistent problems. ""The mismanagement of the environment; the narrow, self-interested actions of the economic elite that deny taxes to the government so they can't provide education to the population; the failure to establish government agencies that can provide services -- all those things are not the consequences of natural disasters, but they make the country more vulnerable when disasters hit,"" he said. Though its economy has grown in recent years, Haiti is still the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with four-fifths of its 10 million people living in poverty. Its gross domestic product of $12 billion in 2008 is a tiny fraction compared to the $14 trillion generated by the United States, its largest trading partner. In addition, years of deforestation has left a mountainous country in the middle of the Caribbean's hurricane belt vulnerable to flooding and mudslides, like the ones that killed thousands in 2004. And poor construction left unknown thousands of people trapped in buildings that pancaked when the earth moved last week, said John Mutter, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at Columbia University in New York. Full coverage    l     Twitter updates . Stricter building codes and honest enforcement are necessary, but ""people will never be able to build strong, expensive structures if they don't have a strong economy,"" Mutter told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""The economy of Haiti cannot put Port-au-Prince back in place,"" he said. ""It's a perfect storm. It absolutely needs external intervention from the international community. We have to think of what we're doing."" Haiti's governmental budget of about $1 billion per year is derived largely from customs fees and is wholly inadequate for the physical improvements needed, Randall said. Emigres send back more money than that every year, but that money goes to individual families, not to public projects. ""The international community has been pressing the Haitian government to put more stock in taxation, but in fact, the real taxation that's taking place are the remittances,"" Randall said. ""It's a form of taxation, family to family, friend to friend."" But Schneider said the influx of reconstruction aid could be an opportunity for Haitians to rebuild its infrastructure with more concern for its environment -- and to create jobs for Haitians in its construction. ""That's the way you employ a lot of Haitians,"" he said. Reconstruction contracts should require ""both jobs and job training."" High-resolution images of damage . The United States has been heavily involved in Haiti commercially, politically and militarily for most of the last century, including occupying the country for nearly 20 years in the early 1900s. The Clinton administration restored Aristide to power in 1994 after a 1991 coup, and a U.S. jet hustled him out of the country again in 2004 following a rapidly spreading uprising against his government. Aristide has called his removal a U.S.-backed coup, an allegation Washington denied. Now the United States is the largest contributor to the Haitian government, while Canada -- which also has a police contingent in Haiti as part of the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSTAH -- is the second-largest.

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Virginia Pozo buys a first-class ticket to Peru on TACA. But it turns out the ticket is in economy class. When she tries to get a refund on the fare difference, her online agency offers her a $400 voucher. Is that enough? And is she entitled to more? A passenger bought first-class tickets to Peru, but learned they were economy-class seats. Q: We bought two first-class airline tickets to Peru on TACA through Cheaptickets.com. But we soon found out they were economy-class seats. We've asked the airline for a $1,100 refund -- the price difference between first-class and economy-class tickets -- but it won't budge. Cheaptickets.com sent a $400 voucher that we don't want. We've disputed the ticket charges with American Express, but it has denied our claim. It's obvious to us we didn't receive what we paid for. We've never sued anyone and I would rather not have to go there. Do you have any other suggestions? -- Virginia Pozo, San Francisco, California . A: If you didn't get a first-class seat, you shouldn't have to pay for one. TACA owes you a refund of the fare difference between the two classes. And your online travel agency, Cheaptickets.com, should help you. At the very least, you would expect American Express to take your side in a dispute. So what happened? From what I can tell, you booked what you thought was a first-class ticket through your online agent. But the airline only delivered a seat in economy class. In fact, it never treated this as a first-class reservation in the first place. Was there a miscommunication between the agent and the airline? Or between your agent and you? Maybe. As far as I can tell, Cheaptickets doesn't have a service guarantee comparable to the other big online travel agencies, which promises everything about your trip will be perfect. But it's reasonable to expect that the products it sells will be on the up-and-up, and that if there's something wrong, it will fix it. Cheaptickets' $400 voucher was a nice gesture, but not enough. Why? Two reasons: First, it requires you to buy another ticket or hotel room, and second, it doesn't come close to making up the price difference between the two tickets. As I read your letter, it seems as if you spent some time on the phone with Cheaptickets and TACA. Writing to the two companies might have yielded a more favorable result. This is one of the rare times when you should have considered sending either a paper letter that included your confirmation and your boarding pass, or, if you're good with a PC and a scanner, an email with documents attached. Receipts are important to resolving this dispute. You need to prove you didn't get what you paid for. Since you were doing business with an American company -- Cheaptickets -- American Express should have sided with you. Invoking the Fair Credit Billing Act, the federal law that protects you from charges for goods and services you didn't accept or weren't delivered as agreed, might have encouraged American Express to see things your way. I think TACA, Cheaptickets and American Express failed to meet their customer-service obligations. But who's responsible for your refund? The correct answer is: The online travel agent who took your money and acted as an intermediary for the transaction. I contacted Cheaptickets on your behalf. A representative contacted you and said the company reviewed its phone transcripts and determined that it was at fault. The online agency refunded you $1,100 and let you keep the $400 voucher for the trouble. Christopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine.

"Leogane, Haiti (CNN)  -- More than three weeks after Haiti's devastating earthquake, many of the makeshift camps housing thousands are starting to function as mini cities. Small markets have blossomed. Some camps have even designated mayors and security personnel. But in others, life still looks as it did days after the January 12 quake. People have only what they dug out of the rubble with their bare hands or acquired somehow else for survival.

"(CNN) -- At least 130 people have died and dozens are missing after heavy rains triggered flooding and mudslides that buried communities Sunday and left a swath of destruction in El Salvador, officials said Monday. The death toll was ""preliminary,"" said Raul Murillo, subdirector of the Department of Civil Protection in San Salvador. Another 13,680 people were staying in emergency shelters, he said. Laura Mata, communications manager for World Vision in El Salvador, said 40 percent of the dead were children. About 60 people were still missing Monday afternoon, said Carlos Alvarado, communications director for the government's rescue efforts. The most affected departments are San Salvador, La Paz, Cuscatlan, Usulatan and San Vicente. He described the latter as the most heavily affected. The government's Web site said there were 108 landslides, 209 destroyed buildings and another 1,835 damaged ones. In all, 18 bridges were affected, it said. Private, government and U.N. donations have all been promised, but the needs exceeded supplies, with high demand for food, construction materials, plastic sheeting, medications and -- with a cold front expected to sweep into the area Tuesday -- clothes, Alvarado said. Fumigation efforts were slated to begin Tuesday to reduce the chances of disease. ""There's a lot of work to do,"" he said. Guatemala, Spain and other countries were helping, Mata said. At the 139-bed Hospital Santa Gertrudis in San Vicente, 33 patients sought help overnight in the emergency room, mostly for trauma, broken bones and abrasions, said Dr. Ana Luisa Velazquez, the hospital director. Patients had to be removed from the pediatric unit and women's surgery unit, both of which were built on low-lying ground and were inundated, she said. Though the hospital had fresh water from its own well, fresh water was in scarce supply in San Vicente, she said. Mata visited the town Sunday. ""All three access roads were completely wiped off,"" she told CNN's Jonathan Mann. ""You could only get there by one lane. Everywhere -- mud, huge rocks."" Electricity was largely out, she said. In addition to losing their homes, many people have lost their crops, she said. President Mauricio Funes declared a national emergency and described the loss as incalculable. About 7,000 people lost homes in the disaster Sunday, officials said. Authorities said the death toll is expected to rise as rescuers scramble to reach regions where roads have been washed away. In some of the hardest-hit areas, such as the capital, San Salvador, roads are completely gone, Mata said. ""You would never imagine there were road systems there. ... Huge rocks, mud, water everywhere,"" she said. ""People have lost complete families."" Landslides on the side of a volcano swallowed up a village in Verapaz, Mata said. iReport: Neighborhood slammed with mud and debris . Residents in affected areas climbed over boulders as rescue crews waded through muddy water, some carrying young children. Homes, trees and electricity poles, and mountains of mud, covered streets. The heavy rains in the impoverished Central American nation were unrelated to Hurricane Ida, said Saul Ezgardo de la Reyes, a government meteorologist in the Center of Prognostics. ""The rains in Salvador are due to the low pressure system,"" he said, adding that it was dissipating Monday. ""We're waiting for the arrival of fresh air and higher pressure."" On Sunday, 355 millimeters (14 inches) of rain fell near the Saint Vincent Volcano, southeast of the capital, and 196 mm (7.7 inches) fell on the capital itself, he said. Sunday's inundations were unprecedented, he said. Hurricane Mitch dropped similar quantities in 1998, but those values were tallied in three or four days, he said. ""This was in practically four hours."" A low-pressure system out of the Pacific triggered the disaster, said Robbie Berg of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.","40 percent of dead are children, aid group spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- The relationship between China and the United States is ""the most important"" bilateral relationship in the world, a former Chinese foreign ministry official said Monday. Victor Zhikai Gao, now the director of the Beijing Private Equity Association, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the United States should deal with Beijing ""with respect"" and not be ""too abrasive."" ""That's the minimum thing we can ask for, I believe,"" he said on the eve of talks between President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao. Gao pointed out that China is now the United States' largest creditor nation, holding foreign reserves of more than $2 trillion, about two-thirds of which are assets that are denominated in U.S. dollars. ""China-U.S. relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world,"" Gao said. Obama appears keen to put past U.S.-Chinese disagreements behind him as he seeks Chinese cooperation on a host of issues from the global economy and climate change to nuclear proliferation. He's also looking to China for leadership on how to deal with repressive regimes such as Myanmar and Sudan, both of which are friends of Beijing and major energy suppliers to China. Critics of the U.S. president say he is downplaying what was once a central tenet of U.S. foreign policy, the promotion of human rights and democracy, in order to persuade China to help the United States achieve its foreign policy goals. But Obama insists America ""will never waver in speaking up for the fundamental values that we hold dear."" Gao acknowledged global concern about China's human rights record, admitting the situation is not perfect. ""But if you look at today's human rights issues, and comparing that with what we had 30 years ago, 20 years ago, or 10 years ago, then China has made great improvements,"" he said. Gao said China and the Chinese people are great admirers of America. But he said, ""China's foreign policy is underlined by the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs. If it is only up to the United States to discuss human rights issues in China, this is unbalanced."" He also tried to reassure critics in the United States, some of whom have accused China of manipulating its currency to keep the cost of Chinese goods artificially low, about the impact of China's rapidly expanding economic power. By some estimates, China's economy will be the same size as the U.S. economy by 2025, though there will still be a huge gap in economic output per person. ""Let me make the record straight. Over the past few months since the outbreak of the financial crisis, China has continued to purchase Treasury bonds issued by the U.S. government, rather than reducing them in any way,"" he said. ""So I think the American people need to realize that China has applied a very steady hand and very responsible hand in dealing with issues involving the dollar."" Gao said China has no desire to be an enemy of the United States. ""Both China and the United States need to give each other due respect and need to incentivize each other. And then we can work together towards a better peace and better world.""","Victor Zhikai Gao is now the director of the Beijing Private Equity Association .

"Vilseck, Germany (CNN) -- The military released 77,000 of about 87,000 detainees locked up during the Iraq war because there was not enough evidence to hold them, CNN has learned. ""In most cases, if we don't have anything, eventually they'll be released,"" said Brig. Gen. David Quantock, who oversees detainee operations in Iraq. Quantock said ""many cases are driven purely on intelligence."" ""Intelligence does not win a fight in a courtroom. It doesn't win the fight in a courtroom in the United States. It doesn't win in Iraq."" According to the U.S. military, 76,985 detainees have been released out of the 87,011 captured during the Iraq war. A CNN investigation found that frustration over the Army's policy on detainees may have led to the 2007 killings of four Iraqi men by three decorated Army sergeants at a Baghdad canal. Former 1st Sgt. John Hatley, who led the mission that day, told CNN in a letter that the detainee policy has ""extensive flaws"" that repeatedly frustrated soldiers. On Army interrogation tapes obtained by CNN, other soldiers complained about the Army rules for evidence gathering. Despite the high release rate, Quantock said he has confidence soldiers can take basic evidence from a crime scene in Iraq. ""We're asking them to take basic evidence, which they've been trained to do,"" said Quantock, who oversees detainee operations in Iraq. ""We've got the greatest soldiers in the world. And I don't accept that they can't take basic evidence off of a crime scene."" CNN asked Quantock to explain why, if it were so easy to collect evidence, so many detainees have been released. ""It took us a while to realize, it goes back to my point of we were trying to make the fight fit the Army as opposed to have the Army fit the fight,"" Quantock said. ""I think a lot of times we thought the insurgency would dissipate, we were working closely with the government of Iraq, we were trying to improve the Iraqi security forces, but at the end of the day, it didn't work out very well. We had to get better at taking evidence off the crime scene."" A January 9, 2005, memo imposed detailed standards of evidence soldiers needed before taking in suspected insurgents in Iraq. Quantock told CNN the rules detailed in the memo were in effect through the end of 2008. The memo spells out that evidence of criminal activity should include photos of ""physical evidence,"" ""the detainee at the crime scene or place of capture,"" as well as photos ""of the detainee next to the evidence."" Other evidence should include ""statements written by first-hand witnesses to the criminal activity,"" the memo states. At the start of this year, the rules got even stricter. A security agreement with the government of Iraq now requires an arrest warrant signed by an Iraqi judge to detain someone. Asked about the killings at the canal, Quantock told CNN: ""There's never an excuse to execute anyone. They become judge, jury and executioner.""","Four Iraqi detainees were killed by three decorated Army sergeants at a Baghdad canal .

"Washington (CNN) -- Most of the world's 1.57 billion Muslims know that the Holy Quran states quite clearly that, ""Anyone who kills a human being ... it shall be as though he has killed all of mankind. ... If anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he has saved the lives of all of mankind."" Accordingly, it should come as little surprise to any reasonable observer that when Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan recently committed his shocking acts of mass murder at Fort Hood, Texas, America's Muslim community of over 7 million felt an added sense of horror and sadness at this senseless attack against the brave men and women of the U.S. armed forces. True to form, many conservative media pundits wasted little time in pointing to reports that Hasan had said ""Allahu Akbar"" (Arabic for ""God is great"") at the start of his murderous rampage. News coverage continuously showed the looping convenience store black-and-white videotape footage of Hasan wearing traditional white Islamic garb. First of all, someone simply saying ""Allahu Akbar"" while committing an act of mass murder no more makes their criminal act ""Islamic"" than a Christian uttering the ""Hail Mary"" while murdering an abortion medical provider, or someone chanting ""Onward, Christian Soldiers"" while bombing a gay nightclub, would make their act ""Christian"" in nature. Simply put; murder is murder and has no religion whatsoever. Professor Juan Cole of the University of Michigan once wrote that, ""One most certainly does insult Muslims by tying their religion to movements such as terrorism or fascism. Muslims perceive a double standard in this regard: Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols would never be called 'Christian terrorists' even though they were in close contact with the Christian Identity Movement. No one would speak of Christo-fascism or Judeo-fascism as the Republican[s] ... speak of Islam-o-fascism. ... [Many people also] point out that [it was] persons of Christian heritage [who] invented fascism, not Muslims."" According to Pentagon statistics, there were over 3,400 American Muslims serving in the active-duty military as of April 2008. The Wall Street Journal reported that many officials believe ""the actual number of [American] Muslim soldiers may be at least 10,000 higher than the Pentagon statistics."" Thus, with thousands of patriotic American Muslim women and men proudly serving in our United States Army in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, perhaps it would behoove our army leaders to consider sending a strong message of American unity by appointing an American Muslim to be a part of the prosecution team against Hasan. This would help show that the mass murders allegedly committed by Hasan have nothing to do with the teachings of our religion. The United States Army can send a resounding message to all Americans and the rest of the world that the social fabric of our country will never become unraveled by murderous (and irreligious) gun-wielding felons -- whether it is a Muslim in Fort Hood, Texas, or a non-Muslim on a shooting rampage in an Orlando, Florida, high-rise less than a day later. By appointing a multicultural (and multireligious) legal prosecution team made up of military lawyers of all races and religions, we can set a good example to show the rest of the world that our American legal justice system is truly equal for all people, regardless of their race, religion or socioeconomic status. The larger point is that Muslims in America completely disavow and wash our hands of any acts of murder (or terrorism) claimed to be performed in the name of our religion. Acts of mass murder, regardless of their time or place, are simply ungodly criminal acts that have no religion whatsoever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arsalan Iftikhar.","The Fort Hood killings were not a religious act, says Arsalan Iftikhar .
He says reports shooter said ""Allahu Akbar"" don't make slayings an ""Islamic"" crime .
Iftikhar says Islam forbids the taking of human life .

"(CNN) --   The death of boxing champion Mike Tyson's 4-year-old daughter after a treadmill accident highlights the issue of hidden dangers in the home. Exercise equipment injures more than 25,000 children each year according to one safety organization. While most parents know enough about covering outlets and keeping poisonous household cleaning products locked away from the reach of their small children, most homes still have less obvious safety hazards that can have disastrous results for curious tots. ""Parents often overestimate their child's intelligence, and underestimate their abilities,"" explains Chrissy Cianflone, Director of Program Operations at Safe Kids USA, a nonprofit organization focused on preventing accidental childhood injury. Case in point: falls from windows. Though a parent might not regularly open windows in the house, it does not mean a child can't or won't. Placing furniture close to windows is a commonly overlooked safety hazard; it allows children to easily climb up and out of the opening. Relying on screens to protect against falls is an inadequate solution, since most screens can't hold the weight of a child. Window guards are a safe choice: they offer protection and cost less than $30 each on average. Window treatment cords are another common, hidden pitfall. To prevent accidents, parents should tie up any cords from blinds or curtains, high enough out of a child's reach, and make sure there is no furniture placed close by that would invite little ones to climb. Cianflone warns against unwittingly placing changing tables and cribs within reach of the window coverings.  Dr. Gupta: Watch more on hidden dangers in the home Â» . Power cords are a source of manifold dangers. They can cause electrical burns, strangulation, tripping, and serious head trauma from appliances being pulled down by little hands or feet. Parents should unplug and secure power cords whenever possible, and move appliances out of the way. With respect to home gyms, more than 25,000 children each year are injured from exercise equipment, including stationary bicycles, treadmills and stair climbers, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Many of those injuries are related to power cords. Police in Phoenix, Arizona, say that Exodus Tyson was injured and later died after being strangled by a cord connected to the treadmill, possibly while playing with the machine. Her mother performed CPR after the accident but Exodus was in need of life support by the time authorities arrived. Since it's usually impractical to unplug a piece of exercise equipment after every use, parental supervision is the primary means of avoiding accidents. Cianflone warns that if you have a home gym, ""make sure to limit your child's access to that room. Keep the door shut and locked if you can, and if you have to leave the room, take the child with you."" Furniture tip-overs are another major unsuspected hazard. A 17-year study published in May 2009 by the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital found that capsized furniture sent an average of 15,000 children a year to the emergency room. The most commonly toppled furniture pieces are dressers and flat-screen television sets. Pulling out one or more dresser drawers decreases the stability of the piece if it isn't attached to the wall. Inexpensive wall mounting kits, available at hardware and baby stores, can secure up to 400 pounds of weight. Similarly, flat-screen TVs -- lighter and less stable than their predecessors --  should be mounted to a wall when possible. If that's not an option, Cianflone recommends positioning the set far back on a stand, enough so that a child climbing the stand would still be unable to reach it. Parents should also keep tabs on toy and product recalls, in case any purchases are found to be potential hazards. A simple method to stay aware is to sign up for recall alerts via email from the Consumer Product Safety Commission. A child's ability to get into certain types of trouble varies with the age and developmental stage of each individual child. For general guidelines, parents can go to Safe Kids for an age-based breakdown of hazards. Most critical is for parents to be aware of their particular child's abilities and level of curiosity. ""Nobody knows a child better than the parent, so it's important to be well-educated so a parent can take the steps necessary to mitigate hazards for their own child,"" says Cianflone.","Death of Exodus Tyson puts spotlight on hidden household hazards .

"(CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry apologized through a spokesman Saturday after videos surfaced showing him using offensive language to describe people in his military unit. Prince Harry apologized for videos of him making offensive comments while on military duty in 2006. In one clip, a voice said to be Harry's calls a soldier a ""Paki."" In another clip, the voice tells a soldier wearing a cloth on his head that he looks ""like a raghead."" The British newspaper News of the World posted the videos on its Web site Saturday. It did not say how it obtained them. A spokesman for Prince Harry apologized in a statement released by St. James's Palace Saturday. The spokesman said the prince -- who is third in line to the British throne -- ""understands how offensive this term can be, and is extremely sorry for any offense his words might cause."" It is not the first apology for offensive behavior by Prince Harry. In 2005, he was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform to a party. He said he was sorry for that incident. ""It was a very stupid thing to do and I've learned my lesson, simple as that really,"" he said in a September 2005 interview with Britain's Press Association, marking his 21st birthday. ""I'd like to put it in the past now. What's done is done. I regret it."" The videos that surfaced Saturday were filmed by the prince himself during his military service in 2006, according to the News of the World Web site. ""Ahh, our little Paki friend... Ahmed,"" a voice says as the camera zooms in on a soldier from across the room. The video does not show Prince Harry's face. The soldiers were waiting for their flight to Cyprus for a mission, according to the Web site. The Royal family said the 'Paki' term was a nickname for a friend in his platoon. ""There is no question that Prince Harry was in any way seeking to insult his friend,"" the St. James's Palace statement said. The second video was filmed after arriving in Cyprus, according to News of the World, and shows a British soldier with a cloth over his head. A voice, which the News of the World claims to be Harry's, is heard saying, ""(expletive) me, you look like a raghead."" St. James's Palace said, ""Prince Harry used the term 'raghead' to mean Taliban or Iraqi insurgent."" Dickie Arbiter, a former press secretary to Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry's grandmother, urged people to take the prince's words in context. ""Harry is not the same man as he was three years ago,"" Arbiter told Britain's ITN network. ""You don't think when you are shooting a video."" And he pointed out that Harry was serving in the army, where language is not always delicate. ""It is quite common for names to be used in the military.... He's a serviceman first and foremost, but people see him as a prince first and he has to be careful of what he says."" The British Ministry of Defense said it was not aware of any complaints against Prince Harry and would investigate the allegations of inappropriate behavior, according to a written statement released Saturday. ""Bullying and racism are not endemic in the Armed Forces,"" it said. David Cameron, the leader of Britain's opposition Conservative Party, said Prince Harry's remark was ""obviously a completely unacceptable thing to say."" But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr program that he saw no need for the prince to be disciplined. ""No, he has made an apology... and I think that's enough."" --CNN's Katy Byron and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Prince Harry apologizes for offensive language used while on duty three years ago .

"Macon, Georgia (CNN) -- Bettye Webb-Hayes won't ever forget the day her son posed a question that stopped her in her tracks. ""Mom,"" the fourth-grader asked, ""am I white?"" It was a question she had never asked her own parents. It was something you didn't talk about in the days of the segregated South -- especially when your mom was white and your father was a mix of African-American and Native American. She went to the black schools of Macon, Georgia. Now, her son was asking probing questions. ""Why would you ask me that?"" she said. ""Because everybody at school calls me a honky,"" said the young Cordell, a light-skinned African-American. Twenty-seven years have passed since that conversation. Bettye and her son recently traveled back to Macon to face something that's been omnipresent their whole lives: the coming together of white and black. They returned for a one-of-a-kind 50th high school gathering. The classes of 1959, once segregated by race as well as gender, sat down together for the first time in history. Ruby Dean Dupree Mayes arrived two hours early for the festivities. She didn't sleep the night before. ""It's like waiting for Santa Claus to arrive. I'm so excited,"" said Mayes, who drove more than 330 miles from Tennessee to attend. Mayes went to Ballard-Hudson High, the city's black high school, whose most famous students include singers Otis Redding and Little Richard. She came this day ""to celebrate and commemorate."" ""I could not pass this event up,"" she said. ""I never dreamed of this moment -- just the realization of knowing that we had come together, at last."" As the 1959 graduates arrived, they welcomed one another. Many first greeted people of their own race. Some hadn't seen particular classmates in the 50 years since they earned their diplomas. Gradually, they began mixing and mingling. There was a commonality -- a need to come together for their children, their grandchildren and the generations to follow. Discuss the past, while moving forward in the present. Separated now by 'personal choice' It sometimes takes a son to see things in a new light. The idea for the meeting began four years ago, when a son told his father: ""Dad, think about how many friends you missed getting to know."" Those were the words of Wyatt Johnson, a public school teacher in Santa Cruz, California. He and his father, Tom Johnson, were enjoying a father-son trip to Macon in 2005 to rediscover their roots. Tom Johnson is the former head of CNN and was once the publisher of the Los Angeles Times. He's traveled the world and left his own mark along the way. Yet despite all his accomplishments, there was something he'd never done: reach out to the African-Americans of Macon from 1959, the ones he never knew because of segregation. An idea was born. He wrote to graduates of the black school, Ballard-Hudson; the white girls' school, Miller; and the white boys' school, Lanier. ""We all have deep personal memories of our high school experiences that will remain with us forever,"" he wrote. ""We had lived in a separate black and white world in Macon. ... It is a different world today. We no longer are separated, except by personal choice."" One white graduate responded with hate mail, a reminder that racism still exists. But on a day in early October, more than 200 people gathered at a Goodwill banquet hall. There was no shouting, none of the in-your-face name-calling seen in recent health care town hall meetings across the country. Here, there were tears, hugs and handshakes. Often, talk of grandkids took center stage at the 16 roundtables. They talked about race and the segregated past that prevented such closeness a half-century ago. ""You'd think we'd have grown up together,"" said Alice Bailey, a Ballard-Hudson grad. ""We still have a gift, and that's a gift of time,"" Johnson said. ""Blacks and whites together, we can do something to make the world better."" They took out notepads. They scribbled ways to take action. They began making a to-do list of 59 things for the Classes of 1959. Their goals range from building a home for Habitat to Humanity to writing letters to service men and women from Macon serving in war. They'd love to persuade the one who sent the hate mail to attend the next gathering. They also want to set an example for the elders of other Southern cities. ""I'm glad we've left the past behind,"" said Michael Cass, the 1959 class president of Lanier. The daughter of one those in attendance stood and took the microphone. ""Today, you have inspired me so much,"" she said. Many in the crowd reached for tissues. Linda Carstarphen Gugin said her whole life had been leading to this moment. ""It was the most amazing thing,"" she said. ""It was just like almost immediate bonding between people."" As the class president of Miller, she'd carried guilt for the last 50 years for not speaking out against segregation. ""I have tears about this,"" she said, crying. For Bettye Webb-Hayes and her son, the gathering underscored why the question ""Mom, am I white"" could be asked in one era and not another. Listening to his mother and her childhood friends, Cordell said, he was struck by how segregation was ""was so transparent to them at the time they were living through it. It was a way of life, so they didn't acknowledge its existence."" ""I find it interesting how human nature teaches you to accept things that are -- and some people question the reality, and other people don't."" His mother did test the reality of segregation on one occasion. Bettye and her sister went into a Woolworth's department store in Macon. They sat at a counter for food. The white waitress looked at them skeptically. She couldn't tell whether they were white or black. She grabbed a black cook for his input. ""Those are the Webb girls,"" he said. The two were kicked out. Webb-Hayes giggles about the story. She's proud she tried to break the rules. ""I think she really would've served us if she thought she could have gotten away with it."" Watch Bettye tell story of her dad and 'stupid' Elvis . It was in 1963 when Webb-Hayes realized just how wrong the segregated South was. She marched in Washington, D.C., with Martin Luther King Jr. that year. ""It was almost like you were listening to God speak in person."" Years later, Bettye -- the girl who was sent away from the Woolworth's counter -- would eat Thanksgiving dinner with President Jimmy Carter. Webb-Hayes was the music teacher for Amy Carter, the president's daughter. Her motto throughout life: ""Just do the very best you can."" She calls the gathering of the segregated schools ""unbelievable."" If it's the last trip of her life, Webb-Hayes, 68, feels her life's journey is now complete. ""I was glad to meet new friends today."" A special thanks to Bright Blue Sky Productions for its help on this report.","Students from former segregated schools of 1959 unite in Macon, Georgia .

"(CNN) -- With Wi-Fi access at airports, hotels, and aboard airplanes, business travelers don't have to look very hard for a wireless Internet connection. Wi-Fi hotspots at airports may put users' computers at risk, but no more so than at coffee shops, experts say. But with these public wireless hotspots becoming more prevalent, in addition to more travelers using smart phones for Web access, are business travelers putting themselves at a security risk? The short answer, some technology security experts say, is yes. But they add that the use of Wi-Fi at these spots is no riskier than at a coffee shop. ""It's a shared medium, and if you can connect to it, someone else can connect to it and monitor your traffic,"" said Marty Linder, a senior member of the technical staff at the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute CERT/Coordination Center. ""That has nothing to do with the security of the network. It's just the nature of the beast."" For Fran Hanna, the convenience isn't worth the risk. The sales representative from Chapin, South Carolina, would frequently bring her computer on business trips and access Wi-Fi through her hotels. Hackers tapped into her computer, resulting in inappropriate material being sent through her account. She had to get her computer restored twice, which cost her $900. And while she still isn't sure where she was when she picked up the malware, she said the only wireless device she will bring with her as she travels is a cell phone for voice calls. On the other hand, picking up public wireless isn't a major concern to Brian Fitzpatrick, the CTO of a technology firm in Alpharetta, Georgia, and a frequent business traveler. He generally avoids transmitting sensitive personal or company data using these hotspots. But as he sees it, having his information stolen ""is more likely to happen in some face-to-face transaction than it is even online."" In addition to open networks, experts say the physical loss of devices poses a threat for business travelers. The combination of replacement cost, detection, forensics, data breach, lost intellectual property costs, lost productivity, and legal, consulting and regulatory expenses sets a company back an average of $49,246 per lost laptop, according to a study released in April by the Ponemon Institute and sponsored by the Intel Corporation. However, lost laptops with encryption saved companies nearly $20,000, compared with those that did not have encryption, according to the Ponemon study. Encrypted disks safeguard data by scrambling information on them. They unlock that information only when the user enters the proper passcode. ""I don't know how many times we've heard about laptops being stolen and they have no encryption on them. And it pretty much means that the bad guys can get to your data. Immediately. They don't have to know your password or anything, they can just get to it,"" said Patrik Runald, chief security adviser for F-Secure, an Internet security company. And many businesses do not yet require their employees to use passwords on their smart phones, leaving lost devices ""woefully unprotected,"" said Pat Clawson, CEO and chairman of Lumension Security. Tips for staying secure . Despite the potential for security breaches, there are simple steps you can take to keep yourself armed as you connect wirelessly on your travels: . â¢ Use an encrypted disk to safeguard the information on your laptop or smart phone, Linder said, and make sure you log off of your computer when you're not using it. In most cases, when you hibernate your computer, its memory is recorded unencrypted. ""You cannot for convenience close your lid, let your computer go to sleep and believe that if someone steals your computer, your data is protected, because it's not,"" Linder said. Runald recommended free software called TrueCrypt (truecrypt.org) that you can use to encrypt the content on your local drive and on USB flash drives. â¢ Turn off your wireless and Bluetooth connections if you're not using them, said Clawson. ""Those are electronic doorways into your devices. On my BlackBerry, I can sit there and scan for open Wi-Fi peer-to-peer connections. I [can] then gain access to what's in your files you may have stored in there, your contacts."" â¢ Use an anti-glare shield on your computer to prevent others from spying, Linder suggested. With such shields, you must be face-to-face with the screen to be able to read it. â¢ Regularly back up the data on your laptop or smart phone, Runald said. Several companies offer backup services, but you can also save information on other computers and disks. Even if your data is encrypted -- eliminating your fear of sensitive information getting stolen -- backing up the data will make it easy to transfer to a new phone or laptop, Runald said. â¢ If you lose your smart phone and don't want others to access your information, call your provider and request that the device be wiped of information, Runald said. He also suggested considering software that allows you to send a text message to your phone that will remotely wipe it and block others from accessing its content. â¢ To ensure that you're visiting an authentic Web site and not getting duped by a phishing scheme, some experts suggest logging onto those sites through your company's VPN connection.

"(CNN) -- Governors in three Eastern Seaboard states Friday called on National Guard troops to help evacuate people from flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida. Strong winds and rain from the powerful storm have left thousands without power. Ida lost momentum but not the ability to generate winds and rain as it made landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast earlier this week, forecasters said. The National Weather Service had flood advisories in effect Friday for areas of coastal Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey. At least 160 National Guard troops were deployed in sections of Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey to evacuate residents in high-water areas as well as provide cots, sandbags and potable water, according to the Pentagon's National Guard Bureau. ""About 40 members of the Delaware National Guard have provided support to civilian emergency relief agencies in Kent and Sussex counties,"" the bureau said. The New Jersey National Guard sent 18 guardsmen with trucks to help with evacuations in the Cape May and Atlantic counties, where the governor Thursday declared a state of emergency due to flooding, Guard officials reported . Almost 100 guardsmen with high-water vehicles were helping firefighters in Portsmouth, Virginia. Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine declared a state of emergency, saying the remnants of Ida had combined with another storm to cause dangerous conditions in some areas. By early afternoon, at least 155,000 customers were without power in the state -- mostly in and around Norfolk, according to the Dominion Power Web site. ""With the National Weather Service indicating that eastern Virginia could experience flooding and storm surge comparable to the effects of a Category 1 hurricane, it's critical that Virginians make the necessary preparations,"" Kaine said. ""While we will continue to monitor conditions, the commonwealth is preparing for a period of coastal flooding through at least Friday evening.""","Strong winds and rain from the powerful storm have left thousands without power.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday -- the eve of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's inauguration for a second term -- that now is a ""critical moment"" for Afghanistan, because Karzai has a ""clear window"" to demonstrate what kind of government he will lead. Speaking to staff members at the U.S. Embassy, Clinton said there is a careful and thoughtful review of U.S. policy going on ""because we know this is a turning point."" ""We want to be a strong partner to people of Afghanistan,"" she said, ""and to the government."" Clinton met with embassy staff before meeting with U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Afterward, she had dinner with Karzai. The two, flanked by their senior aides, met at a second-floor reception room at Karzai's palace. They spoke about Clinton's travel schedule and about the planning for Karzai's Thursday inauguration. They also spoke about the difficulty in accommodating all the Afghans who want to attend the ceremony. The government expects about 800 people to attend in all; some will have to stand. Clinton's attendance at the inauguration will show U.S. support for Karzai's government after an election that was tainted by fraudulent balloting. Karzai is under intense international pressure to clean up corruption within his government, and Clinton was to deliver a tough message on the need to show results, a senior U.S. official tells CNN. The senior U.S. official, who is not authorized to speak publicly about details of Clinton's meeting with Karzai, said the Obama administration already is discussing with the Karzai government specific ""benchmarks"" that will require Afghan ministries to be certified as ""open and transparent"" if they are to receive direct payments from the U.S. government. If ministries are not certified as open and transparent, they can continue to receive technical assistance, but not direct U.S. funding, the official says. If the assessments determine that the ministry needs additional specific technical assistance to be certified, the U.S. will provide it. Clinton's first visit to Afghanistan as secretary of state comes as President Obama is deciding whether to send up to 40,000 more troops to Afghanistan, as requested by McChrystal. A major factor in Obama's decision on how many troops to send to Afghanistan centers on the Afghan government's ability to partner with the United States to fight the Taliban. In the past several weeks, Eikenberry has sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid lingering concerns about Karzai and the uncertainty about the government he will put in place. On Sunday, Clinton said she had ""made it clear"" that the United States won't provide civilian aid to Afghanistan's government agencies without an effective certification process that shows the money will be spent on its intended purposes. ""We believe that President Karzai and his government can do better,"" Clinton said on the ABC broadcast ""This Week,"" adding that Obama's administration was ""looking for tangible evidence"" that the Karzai administration would be more responsive to the needs of the Afghan people. She cited the need for the Karzai government to crack down on fraud and ""demonstrate there's not impunity for those who are corrupt."" The senior U.S. official says the United States has certified departments in the Ministries of Public Health, Communications and Finance to receive direct U.S. government assistance. During the next three months, he says, it will assess the Ministries of Education; Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock; and Rural Rehabilitation and Development. Two assessments will be carried out -- financial and procurement -- at each ministry. If those assessments determine that the procurement, financial, and expenditure systems are adequate, the U.S. will certify them as having the capacity to accept direct assistance. The Afghan government already has announced it is creating a commission that will investigate allegations of corruption. It also says it will create a tribunal in the Justice Ministry that will prosecute corruption cases that the commission has investigated. This U.S. official says the United States is not trying to ""hector, lecture or look over the shoulder"" of the Afghan government, but it does want to make sure U.S. tax dollars are spent wisely. The U.S., he says, ""wants an Afghan-led process to fight corruption."" Clinton told the NBC program ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that the primary U.S. mission in Afghanistan is defeating al Qaeda, rather than making a long-term commitment to rebuild the country. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","U.S. policy under review because ""this is a turning point,"" she tells U.S. Embassy staff .

"(CNN) -- Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd formally apologized on Monday to thousands of adults who, as impoverished British children, were brought to Australia with the promise of a better life but found abuse and forced labor. ""My hope today is to reach out to you all on behalf of this nation -- Australia -- and to speak what so often has been unspoken, and to offer this profound apology,"" Rudd told an audience of former child migrants gathered in the national capital of Canberra and scattered throughout the country. ""To apologize for the pain that has been caused. To apologize for the failure to offer proper care. To apologize for those who have gone before us and ignored your cries for help."" The so-called Forgotten Australians -- children who came from British families struggling with severe poverty or from institutions in the UK -- were brought to Australia in a program that ended 40 years ago. The program scarred generations of children who were placed in state institutions and orphanages. They later told of being kept in brutal conditions, being physically abused and being forced to work on farms. ""There are tens of thousands -- perhaps hundreds of thousands -- of these stories,"" Rudd said, ""each with its own hurts, its own humiliations, its own trauma -- and each united by the experience of a childhood without love, of childhood alone."" ""Whatever I might say today, the truth is I cannot give you back your childhood. I cannot rewind the clock on your suffering, nor can I erase the past,"" Rudd added. ""But what I can do with you is celebrate the spirit that has lived within you over the decades -- a spirit that has stubbornly refused to be beaten, a spirit that has turned you into the survivors that you are.""","""Forgotten Australians"" were brought from Britain in program that ended 40 years ago .

"Adults who were exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke during childhood have lungs that look different on CT scans from those of people who grew up in a smoke-free environment, a new study suggests. The harmful short-term effects of secondhand smoke are well known; the long-term consequences aren't as clear. Specifically, their lungs have slightly more, and larger, emphysema-like ""holes"" than those with less smoke exposure, says Gina Lovasi, M.P.H., Ph.D., of Columbia University, and her colleagues. Although breathing tests showed that the smoke-exposed lungs were functioning just fine, Lovasi said the changes could signal an increased vulnerability to developing emphysema and other lung problems down the road. Health.com: Should smoking around kids be illegal? Emphysema is a progressive lung disease characterized by shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and weight loss. About 24 million people in the United States have emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis, which together are known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however about half of those people don't realize they have COPD. The lung condition is the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States, and smoking is a major cause of COPD. Health.com: I'm a nonsmoker, but I have emphysema due to a rare genetic condition . ""The interesting part about this is that we don't know a lot about how the lungs change over time and whether they heal completely after being exposed to tobacco,"" says Lovasi, who is scheduled to present her findings on Tuesday at the American Thoracic Society's 105th International Conference in San Diego. ""We can still see a difference even decades later."" The harmful short-term effects of breathing other people's cigarette smoke are well known, but the long-term consequences aren't as clear. To investigate, Lovasi and her team looked at CT scans of the lungs of 1,781 nonsmoking 45- to 84-year-olds taking part in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) trial. Health.com: 5 celebrities who had -- or are at risk of -- the lung disease COPD . About half of the study participants said that no one with whom they lived  during childhood smoked cigarettes at home, 31 percent lived with one person who smoked at home, and 17 percent lived with two or more smokers. Lovasi and her team checked the lung CT scans for large areas where the density was similar to air (lung tissue is naturally denser than air), and also calculated what percentage of their lungs was made up of these ""holes."" Health.com: My smoker's cough turned out to be emphysema . ""The lungs are supposed to have air in them, but it's important that the air is interspersed with blood vessels so that we can get the oxygen out of the air,"" she says. ""Small holes can expand over time and merge to form larger holes."" For people who hadn't grown up with smokers, 17 percent of their lung tissue had this air-like density, while ""holes"" made up 20 percent of the lung area of people who had lived with at least two smokers during childhood. The more heavily smoke-exposed study participants also had more relatively large holes in their lungs. In comparison, ""someone with emphysema would typically have between 30 percent and 60 percent of the lungs classified as air-like (or emphysema-like) using the threshold we used for our study,"" says Lovasi. Health.com: 1 in 3 smokers would kick habit to protect pet . Lovasi says she and her colleagues will be following the MESA participants over time to see how their lungs change, and whether people with more early smoke exposure are indeed more vulnerable to lung problems later on.

"Grand Rapids, Michigan (CNN) -- I'm a single father of a 12-year-old boy who every five minutes seem to switch personalities on me. One moment he's a starving student athlete hungry enough to eat a cow, the next he's a picky vegan. I'm told by people much smarter than me that this is normal for a child going through puberty. And so, while I am not an overly religious man, I have found myself meditating on I Corinthians 13:4 to help me get through. Love is patient, love is kind. I believe there is something each of us can pull from that Bible verse. We may not agree on spirituality or the existence of God, but we can agree that love is one of the most beautiful and mysterious forces. When I'm frustrated with my son, or a friend or even myself, I try to think about the characteristics of love described in I Corinthians before reacting. Be patient. Be kind. I felt the need to lean on that verse last week after yet another ballot defeat for marriage equality -- when voters in Maine repealed a state law allowing same-sex couples to marry. A visceral wave of anger swept over me as once again I was reminded of my second-class citizenship. I wanted to smash something. I wanted to punch somebody out. I wanted revenge. The last thing on my mind was I Corinthians. But at the very core of the debate over marriage equality is that scripture's concept of love. It's easy to love someone when there is no turmoil, no conflict. And it's no accident that ""patient"" is the first word Corinthians uses to describe love -- it's first because it is most important. No matter how strongly we may feel about each other, we will not always agree, and it is in those moments that we must tap into the mystery of love even more to find a way to first be patient, and then be kind. That is true in marriage and in parenting. And it's true in this much-accepted notion that we should love our fellow man. I'm not suggesting the gay community should not be upset -- patient and kind does not mean complacent and apathetic. We must continue pressuring politicians to end civil injustice, but we're not served if we allow hate and fear to dictate our words. We cannot begin to change the nation's mind if we cannot first speak to the nation's heart. With the economy and the swine flu and the recent tragedy at Fort Hood, it seems that everywhere there is a reason to hate and to fear. But I agree with my buddy Dierks Bentley, who sings in his song ""Beautiful World"": . ""There's tears and there's fears and there's losses and crosses to bear; . And sometimes the best we can do is just to whisper a prayer; . Then press on because; . There's so much to live for and so much to love."" That might seem Pollyanna-ish, but the truth is that even if President Obama signed a law today to make all forms of discrimination based upon sexual orientation illegal, it would hardly mark the end of the gay rights movement. After all, true social change isn't revolutionary -- it's evolutionary. That means we will have to continue our forbearance with those who oppose us -- from the black pastor who preaches that gay people should not be allowed to marry, to the white, closeted politician so afraid of losing his position that he would vote to oppress his own community. Through all of that, we will still have to find a way to love. Many gay rights activists like to draw parallels between the gay community's struggles and those of blacks during the civil rights movement. It's not uncommon to hear them echo the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: . ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" ""In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."" ""I have a dream..."" But as the frustration of the gay community grows, it is important that we -- and our allies -- do not forget another of Dr. King's powerful quotes: . ""Let no man pull you low enough to hate him."" In other words, hate the sin but love the sinner. It may seem weird to think in those terms because many well-meaning Christians also like to use that last phrase to justify oppressing gay people at the polls. But here's what's curious: The quote is from Mahatma Gandhi, a Hindu who said it in reference to his own people's oppressors, who happened to be Christians. This undoubtedly inspired another one of Gandhi's famous quotes: ""I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians."" You don't have to like either in order to have love in your heart. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson says gays should show patience after same-sex law defeated in Maine .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The world economy is placing a bet on its future with China, but some Chinese are placing bets on their future with plastic. In rebalancing the world economy, analysts have said U.S. citizens should take cues from the Chinese, where 40 cents of every dollar of disposable income is saved, compared to 3 cents of every dollar in the U.S. But there are worrying signs in China that some young consumers are starting to emulate the worst habits of U.S. consumers -- like 27-year-old Yuan Shuai in Beijing, whose credit card bets on his future have turned into overwhelming debts. In the last two years, he got seven cards from seven banks and wracked up $29,000 in debts. ""I spent money on eating and having fun,"" he said. ""That's all."" Unemployed and studying to be a taxi driver, Yuan now has debt collectors from banks turning to his father, Yuan Yizhong, for bill payment. ""The banks told me they could lend to him because he's an adult,"" his father says. ""Now they hold me responsible and threatened me."" With no laws for bankruptcy protection in China, those threats can be real. ""If you cannot pay it back you either have to go to parents or friends to pay back for you, or you got to jail,"" said Yeongwen Chiang, a consumer expert. Credit card issuance is up 32 percent in China in the past year, according to China Market Research and the National Bureau of Statistics. Credit card debt is up more than 130 percent to $838 million. That still pales compared to U.S. credit card debt, but the quick rise have some observers alarmed. With the decrease in exports during financial crisis, China has been working to build domestic consumption, offering subsidies on cars, home appliances and other big ticket items. That has helped China to continue to grow through the recession. During the October holiday week celebrating the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, Chinese poured $83 billion into the economy - a 20 percent increase in spending from the same holiday period last year. By comparison, retail spending in the United States fell 6 percent in September compared to the same time last year. But some of the increased spending in China is with money the consumers didn't have. In the first six months of this year, the number of Chinese consumer with credit card debts more than two months overdue rose 133 percent. For the Yuan family, credit card debt will take years to pay back. ""I have only one son, and he failed to live up to my expectations,"" Yuan's father said. CNN's Emily Chang, Fareed Zakaria and Kevin Voigt contributed to this report .","Although Chinese credit card debt is far behind the U.S., it's beginning to mount .

"(CNN) -- The Colorado couple who said their 6-year-old son was aboard an escaped balloon pleaded guilty Friday to charges related to the well-publicized ""balloon boy"" case. Richard Heene pleaded guilty in Larimer County Court to a felony charge of attempting to influence a public servant. His wife, Mayumi Heene, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of false reporting to authorities. The Heenes' attorneys said prosecutors had agreed to a sentence of probation with the possibility of up to 90 days in jail for Richard Heene and up to 60 days in jail for his wife. The incident occurred in October, when a large silver balloon came loose from its moorings in the Heenes' yard and drifted over eastern Colorado. Mayumi Heene called 911 and said the couple's 6-year-old son, Falcon, was inside the craft. Millions of people across the country watched the saga on television for nearly two hours as military aircraft tracked the balloon in the air and rescuers chased it below. Mayumi Heene later admitted the whole thing was a hoax and that Falcon was safe in their home the whole time, authorities said. Watch the moment the hoax was revealed . The couple's attorneys have said that the threat of Mayumi Heene's deportation was a factor in the plea deal negotiations. Mayumi Heene is a Japanese citizen but is in the United States legally. ""Even though Mr. Heene would have a triable case, I believe, to avoid the risk that his wife is deported ... we have decided that the best course of action is to proceed as we are proceeding,"" Richard Heene's lawyer, David Lane, said Friday. The judge is allowing the Heenes to leave the state while they remain on bond. Lane said Richard Heene is going to seek employment in New York and also has plans to go to California. Mayumi Heene's attorney said she may accompany him on those trips. Sentencing will be next month. Court documents released last month said the couple hatched the plan about two weeks before the incident and ""instructed their three children to lie to authorities as well as the media regarding this hoax."" Their motive? To ""make the Heene family more marketable for future media interests,"" the documents said.","NEW: Mayumi Heene pleads guilty to misdemeanor charge of false reporting to authorities .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The Italian government is vowing to fight a European court ruling that crucifixes in classrooms violate students' right to freedom of religion. The European Court of Human Rights found unanimously Tuesday that the display of a particular religious symbol -- such as the Christian cross -- in a classroom ""restricted the right of parents to educate their children in conformity with their convictions, and the right of children to believe or not to believe,"" a court statement said. The case was brought by an Italian woman, Soile Lautsi, who objected to the crucifixes on the walls in her two sons' classrooms. Italian courts had ruled earlier that the cross was a symbol of Italy's history and culture, prompting Lautsi to take her case to the European court in Strasbourg, France. It awarded her 5,000 euros ($7,400) in damages Tuesday. The Italian government said it would appeal the European Court's verdict and leading Catholic figures expressed astonishment and anger. The ruling ""is cause for bitterness and many perplexities,"" the Italian Conference of Bishop said in a written statement. The bishops said they were still studying the ruling, but it appeared to result from ""ideological bias"" and a lack of understanding of ""the multiple significances of the crucifix."" ""It does not take into account the fact that in Italy the display of the crucifix in public places is in line with the recognition of the principles of the Catholicism as 'part of the historical patrimony of the Italian people,' as stated in the Vatican/Italy agreement of 1984,"" the bishops said. The Vatican in Rome, which has been the seat of the Catholic Church for most of its 2,000-year history, did not officially respond to the ruling. But Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re told the leading Italian daily La Repubblica he could not understand it, and that no one with common sense could have expected it. ""When I think that we are talking about a symbol, the crucifix, an image that cannot but be the emblem of a universally shared humanity, I not only feel disappointed but also sadness and grief,"" he said. ""The crucifix is the sign of a God that loves man to the point of giving up his life for him. It is a God that teaches us to learn to love, to pay attention to each man ... and to respect the others, even those who belong to a different culture or religion. ""How could someone not share such a symbol?"" Italy has three months to file a request for a new hearing, court spokesman Stefano Piedimonte told CNN. A five-judge panel will examine the request, officially known as a referral, to determine if it raises sufficiently important issues for a 17-judge Grand Chamber hearing. Only the Italian government can appeal the verdict, but other interested parties can file briefs if the case goes forward, Piedimonte said. The European Court of Human Rights was set up in Strasbourg by the Council of Europe Member States in 1959 to deal with alleged violations of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights. CNN's Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","Italy vows to fight European court ruling banning crucifixes in classrooms .

"(CNN) -- Hunger is stunting hundreds of millions of children in the developing world, and more than 90 percent of them live in Africa and Asia, UNICEF says. Poor nutrition is one of the main killers of young children, the U.N. Children's Fund says in the new report ""Tracking Progress on Child and Maternal Nutrition."" ""The report we have launched draws attention to the fact that 200 million children under the age of 5 in the developing world suffer from chronic undernutrition,"" said Werner Schultink, UNICEF's associate director of nutrition. A lack of food can impair physical, mental and social abilities, the report says, adding that proper nutrition is important for mother and child. The 1,000 days from conception until a child's second birthday are the most critical for development, according to UNICEF. Undernourished children ""will perform less well in school, they will be able to do less well as an adult and, even worse, their health situation in adult life may be negatively affected,"" Schultink said. ""They are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes."" UNICEF says nutrition supplement programs have helped deliver vitamin A and iodized salt to vulnerable children in developing countries, boosting childhood mortality. Mothers also are being urged to breast-feed their children for at least the first six months to provide key antibodies and nutrients. Reducing and eliminating malnutrition is feasible, according to the report, which calls on the international community to provide urgent help or face the consequences. ""Global commitments on food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture are part of a wider agenda that will help address the critical issues raised in this report,"" said Ann Veneman, UNICEF's executive director. ""Unless attention is paid to addressing the causes of child and maternal undernutrition today, the costs will be considerably higher tomorrow.""","Poor nutrition is one of the main killers of young children, UNICEF report says .

"London, England (CNN) -- The British government said Wednesday it will appeal a European court ruling that certain police stop-and-search powers are a breach of human rights. Under Section 44 of Britain's Terrorism Act 2000, uniformed officers may stop any pedestrian or vehicle and search them, regardless of whether they have reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing. Human rights groups complain the rules are subject to abuse, but the British government calls the powers an important tool in the fight against terrorism. British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he was disappointed in Tuesday's ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, because the appeals had previously gone through the British courts and been rejected. ""We are considering the judgment and will seek to appeal,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""Pending the outcome of this appeal, the police will continue to have these powers available to them."" London's Metropolitan Police said that because of sensitivity and concerns about use of the stop-and-search powers, they are only being used at ""pre-identified significant locations"" like landmarks, tourist sites, and crowded places, or where certain police operations are taking place. The case began in September 2003, when police stopped and searched two British nationals who were on their way to a London demonstration. Kevin Gillan was on his bicycle and wearing a backpack when police searched him. He was allowed to go after about 20 minutes, the court said. Pennie Quinton is a journalist who was on her way to cover the demonstration when police stopped and searched her, the court said. Police ordered her to stop filming even though she showed her press cards; the official record of her search said she was stopped for about five minutes, though she says she thought it was closer to half an hour. Gillan and Quinton complained that the police use of the stop-and-search powers under Section 44 breached the European Convention on Human Rights -- specifically their right to liberty and security, right to respect for private and family life, freedom of expression, and freedom of assembly and association. The case reached the Law Lords, Britain's highest court, but the Law Lords dismissed the appeal in March 2006 because they said they weren't convinced the police search disrespected the plaintiffs' private lives. Even if the search did not respect the plaintiffs' private lives, the Law Lords found, the procedure was in accordance with the law and was proportionate to counterterrorism efforts. Gillan and Quinton then appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which heard the case in May and issued its ruling Tuesday. ""It's fantastic news after a long struggle,"" Gillan said, in a statement issued by the human rights group Liberty, which took the case to court. ""I look to the government for a strong response."" Said Quinton, in another statement issued by Liberty, ""There has to be a balance between private life and security. The court has shown that Section 44 is an invasion of people's right to liberty and privacy."" The court found that the ""coercive powers"" of the anti-terrorism legislation amounted to a clear interference with the right to respect for private life. This interference was compounded by the public nature of the search, because it brings an element of humiliation and embarrassment, the court found. Legal safeguards were not adequate enough to curb the wide discretion police had to use the powers, the court found. It said that wide discretion was a cause for concern. ""The officer's decision to stop and search an individual was one based exclusively on the 'hunch' or 'professional intuition,'"" the court wrote in its decision. ""Not only was it unnecessary for him to demonstrate the existence of any reasonable suspicion; he was not required even subjectively to suspect anything about the person stopped and searched."" Because officers have no obligation to show a reasonable suspicion, it is ""almost impossible to prove that the power had been improperly exercised,"" the court said. As a result, the court said, the stop-and-search powers were not in accordance with the law. Liberty called on the British government to ensure that Section 44 is only applied when authorities believe it is necessary to prevent terrorism. It should be applied to specific areas and for not longer than 24 hours, Liberty said, which would prevent authorities from applying the measures on a rolling basis and over large parts of a city. Liberty also called on the government to publish notice that authorization for Section 44 has been given.","Britain will appeal ruling against police searches allowed by its anti-terrorism legislation .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. serviceman was among six victims of an early morning shooting at a Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, strip club Wednesday, officials said. Unidentified gunmen entered the Amadeus club in the border city across from El Paso, Texas, just after midnight and fatally shot six men, Chihuahua state attorney general's office spokesman Arturo Sandoval said. An additional person was injured, he said. Two of the victims were identified as employees of the strip club, a waiter and a security guard, the spokesman said. Another was identified as an American citizen and member of the U.S. Air Force, Sandoval said. A statement from Holloman Air Force Base, near Alamogordo, New Mexico, confirmed that the airman was based there, and identified him as Staff Sgt. David Booher, 26. The gunmen appeared to have targeted the victims, Sandoval said. ""Everything indicates that these people were looking for these men,"" he said. Investigators recovered more than 30 shells from the scene. Because of drug-related violence, particularly in border cities, Juarez is considered off-limits for the U.S. military. At Fort Bliss in El Paso, for instance, a memorandum prohibits its soldiers from traveling into the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where Ciudad Juarez is located. More than 2,000 killings have been recorded in Juarez this year. CNN's Mayra Cuevas-Nazario, Mike Mount, Dave Alsup and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Air Force Staff Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Charges of rebellion will be leveled against many of those arrested during martial law in the southern Philippines -- declared in the aftermath of last month's massacre of 57 civilians, the nation's justice secretary said. Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera made the statement Saturday as the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo defended the martial law declaration, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. Some lawmakers have challenged the legality of the declaration, which allows authorities to make arrests without a warrant. Martial law went into effect Friday night in the province of Maguindanao to impose peace following the politically motivated massacre, said army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. He added that Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. Police and military reports of armed men massing in Maguindanao would lead to charges of rebellion, Devanadera said, according to ABS-CBN. Signs indicated that ""violence was imminent,"" said Brig. Gen. Gaudencio Pangilinan, operations chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the affiliate reported. The armed men were supporters of the politically powerful Ampatuan family, which has been implicated in the massacre, Pangilinan said. At least six members of the Ampatuan family have been arrested, including Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr., according to ABS-CBN. Ampatuan, whose father is governor of Maguindanao, has been accused of directing the killings and has been charged with 25 counts of murder. One of the massacre victims implicated members of the Ampatuan family before she died, the affiliate reported. Over the weekend, authorities raided at least one warehouse and ranch belonging to the family. They confiscated firearms, ammunition and vehicles, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the eastern Mindinao command, told CNN. The military was looking at arresting at least 100 people tied to the massacre, ABS-CBN reported. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. Asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings, Cabangbang said authorities ""were trying to build a case, a tight case"" against suspects. ""But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant. So we really need this declaration of state of martial law."" The president was to submit a written report to Congress on Sunday evening, justifying her declaration of martial law, the Department of Justice said, according to the state-run Philippine News Agency. Political debate had flared over how soon Congress needed to convene after the declaration of martial law, as required by the Constitution. The House of Representatives and the Senate might jointly convene on Tuesday to discuss the president's report, House Speaker Prospero Nograles said Sunday, according to the Philippine News Agency. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the country. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Ampatuan Sr. has been taken into custody in the massacre, but was hospitalized after taking ill. Witnesses and local officials say the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging the younger Ampatuan -- a longtime ally of the Philippine president and a known warlord -- in the May gubernatorial election. A dozen journalists who had accompanied the women were also killed in the massacre. Group: Philippines most dangerous country for journalists . Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.","NEW: Charges of rebellion will be leveled against many of those arrested during martial law .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- It isn't clear whether the United States will ever be able to declare victory in Iraq, the top U.S. commander there said Thursday. Army Gen. Ray Odierno speaks to reporters at the Pentagon  on Thursday. ""I'm not sure we will ever see anyone declare victory in Iraq, because first off, I'm not sure we'll know for 10 years or five years,"" Army Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters at the Pentagon. About 123,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq now, and President Obama says all combat forces will be gone by the end of August 2010, leaving as many as 50,000 noncombat troops to advise and train Iraqi forces before leaving by the end of 2011. Odierno has said he wants to draw down the U.S. forces at a faster rate than planned if the security situation allows it. On Thursday, he said he expected the number of U.S. troops to drop to 120,000 by the end of October, and to as few as 110,000 by the end of 2009. ""What we've done here is we're giving Iraq an opportunity in the long term to be a strategic partner of the United States, but more importantly, be a partner in providing regional stability inside of the Middle East,"" Odierno said. Odierno also highlighted continuing security issues inside the country, saying Iraqi security forces have recently seized several ""very large"" caches of Iranian-made rockets and armor-piercing munitions known as explosively formed penetrators, or EFPs. ""If you're training people ... in Iran to come back into Iraq, and you're providing them rockets and other things, I call that significant because it still enables people to conduct attacks not only on U.S. forces but on Iraqi civilians,"" Odierno said. At a congressional hearing Wednesday, Odierno said the main threat to stability in Iraq are Arab-Kurd tensions, adding there has been difficulty bringing the two sides together for possible joint patrols. ""We've had some very good meetings,"" he said. ""But we still have some ways to go on that.""","U.S. Army Gen. Ray Odierno makes remark to reporters at Pentagon .

"(CNN) -- It has long been the final destination for terminally ill patients who want to end their lives, offering what many consider to be a dignified way out of their suffering. But now, Switzerland is proposing legislation that would limit the practice of assisted suicide to people who are terminally ill -- or ban it altogether. If either proposal is adopted, people suffering from a chronic illness or who have a mental illness could no longer legally take advantage of assisted suicide. The Swiss Federal Council says it doesn't necessarily want to end the country's liberal laws, which allow someone to assist a suicide as long as they are not motivated by their own interests. But the council says organizations that provide assisted suicide in Switzerland -- such as the well known Dignitas clinic -- are increasingly testing the boundaries of the law, requiring the government to lay out specific guidelines and restrictions. Recent cases have drawn more attention to ""suicide tourism,"" in which people who can't legally seek assisted suicide in their home countries travel to Switzerland, where it is allowed. Dan James, a 23-year-old British rugby player, ended his life at a Swiss assisted suicide clinic last year. He had been paralyzed from the neck down in a rugby accident. His illness was chronic but not terminal. James' case drew headlines when his parents, who accompanied their son to Switzerland, returned home to questions from police. In the end, the Jameses were not prosecuted. Multiple sclerosis sufferer Debbie Purdy won a high-profile battle in June to have Britain's law on assisted suicide clarified. Purdy, who has said she wants the option of assisted suicide if her condition deteriorates, wanted to know at what point her husband might be prosecuted if he accompanied her to an assisted suicide clinic. Purdy's case went all the way to the Law Lords, Britain's highest court, who ordered the director of public prosecutions to issue a new policy on assisted suicide. He did so last month. Multiple sclerosis is chronic disease and some times can be terminal, leaving open the question whether Purdy might qualify if the new Swiss proposals are approved. At least 117 Britons have traveled abroad for an assisted suicide since 2002, at an average of two a month, according to Dignity in Dying, which advocates giving terminally ill adults the option of assisted suicide. Switzerland's Parliament is now considering two proposals from the federal council, the seven-member cabinet that heads the government. Consultations on the proposals will last until March. The first option would ensure that the person committing suicide is doing it of their own free will, and that the person assisting them is not driven by personal gain. It would also make assisted suicide an option only for those suffering from a terminal illness -- not for those suffering from a chronic or mental illness. The suicidal person would have to declare that he has given ""long and proper consideration"" to his decision,"" according to the council. That is intended to prevent spur-of-the-moment decisions that have not been thought through, the council says. Patients must also present two different doctor's certificates from two different doctors, one stating that they have the legal capacity to decide their options for themselves, and the other stating that they suffer from an incurable physical illness that will result in death within a short period. For those with chronic or mental illnesses, the council said it supports ""comprehensive treatment, care and support, in the sense of palliative medicine"" rather than suicide. Those assisting with suicide face criminal charges if they don't make sure of these steps, the council says. They must also discuss alternatives to suicide with the patient, and must not accept payment for their services that would exceed the costs and expenses of the suicide. ""This provision ensures that those assisting a suicide are not driven by personal gain, and that their prime motivation is to help the person who wishes to die,"" the council says. ""The Federal Council firmly believes that, by determining these duties of care, the negative aspects and abuse of organized assisted suicide can be prevented, and 'suicide tourism' can be reduced."" The council says it prefers stricter legislation for assisted suicide, but it is also giving Parliament a second option for a complete ban on organized assisted suicide. ""This option rests on the belief that individuals working in assisted suicide organizations are never actually motivated by purely altruistic reasons, and may develop a close relationship with the suicidal person,"" the council says. Dignity in Dying said it welcomes the first option, restricting assisted suicide to terminally ill, mentally competent people. ""Individual patient autonomy has to be balanced against the need to protect potentially vulnerable people,"" the group said in a statement Thursday. ""This proposal seeks to address this balance.""","Switzerland has reputation for lax laws on assisted suicide .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai's office contacted the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan about reports the ambassador warned against sending more U.S. troops to the country, a Karzai spokesman told CNN Thursday. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Ambassador Karl Eikenberry sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over Karzai's government. One official, who spoke on condition of not being identified because of the sensitive nature of the cables, said the two communications ""expressed concern and reservations about troop increases in Afghanistan"" until more is known about Karzai's government after his recent re-election. Separately, a senior U.S. official also confirmed the existence of two Eikenberry classified cables. The official said Eikenberry expressed reservations about troop increases because of lingering concerns about Karzai and uncertainties about the government he is going to put in place. The second official also asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the cables. In Kabul, Eikenberry's office would not confirm to Karzai's office the reports about the cables, Karzai spokesman Seyemic Herawi said. Herawi said Karzai will not comment on the reports without more information from the U.S. Embassy. Should more troops be sent to Afghanistan? Share your thoughts . Eikenberry previously expressed worry about corruption in Karzai's government and its ability to partner with the United States to fight the Taliban. A senior State Department official told CNN that President Obama's administration has questions about Karzai's behavior, suggesting it has been inconsistent. Asked for an official response on reports of the cables, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said it does not comment on private messages, but did confirm that there had been correspondence between Eikenberry and the president. In Washington, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly declined to comment Thursday on Eikenberry's communications. ""We are not going to get into the details of this kind of advice,"" Kelly said. ""This is a privileged channel of communication. They have the right to receive this advice in a confidential way,"" Kelly said. ""Ambassador Eikenberry has been providing this kind of advice and analysis to the president and secretary since he arrived,"" he said. ""The president really deserves the right to be able to gather all of this information from all of the different principals, people involved in the shaping of this policy."" Earlier, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said, ""We won't discuss classified documents publicly, but, as we have said for months, success in Afghanistan depends on having a true partner in the Afghan government."" Initial reports of cables sent by Eikenberry appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. All three newspapers attributed the reports to senior U.S. officials, without identifying them. The developments came as Obama told his war council Wednesday that the U.S. troop commitment to Afghanistan is not open-ended, and then asked for revisions to options he previously received for sending more troops, a senior administration official told CNN. The war council -- comprising top Cabinet, Pentagon and administration officials -- met with Obama for the eighth time to discuss a request by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan for up to 40,000 more troops. The meeting lasted more than two hours, according to the senior administration official. ""The president and his team discussed the length of time that it would take to implement the options he's been presented,"" the senior official said. ""The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended. After years of substantial investments by the American people, governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our Afghan partner."" In particular, Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government, the official said. Earlier, a senior administration official and a U.S. military official independently told CNN that one option presented to Obama calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country. The military official said the plan would send three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade of about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000 troops; and 4,000 to 5,000 support troops. The combat brigades would be brought in gradually, in three-month intervals, according to the military official. The troops would be spread across the country, mainly focusing in the south and southeast, where much of the fighting is, according to the military official. The option has been a favorite at the Pentagon in recent weeks, the official added. That is only one option, the senior administration official emphasized. Three other options, the official said, would be ""different mixes,"" or ""different components of it."" Despite reports to the contrary, Obama has not decided the number of U.S. troops he will send to Afghanistan, White House officials said. Such reports are ""absolutely false,"" Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. And anyone who suggests otherwise, ""doesn't have, in all honesty, the slightest idea what they're talking about."" Republican members of the Senate Armed Services Committee urged Obama in a letter sent Wednesday -- Veterans Day -- to agree to the request for additional troops by U.S. military leaders in Afghanistan. The letter, signed by 10 Republican committee members, said success in Afghanistan will require enabling local leaders to govern and secure their country without substantial international assistance. CNN 's Barbara Starr, Elise Labott, Suzanne Malveaux, Mike Mount, Chris Lawrence and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","State Department says what ambassador tells president is confidential .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Authorities arrested a man accused of secretly taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude and posting the videos on the Internet, the FBI said Friday. ESPN reporter Erin Andrews claims someone videotaped her while she was nude and posted video online. Authorities arrested 48-year-old Michael David Barrett at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Friday. Barrett faces a charge of interstate stalking, the FBI said. Barrett is accused of taping Andrews while she was nude in two hotel rooms. He then made eight videos that he posted on the Internet, the FBI said. Barrett allegedly filmed seven of the eight videos at a hotel room in Nashville, Tennessee, in September 2008. FBI agents said they found evidence that a peephole to the door of Andrews' hotel room had been altered. The FBI learned that Barrett checked into the same hotel at that time and asked for a room adjacent to Andrews using his home address to register for the room. According to a criminal complaint, Barrett tried to sell the videos to celebrity gossip Web site TMZ.com. Employees at the Web site also helped in the investigation providing Barrett's information to Andrews' attorney. Andrews works as a sideline reporter traveling around the country covering college football games. Barrett will have his first court appearance in Chicago at 10 a.m. (11 a.m. ET) Saturday, authorities said. The maximum penalty for the charge of interstate stalking is five years in federal prison, the FBI said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The head of ACORN on Tuesday sharply deplored recent videos showing some of the group's workers advising people how to set up a prostitution business. ACORN leader Bertha Lewis defends her group at the National Press Club on Tuesday in Washington. ""It made my stomach turn,"" Bertha Lewis, chief executive officer of ACORN, told reporters at the National Press Club in Washington. ""It just made you sick."" ACORN workers who did perform their tasks properly ""did not deserve to have co-workers who did not live up to their standards,"" Lewis said. ""So yes, I terminated those employees."" At the same time, Lewis defended the community organizing group and punched back at widespread criticism, touting the group's efforts in helping poor people in the areas of housing and voting. She backed up the group's legal action in Maryland against the makers of one of the videos. Video, shot with a hidden camera, shows conservative activists posing as a pimp and a prostitute. Lewis said that ""we want to hold them accountable"" for what she said was breaking the law. Similar videos were made at other ACORN offices. ""It is illegal, as Linda Tripp will tell you, to record someone in the state of Maryland without their permission. Just because we were embarrassed by these highly edited tapes, which don't tell the whole story again, and hopefully that will come out, doesn't mean that these people didn't break the law in order to embarrass and attack the organization,"" Lewis said. Lewis was referring to the former White House employee who recorded conversations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky about her sexual encounters with President Clinton, which ultimately led to his impeachment. ACORN -- which stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- was in the headlines during last year's presidential campaign after GOP allegations of falsifying voter registration applicants. Some of its voter registration workers were prosecuted, and some other employees resigned. But after the recent release of videos, the political criticism grew. In the videos, some ACORN workers advised the undercover conservative activists how to set up a prostitution business involving underage, foreign girls. Along with firing employees, ACORN also is conducting an investigation through an independent auditor. The Justice and Treasury departments are investigating the group, too. The U.S. Census Bureau has terminated ACORN's involvement in its public outreach program, both chambers of Congress have voted to deny federal funding to the organization, and several states are looking into ACORN operations. In addition, ACORN suspended tax preparation services it carried out as part of an Internal Revenue Service program. And Bank of America announced it is pulling its funding of an ACORN housing affiliate until it is satisfied that all issues related to the organization have been resolved. Lewis contends the group also has been responsive to allegations that some canvassers falsified voter registration applications and turned in those who falsified voter registration forms. ""We were punished for following the law and doing the right thing, and that part of the story was never told,"" she said. ""And so nine months later it finally began to resonate with folks that we had not had one individual who voted fraudulently in the presidential election because of an ACORN registration -- not one Mickey Mouse, not one Donald Duck, not one New York Jet, Giant or any other fraudulent person."" One of the shadows over ACORN is an embezzling incident involving Dale Rathke, the brother of ACORN founder Wade Rathke. Lewis acknowledged that the founder's sibling embezzled nearly $1 million from the group. She disputed reports that a subpoena from the Louisiana attorney general's office showed that the amount was up to $5 million. Lewis said the claim is ""speculation, ""completely false"" and not based on any documentation. She attributed the contention to two ""disgruntled former board members."" Lewis' group works in poor precincts across the country considered Democratic turf. She said e-mails from Karl Rove, when he was Bush's top political adviser, show that ACORN was targeted to stop its voter registration efforts because ""we were moving too many minorities to vote"" and ""changing the power dynamics"" in local elections. Such critics of the group believe ""we needed to be stopped,"" Lewis said. ""I do think that after 40 years of going after the rich and powerful, I think you make some powerful enemies. I think since 2004, things have been ramped up."" Lewis said ACORN has been demonized and news about it has served as a Republican fund-raising tool. She said this form of ""modern-day ACORN McCarthyism has got to stop."" ""Last week, members of Congress were asked, 'Are you now or have you ever been members of ACORN? Everybody should take pause at that. Everybody should say, 'Wait a minute. This is not how we have discourse,' "" she said, making reference to the familiar phrase from McCarthy-era hearings in the 1950s: ""Are you now or have you ever been a communist?"" Appointed to her post in 2008, Lewis said she has been working hard to improve the group's management practices to ""restrengthen, reorganize and put together the 21st-century ACORN."" ""I'm proud to say that they've made it clear to me that I will continue to be tortured for at least another year. If the board thought or our membership thought that I should resign, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" she said. ""I don't think, however, it is fair to judge me as I'm cleaning up a previous administration, and now we have real documentation that these are political attacks on us, which is unprecedented.""","ACORN leader defends community organizing group at National Press Club .

"(CNN) --  I spoke at TED in 2006, the year they started to put the talks online. I'm told that since then, the talk has been downloaded more than 3.5 million times in more than 200 countries. The number of people who've seen it may be 20 times that or more. I have a stream of e-mails, tweets and blog posts round the world from young people, parents, students, teachers, cultural activists and business leaders of all sorts. They tell me how deeply they relate to the talk and often that they've seen or shown it many times at meetings, conferences, workshops and retreats. Parents tell me they've shown it to their children; young people tell me they've shown it to their parents. They say they've laughed and sometimes cried together and had a different sort of conversation as a result. Changing the conversation is one of the primary purposes of TED. Why has this talk had such an impact? I think there are several reasons. To begin with, the talk is short. The 18-minute talk is part of the genius of TED. In a world of instant messaging, rampant data and overspecialization, brevity is a virtue. (Even so, I've seen blogs that strongly recommend the talk but warn that it's almost 20 minutes long.) A second factor is that, based on the audience's reaction, the talk is entertaining and funny at times, which always helps. And I'd just had my hair cut. We may never know how much that simple act contributed to the global appeal of the talk. But the real reason for its impact is that what I'm saying clearly resonates deeply with people of all ages and across many different cultures. I believe that the argument is becoming more urgent by the day. What is the argument? In a nutshell, it's that we're all born with immense natural talents but our institutions, especially education, tend to stifle many of them and as a result we are fomenting a human and an economic disaster. In education, this vast waste of talent involves a combination of factors. They include a narrow emphasis on certain sorts of academic work; the exile of arts, humanities and physical education programs from schools; arid approaches to teaching math and sciences; an obsessive culture of standardized testing and tight financial pressures to teach to the tests. The result is a disastrous waste of talent among students and their teachers. To sense the scale of this disaster, you only have to look at the alarming rates of turnover among faculty and the levels of drop out, disaffection, stress and prescription drug use among students. Even for students who stay the course and do well in education, the rules of success have changed irrevocably. Just look at the plummeting value of college degrees. The waste of talent in education is not deliberate. Teachers are as anxious about this as everyone else, but many of them feel trapped in the awkward groping of national reform policies, many of which misunderstand the problems as well as the solutions. The waste of talent isn't deliberate, but it is systematic. It happens in part because the dominant systems of education are rooted in the values and demands of industrialism: they are linear, mechanistic and focused on conformity and standardization. Nowadays, they're buttressed by major commercial interests in mass testing and by the indiscriminate use of prescription drugs that keep students' minds from wandering to things they naturally find more interesting. The tragedy is that meeting the many social, economic, spiritual and environmental challenges we now face depends absolutely on the very capacities of insight, creativity and innovation that these systems are systematically suppressing in yet another generation of young people. Reforming these systems is not enough. The truth is that we are caught up in a cultural and economic revolution. This revolution is global in scale and unpredictable in nature. To meet it, we need a revolution in the culture of education. This new culture has to emerge from a richer sense of human ability. To shape it, I believe we have to leave behind the manufacturing principles of industrialism and embrace the organic principles of ecology. Education is about developing human beings, and human development is not mechanical or linear. It is organic and dynamic. Like all living forms, we flourish in certain conditions and shrivel in others. Great teachers, great parents and great leaders understand those conditions intuitively; poor ones don't. The answer is not to standardize education, but to personalize and customize it to the needs of each child and community. There is no alternative. There never was. The good news is that all around the world there are wonderful examples of people and organizations that are making determined efforts to do things differently in education -- and in business, health care, architecture, communities and cultural programs. There are examples of these all over the TED Web site and in the expanding ripples of the TED prizes. TED itself is a great example of the spirit of collaboration and inter-disciplinarily that is the essential to a genuine culture of creativity. What are the principles of this culture? Towards the end of my talk, I mention a book I was working on called ""Epiphany."" It was published this year under a much better title, ""The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything"" (Viking) and is now in 11 languages. It draws on conversations with people in science, business, education, the arts, sports and more on how they found in themselves the talents and passions that have shaped their lives. But the book is not about them: it's about you and your children, if you have any; and your friends too, if you have any of those. There's a wealth of talent that lies in all of us. All of us, including those who work in schools, must nurture creativity systematically and not kill it unwittingly. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sir Ken Robinson.","Sir Ken Robinson: We're born with great natural talents .

"(CNN) -- Former Philippine President Corazon Aquino, whose ""People Power"" movement pushed out longtime strongman Ferdinand Marcos less than three years after her husband's assassination, has died at age 76, her family announced Saturday. ""She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy,"" said Ray Donato, the nation's consul-general in Atlanta. Aquino, the first woman to lead the Philippines, had been battling colon cancer since March 2008 and died of cardio-respiratory arrest at 3:18 a.m. Saturday (3:18 p.m. Friday ET), said Mai Mislang, a spokeswoman for her son, Philippine Sen. Benigno Aquino III. Funeral arrangements were being set up, Mislang said.  Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has also announced a 10-day mourning period for the former president, said Ray Donato, the country's consul-general in Atlanta. ""She was the agent of change in Philippine democracy, and almost all the Filipinos I know revered her during her presidency,"" Donato said. Aquino had been born into a wealthy family and was educated in the United States. She had not been involved in politics before her husband, opposition leader Benigno ""Ninoy"" Aquino Jr., was gunned down at Manila's airport in August 1983 as he returned from exile. The political novice took over the leadership of her husband's movement after his death and challenged Marcos in a 1986 election, making a yellow dress her trademark and bolstered by the support of the country's Roman Catholic churches. Marcos had been backed by the United States, the former colonial power in the Philippines, for two decades as a stalwart anti-communist. He and his wife Imelda were friends of then-President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy. But widespread allegations of electoral fraud and a mutiny by the country's military led the Reagan administration to withdraw its support, and Marcos went into exile in Hawaii. Aquino took office in a country with a $28 billion debt, widespread poverty and a persistent Marxist insurgency. She put in place a U.S.-style constitution that limited presidents to a single six-year term and survived seven coup attempts -- including one that was supressed with American help. She also oversaw the closure of the major U.S. military bases in the country before leaving office in 1992. The bases had been a bulwark of American power in the Pacific since the early 1900s and employed nearly 80,000 Filipinos, but Aquino's opponents argued the country was too dependent on the United States. Aquino announced in 1990 that it was time to begin negotiating the ""orderly withdrawal"" of U.S. forces.","NEW: Funeral arrangements are being set up, spokeswoman says .

"(CNN) -- She's been called ""America's mom."" Strangers stop her for hugs in the airport. And she still dishes up kindly parental wisdom daily in reruns of ""The Brady Bunch."" ""Brady Bunch"" actress Florence Henderson founded a service to help older adults learn about computers. Now, actress Florence Henderson, otherwise known as Mrs. Brady, has a new mission: Helping older adults learn to use technology. Her new business, Floh Club, is a ""telephone-based technical support service"" focusing on people who didn't grow up with computers -- especially grandparents who want to stay in touch with family but are intimidated by webcams, Facebook, instant messaging or even e-mail. Henderson says Floh Club is ""like roadside assistance for your computer."" She spoke with CNN's Josh Levs about her inspiration, her grandkids and ""Brady Bunch"" rumors as the show celebrates its 40th anniversary.  See more of our chat with Florence Henderson Â» . CNN: What made you think of this? Florence Henderson: I was terrified of computers, Josh. I didn't grow up with them. And I have four kids, and they were always saying, ""Oh, Mom, please get connected."" And I would go, ""No, I don't have time."" But I was really scared. And so, a few months ago I decided that if I felt that way, there must be a lot of older adults that feel the same way, or maybe even some younger ones. I am now sending e-mails, I'm videoconferencing. I'm taking photos off my camera and actually putting them on the computer. Facebook, it is so exciting. I mean, I'm thrilled. CNN: What kinds of calls are you getting? What have people been calling and saying they need help with? Henderson: Things like as simple as learning how to send an e-mail. We have all North American-based technical experts standing by. Eighteen hours a day. Seven days a week. They are all very patient and very caring, and they will access your computer remotely, and they will talk you through any problem you may be having. They'll teach you how to use your computer. CNN: The plans and services range from $25 to up to $250 for an entire year. You have grandkids. Do you stay in touch with them this way? Henderson: You know what, Josh? That's one of the most exciting things for me is to be able to videoconference because I have a son and his wife and two children that live in St. Louis. I have a daughter in Florida. And they have two children. And now I can actually see them. I have a new granddaughter who is just a year old. I can watch her grow, and I can talk to them. To me, that is the most exciting thing. And so I'm encouraging older adults to really stay connected and use your brain. CNN: It's the 40th anniversary of the Brady Bunch. We see sitcom stars come and go. But you, 35 years after the show technically ended, you have stayed out there as an icon. What's your secret? What did you do that no one else figured out? Henderson: You know what, Josh? I think it's because I love what I do. I'm passionate about what I do. I've always kind of felt that my career was my vocation, and I love staying on top of things. Now I'm cybermom! I genuinely love to communicate. And I love people. CNN: I got to tell you, when I said I was going to talk to you today, every person I talked to said I have to get the truth about you and Greg (Barry Williams). You write about this on your blog. Just give everyone the real story. Henderson: The real story is that he always had a crush on me and he asked me to go on a date with him. And so I went. And he only had a driver's permit. And his brother had to bring him to my hotel, and then he could drive my car, you know, he had a permit. But it was so sweet and so innocent. And he's still a very dear friend.","Florence Henderson launches a new service to help seniors learn about computers .

Search and rescue crews were not immediately able to land their helicopter in the area and determine whether anyone survived the crash in the east of the country, said Christope Illemassene, spokesman for the U.N.

But Air Serv International, the relief group that operated the plane, said an aerial survey has indicated that all the occupants on the Beechcraft 1900 plane died. The plane was on a routine flight from Kinsasha to the eastern city of Goma on Monday, with three stops, Illemassene said. Air-traffic controllers lost contact with the plane when it approached Bukavu, the last of its three intermediate stops. The weather in the area was stormy at the time, Illemassene said. Search and rescue crews spotted the plane's debris Tuesday, about 9.4 miles (15 km) northwest of the Bukavu airport, Illemassene said. ""We're anxiously waiting for results from the search and rescue operation,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A new classified directive to coalition forces in Afghanistan puts restrictions on nighttime raids of Afghan homes and compounds, according to a senior U.S. official who has seen the document. The official declined to be identified because a declassified version of the document has not been made public. The directive is signed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, the official said. The directive comes as the coalition seeks to reduce tension between its military forces and Afghan civilians in an effort to maintain Afghan public support. Nighttime raids in which troops enter private homes have sparked problems for U.S. and NATO forces. The raids are viewed as overly invasive -- a violation of the privacy of the home in Afghan culture -- and they can turn violent. The document orders forces to use Afghan troops at night ""whenever possible"" to knock on doors of residences and compounds, and to use them if forcible action is required for entry, the official said. But the directive also orders troops to ""conduct an analysis"" of whether it is militarily essential to conduct a raid at night or whether it can be put off until daylight, the official said. If troops can keep a target under surveillance but wait for daylight, they then can enlist the aid of village elders, perhaps, in determining if a home or compound poses a threat, the official said. The official emphasized that troops always have the right to defend themselves and are given leeway to use their best judgment on the battlefield. McChrystal also is updating another directive, first issued last year, on conducting operations to minimize civilian casualties, the official said. The updated version, which is yet to be published, will include ""more clarity"" for troops on how to operate in ""escalation of force"" incidents, such as when a vehicle approaches a checkpoint in a potentially threatening manner and troops must decide whether, and when, to fire at it. The official declined to offer further details but said the aim is to make sure even the most junior troops have full understanding of rules and procedures. Some troops and local commanders have expressed concerns that recent rules can inhibit their ability to take action under fire. These directives come as the coalition has been involved in several recent incidents in which civilians were inadvertently killed, and as the coalition conducts major operations in southern Afghanistan. McChrystal released a video message to the Afghan populace apologizing for an incident this week in which 27 Afghan civilians were killed. ""I have made it clear to our forces that we are here to protect the Afghan people. I pledge to strengthen our efforts to regain your trust to build a brighter future for all Afghans,"" he said in the message. The official said the documents may be made public in the coming weeks, after current operations ease.","U.S. official: Directive pertains to coalition forces' raids on Afghan homes, compounds .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian protesters are vowing to continue their anti-government demonstrations into Wednesday night, despite violent crackdowns and arrests. Witnesses in Tehran tell CNN the demonstrators number in the tens of thousands. The protests are timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy. Iran celebrates the embassy takeover as an official holiday, and tens of thousands showed up to hear anti-American speeches in front of the building that once housed the U.S. diplomatic corps. Many chanted ""Death to America."" The anniversary was also an opportunity to reignite the anti-government protests that were sparked in June, following a disputed presidential election. Thousands of protesters ignored warnings from Iranian authorities to stay home, many chanting ""Death to the Dictator"" and others saying, ""Obama - Either you're with us or with them,"" referring to the U.S. president. Riot police and pro-government Basij militia turned out in force to quash anti-government protests. ""We were running from the police in the alleys off of the main streets,"" said Soheil, an opposition protester, who gave only one name for security reasons. ""Strangers were opening up their garages so we could hide until the police went away. I ran into a garage for about 15 minutes. When I went back into the main street, I saw riot police arresting a group of young men, then putting them inside a bank and locking the door. ""Only God knows what will happen to them after that."" iReport: Iranians take to the streets . Soheil, like many other of the demonstrators, took part in the protests this summer. As with previous demonstrations, many images of Wednesday's protest were uploaded to the Internet on the site YouTube.com -- including video of protesters walking over an image of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Another clip showed a group of women being beaten by what appeared to be Iranian security forces. Witnesses said many Iranian women took part in Wednesday's demonstration, and were frequently targeted by the Iranian security forces -- which is what also happened during the summer protests. Video posted on YouTube showed many protesters beaten on the head with batons. Iranian reformists have chosen key anniversaries to protest the hardline government -- the same anniversaries chosen for government-sanctioned anti-American rallies. Wednesday's was the biggest annual anti-American observance of all. On November 4, 1979, Islamic students stormed the U.S. Embassy. They held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. There were also small pockets of protest on Wednesday in the southwest Iran city of Shiraz, according to a resident who witnessed the protests. Demonstrators marched down the main street of Shiraz, yelling ""Death to the dictator"" and ""We will not stand down to you, together we are united,"" according to Najmeh, who only gave her first name for security reasons. There was strong police presence on the streets, and the police force seemed much more organized than past occasions, she said. Earlier in the day, opposition supporters marched defiantly in Tehran's Haft-e-Tir Square, witnesses said. Many held up their hands in V-signs. Others shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great,"" which has become a slogan of protest. Police blocked all roads leading to the square, creating massive traffic jams. Witnesses described helmet-clad security personnel beating demonstrators with batons and firing tear gas at Haft-e-Tir Square and in a neighborhood a few kilometers north. ""I had never seen that many riot police and security personnel,"" a witness told CNN. ""They were brought in by the busloads. As soon as crowds gathered somewhere, riot police were there within minutes."" The opposition showed Wednesday that even after five months of government crackdown, people were still willing to take risks. The disputed June 12 presidential election triggered Iran's most serious political crisis since the Islamic revolution toppled the shah. Led by opposition candidate Mir Houssein Moussavi, thousands of Iranians protested what they believed was a rigged vote that returned hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office for a second term. In the election aftermath, the Iranian government arrested more than 1,000 people and accused reformists Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi of spreading anti-government propaganda and fueling anger among the public. But despite warnings from the government, Iran's reformists have largely refused to back down. They released the names of 72 protesters they say were killed in the unrest that followed the election -- more than double the government's official number. Both Moussavi and Karrubi were prevented from attending Wednesday's rallies, according to a reformist Web site, Norooz News. Karrubi's son told the Web site that his father tried to reach the Haft-e-Tir Square rally on foot, but he was blocked by anti-riot police, sparking clashes with his followers. Police fired tear gas toward Karrubi, hitting one of his guards on the head, and causing Karrubi and some of his supporters to fall to the ground, according to Norooz News. Karrubi and his followers returned to their vehicles and drove away when, at one point, security forces attacked and damaged Karrubi's vehicle, the Web site said. Video posted on YouTube showed Karrubi briefly opening his car door to a crowd of cheering supporters, who chanted, ""Honorable Karrubi, help the people of Iran."" Iranian authorities had warned Karrubi to not participate in the marches, saying he might be the victim of a suicide attack, according to Norooz News. Moussavi was unable to join the demonstration after his car was prevented from leaving his office, according to his Facebook page and a report on a reformist Web site. Cell phone and Internet connections were cut in the area where his office is located, and dozens of plainclothes motorcycle riders blocked the entrance and chanted slogans against Moussavi, the Web sites said. Read analysis from Hamid Dabashi, author of ""Iran: A People Interrupted"" In Washington, President Obama said the world continues to bear witness to the Iranian people's ""calls for justice and their courageous pursuit of universal rights."" ""Iran must choose,"" he said in a statement late Tuesday. ""We have heard for thirty years what the Iranian government is against; the question, now, is what kind of future it is for. ""It is time for the Iranian government to decide whether it wants to focus on the past, or whether it will make the choices that will open the door to greater opportunity, prosperity, and justice for its people,"" he said. Obama noted how the embassy takeover reshaped U.S.-Iranian relations. ""This event helped set the United States and Iran on a path of sustained suspicion, mistrust, and confrontation,"" he said. ""I have made it clear that the United States of America wants to move beyond this past, and seeks a relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran based upon mutual interests and mutual respect."" Obama said America has demonstrated willingness to work with Iran over nuclear issues by recognizing its right to peaceful nuclear power and accepting a recent proposal by the watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency. ""We have made clear that if Iran lives up to the obligations that every nation has, it will have a path to a more prosperous and productive relationship with the international community,"" Obama said. CNN's Reza Sayah, Sara Mazloumsaki, Mitra Mobasherat, and journalist Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","NEW: Reformist leaders stopped from attending anti-government rallies, Web site says .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- There's an innocence to Jessica Biel, she says. The actress, who has starred in ""The Illusionist"" and ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry,"" wanted to tap into her childlike side for ""Planet 51,"" a new animated film about an Earth astronaut who lands on a faraway planet that has much in common with 1950s America -- except for the aliens. ""I love that kind of throwback to a more of innocent time and a simpler time and more conservative,"" she told CNN. ""There's something just kind of attractive about that, those kinds of qualities to me, and I just thought it would be fun."" ""Planet 51,"" which also features the voice work of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Justin Long and Gary Oldman, opens Friday. Biel sat down with CNN to talk about the film, the challenges of voice work and the difficulty of finding good roles for actresses. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Why did you choose to do something animated? Jessica Biel: I think I chose this part because I'm kind of a kid at heart and I really thought the story was so sweet and fun. ... I wasn't doing anything. I was able to work in town, at home in L.A., which is so rare. CNN: You could probably wear your pajamas to work. Biel: Pretty much. Roll in, no hair and makeup. I just always wanted to be a voice in some great movie where some little girl loves my character. CNN: Did you get to meet [your co-stars] when you were doing the voices? Biel: I never saw them, never met them. I mean, I know Dwayne, I've known Dwayne for a long time. I met Justin before, but I never saw them once. It was such an interesting experience to be there by yourself kind of going through it. But ... it goes fast. You're there, it's fast, it's fun. CNN: Who's your character? Biel: I play Neera, who is this lovely 16-year-old girl. ... She's insecure about boys but also has a sense of confidence for herself, very independent, and is not listening to what the government is saying about this alien [the Earthling] who's landed on her planet. She is standing up on her own two feet, thinking for herself. ... So she's, you know, she's trying to find out who she is as a woman. CNN: You do have a strong female character and it's such a good role model for young girls. Is it hard to find that in films today? Biel: It is. It's very hard. I mean, honestly, it's just rare to find a story about a woman's experience, about a young girl's experience. For some reason nobody wants to make those movies. And it's really hard because there are so many talented women and there are not enough projects for everybody to really blossom and explore. So it's quite competitive because there's a small amount of material. CNN: Is it hard for Hollywood to write those kinds of roles? Biel: I don't know what it is. I'm still trying to decipher that.","Jessica Biel lends her voice to animated film ""Planet 51""

"ONDO, Nigeria (CNN) -- In the dark of the early morning, the assembled drug agents murmur a short prayer before setting out on an early morning drugs raid. A agent torches marijuana plants found in the Nigerian forests but there could be hundreds more farms. After a few short orders, we set off into the deep undergrowth of southern Nigeria's forests on a tip-off that somewhere ahead are hidden farms illegally growing cannabis. ""It's dangerous because some of them have machetes and in the deeper forest they have pump action shotguns that they use,"" explained Gaura Shedow, Nigeria's narcotics commander for Ondo state. Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, or NDLEA, are battling to stop drugs illegally transited through the country, from Latin America and Asia into Europe and the U.S., spilling over into the streets of Nigeria. As we approach the farm, orders go for out for silence and torches out. The agents spill into an opening in the dense forest, and in the red-glow of the rising sun we can make out the unmistakable leaf of the marijuana plant. NDLEA suspects there may be hundreds of farms hidden in the forest - estimating the crop they've found this morning to be about $6,000. Despite NDLEA's efforts the farmers are nowhere to be seen, but Commander Gaura remains practical. ""The people that stay in these farms are not the big people. The big men stay in the cities -- they don't even come to the farmlands."" Nigeria is on the frontline in the global war on drugs -- an international gateway for cocaine from Latin America and heroin from Asia to abusers in Europe and the United States. It's not known exactly how much is transited through Nigeria but NDLEA says last year they seized over 300 tons of narcotics. Focusing primarily on the main transit points -- roads, ports and airports - NDLEA claim to have convicted over 1,800 traffickers. Most of them are Nigerian. ""We do have a big expatriate community of Nigerians in Europe and United States,"" explains Dagmar Thomas at the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime in Nigeria. ""And there is always the danger that these communities are tapped into by organized crime cartels."" We spoke to one man arrested for trying to trafficking cocaine to Europe. A young graduate, he explained how after losing his job in Spain he was tempted by the offer of $5,000 to transport cocaine packets in his stomach. ""When you are swallowing - taking in this thing into your body it's just as if you are signing your death warrant ... but this is what many youths do today just to make a living."" And with low-ranking NDLEA officers paid on average $200 a month corruption within the agency is a key concern. ""Yes, certainly there was a lot -- a lot, I think -- of corruption in the agency,"" explained Ahmadu Giade, the agency's chairman. ""But so long as I continue as chairman of the agency, so long I will continue to dismiss anybody who's involved in corruption -- I will never spare him."" But neither do the drugs. Living under a bridge in Nigeria's over-crowded metropolis, Lagos, Mercy Jon sleeps behind a public toilet with five other people. She prostitutes herself to pay for her cocaine habit. ""Cocaine has destroyed my life - if it was not for the cocaine I'm taking, I would not be in such a place because I'm a learned somebody. My parents spent a lot to make sure I go to school, but because of cocaine I've ruined everything."" Mercy Jon is being helped by one of only a handful of drug rehabilitation centers in Lagos -- Freedom Foundation. But struggling to find funding to cope with the number of addicts, their founder Tony Rapu is seeing a disturbing trend. ""I actually think its increasing -- in the past few years we've seen more cases of heroin and cocaine abuse and in the area of marijuana it's like its getting even more common."" Watching his officers systematically set about cutting and burning the seized cannabis crop Commander Gaura gestures to the flames. ""We prefer to get to the grass roots and cut it down before it gets to the streets."" But with the farmers and drug barons still in hiding Nigeria's drug war is far from over.","Nigerian drug agents patrol southern forests hunting for hidden drug farms .

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN)  -- Three teens accused of setting a 15-year-old friend on fire pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges of attempted murder, a public defender for one of the boys said. Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, and Jesus Mendez, 16, are charged as adults with one count of attempted murder in the second degree in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida. They were arraigned in Broward County Circuit Court before Judge Dale Cohen and are being held without bond. Two other boys ages 13 and 15 have been charged as juveniles. Prosecutors say Jarvis, Bent and Mendez were in a gang that poured alcohol over Michael Brewer, 15, then set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. Brewer jumped into the swimming pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames, witnesses say. Brewer suffered burns over 65 percent of his body. He's reported in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center, where he's been in a private room since the incident. Gordon Weekes, the attorney for Bent, denounced the fact that the teens were charged as adults. ""It's been decided by society that a 15-year-old can't vote, can't join the armed forces and cannot buy alcohol, because society has recognized that children do not have the ability to appreciate the long-term consequences of their actions,"" he said. ""But they can treat them as adults in court, when we have very capable remedies for them in the juvenile justice system, which is geared toward rehabilitation,"" he said. Weekes said he and the other two public defenders plan to make separate motions to the court asking that their clients be allowed to post bond. Detectives say witnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis poured alcohol over him. They said Matthew Bent encouraged the attack. Authorities say Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire, and that he made a ""bad decision,"" according to an arrest transcript. Detectives with the Broward County Sheriff's Office have been unable to interview Brewer. Until last week, he had been on a ventilator to keep him alive. ""We hope that we can maybe get a statement this week,"" said sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal. ""Detectives have been waiting for him to recover to the point where he's strong enough to give us a complete statement,"" he said. Doctors say Brewer is improving but his condition is tenuous because of the severity of his burns and the possibility of infections. Most of his burns are on his back and buttocks; his face and hands were largely spared, doctors say. Brewer's doctor told CNN the teen faces several more months in the hospital and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries. ""They still have to perform several operations on him for skin grafting, but his parents are with him all the time,"" said Lorraine Nelson, a hospital spokeswoman. ""I don't tell him what happened,"" Brewer's mother, Valerie, told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV. ""I just tell him he's in the hospital and he's safe and he's getting better. ""And he'll say, 'Am I going to be OK?' And I say 'Yes, Michael. You're going to be fine. You're going to be just fine,' "" she said. Investigators believe Brewer owed Bent $40 for a video game. When Brewer did not pay, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle, police say. When Brewer reported him to the police, Bent was arrested. The next day, the group surrounded Brewer. The five boys called Brewer ""a snitch"" and set him on fire, witnesses said. The Brewer family told WFOR that none of the families of the accused boys have tried to contact them, but it doesn't matter. ""We can't focus on it. They'll get theirs is all we can say. I don't focus on it,"" Michael Brewer's father, also named Michael, told WFOR. If convicted they could face up to 30 years in prison. A court-appointed psychologist who has examined two of the five boys told CNN they are competent to take part in legal proceedings and assist their attorney. ""I can describe both of them as being afraid, being fearful,"" said forensic psychologist Michael Brannon, who did not identify the boys. ""I can describe both of them as being tearful at various times during the interview, especially when talking about the specific incident which led to the injuries of the victim,"" he said. Psychologists are often brought into cases involving teenagers and young adults to judge their mental capabilities and determine their competency to proceed. Psychologists also must evaluate whether the defendants can talk about what happened and communicate effectively with defense attorneys. ""I don't think they expected to have happened, what happened,"" Brannon said. ""It's a horrible event that occurred, but this was not their conceptualization, in my opinion, of what was going to happen.""","NEW: Attorney denounces charging teens as adults, will seek bond .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Tibetan exile leaders, meeting in northern India to debate a potential new approach to Tibet's decades-long struggle for autonomy, have voted to stay with the Dalai Lama's current ""middle way approach,"" according to a spokesman for the spiritual leader. Some have sought Tibet's independence from China, but the Dalai Lama has sought autonomy. ""The majority of the people have spoken and have requested his holiness the Dalai Lama to continue with his middle way approach,"" said spokesman Tenzin Taklha. The meeting was called after the Dalai Lama acknowledged he had failed in his efforts to convince China to restore the territory's autonomy. He did not attend the week-long conference in Dharamsala, a town in the hills of north India where he lives in exile. He called the meeting, he said, to offer the exiles an opportunity to discuss ""the best possible future course of action"" for Tibet. Takhla said the Tibetans demonstrated that the Dalai Lama was their undisputed leader, and they hoped China would recognize him as such and negotiations toward a realistic solution could be held. There was a small minority who said they wanted to demand Tibet's independence, Takhla said. The ""middle way"" approach with Beijing is one in which Tibetans want a level of autonomy that will allow them to protect and preserve their culture, religion and national identity. In exchange, China could continue to claim Tibet as part of its territory. Some in Tibet have advocated independence from China, but the Dalai Lama has long called for genuine autonomy. Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government, but the Dalai Lama and others have said they favor real autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in China.  Learn about Tibet's history of conflict Â» . The resentment spilled over in March, when Buddhist monks initiated peaceful anti-Chinese protests in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. The demonstrations began March 14, the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Beijing's rule that sent the Dalai Lama into exile. The protests soon turned violent, with demonstrators burning vehicles and shops. Some protesters advocated independence from China, while others demonstrated against the growing influence of the Han Chinese in Tibet and other regions of China with ethnic Tibetan populations. The subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead, according to the Chinese government. Tibet's self-proclaimed government-in-exile put the death toll from the protests at 140. China blamed the Dalai Lama and his followers for the March riots -- a charge he has consistently denied.","Tibetan exile leaders back Dalai Lama's current ""middle way approach""

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Schuett's search for the man who snatched her from her bed when she was 8, sexually assaulted her and left her for dead on top of an ant hill ended Tuesday with the arrest of a suspect. Jennifer Schuett, 27, was abducted and left for dead at age 8. A suspect was arrested Tuesday. Now begins another chapter in Schuett's 19-year quest for justice. Standing in front of the television cameras, Jennifer Schuett blinked back tears. ""This is a huge day for me,"" she later told CNN over the phone. ""And I want to see this through the end. The rest will come out during the trial."" Schuett, 27, joined a multi-agency team of investigators in her hometown of Dickinson, Texas, as they announced the arrest earlier in the day of Dennis Earl Bradford, a 40-year-old welder, in Little Rock, Arkansas. The arrest came after new DNA testing and other evidence made it possible to identify Bradford as the suspect. Schuett's boyfriend and two police investigators who kept the case alive stood beside her. Fighting tears, she thanked them for their support. ""Throughout this journey, I've had two main goals,"" she said. ""And they were to find the man who kidnapped, sexually assaulted and attempted to murder me 19 years ago so that he could not hurt anyone else. And to use my voice in telling my story to as many people as I possibly could over the years in hopes that I may encourage other victims of violent crimes to stand up and speak out against criminals.""  Watch Schuett explain why she's speaking out Â» . She continued, ""Today, I can say very proudly that I have accomplished both of these goals."" Schuett spoke with CNN two weeks ago about her 1990 ordeal. CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assaults. But Schuett decided to go public with her story and her name to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker. Schuett was in her bed when a man crept in through a window on August 10, 1990. She remembers waking up in a stranger's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot. She said he told her he was an undercover cop and knew her family. He drove her through the streets of Dickinson, pulling into an overgrown field where, she said, he sexually assaulted her. She passed out. When she regained consciousness, she was lying on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed and her voice box torn. She spent about 14 hours in the field before she was found and rushed to the hospital in critical condition. ""Three days after the attack, I started giving a description. The doctors told me I would never be able to talk again, but I proved them all wrong,"" Schuett said. She believes she got her voice back so she could tell her story. At the news conference, a driver's license photo of the suspect was shown next to the 1990 sketch based on her description. There was a clear resemblance.  Watch the sketch artist's memories of Schuett Â» . Shauna Dunlap, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Houston office, said Bradford lived in North Little Rock, with his wife and two children -- a boy, 12, and a girl, 15. He also has three adult stepchildren. Bradford worked as a welder for United Fence in North Little Rock. A company representative said Bradford had been working there for 10 years and was a ""good guy"" who had mended ""his old ways"" and ""changed his life."" He wouldn't go into specifics about what those ""old ways"" were. Court documents give some indication. In 1996, Bradford was accused of kidnapping, sexually assaulting and cutting the throat of a female victim. He was initially charged with attempt to commit first-degree murder, but prosecutors amended the charges to rape and kidnapping. A Garland County Circuit Court jury found him guilty of kidnapping but was not able reach a verdict on the rape charges. Arkansas corrections officials said he entered prison in March 1997, facing a 12-year-sentence, and was paroled in February 2000. Investigators also found Bradford lived slightly more than two miles from Schuett's residence and just a mile and a half from where she was found, according to an affidavit released Tuesday. ""It's truly a rare occasion when we have the opportunity to prosecute a case like this,"" said Galveston County District Attorney Kurt Sistrunk. His office is charging Bradford with attempted capital murder. ""Jennifer has been a tremendous asset to this investigation from the beginning, an inspiration to all of us, and we are going to be very proud to have Jennifer by our side as we continue with our efforts to seek justice for you in the courtroom,"" said Sistrunk. The break in the case came after FBI agent Richard Rennison and Dickinson police Detective Tim Cromie persuaded the FBI's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) team to get involved. ""The main reason the CARD team picked this case was because she was alive,"" Rennison said. ""In cases of child abduction, it is rare that the child is recovered alive. Frequently, you recover a body. And most times, you never find them."" In March 2008, the investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago -- the underwear and pajamas Schuett was wearing, as well as a man's underwear and T-shirt, which were found in the field where Schuett was left for dead. The clothes had been tested in 1990, but the sample wasn't large enough for conclusive results. But newer techniques allow DNA to be isolated from a single human cell. The FBI lab recently informed Rennison that the DNA in the man's underwear matched Bradford's DNA profile. He was entered into the database after the 1997 kidnapping conviction in Arkansas. Bradford was arrested on Tuesday morning on his way to work. He awaits extradition to Texas.

"GENEVA, Switzerland (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama called on Iran to provide the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency with ""unfettered"" access to the newly disclosed Qom uranium enrichment site, and Tehran's nuclear negotiator said the country would cooperate with inspectors. President Obama said Iran must provide inspectors with ""unfettered"" access to the new site within two weeks. Iran says it plans to cooperate ""fully"" and ""immediately"" with the U.N. nuclear agency and will invite representatives of the body to visit its newly revealed uranium enrichment facility ""soon,"" said Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief. The IAEA has confirmed a trip to Iran by Director General Mohamed ElBaradei would take place soon, but no specific date has been announced. A senior U.S. official speaking on background told reporters that ElBaradei's trip to Tehran could come as early as this weekend. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, said ""transparency is not something new"" for the Islamic republic's nuclear program. ""Iran has committed itself to follow all the obligations and the like,"" Jalili said, speaking through a translator provided by the Iranian delegation in Geneva. ""What I want to emphasize is that our cooperation with the agency and the way we look specifically regarding to nuclear energy is that we believe that nuclear warheads are illegitimate and no country should have these kind of weapons."" He said nuclear energy for peaceful purposes ""is the right of every sovereign state and country.""  Watch more from the Jalili interview Â» . There were a number of developments at a meeting Thursday in Geneva between Iran and world powers over Iran's nuclear program; Solana said the meeting ""represented the start of what we hope will be an intensive process."" ""I and all the representatives of the six countries were united in underlining the importance of fully transparency and of rebuilding confidence through practical steps. In the course of the day, we had both plenary meetings and bilateral discussions allowing for detailed exchanges on all issues,"" Solana said. The meeting occurred on the heels of the recent revelation that Iran was building a second uranium enrichment facility near the city of Qom, a dramatic development that jacked up tension between Iran and international powers. International powers have threatened more sanctions if the Islamic republic doesn't change its ways. At a news conference Thursday after the talks, Solana said International Atomic Energy Agency experts are expected to visit the facility near Qom ""within the next couple of weeks."" IAEA spokesman Gill Tudor said Director General Mohamed ElBaradei ""has been invited to Tehran by Iranian authorities. He will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters."" Solana confirmed that world powers and Iran will hold another round of talks before the end of the month, but it is not known where or exactly when. ""An agenda for that meeting will be worked out through diplomatic channels. It will focus on nuclear issues, including proposals previously put forward by both sides. It will also deal with global issues that any of the parties wish to address,"" Solana said. Solana also said the world powers and Iran agreed in principle ""that low-enriched uranium produced in Iran would be transported to third countries for further enrichment and fabrication into fuel assemblies for the Tehran research reactor, which produces isotopes for medical applications."" Details will be worked out at the next meeting, Solana said. The senior U.S. official told reporters that the enrichment would happen in Russia. ""The potential advantage of this, if it's implemented, is that it would significantly reduce Iran's [low-enriched uranium] stockpile which itself is a source of anxiety in the Middle East and elsewhere,"" the senior U.S. official told reporters in a briefing Thursday. Jalili, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, noted at a news conference Thursday that the parties hope to reach a framework for future talks. The Geneva talks also featured a proposal for Iran to send its enriched uranium to a third country for final processing to ensure that it would be used for medical purposes, rather than a nuclear weapons program. Of the third-party enrichment proposal, Obama said it might be ""a step towards building confidence that Iran's [nuclear] program is, in fact, peaceful."" The president said Thursday in Washington that he expected to see ""swift action"" by Iran on the steps outlined in the Geneva talks.  Watch Obama demand transparency Â» . ""This is a constructive beginning, but hard work lies ahead,"" Obama said, noting that an ""intensive period"" of negotiations with Iran will be occurring. ""Talk is no substitute for action,"" Obama said in urging Iran to take the necessary steps to meet its obligations under international non-proliferation agreements. ""This is about the global non-proliferation regime and Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy,"" Obama said. Iran participated in the talks along with the EU, Germany and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China. Top officials from the United States and Iran huddled on the margins of the Geneva talks on Iran's nuclear program. Jalili met with William J. Burns, the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs who was leading the U.S. delegation, a senior U.S. official and a diplomatic source confirmed. The men discussed the nuclear program, a sit-down described as the first face-to-face meeting over the Iran's nuclear program. The diplomatic source, who characterized the meeting as ""serious and frank,"" said world powers are pushing for a date for International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to examine the nuclear facility in Qom.  See a map of Iran's nuclear sites Â» . They also discussed human rights issues, including detained Americans in Iran. Among those held in Iranian custody are three hikers who strayed from Iraqi territory into Iran. The sources would talk only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing discussions with Iran. ""They certainly are historical talks,"" said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security and a former weapons inspector. ""For the United States and Iran to sit down finally and start to talk about the significant differences between the two countries is extremely important, and I think it's long overdue.""  Watch commentators on concerns over Iran's nuclear program Â» . The existence of the second uranium enrichment facility prompted Obama and the leaders of Britain and France to publicly chide the Islamic republic last week at the G-20 summit in Pittsburgh and threaten further sanctions. Iran claims that its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes, but many in the international community have accused the country of trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability.

"(CNN) -- The two people who died and the 19 others who fell ill at a central Arizona resort after spending time in a sauna-like ""sweatbox"" were attending a program by self-help expert James Arthur Ray, authorities said Saturday. Two people died and were 19 injured after spending up to two hours inside this ""sweatbox"" at an Arizona resort. The dead were identified as James Shore of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Kirby Brown of Westtown, New York, Sheriff Lloyd Waugh told reporters. They were among the 50 or so visitors at the Angel Valley Resort near Sedona attending Ray's ""Spiritual Warrior"" program. Nineteen others were treated for injuries sustained in the sweatbox, a dome-like structure covered with tarps and blankets. Hot rocks and water are used to create steam in the enclosed environment. Waugh said investigators are looking into evidence that ""may turn this into a criminal prosecution."" Investigators are looking into similar events held previously in other locations by Ray, who refused to speak with officers at the scene, Waugh said. A follow-up interview is expected to happen. Ray's publicist, Howard Bragman, did not immediately return calls from CNN on Saturday. Ray posted a noted late Friday on his Twitter page, saying: ""I'm shocked & saddened by the tragedy occurring in Sedona. My deep heartfelt condolences to family & friends of those who lost their lives."" On Saturday he posted another message, saying he's ""spending the weekend in prayer and meditation for all involved in this difficult time; and I ask you to join me in doing the same."" The self-help guru is widely known for his programs that claim to teach individuals to create wealth through all aspects of their lives -- financially, mentally, physically and spiritually. Ray, whose company is based in Carlsbad, California, has appeared on a variety of national programs, including CNN's ""Larry King Live."" In that appearance, Ray was about to address 3,000 people in Phoenix, Arizona. Asked what he thinks about critics of his teachings, Ray told King: . ""Well, you know, it's interesting, Larry, because any time a new idea comes to the fore, it goes through three phases. It's first ridiculed. Then it's violently opposed. And then it's finally accepted as self-evident, normally after the opposition dies."" Angel Valley Resort advertises itself as ""a place to relax and heal ... where powerful earth energies are present and active."" It was founded in April 2002 by Michael and Amayra Hamilton, both of whom are teachers and counselors there. The resort is on 70 secluded valley acres 20 minutes from Sedona, surrounded by thousands of acres of national forest, according to the Web site. It has Internal Revenue Service nonprofit status as a religious organization, its Web site says. ""There are twenty marked vortexes and angel sites to experience connection with Earth and spirit, deep relaxation, and balancing,"" an online brochure says. ""Angel Valley offers two labyrinths and an Angel Wheel for going inward, finding answers and getting insights."" No information about the sweat lodge could be found on the Web site Saturday morning, and numerous internal links were not functioning. The use of sweat lodges for spiritual and physical cleansing is a part of several Native American tribes' cultures. A traditional Native American sweat lodge is a small dome-like structure made up of willow branches carefully tied together and covered in canvas. Rocks are heated in a nearby fire pit and placed inside the lodge, and water is poured over them to create steam. ""We are curious to find out what happened there,"" Richard Moreno, a member of Pira Manso Pueblo tribe, told KPHO-TV. ""I've been participating in the sweat lodge since the age of 3 and I've never recalled being sick from being in the sweat lodge."" Moreno told the station he has never been to a lodge that held more than 20 people.

"(CNN) -- His father and uncle fall to the ground, crying uncontrollably. After 11 years of not knowing, relief of finding a child they thought had been lost forever pours out of them. Christian Norris is reunited with his uncle and grandmother in Beijing. That child is Christian Norris -- he's 17 now and he stood there unmoved as his father and uncle wept; perhaps because to him both men are distant memories. ""I don't really remember my dad that much,"" Christian said quietly ""I just remember my uncle, who raised me much of the time."" His low-key, almost stone-faced demeanor was in stark contrast to his father Jin Gaoke. ""There are no words to describe the joy I felt when I saw him. He is like a piece of flesh from my own body."" His uncle Jin Xiaowang chimes in. ""The hair on his arms makes him look American, he has lots of hair on his arms."" Christian set this day in motion three years ago when he asked his adopted mother Julia Norris to find his Chinese family; a search from Maryland in the United States, to a remote village in central China, which would eventually involve hundreds of China's savvy Internet users. Despite her background as a federal and private investigator and her work on the TV show ""America's Most Wanted,"" Julia's search kept proving fruitless. Police and orphanage records were incomplete and Christian's memories were vague. ""The first obstacle was that I was focusing on the wrong province. He remembered being from Shanxi province ... and he remembered the name of (his) village as Dongjiagou, and so I searched and searched."" Both the village name and the province were wrong -- Julia was looking in the wrong place hundreds of miles to the east.  Watch the emotional reunion Â» . Everything changed in April this year when she contacted lawyer Zhang Zhiwei, who works with volunteers in China, reuniting lost children with the parents. ""Based on Jiacheng's (Christian's) memories we did some analysis, like his eating habits,"" Zhang said. ""He likes vinegar, which should be in northern China and close to Shanxi. He also likes garlic ... and from his memory his family grew potato and corn, which gave us a hint of the region he used to live."" But the search really took off after Zhang posted a blog. ""When I posted the story many Chinese netizens were also moved by the selfless love and actively participated, providing as much detail as possible, all hoping to fulfill her dream of finding her son's hometown,"" he said. Through their Internet searches the netizens discovered that Christian's birth parents were doctors and tracked them down to a city called Longde in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region through a medical essay they had written. But Christian's birth parents weren't who he remembered; for the first six years of his life he had been raised by his uncle Jin Xiaowang -- always thinking he was his father. ""My older brother wanted to have two children, an older one and a younger one. They broke the one-child policy. They were afraid it might affect their jobs (and) they brought him (Christian) to me once he was born,"" Jin said. So Christian grew up in a poor village called Donggou. When he was 6 years old his uncle says he was sent away to school in the city to live with his birth parents, but was told they were a foster family. After just a few months, Christian wanted to return to the village, so his father put him on a bus, and that was the last his family saw of him. Details are vague and records incomplete, but it could have been up to a year later when police found him hundreds of miles away from his home, then took him to a nearby orphanage in Luoyang, Henan Province. The orphanage and the place they found him were in the same city. That's where he was adopted by Julia, who was doing volunteer work there. ""When I found out that the birth family actually lost him at a crowded bus station and did not mean to relinquish him, my heart was broken for both Christian and the family. It was just sad."" Christian still has much to talk about with his Chinese family, ""but I'm pretty clear that I wasn't abandoned."" But simply talking won't be easy -- he's forgotten how to speak Mandarin, and his birth relatives don't speak English. But this is just for a few days in China before returning to the U.S. where he has lived most of his life. His Chinese relatives all say they respect his decision about where to live but hope that just maybe he will want to stay. ""He has grown taller, he has grown bigger, but inside Chinese blood is still flowing in his veins,"" said his birth father Jin Gaoke.","Christian asked his adopted mother to find his Chinese family three years ago .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The news on the housing market continues to be bleak as bleak can be. In just one example, the January numbers from the Case-Shiller index -- a popular collection of data about repeat sales of single-family homes -- show that home values in Phoenix are down almost 50 percent from their peak in July 2006. Clark Howard has bought several foreclosures over the years and has his eye on another. There are similarly dismal numbers in Las Vegas and Miami (both down more than 40 percent) and San Francisco and San Diego (both down 40 percent). But you've got to realize that housing stats are skewed by bubble markets such as these, where people were trying to get rich quick on someone else's money. Yet still, sometimes you can be left feeling like there's no good news in all of this. Well, I have some for you. Half of all home purchases in February were by first-time homebuyers, according to The Financial Times of London. Those buyers were taking advantage of incredible interest rates and low housing prices, not to mention new tax incentives for first-time homebuyers. How about you? If you want to get in the game, you've got to look REO -- and I'm not talking about the classic rock band REO Speedwagon! REO stands for real-estate owned property. It's where you buy directly from the bank after they foreclose on a property. Banks are notoriously bad property managers. It's not uncommon for them to let a property go unloved and neglected for several months. Before long, the property starts looking like a haunted house on Halloween. The grass is unkempt, the shutters are falling off and windows may be broken. That's when you can really swoop in and steal a deal. I've bought a number of foreclosures over the years. My most recent purchase was last year, but I'm thinking about buying another foreclosure I saw while filming with my HLN show crew.  Watch Clark finding a bank-owned bargain Â» . I'm particularly a fan of houses that smell! The odors can usually be eliminated very easily. But buyers are quickly turned off by a stinky house, and that means I can really underbid on my offer. If you want to start looking for REOs in a specific part of town, try finding a real estate agent who farms that area. You can also try searching the web by visiting sites such as HUD.gov, HomeSales.gov, EmailForeclosures.com and Trulia.com. When searching for foreclosures or distressed property in the single-family home market, be on the lookout for several things: an established neighborhood that's 10 years or older; a neighborhood that is mostly owner-occupied; and a house that is structurally sound with cosmetic damage only. My rule of thumb has always been that you want to buy 20 percent below fair market value for homes and 30 percent below fair market value for condos. Speaking of condos, the condo market in particular has a lot of hazards. When you buy a condo, you're buying an obligation and a commitment in a condo association. Do not buy in a building that has been recently constructed. You want to look for established condo buildings that have been there six years or longer. With established buildings, you know that most people are paying their condo fees. And finally, remember that foreclosures and REOs are just part of a larger category of ""people problem"" houses. These are the kinds of houses that sit on the market as wounded ducks because the owners endured job loss, divorce, relocation or any other of a host of troubling scenarios. The real key to finding a deal is to know the local market conditions where you're buying. Go after the properties that are REOs for 45 days or longer. Lenders are usually unrealistic about the pricing of properties on their books for about the first 6 weeks. Remember, out of adversity comes great opportunity.","Half of all home purchases in February were by first-time homebuyers .

"New York (CNN) -- More than 80 Michael Jackson collectibles -- including the late pop star's famous rhinestone-studded glove from a 1983 performance -- were auctioned off Saturday, reaping a total $2 million. Profits from the auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York's Times Square crushed pre-sale expectations of only $120,000 in sales. The highly prized memorabilia, which included items spanning the many stages of Jackson's career, came from more than 30 fans, associates and family members, who contacted Julien's Auctions to sell their gifts and mementos of the singer. Jackson's flashy glove was the big-ticket item of the night, fetching $420,000 from a buyer in Hong Kong, China. Jackson wore the glove at a 1983 performance during ""Motown 25,"" an NBC special where he debuted his revolutionary moonwalk. Fellow Motown star Walter ""Clyde"" Orange of the Commodores, who also performed in the special 26 years ago, said he asked for Jackson's autograph at the time, but Jackson gave him the glove instead. ""The legacy that [Jackson] left behind is bigger than life for me,"" Orange said. ""I hope that through that glove people can see what he was trying to say in his music and what he said in his music."" Orange said he plans to give a portion of the proceeds to charity. Hoffman Ma, who bought the glove on behalf of Ponte 16 Resort in Macau, paid a 25 percent buyer's premium, which was tacked onto all final sales over $50,000. Winners of items less than $50,000 paid a 20 percent premium. Darren Julien, president and CEO of Julien's Auctions, said people were hungry for such tokens of Jackson's life, as evidenced by the 3,500 who registered as bidders for the auction. ""Michael was very generous,"" Julien said. ""If you were friends with Michael Jackson or an important part of his life, occasionally he would give something away, and that's a very big reason that these things got out in the public."" A signature black synthetic blend jacket from Jackson's 16-month Bad World Tour, his first concert tour as a solo artist, sold for $270,000. Featuring black straps with silver buckles and zippers, the jacket came to symbolize Jackson's ""Bad"" era. Tori Renza, whose father bought her the Bad jacket when she was just 4 years old, said she grew up singing and dancing to Jackson's songs around her house. ""It just became part of our family,"" said Renza, who planned to use the money from the auction to pay back student loans. Jackson's famed fedora, which he sported at the 1995 MTV Music Awards, sold for $73,800. It was one of three hats Jackson wore during a 10-minute medley before hurling it into the crowd. The hat was auctioned at a charity event that year, and the letter of verification is signed ""Lisa Marie Presley Jackson,"" the daughter of Elvis Presley who was married to Jackson for nearly two years. ""To my knowledge, there were not a lot of letters that she signed with her full name,"" Julien said. Handwritten lyrics of the 1983 smash hit ""Beat It,"" which Jackson scribbled on a piece of white paper, went for $60,000. One of the more bizarre items up for bidding, an upper mold used to fit Jackson with animal fangs for the 1983 video for ""Thriller,"" sold for more than $10,000. The auction also allowed the world to see photographs of Jackson engaged in simple activities, like driving. His 1985 Mercedes-Benz 500 SEL, which he ultimately gave to an aunt as a birthday gift, was auctioned for $104,500. ""What's even more significant is that we have photos of Michael driving the car,"" Julien said. ""When have you seen Michael driving a car? He was always chauffeured or driven."" There were also a number of autographed photos, as well as signed books, collectibles and artwork. Even Jackson's doodles and sketches of the likes of Frankenstein, Mickey Mouse and Charlie Chaplin were up for sale. Lee Tompkins, a renowned pencil artist who said he came to know Jackson in the early 1980s and owns approximately 75 of Jackson's artworks, auctioned two of Jackson's pieces: one of a vagabond and the other of Charlie Chaplin. They sold for $20,000 and $33,280 respectively. ""He's more than just a singer and dancer. He was an artist first,"" Thompkins said. Before Saturday's auction, the items were exhibited in Santiago, Chile; Dublin, Ireland; and Tokyo, Japan, where crowds lined up for hours get a glimpse of them, Julien said. ""Michael Jackson is looking down and has to be happy,"" he said after the auction, adding, ""We lost an icon.""","Among items auctioned Saturday: jacket, song lyrics, sketches, dental mold .

"TAMPA, Florida (CNN) -- Some Florida minimum-security inmates want to know: Can you handle the heat? Inmates work with peppers at the Hillsborough County Jail in Tampa, Florida. Hot sauce heat, that is -- Jail House Fire Hot Sauce, cooked up by inmates at the Hillsborough County Jail and now offered for sale. The idea to make Jail House Fire Hot Sauce came from a Cuban former inmate who thought food in the big house was bland. Allen Boatman, the head of the jail's horticulture program, remembers what his former trusty said: ""We're growing these peppers. Why don't we use them?"" Peppers are grown as part of the jail's horticulture program, which is voluntary and offered only to minimum-security trusties. The inmates learn about growing plants, ornamentals, trees, herbs and vegetables -- including more than 1,200 varieties of peppers. ""I thought that was a great idea, so I started doing research on some of the recipes,"" says Boatman. The research led to a variety of hot sauces that can be bought for $7 a bottle at the jail in Tampa, Florida, or online at www.jailhousefire.org. There are three different sauces for sale: . Coming soon is a fourth sauce: Misdemeanor.  Watch the inmates at work on hot sauce Â» . Orders for the Jail House Fire sauces have come in from as far away as Germany, England and even Australia. The inmates make no money from this product. The money goes back into an inmate fund that pays for things like the greenhouse where the peppers are grown. The horticulture program pays for itself, says Boatman, so no taxpayer money is used. Several times a year the program hosts a sale of its ornamentals, shrubs and trees, and the locals turn up to support the program. The money raised is used to purchase necessities like fertilizer and soil. A green thumb is not the only thing that inmate and program member Deline is developing, he says. ""We learn a lot about professionalism, respect, teamwork, ya know -- all that helps,"" Deline says. And working in the fields is good for the inmates' self-worth, Boatman says. ""They actually see something growing that they've been involved in. It gives them a lot of sense of pride and accomplishment,"" says Boatman. ""Possibly that'll give them some momentum when they are released to go and get a job and start being a productive member of society."" Boatman doesn't just wish his trusties a good future; he gives them an opportunity. When the inmates are released, they are given a certificate of completion in vocational horticulture.

"(CNN) -- World champion race driver Jenson Button has joined the McLaren Formula One team, McLaren announced Wednesday. The jump to powerhouse McLaren -- already the home of previous world champion Lewis Hamilton -- creates the first team to start a season with the two previous world champions racing together, McLaren said. British media reports said the deal was worth $30 million over three years. Both Button, 29, and Hamilton, 24, are British. Button visited McLaren headquarters earlier this month as he was being lured to the team, he said in a statement Wednesday. ""It wasn't simply the technical resources and the incredible standards of excellence that impressed me,"" Button said. ""I was equally struck by the ambition, the motivation and the winning spirit that flow through everybody there. And then there's the team's epic history: put it this way, the trophy cabinets seem to stretch for miles."" The Guardian newspaper reported that Button's former team, Brawn GP, offered to double Button's salary to keep the driver for 2010, but the terms were rejected. News of the decision coincides with an official announcement from German carmaker Mercedes-Benz that their allegiance has moved from McLaren to Brawn; the current champion constructors will compete under the Mercedes banner next season. Button's switch comes after news that former world champion Kimi Raikkonen will not race in Formula One in 2010, after failing to secure a team. The Finn's manager, David Robertson, told the BBC he had been trying to secure a deal with McLaren for the former Ferrari driver but the offer had not been enough for the 30-year-old to sign. It seems Raikkonen will now turn his attention to the World Rally Championship instead: ""It wasn't in his interests to race for what [McLaren] were offering so he's going to go rallying,"" Robertson said.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haitian police shot and killed a man they suspected of stealing rice in earthquake-ravaged Port-au-Prince on Thursday, leaving his body on the sidewalk for hours as his family mourned. The dead man's mother identified him as Gentile Cherie, a 20-year-old carpenter. A companion with him was wounded, and a third man nearby was hit by what he said was a stray bullet. Witnesses said no one was looting at the time. Josef Josnain, the owner of a shop near the city's airport, said the five bags of rice the men were found with fell from a truck and passers-by picked them up. And Cherie's wounded companion, who did not give his name, said a truck driver gave them the rice. ""A truck stopped and we jumped on, and the driver gave us the rice as a gift,"" he said. ""But the cops shot us."" A CNN crew spotted police stopping the two men Thursday afternoon. They stopped to film the arrests, but while they were getting out of the car, they heard four gunshots and saw the men on the ground. Both had been shot in the back. A third man, Auxilus Maxo, was wounded by a stray bullet near the scene. He told CNN he was hit in the side while waiting for a bus -- after applying for a job as a police officer. Marc Justin, a senior police officer in the area, said he would investigate the killing and said there was no shoot-to-kill order for suspected looters. ""Nobody can do this in any country,"" Justin said. ""Even if somebody was stealing a bag of rice, nobody has a right to do this."" Justin said he had called for an ambulance for the wounded man, but none appeared. Instead, the man was picked up by members of the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSTAH who happened on the scene after the shooting. Shopkeepers retrieved the rice left behind. CNN sought comment from the Haitian government about Thursday's incident. There was no immediate response.          Twitter updates    l     Full coverage . Sporadic looting has broken out in Port-au-Prince, where relief workers have struggled to get food, water and medical aid into the hands of survivors of last week's magnitude 7.0 earthquake. Reports of police firing on looters have surfaced as well, but CNN has been unable to independently confirm them. The Haitian National Police have been criticized for alleged abuses for years. A 2009 report by Human Rights Watch criticized its officers for the use of ""excessive and indiscriminate force,"" including involvement in kidnappings, torture and arbitrary arrests. Meanwhile, the force ""is largely ineffective in preventing and investigating crime,"" it found.  List of missing, found in Haiti .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A federal judge on Monday ruled against a Web site operator who was seeking to publish an encyclopedia about the Harry Potter series of novels, blocking publication of ""The Harry Potter Lexicon"" after concluding that it would cause author J.K. Rowling ""irreparable injury."" Steven Vander Ark speaks to the media outside the U.S. District Court on April 15, 2008 in New York City. U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson awarded Rowling and her publisher $6,750 in statutory damages and permanently blocked publication of the reference guide. Harry Potter fan Steven Vander Ark sought to publish the book, a reference guide to the Harry Potter series, through a small Michigan-based publishing house called RDR Books. Vander Ark operates a Web site called ""Harry Potter Lexicon."" Rowling sued RDR Books in 2007 to stop publication of material from Vander Ark's Web site. Vander Ark and RDR Books claimed the book should not be blocked from publication because it was protected by the ""fair use"" doctrine, which allows for commentary and critique of literary works. Patterson, in his ruling, said the defendants failed to demonstrate fair use. Rowling issued a statement after Monday's ruling, saying, ""I took no pleasure at all in bringing legal action and am delighted that this issue has been resolved favorably."" Vander Ark did not immediately return calls from CNN on Monday. ""We are obviously disappointed with the result, and RDR is considering all of its options, including an appeal,"" attorney David S. Hammer said. Rowling, who said she has long planned to publish her own encyclopedia, and Warner Brothers Entertainment, producer of the Potter films, filed suit to stop RDR from publishing the book.

"(CNN) -- A controversial policy that limits the amount of time NATO troops can hold Afghan detainees is under review by U.S. Defense Department officials, a spokesman for the department told CNN. The review of what's known as the ""96-hour rule"" is under way as CNN questioned whether the policy was putting soldiers in danger. Under the rule, NATO troops have 96 hours to either turn over detainees to Afghan authorities or release them -- a rule put in effect to avoid Abu Ghraib-like offenses. ""We are currently reviewing the 96-hour rule, but have yet to make decisions about how we wish to proceed in light of some of the obvious problems associated with it,"" Geoff Morrell, deputy assistant secretary of defense, told CNN in a statement. ""As soon as we have something concrete to say about our way ahead with respect to this aspect of detainee operations, we will of course share it with the Afghan government, our allies in the fight and, of course, the public at large."" NATO forces fighting in Afghanistan have operated under the 96-hour rule since December 2005. But soldiers interviewed by CNN said it could put them in danger because it forces them to release detainees in a short time span. The rule, contained in a directive outlining International Security Assistance Force detention policies, resulted from consultations with U.S. military and Afghan commanders, said James Appathurai, spokesman for NATO. CNN's Abbie Boudreau's blog: At the 96th hour . ""We have to balance the requirement for protecting our soldiers with the reality that Afghanistan is a sovereign country, that there must be limits on the time we can detain Afghans before handing them over to Afghan authorities,"" Appathurai said. ""The Afghan authorities can also talk with detainees to extract information. It is not as though the interrogation needs to end when we hand them over to the Afghan authorities."" Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of U.S. Central Command, however, said he was not convinced that 96 hours was enough time -- particularly for high-value targets. ""Ninety-six hours is not enough if you are going to ensure that they stay behind bars, obviously,"" he told CNN after a question and answer session in Atlanta. ""Again, there has to be a process by which the individuals that need to be detained are detained, or that if they're handed off to Afghan officials that there's confidence in the system working."" Appathurai announced the rule in December 2005. At CNN's request, NATO compiled statistics on what has happened to detainees since the agency began keeping such records in 2006. Under the 96-hour rule, about one in four detainees has been released. U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who was in Afghanistan last year and who is a colonel in the Air Force Reserve, said the rule puts soldiers in danger. ""The one story I hear told over and over and over again [is] 'Senator Graham, this policy makes no sense. It is putting our folks at risk for no higher purpose. It needs to change,'"" Graham said. ""So the level of frustration is now turning to anger, and quite frankly, here's what's going to start happening -- we're going to take less prisoners. They're going to start shooting these folks."" Graham said he is not satisfied about how the rule was first implemented. ""I've been asking for months now, 'Who the hell made this rule up? Why did you pick 96 hours versus 80 hours or a hundred hours? What's the source document? What analysis went into whether or not this is an effective tool to deal with problems that we have in Afghanistan?'"" he said. ""I can't get anyone to tell me how this thing was formed, whose idea it was and how it became policy."" The case of Roger Hill, a former Army captain who received a general discharge for his role in the questioning of 12 detainees, prompted CNN's investigation of the 96-hour rule. Those 12 men had worked on his base in Afghanistan, including one who was his trusted interpreter. Hill was the commander in charge of the Wardak Province in eastern Afghanistan for much of 2008. He said he feared the enemy was tracking his every move and suspected an inside threat. ""Out of a 90-man company, we had 30 wounded, to include two killed in action,"" he said. He told CNN that his headquarters sent a team to the base to detect possible spies. The team screened cell phone activity to find out which Afghan civilians working on the base might be working for the Taliban. ""It turned out that it wasn't just one or two or three, but we actually had a full dozen,"" Hill said. Hill's trusted interpreter was one of them. Angry and frustrated that the interpreter might be sabotaging missions, Hill detained all 12 men in a small building on the base. When he took the men in the building, the 96-hour countdown began. The rule is designed to give the Afghan government control over detainees and avoid abuses like what happened at the Iraqi prison Abu Ghraib in Baghdad. But Hill said the rule does not work, and many times dangerous suspects are released because there's not enough time to gather evidence. The other problem, he said, was that the evidence against the 12 men was too sensitive to hand over to the Afghans. Hill was ordered not to share classified intelligence with the Afghans for fear it could be used against U.S. soldiers in future battles. ""So we're in this Catch-22, where they're saying, 'Hey we'll take these guys off your hands, but give us the evidence,'"" Hill said. ""And I'm saying, 'I can't do that because there are technologies and techniques utilized that I can't sacrifice for this one particular case that will be used again in a fight later on.' 'Well, if you can't give us the evidence, then we can't take these guys off your hands.' So, the clock continues to tick."" As the clock ticked toward the 96-hour NATO deadline, Hill made a decision that would cost him his military career. ""I decided that I needed to break protocol and interrogate them myself,"" he said. ""I took three gentlemen outside, sat them down, walked away, and fired my weapon into the ground three times, hoping that the men inside, left to their own imagination, would think that they really needed to talk."" Hill walked back inside. ""And sure enough, some of the detainees started to talk,"" Hill said. What the detainees told him was enough to convince the Afghans to take all 12 men into custody, including Hill's interpreter. Hill said he felt he had made the correct decision to protect his soldiers, but the Army charged him with detainee abuse, leading to his discharge from the military. And the 12 men ended up being released, despite the confessions, according to Army investigators. No one knows where they are now and what they're doing.","Roger Hill, a former Army captain, was discharged after a mock execution of Afghan detainees .

"(CNET) -- With its launch of iPhoto 09, Apple has begun showing some reasons why it's worth enduring the hassle of geotagging your photos. Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president, unveils iPhoto 09 at Macworld Tuesday. It's generally not easy right now to label your photos with information about where you took the pictures -- the process usually is done with special software to marry the photos with location data taken from a separate GPS receiver. Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, demonstrated what you can do with iPhoto at the Macworld 2009 keynote Tuesday. iPhoto 09 works best with photos that already have been tagged. That's getting more common, as GPS hardware support becomes less of a rarity. For example, Nikon's Coolpix P6000 has a built-in GPS receiver, and Nikon has begun selling its GP-1 GPS receiver, which can plug into its SLR's flash mount so location data is embedded in the photo. Apple's iPhone can geotag its own photos, and camera manufacturers say GPS support in cameras has become a matter of when, not if. But the software also can help you tag your own images. Clicking a photo flips it over, letting you type in a location, then showing the spot using a map. (Google supplies back-end mapping services). Helpfully, iPhoto then can spread that location data to other photos with similar time stamps, and they can be bundled together into a group called an event. OK, but what can you do? Once you have geotagged photos, what can you do with them? For one thing, sift through them geographically using iPhotos' new Places interface. Viewing an iPhoto event can show an associated collection of pushpins on a map, and clicking each pin shows the photo. For another, you can search for photos based on where you took them, not on whatever filing system you might use. iPhoto can handle geographic hierarchies, so if you labeled a photo with ""Eiffel Tower,"" it'll find it with a search for ""France"" or ""Paris."" Last, you can create photo books based on location. For people who want to create albums of their travels, this is a good idea, especially since you can use the tags both for selecting photos to print and to add maps into the book itself. There's no support for the painful part of geotagging, though: extracting location data from a GPS unit. There are other programs that can handle that chore, including Microsoft's Pro Photo Tools, Breeze Systems' Downloader Pro, or GPS Photo Linker. iPhoto is bundled with Macs, along with other members of the iLife suite: iMovie, Garage Band, iWeb, and iDVD. People who have earlier versions can upgrade to iLife 09 for $79. Tag, you're it . In some glorious future, computers might be able to understand the content of your photos just by ""looking"" at them, letting them retrieve just what you want when you ask. But for now, it's mostly up to you to add metadata, textual information such as titles, captions, star ratings, and geotags. If you want to find pictures of the Sydney Opera House, you'll have to know when you took them, what folder you tucked them into, or hope you labeled them with appropriate tags. iPhoto 09, like Google's Picasa Web Albums, adds another major tagging automation feature, though: face recognition. The software finds faces, lets you put a name to them, then offers other views of what it judges to be the same person. After you're done, you can view photos of a specific person. And if you've tagged people in Facebook, it'll slurp up those tags through a synchronization process. Yahoo's Flickr, which has extensive tagging and geotagging abilities, also benefits from this synchronization ability. So what's the upshot here? Good news and bad news. The good news is that the world of digital photography is moving to a new organizational scheme, finally shedding the filing-cabinet metaphor of a hard drive's file system or the shoebox full of prints. The new tag-based world is more flexible and approachable in several ways, and it is still fully compatible with the older methods. The bad news is that in order for it to work, you have to do a little more work getting the tags right in the first place. I, for one, think that it's worthwhile. Here's an example why: my sister needed photos for an end-of-year letter, and because I am the de facto family photographer, she looked to my online shots. The way she found photos of her family members was simply by searching my photos by her family members' names at Flickr. That's far superior to clicking on every photo album for the year and seeing what's within. Â© 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- If you're on Facebook, Twitter or any other social networking site, you could be the next victim. Experts say cybercrooks are lurking just a mouse click away on popular social networking sites. That's because more cyberthieves are targeting increasingly popular social networking sites that provide a gold mine of personal information, according to the FBI. Since 2006, nearly 3,200 account hijacking cases have been reported to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, a partnership between the FBI, the National White Collar Crime Center and the Bureau of Justice Assistance. It starts with a friend updating his or her status or sending you a message with an innocent link or video. Maybe your friend is in distress abroad and needs some help. All you have to do is click. When the message or link is opened, social network users are lured to fake Web sites that trick them into divulging personal details and passwords. The process, known as a phishing attack or malware, can infiltrate users' accounts without their consent. Once the account is compromised, the thieves can infiltrate the list of friends or contacts and repeat the attack on subsequent victims. Social networking sites show there is ample opportunity to find more victims; the average Facebook user has 120 friends on the site. ""Security is a constant arms race,"" said Simon Axten, an associate for privacy and public policy at Facebook. ""Malicious actors are constantly attacking the site, and what you see is actually a very small percentage of what's attempted."" As some social networking sites experience monstrous growth, they are becoming a new -- and extremely lucrative -- frontier for cybercrime. Facebook says it has 300 million users, nearly the size of the U.S. population, and it continues to attract users outside the college student niche. From February 2008 to February 2009, Twitter, a micro-blogging site where users post 140-character messages known as tweets, grew 1,382 percent to more than 7 million users. ""They [cybercriminals] are very adept to using social engineering,"" said Donald DeBold, director of threat research for CA, an Internet security company. ""Your friend is in trouble traveling in another country, 'I lost my wallet. I need help.' They exploit the curiosity aspect out of human nature."" A few decades ago, malicious software and viruses were usually the result of a prank, but Internet security experts say today's attacks are profit-driven. A study from the Indiana University in 2005 discovered that phishing attacks on social networks operated with a 70 percent success rate. These users had fallen for the scam, opened the foreign link and released personal information. Cybercriminals are employing phishing and malware attacks for a number of reasons, including trying to redirect users to sites where profit is fueled by the number of visitors. They also try to elicit private information like passwords and bank account numbers to perform scams. Early this year, Twitter experienced several phishing attacks in which a Web page that looked identical to the widely recognized light blue Twitter page was a hoax. The company warned users to double-check the URL to ensure they were visiting the correct site. The Internet Crime Complaint Center received more than 72,000 complaints about Internet fraud in 2008 that were referred to law enforcement agencies for further investigation. These cases involved financial losses amounting to $264.6 million, an increase from 2007. Each person lost an average of $931. ""Most of us would want to help a friend in need, but if it's an online friend, and they want you to wire money, you should double-check,"" FBI spokesman Jason Pack said. Security experts said it makes sense that cybercriminals are turning to social networking sites. Personal information is abundant on sites like Facebook and MySpace. Each time users give out valuable information like birth dates or addresses, they could be providing hints about their password, security experts say. The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern about the information visible through Facebook quizzes and applications. ""They'll have access to all that information, so they can sell it, they can share it, they can do an awful lot with it,"" Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for privacy-related issues with the ACLU, told CNN.com in September. Many Internet security experts consider the first virus attack on the PC to have occurred in 1986. By the early 1990s, viruses transmitted on floppy disks became ubiquitous. When the World Wide Web became widely available that same decade, viruses, worms and malware became problems in e-mail accounts, frustrating users who clicked on messages thought to be legitimate. In the new millennium, the most common form of malware attack has become known as drive-by downloads. While surfing on Google or Yahoo, spyware or a computer virus is automatically and invisibly downloaded on a computer, requiring no user interaction for the computer to be infected. ""We are on the verge from shifting from the Web being the No. 1 victim of infecting to social network,"" said Mikko H. Hypponen, chief of research technology at F-Secure Corp. His company sells anti-virus software and malware protection programs. ""It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better."" Social networks are fighting the aggressive attacks from cybercriminals. Most sites have information pages dedicated to educating users about the risks of Internet scams. Users can become a fan of ""Facebook Security"" and receive updates on how to protect their accounts. One of the most common pieces of advice given by security experts is to change passwords frequently. Facebook has also developed complex automated systems that detect compromised accounts. They spot and freeze accounts that are sending an unusually high number of messages to their friends. Company security officials said Facebook is a closed system, which can be helpful in erasing phony messages from all accounts. At News Corporation's MySpace.com, the company creates blacklists of phony accounts to prevent people from clicking on a faulty link. Hemanshu Nigam, first chief security officer for MySpace, said the firm warns about suspicious links and educates  users about the harm phishing and malware attacks can bring. ""We are prepared for them,"" he said.","The FBI reports nearly 3,200 account hijacking cases since 2006 .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Breathlessly, they came, carrying suitcases, plastic bags and just about anything that would hold the few belongings they still had. Thousands of Haitian people, most of them homeless, have flooded the port, hoping for a ticket to hope, on board a ferry, being paid for by the Haitian government. This ferry, the Trois Rivieres, is headed for Port Jeremie on Haiti's far western tip, far away from the hopelessness that has become Port-au-Prince. ""The government gave us 1500 gallons of fuel to go back to Jeremie to evacuate more people,"" said Roger Rouzier, director general of Marinetec, the ferry boat owner.  Anaika Clement has been here three days with her mother and her friend. Their homes have been destroyed. She and the others wait at a filthy wharf, littered with garbage and human feces, with cracks in the ground, from the day the earth moved in Haiti, last week. In creole, Anaika told CNN's Ivan Watson that they came here after Wednesday morning's 5.9 aftershock. ""I don't know how many days we're going to stay here,"" said Anaika. Wednesday's seismic rattle appeared to have pushed desperate people into action. For some, it didn't matter where the ferry would take them, as long as it left Port-au-Prince. With the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship in sight of them, mothers, fathers, children, infants, and their belongings, packed themselves into small, overcrowded row boats.  Latest updates l  Full coverage l  Twitter . In the words of one man, ""All of our hopes are with the international community. We are not able to sustain ourselves,"" he said. Many of the rowboats sat with too many people, too low in the water, and had the look of a potentially new tragedy. They would row about a mile, to the Trois Rivieres ferry, which was docked at the other end of the port. The owner docked it far away so that people could not board it, while it sat awaiting fuel from the government.  iReport: Search list for missing and found . ""First of all I have to put fuel on board. And I would prefer to put fuel on board before the people get in,"" said Roger Rouzier, the ferry boat owner. ""It's a little bit dangerous while you are refueling to have people on board,"" he said. Seeing the ferry boat, the people used the row boats to make their way out to the ferry, to board themselves. Once there, they climbed up the side of the boat, and designed their own assembly line of people to help pass luggage, and children, from one person to the other, on board the ferryboat. CNN witnessed one infant passed up along a sea of hands from their dinghy all the way to the top of the ferryboat.  iReport: Are you there? ""No one is helping us with crowd control here. No one. We don't have any help from no one. Even from the government,"" said ferry owner, Roger Rouzier. ""The government gave us fuel and told us to evacuate people to Jeremie and that's it,"" he said. CNN watched as one lone Haitian coast guard vessel tried to approach the ferryboat to curtail the rowboaters, but they were quickly overpowered by the sea of people fleeing. The ferry's owner told CNN his ferry is licensed to carry 600 people, but on the last trip to Port Jeremie, there were over 3000 onboard. With no serious crowd control and no lifeboats on board, Rouzier's only option to stop the crowds, is to leave. ""They'll do anything to get on the boat. And then it becomes very, very dangerous,"" he said. CNN took their own rowboat onto the Trois Rivieres, and saw a boat, slowly filling with the desperate refugees. They all appeared to relax once onboard. Perhaps, now they can begin to have hope about tomorrow.","Thousands of Haitians try to board government ship to Port Jeremie on Haiti's far western tip .

"(CNN) -- It's doubtful there's ever a perfect time or place to end a marriage, but for Dean McDermott, that time and place was in a Palm Springs, California, hotel room after playing a round of golf. Mary Jo Eustace said she's been able to take her 2006 divorce from Dean McDermott and turn it into a positive. The actor told his then-wife, Mary Jo Eustace, that he'd been having an affair with Tori Spelling and that he'd found his soul mate, Eustace recalled Tuesday on HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show."" ""[He said], 'I'm leaving you -- she loves me unconditionally,' "" Eustace said. Eustace replied that ""you've known her [for] three weeks. I actually thought it was a joke. I thought I was being punked. But it was true,"" she told Behar. Eustace offers life lessons she learned from the 2006 split with McDermott in her book ""Divorce Sucks: What to Do When Irreconcilable Differences, Lawyers Fees, and Your Ex Husband's Hollywood Wife Makes You Miserable,"" which arrived in bookstores Monday.  Watch Eustace describe her shock Â» . Donald Trump's ex-wife Marla Maples; Dina Matos, ex-wife of former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey; and Lance Armstrong's ex, Kristen, also appeared on Behar's show to break down what happens during and after very public breakups. When Eustace found out her 13-year marriage was ending, she said she was ""in a really ugly bikini -- missing like padding on one side, holding my daughter in my arms,"" but at least the bomb wasn't dropped in front of news cameras. Matos was standing right next to her husband when he admitted at a press conference that he'd had an affair with another man. ""I was in shock because I had only learned three days before that he had been involved in a relationship,"" Matos recalled on Tuesday's show. ""I was there in the moment. I was there physically but mentally, you know; I was just trying to maintain my composure and not fall apart in front of the cameras."" When a marriage ends, ""you think this is the end of your life as you know it,"" Matos said. ""And in some ways it is. You feel powerless.""

Although Lance Armstrong's post-marriage flame, Sheryl Crow, wasn't the reason his five-year marriage to Kristen ended, she told Behar it was still difficult to watch. And yet the hardest part for Kristen Armstrong was disliking her former husband's new love. ""I really wanted to dislike her,"" Armstrong said. ""I really did. [But] she's beautiful. She's smart. She's funny. She was great with the kids. For as much as I wanted to dislike her and I tried, I couldn't."" Matos said it's different when your husband leaves for another man. ""When your husband leaves you for another woman, at some point you know there was love in the marriage, and you had something,"" she said on Tuesday's show. ""But when your husband is not the person that you think he is, you know, he's an impostor -- then you start questioning every aspect of your life together. What was real? Did he ever love me? Why did he marry me? Later I found out why,"" she said. After McGreevey announced his affair, Matos said she found papers that appeared to be the outline for a book that said McGreevey married her ""for political gain,"" she said. ""He married me because he wanted to become governor and perhaps president. That's very painful."" All of the ex-wives said they've been able to use their divorces as a time to grow. ""You feel dehumanized, horrible,"" Eustace said of divorce. ""With lawyers and fighting and feeling unloved and unlovable, and the media thrown into it, you really have to take care of yourself and to take care of your kids,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Former ""Manson Family"" member Susan Atkins, who stabbed actress Sharon Tate to death more than 40 years ago and now is terminally ill, was denied parole Wednesday, prison officials said. Susan Atkins, shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders, was denied parole again Wednesday. The parole hearing was the 13th for Atkins, 61, who is battling terminal brain cancer. Held at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, California, the hearing stretched to more than six hours. The panel set another hearing for Atkins in three years, said Michele Kane, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Atkins was 21 when she and other followers of Charles Manson participated in a two-night rampage that left seven people dead and terrorized the city of Los Angeles in August 1969. She and the others -- Manson, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles ""Tex"" Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people, including Tate, and two additional deaths the following night. Their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972.  Watch Atkins, victims' kin speak Â» . By her own admission, Atkins, known as Sadie Mae Glutz within the Manson family, held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the actress 16 times. Tate was eight months pregnant. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate ""asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her."" After killing Tate, according to historical accounts of the slayings, Atkins scrawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. Polanski was not home, but three of Tate's house guests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his nearby cottage. In an interview scheduled to air Friday on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Linda Kasabian, a former Manson follower who was the prosecution's star witness against Manson and Atkins, recounted the Tate slayings.  Watch Kasabian recall killings Â» . ""I started hearing like horrible screaming and I started running toward the house and Sadie came running out and I just looked at her and I said, 'Sadie, please make it stop,'"" Kasabian said. ""And she said, 'I can't. It's too late.' ... It was unreal. It was so real that it was unreal."" On whether she asked Atkins and the others why they were killing, Kasabian said, ""It wasn't that kind of a scenario. All that I said was, 'Sadie, make it stop.'"" For her safety, Kasabian asked to wear a disguise during the interview, which was conducted last month. As of earlier this year, Atkins was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse. She has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson. But Tate's sister, Debra Tate, told CNN in an e-mail in March that she does not think any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were ""so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back."" ""The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,"" Tate said. ""They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do."" In a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins wrote that ""this is the past I have to live with, and I have to live with it every day."" ""Unlike the reader, or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool, I can't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life. Just like the families and friends of the victims, this is with me every day. I have to wake up every day with this and, no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community, I will never be able to replace what my crime took away. And that's not 'neat,' and that's not 'cool.'"" Atkins' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site. On May 15, doctors predicted she would live less than six months. But she passed that deadline, he wrote, and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7.","Susan Atkins held Sharon Tate down and stabbed the pregnant actress 16 times .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House on Friday began releasing the names of visitors as part of a Barack Obama campaign promise to run a more transparent administration. Last month, Norm Eisen, special counsel to the president for ethics and government reform, said records of White House visitors would be made available to the public on an ongoing basis beginning in December. ""We will achieve our goal of making this administration the most open and transparent administration in history not only by opening the doors of the White House to more Americans, but by shining a light on the business conducted inside it,"" he said. ""Americans have a right to know whose voices are being heard in the policymaking process."" As part of that initiative, he offered to look back at records from before the announcement. Eisen said Friday that 110 disclosure requests from September have been processed, yielding nearly 500 visitor records that have been posted on the White House Web site. Since the release covers only those records that are at least 90 days old, the first records cover January 20 to July 31. ""This first release is only the latest in a series of unprecedented steps by the president to increase openness in government,"" Eisen said. Given that up to 100,000 people visit the White House each month, the names published Friday included people with some very familiar names -- including William Ayers, Michael Jordan, Michael Moore, Jeremiah Wright and R. Kelly -- that did not belong to their more famous counterparts, he said. ""The well-known individuals with those names never actually came to the White House,"" Eisen said.

"(CNN) -- A Rwandan accused of ""complicity"" in the massacre of students at the college he headed during the country's genocide 15 years ago has been arrested in Italy, where he served as a clergyman, an international police agency said. Interpol hailed arrest of Uwayezu as a demonstration of effectiveness of international police co-operation. Officers from the Italian Carabinieri and Interpol's National Central Bureau in Rome, Italy, arrested Emmanuel Uwayezu -- who had been wanted in Rwanda, the international police organization Interpol said Wednesday in a news release. Uwayezu, 47, is accused of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity. He is in Italian custody and is awaiting extradition to Rwanda. According to Interpol's statement, the Rwandan arrest warrant says Uwayezu was alleged ""to have acted individually and as part of a conspiracy to plan and commit genocide by instigating Hutus to kill Tutsis in the area of Gikongoro, as director of the Groupe Scolaire Marie Merci college in Kibeho."" He is accused of ""participating in meetings with government and military authorities which allegedly planned the extermination of the Tutsi ethnic group"" and ""complicity in the massacre of some 80 students in May 1994 in the college which he headed."" Uwayezu arrived in Italy in 1997, took an alias, and was working as a vicar at the Church in Empoli commune near Florence when he was seized, Interpol said. The man was identified after Interpol's fugitives unit received information and pictures from Rwandan authorities. The Archdiocese of Florence issued a statement about the arrest two days ago, saying it hopes the justice system will come up with the truth about the case. But, it said, ""we stand by the fact that Don Emmanuel has always declared his estrangement to the events in question and we accompany him in prayers."" One Italian news report noted that Uwayezu is a priest of Hutu ethnicity and lived and worked as vice-parish priest in Ponzano, part of the county of Empoli. Don Guido Engels, the head of the parish and a priest, told the ASCA news agency that ""Don Emmanuel never cultivated feelings towards another ethnic group. He always wanted peace."" ""The arrest of Uwayezu demonstrates the power and effectiveness of international co-operation between police worldwide in obtaining information in relation to the identification, location and apprehension of fugitives around the world,"" said Jean-Michel Louboutin, Interpol's executive director of police services. ""This operation is a credit to law enforcement officers and agencies in Italy and Rwanda."" Two years ago, Interpol created a unit dedicated to searching for fugitives in the genocide who were wanted by Rwanda and the U.N.-sponsored International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. So far, seven people wanted by Rwanda and five wanted by the tribunal have been arrested. Police in Uganda recently arrested and extradited a man who is among the most wanted suspects from the Rwandan genocide. Idelphonse Nizeyimana was picked up at a hotel in Rubaga, a suburb of the capital, Kampala. The arrest, by Ugandan police, was part of an operation between the tribunal, Ugandan authorities, and Interpol. Nizeyimana was transferred Tuesday to a U.N. detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania, where the tribunal is based. The 1994 Rwandan genocide left an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead over a 100-day period, the United Nations and Interpol say. Millions more were raped and disfigured, and nearly an entire generation of children lost their parents.","Emmanuel Uwayezu accused of genocide, crimes against humanity .

"(CNN) -- Jacmel was the artsy town Kathryn Bolles would travel to on weekends, a respite from the bustle of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. But when a colleague with the Save the Children organization returned from once-scenic Jacmel on Friday, Bolles said he was traumatized. ""He said it's horrible what's happened there,"" said Bolles, the emergency health and nutrition director for Save the Children in Haiti. ""People are lost, dead, missing. Houses are down and facilities are down. It sounded similar to what we're seeing here in Port-au-Prince."" Attention has focused on Port-au-Prince since Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake, as it is the country's most populous city -- at more than 1.2 million people -- and has suffered tremendous devastation. Thousands of homeless victims have taken to sleeping in the streets, without food, water and medical attention. Others are buried beneath the rubble, and rescuers have miraculously pulled out survivors who were entombed by the debris. Elsewhere, though, preliminary reports are telling of how the crisis has gripped residents beyond the capital. ""What we're hearing from text messages, from e-mails is that all along the coast going west and then down south, towns are absolutely destroyed,"" said Bolles, who has worked in Haiti since 1999 and spoke to CNN from Port-au-Prince. She learned of the extent of the damage from colleagues, people on the street and other aid groups. Just to the west of Port-au-Prince is Carrefour, a city of 442,000 that felt violent shaking during the quake, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Damage there is expected to be heavy -- reports have yet to come in, the agency said. West of that is Leogane, a city, like Carrefour, that is passed on the road to Jacmel. More than 30 miles further west of the capital is Petit-Goave -- all towns, Bolles said that are reeling from the quake. Leogane's main hospital was flattened, as were numerous other buildings, Bolles said. She said she heard the ""whole town had collapsed."" Among the other areas, she said she was told an orphanage full of 1,500 children collapsed, and many people were dead or missing. CNN has yet to independently verify damage or casualties outside the capital, but reports continue to build in bits and pieces. About a three-hour drive south of the capital in Jacmel, there were reports of an orphanage that toppled, and of a hospital for women that collapsed, said Alana Salcer, spokeswoman for Cine Institute, a film school in Jacmel. Staff at the school and students there have written Salcer about the dire situation in that city, and even shot footage of buildings ripped open and survivors lying in streets. To keep the lights on and communication open, the school has had to rely on a generator after power lines went down. The home of the school's editing teacher, Andrew Bigosinski, fell down a hill when the earth violently shook, and many others lost their homes, Salcer said. Just east of Port-au-Prince, makeshift camps have been erected in the public squares of the densely populated area of Delmas, Cine Institute founder David Belle told Salcer in an e-mail shared with CNN. Belle described a harrowing scene on the road to Port-au-Prince: . ""Moving into the city ... the destruction gets worse and worse and the street is lined with piles of swollen, rotting bodies. ...Periodic road blocks have been set up by residents, protesting the lack of any aid presence and angry at stench and indecency. Huge tractors and dump trucks were just beginning to arrive and load bodies as we passed thru."" American Red Cross logistics expert and relief worker Colin Chaperone said the biggest obstacle outside the capital was getting medical treatment to the injured. Chaperone arrived in the capital Wednesday and had driven east toward the border with the Dominican Republic to escort an American Red Cross Emergency Response Unit into Haiti, said Red Cross spokesman Jonathan Aiken. Chaperone told Aiken that about 30 minutes out of Port-au-Prince, he was still seeing significant and widespread damage. Medical care was limited, as local clinics were overwhelmed by demand, he said. Makeshift treatment facilities were established for those who fled the capital, many of whom had broken bones and other serious injuries, Chaperone said. Exacerbating the dangerous situation was the reality that medical supplies were running out. Roads are slowly becoming easier to navigate, but aid is still slow to get outside the capital. Bolles said that her team plans to travel as far as they can to assess the situation and offer help. ""There really needs to be a humanitarian response and it needs to be immediate,"" she said. ""Outside of Port-au-Prince there really hasn't been anything.""","Jacmel, Leogane, Carrefour and Petit-Goave are towns that are reeling from earthquake .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United are now just one point behind leaders Chelsea at the top of the English Premier League, after a double from in-form Wayne Rooney helped them to a comfortable 3-0 home win over West Ham on Tuesday evening. England striker Rooney, who is enjoying the best goalscoring run of his career, has now scored 27 goals this season, as well as finding the net in United's last six league matches at Old Trafford. Former England striker Michael Owen added a late third goal, to ensure that United head into Sunday's League Cup final against Aston Villa at Wembley in good heart. Rooney opened the scoring on the stroke of half-time, superbly converting a diving header from Antonio Valencia's cross. And the 24-year-old doubled his advantage in similar vein in the second half, again finding space to head home another pin-point Valencia cross. West Ham arrived at Old Trafford on the back on consecutive victories that had seen them move away from the relegation zone, but they were always second best here and their fate was sealed when Owen netted his eighth goal of the season from a Paul Scholes through-pass.","Wayne Rooney scores twice as Manchester United defeat West Ham 3-0 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The son of the late Gambino family crime boss John Gotti is set to stand trial in federal court in New York on Monday on murder and racketeering charges that could put him in prison for life if he is convicted. 'Junior' Gotti's lawyer, Charles Carnesi, talks with reporters outside the federal courthouse. Three previous racketeering trials against John ""Junior"" Gotti, 45, have ended in mistrials in New York. The government says it has learned since his previous trial, ""that Gotti had participated in three murders, that Gotti had run a multi-million dollar cocaine trafficking network, that Gotti had overseen a systematic effort to tamper with trial juries, grand juries and witnesses, and that Gotti had participated in various other violent crimes,"" according to court documents filed by prosecutors. The defense claims the newest round of charges is part of the government's ongoing quest to convict Gotti. The current case was moved to New York in December from Florida, where the original indictment was handed up. A superseding indictment was filed in the case on August 3. In the first indictment, Gotti was only charged with violating the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. The superseding indictment formally charged Gotti with the drug-related murders of two men -- allegations mentioned as part of the first indictment -- along with the RICO charge. The RICO law is used to target organized crime groups -- in this case, the Gambino crime family. Gotti's defense attorneys, however, allege in court filings that ""the prosecution has engaged in a 'win at all costs' campaign riddled with misconduct."" ""The prosecution charges the same conspiracy, albeit with new garnishments,"" said one filing from July. ""After having received frustrating results in three separate trials, the case was hijacked to the Middle District of Florida in a shameful attempt to forum shop or judge shop or both."" Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, say in court filings that Gotti's allegations he is a victim of a government vendetta are unfounded. Since Gotti's previous trials, prosecutors maintain, they have ""uncovered extensive new evidence of Gotti's criminal conduct in the course of investigating and prosecuting another Gambino family captain."" The indictment alleges that Gotti was at times an ""associate, soldier, captain and de facto boss"" in the Gambino family, and also served on a ""committee of captains"" formed in the early 1990s to assist in family administration. ""The principal purpose of the GCF (Gambino crime family) Enterprise was to generate money ... for the GCF Enterprise members,"" the indictment says. ""This purpose was implemented,"" the indictment continued, ""through various criminal activities, including criminal acts involving the felonious manufacturing, importing, receiving, concealing, buying, selling and otherwise dealing in narcotics and other dangerous drugs, extortion, armed and unarmed robbery, armed home invasions, illegal gambling, extortionate credit transactions, theft and bribery."" To further their activities, family members threatened and caused economic injury, the indictment says, as well as threatening and using physical violence ""ranging from simple assault to murder."" The two murders Gotti is charged with are those of George Grosso, who died in December 1988 in Queens, and Bruce John Gotterup, slain in November 1991 in Queens. The indictment also accuses Gotti in connection with a third murder, that of Louis DiBono in October 1990 in the parking garage of the former World Trade Center, but does not allege that murder was drug-related. Although the murder charges carry a potential death sentence, prosecutors have said they will not seek the death penalty against Gotti. The trial will be the latest chapter in a long legal saga. In late 2006, a third mistrial was declared in a federal case against Gotti on charges including racketeering and extortion. Prosecutors said they would not retry Gotti, who was accused of ordering attacks on radio talk show host Curtis Sliwa after the Guardian Angels founder criticized Gotti's father on his program. Sliwa was shot three times but recovered and testified against the younger Gotti. At the time of Gotti's arrest in August 2008 on the latest charges, his attorney, Charles Carnesi, told reporters he ""was very disappointed to have to go through all this again."" Carnesi continued, ""You can imagine the toll it took on him and his family to have to fight three times in the course of a year, to feel that, OK, perhaps it's over ... because the government itself came to the conclusion, no more. It's very disheartening for him to be back here again."" Gotti's father, John Gotti Sr., was nicknamed the ""Teflon Don"" because prosecutors had trouble making charges against him stick. He died in prison of throat cancer in 2002.","Junior Gotti, son of late ""Teflon Don,"" set to go on trial in federal court .

"Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Police announced 15 new suspects in the January killing of a Hamas leader at a Dubai hotel, bringing to 26 the number of people suspected of involvement in his death. Authorities previously had released a list of 11 suspects in the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing. Al-Mabhouh was found dead in his hotel room January 20. Police believe he was killed the night before and suspect the Mossad, the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit, was behind his killing. Among the new suspects are six more people who allegedly used British passports in the commission of the crime, four others using Irish passports, two other French passport holders and three people, including a woman, traveling on Australian passports, police said in a statement Wednesday. The total number of suspects using British passports is now at 12, police said, along with six Irish passport holders and four French passport holders. Another suspect using a German passport was announced earlier this month. The three Australian passports are new. ""Friendly nations who have been assisting in this investigation have indicated to the police in Dubai that the passports were issued in an illegal and fraudulent manner, adding that the pictures on the travel documents did not correspond to the original owners,"" the police statement said. Dubai authorities have informed Australia of the possible use of the three Australian passports, Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said Thursday (Wednesday ET) in a statement to Parliament. The passports were issued in 2003 to Joshua Bruce, Adam Korman and Nicole McCabe, he said, adding that Australian officials have been cooperating with Dubai authorities. ""The Australian government is very gravely concerned that these Australian passports appear to have been used fraudulently,"" he said. Preliminary analysis shows that the passports ""appear to have been duplicated or altered,"" he said. ""At this stage, Australian officials have no information, no information to suggest that the three Australian passport holders were involved in any way, other than as victims of passport or identity fraud."" He said he had told the Israeli ambassador to Australia, Yuval Rotem, that Australia expected Israeli authorities ""to cooperate fully and transparently with the Australian Federal Police investigation into this matter."" The European Union earlier this week said it ""strongly condemns"" the use of false EU passports in connection with al-Mabhouh's slaying. Officials have said the passports are not fake or forged but were authentic passports meant for other people. While authorities have not said how he died, al-Mabhouh's family was told there were signs of electric shocks on his legs, behind his ears, on his genitals and over his heart. Blood on a pillow led police to believe he was suffocated, the family was told. The killers left some of al-Mabhouh's medicine next to his bed in an apparent effort to suggest his death was not suspicious, police said. Police said Wednesday they have traced the suspects' travel routes and their destinations before and after al-Mabhouh's death. ""The suspects gathered in Dubai and dispersed to various locations before pairing up again in different teams and heading off to other destinations,"" the statement said. The Australians, for instance, are believed to have departed Dubai in a boat for Iran. Police released a diagram showing the travel routes. The suspects are believed to have departed Dubai for places including Paris, Hong Kong and Rome following al-Mabhouh's death. In addition, police said in a statement that 14 of the suspects used credit cards issued by MetaBank, based in the U.S. state of Iowa, to book hotel rooms and pay for air travel. Payoneer, an online payment distribution service, issues the types of cards the suspects are said to have used through MetaBank. Someone ""loads"" the cards by paying Payoneer, which then contacts MetaBank to issue the card, according to Payoneer. ""We are aware of the news reports,"" Mary Kae Marinac, a spokeswoman for Payoneer, said Wednesday. ""We are cooperating with [MetaBank] and the authorities to explore the matter"" and identify the accounts. A spokeswoman for MetaBank confirmed the bank's relationship with Payoneer and said the company is investigating the allegations. Meanwhile, the new list of 15 suspects ""includes people who offered prior logistical support and preparations to facilitate the crime and others who played a central role,"" police said. ""Dubai police investigators are not ruling out the possibility of involvement of other people in the murder."" The 26 do not include two Palestinians arrested in Jordan earlier and returned to the UAE. In an interview Wednesday, Khairi Aloridi, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, called al-Mabhouh's death ""a major terrorist crime."" The European Union is concerned the killers acquired passports and credit cards by swiping the identities of EU citizens, Baroness Catherine Ashton said Monday. She did not name Israel, although foreign ministers in countries whose passports were doctored called in Israeli ambassadors last week to discuss the issue. In Israel, as many as seven people whose names were on the travel documents said they have no knowledge of al-Mabhouh's death. The British Foreign Office said Wednesday it was planning to contact the British citizens named by Dubai authorities as suspects -- because the passports bear their names -- and ""we will be offering them counselor services. ""We continue our investigation into this matter and repeat that we expect full cooperation from Israel in relation to this matter,"" the office said in a statement. Dubai's police chief said Thursday he was ""99 percent"" certain that the Mossad, the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit, is behind al-Mabhouh's slaying. Hamas has called al-Mabhouh's death an ""assassination."" Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, meanwhile, has said there is nothing more than ""media reports"" linking Israel to al-Mabhouh's death. Asked if he believed the Mossad was responsible, Aloridi said Wednesday, ""All the evidence and the clues point to an Israeli involvement."" In a report from the information office of the Ezzedeen al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, senior Hamas leader Ismail Radwan said he believes Israel was behind the killing and called for ""the Zionist war criminals"" to be held accountable. CNN's Paula Hancocks, Caroline Faraj, Saad Abedine and Hugh Williams contributed to this report.","NEW: Australian officials cooperate with Dubai authorities over passports .

"(CNN) -- Deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya will not be reinstated as head of state, an overwhelming majority of the Honduran congress voted Wednesday. In an hours-long process, 111 lawmakers voted in favor of a motion not to return Zelaya to office. A majority of 65 votes in the 128-member body was required to reject his reinstatement. Zelaya was removed from office in a military-led coup on June 28 and replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti. On Wednesday, lawmakers voted one by one and addressed the chamber as they cast their vote, making for a slow process. The vote was a key part of a U.S.-brokered pact that representatives for Zelaya and Micheletti signed October 29, giving Congress the power to decide Zelaya's fate. The United States expressed disappointment Thursday over the latest rebuff to its diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in Honduras. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela continued to call on the Honduran government to allow Zelaya's return and to create a unity government in the interim period before the new president takes office next month. ""We are disappointed by this decision since the United States had hoped the [Honduran] Congress would have approved his return,"" Valenzuela said in a conference call with journalists in Washington. ""Our policy since June 28 has been consistently principled. It has condemned the coup d'etat and continued to accept President Zelaya as the democratically elected and legitimate leader of Honduras throughout this political crisis."" The United States continues to call for Honduras to engage in national reconciliation and creation of a truth commission to investigate the crisis, in addition to the unity government. ""The absence of democratic, constitutional order is the unacceptable status quo,"" a senior U.S. administration official said on the conference call, remaining anonymous under the ground rules of the call and because of the sensitivity of the situation. ""The election is a step toward a day where Honduras will have an electorally legitimate government in place."" Zelaya, who says he does not recognize the election, also has said he would not accept the post even if Congress voted him back in. Accepting the job, he said, would legitimize the coup. Many nations said before the Sunday's election they would withhold recognition if Zelaya were not returned to power. Some countries, such as the United States, Colombia and Costa Rica, have said they will recognize Lobo. Others, such as Argentina, Brazil and Spain, have said they will not. Despite the diplomatic pressure from abroad, lawmakers were voting the will of the people, Congressman Juan Angel Rivera Tabora said. ""History will judge us, and I'm certain it will judge us positively,"" he said. ""Congress didn't make this problem. The problem came to us."" Those voting against Zelaya echoed those sentiments. After the coup, the same body voted to install Micheletti as interim president. Wednesday vote only happened because the agreement between the two sides called for it, many lawmakers repeated. Zelaya's supporters argued that the coup was an illegal act that only restitution could heal. Congress sought opinions from the nation's Supreme Court and other bodies before holding the vote. The court ruled last week that Zelaya cannot return to office without facing trial on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when he tried to hold a vote that could have led to the removal of presidential term limits. The Supreme Court ruled before the coup that the vote was illegal and Congress had forbidden it. The coup came on the day the term-limits vote was to have been held. Micheletti and his supporters have insisted that Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power, not a coup. But the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the European Union and most nations -- including the United States -- condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated immediately. He wasn't. Zelaya, who was flown out of the country while still in his pajamas on the day of the coup, has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras' capital since secretly returning to the country September 21.","111 of 128 lawmakers vote against reinstating ousted leader Jose Manuel Zelaya .

"SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- You've got your spot on a lounge chair angled into the hot Caribbean sun, with tall, slender palm trees jutting out over your head. As you gaze at the calm turquoise waters and sip that refreshing rum drink, you may ask yourself, ""What more could I possibly want?"" Visitors can climb the tower at Fortaleza Ozama for a view over the rooftops and out to sea. For many travelers to the Dominican Republic, that chair -- usually secluded inside a mega all-inclusive resort complex -- is the sole destination. And don't get me wrong, it's a great one. The Dominican Republic's stretches of sand are some of the best on the planet. But if you never leave the high walls of your tourist compound, you're missing out on a gem of a capital city. Santo Domingo is the New World's first city, with 16th-century buildings, quaint colonial streets, romantic ruins and a lively atmosphere. All you need is a full day to experience the city's architecture, culture and food. Plus, it's only a $9 coach bus ride from Punta Cana. So when you begin to tire of the antics of the ""animation team"" at the resort, and the color of your skin starts to resemble the papaya or watermelon you're eating, consider a short trip to Santo Domingo. Founded soon after Christopher Columbus set foot in the New World, and run by his son Diego, the city became the colonial capital of the Americas and launch pad for further Spanish expeditions. Despite several raids by pirates, the oldest section of town remains largely intact. Known as the Zona Colonial, it contains many European ""firsts"" in the Western Hemisphere including the first street, cathedral, hospital and university. How to see it all in a day . Start at the heart of the zone, Parque ColÃ³n, a square that borders the cathedral and is always full of life. You can sit and watch children chase pigeons as you gaze up at the simple beauty of the oldest cathedral in the Americas. Next, head over to the oldest fortress in the New World, Fortaleza Ozama, built in the early 1500s. There you can climb the tower for a view over the rooftops and out to sea. Back on street level, walk up a couple blocks to the expansive Plaza EspaÃ±a, site of two museums and a hangout for locals, especially in the evening, when kids crisscross the square on scooters or fly kites, and couples sit quietly together. The Museo de las Casas Reales and the AlcÃ¡zar de ColÃ³n -- Diego Columbus' palace -- show you how the wealthy Spanish lived when they came to the early colonies and provide some history of the island's colonization -- all for a buck or two. Next, head over to a pair of impressive ruins. Gaze up at the towering walls and arches of the Americas' first hospital, Hospital de San NicolÃ¡s de Bari. Then, just up a picturesque bend in the road lined with colorful houses, you'll find the large ruins of Monasterio de San Francisco. Pirate attacks and earthquakes brought down the monastery. The hospital was merely abandoned in the 18th century, and later dismantled for safety. Now let yourself wander a bit through the streets, checking out the colorful surprises around every colonial corner. You'll discover the varied architecture of people's homes, and get a view into Dominican city life. In just a few blocks, I ran across a pickup game of baseball, the national sport and passion, in the middle of the street, with adults using just a broom handle and roll of tape; several ""kiddie"" pools in the streets, where both children and adults were cooling off in the afternoon heat; and a handful of corner parks alive with activity. After exploring, your final destination is the zone's main drag, Calle El Conde. This pedestrian-only street is the place to shop. You'll find street sellers hawking colorful artwork; music stores to pick up that merengue and bachata music you've heard blaring out of everyone's stereos; and jewelry shops featuring native amber and the sky-blue stone larimar found only in the Dominican Republic. By now, you've certainly worked up an appetite walking in the hot sun. Parque ColÃ³n and Plaza EspaÃ±a each have a row of chic sidewalk cafÃ©s, although they're a bit pricey and touristy. Consider wandering a bit through some side streets to find a more local establishment, where you can feast on typical cuisine such as la bandera dominicana (a red beans and rice dish), several stews, fried plantains or yucca and delicious tropical fruits. And if you still feel like dancing the night away, hop in a taxi to the MalecÃ³n, Santo Domingo's seafront boulevard, where the large hotels have popular dance clubs pumping merengue until the wee hours of the morning. The bus ride . Getting to the capital city from the beach areas is cheap and relatively easy. Expreso BÃ¡varo runs from the Punta Cana area for $9 in an air-conditioned and comfy coach bus. On your four-hour ride, you'll get a glimpse of some smaller Dominican towns, a towering modern cathedral, distant mountains and vast sugarcane fields. Metro and Caribe Tours provide similar services from the beaches on the north coast around Puerto Plata. The buses to/from Punta Cana don't run long into the evening (they leave each side at 7 a.m., 10 a.m., 2 p.m., and 4 p.m.), so you'll want to make this an overnight trip. The Zona Colonial has several boutique hotels that are quaint, clean and reasonably priced. You could even arrange to fly out of Santo Domingo's Las Americas airport, rather than Punta Cana.","Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic's capital, was the New World's first city .
