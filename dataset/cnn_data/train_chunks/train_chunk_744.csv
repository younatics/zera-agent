Difficult decision: Staff at Adelaide Zoo yesterday put Greater down, their 83-year-old flamingo . It survived World War II and being set upon by a gang of youths but yesterday the world's oldest known flamingo died in Australia at the age of at least 83. 'Greater' was put down by staff at Adelaide Zoo because its quality of life had deteriorated and it was 'complications associated with old age' and arthritis, the zoo said on its blog. They admitted the decision had been 'difficult'. 'Greater is best known for being the world's oldest flamingo and the last Greater Flamingo to have resided in Australia,' they added. Greater was brought to the zoo in 1933, although records are unclear about whether it came from Cairo or Hamburg Zoo. It arrived as a mature adult but its gender and  exact year of birth are unknown. The bird, who was named after its species, had been a star attraction as it would confidently approach visitors. Greater Flamingos, characterised by pale plumage and pink bills, have a life expectancy of between 40 and 60 years in captivity, but less in the wild. The zoo’s chief executive Elaine Bensted told The Australian newspaper staff had taken the decision after their octagenarian bird, who was already almost blind, took a turn for the worse this week. She said there was no more treatment that would have improved Greater's life. The zoo's veterinary team had already put Greater on a course of anti-inflammatory pain medication to ensure its comfort after its health started to deteriorate last year. 'Greater responded well to treatment and remarkably survived the cold winter,' Ms Bensted said. Prime: Greater had been a favourite at the zoo over the decades. It arrived in 1933 as an adult from either Germany or Egypt . Wily old bird: Greater stunned staff with its recovery from a vicious 2008 attack that left it with a fractured skull . Seniority: Great was the zoo's oldest resident . Perfect match: Greater and Chilly were described as 'a pair of grumpy old men'. Chilly is now the last flamingo in Australia . Winging it: Greater, with his striking red wing feathers, had a companion in Chilly. Staff will check up on Chilly to see how it is affected by its friend's death . The elderly bird, whose sex is unknown, had already beaten the odds to make a remarkable recovery after a vicious attack in 2008 that left it with a fractured skull. Four youths aged 17 to 19 were charged with the attack. The zoo said it may erect a memorial to Greater near the heritage-listed Flamingo Grotto, the zoo's oldest exhibit, which was built in 1885. Those were the days: When Greater arrived the zoo was home to several flamingos but because of an import ban Greater had just one companion in his twilight years, Chilly the Chilean flamingo, now the last flamingo in Australia . The flamingo is survived by companion Chilly the Chilean flamingo, 65, which is said to be the last flamingo in Australia. Zoo staff said they would keep a close eye on Chilly to see how Greater's death affects it. The former head of South Australia's zoos, Chris West, said at the time of the attack that Greater and Chilly were 'like two grumpy old men but they will certainly miss each other if they are apart for any length of time'. Chilly is the only remaining flamingo in the country. Although Adelaide Zoo used to be home to several, but the zoo has not been able to replace those which have died because there is now a moratorium on the importation of flamingos, which can carry a raft of avian diseases, into Australia.","The bird named Greater was a star attraction at Adelaide Zoo .

Star footballers Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema were today cleared on all charges in their underage sex trial in Paris. Prosecutor Jean-Julien Xavier-Rolai has been tasked with proving they had illegally slept with a teenage prostitute – a crime which carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison. But Mr Xavier-Rolai told Paris Correctional Court that it was ‘impossible to prove’ the case against them. Both Ribery, 30, and Benzema, 26, denied knowingly paying for sex with Zahia Dehar when she was under 18. Cleared: Karim Benzema, left, and Franck Ribery, right, have both been cleared of paying for sex with prostitute Zahia Dehar when she was under 18 .

Now 20, she has become one of the most famous names in France since the players were first arrested, building up a career as a reality TV star, and the muse of designer Karl Lagerfeld. Neither she, nor the footballers, attended court, instead leaving the process to their lawyers. Judges in the case today said there would be no further action against Ribery and Benzema. At the opening of trial earlier this month, Ribery’s defence lawyer said Dehar had withdrawn her status as a civil plaintiff, and conceded that neither men knew how old she was. Referring to Dehar, barrister Carlo Alberto Brusa said she was ‘no longer the victim and no longer considers herself one, and she is out of the trial.’ He added that even ‘the prosecutor has . recommended that the case be dismissed. In consequence, we have a trial . without accusations.’ High fashion: Ms Daher attending a Versace fashion show. Trading on her notoriety as a sex symbol, Zahia Dehar reinvented herself as a lingerie designer, showing her first collection on the Paris catwalks in January last year . The 'Birthday Treat': Ms Dehar was 17 when she . was paid in 2009 to fly from Paris to Munich. Ribery admitted having sex with her, but said the money he gave her was just for travel, her hotel and food . Paying for sex is legal in France, but only if all parties involved are more than 18 years old. The age of consent in the country is 15. Ms Dehar was 17 when she was paid in 2009 to fly from Paris to Munich, where Ribery plays for European Champions Bayern Munich, to sleep with him as a 26th 'birthday treat’. He admitted having sex with her, but said the cash he gave her – the equivalent of some £650 – was solely for travel, food and a hotel. Mr Dehar is known to have lied about her age to all the footballers she slept with, including Real Madrid forward Benzema, said Mr Brusa. Benzema was alleged to have paid Ms Dehar just over £400 to sleep with her after the French Union of Professional Footballers' awards in May 2008, when she was 16. Sylvain Cormier, for Benzema, said his client denied this claim, adding: ‘From the outset, Karim Benzema has said that nothing happened.’ Daniel Vaconsin, Ms Dehar’s barrister, confirmed she had withdrawn as a civil plaintiff in the case, so will not be seeking damages. ‘She is not asking for anything,’ he said. Five others accused in the case today received suspended prison sentences of between three months and two years.

Arsenal face a backlash from fans after it emerged that the club’s only January signing was already injured when he arrived. Kim Kallstrom, signed on loan from Spartak Moscow on deadline day, reportedly sustained a back injury playing football on a beach during his former side’s winter break in Abu Dhabi last week - and he is now expected to miss at least six matches. Arsene Wenger’s side have their best chance of winning a Premier League trophy in years and supporters were keen for him to capitalise on that  by strengthening their squad in the  January transfer window by signing a much-needed striker. Blow: Arsenal face a backlash from fans after the club's deadline day signing, Kim Kallstrom, was already injured when he arrived . Life's a beach: Kallstrom, pictured playing for Spartak Moscow, sustained a back injury during his side's winter break in Abu Dhabi last week . But not only did Arsenal fail to bring in a big-name forward, they also missed out on a player they dubbed ‘the new Thierry Henry’, Schalke winger Julian Draxler, instead signing Swedish midfielder Kallstrom as cover for  Mathieu Flamini, who is suspended for three games, and injured duo Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere. Wenger is expected to reveal the likely length of Kallstrom’s injury in the next 24 hours. The club have said that the problem was identified during the medical and that they chose to proceed with the transfer regardless because they are confident he will play an  important part later in the season. Kallstrom did not train on Saturday and the Swede could not have played against Crystal Palace on Sunday because he was not registered as an Arsenal player in time. Staying put: Arsenal had been tracking Schalke frontman Julian Draxler (centre) but instead signed Kallstrom . But the 31-year-old, who has been capped more than 100 times by his  country, is expected to miss Arsenal’s two matches against Liverpool as well as games against Manchester United, Bayern Munich in the Champions League and Sunderland. It is understood that Kallstrom will briefly return to Sweden and Russia before moving to London and beginning a course of treatment. The former Lyon midfielder had been brought in as cover for the injured Ramsey, who is set to miss six weeks. However, the Swede now faces a spell on the sidelines himself and will is being assessed over the weekend. International: Kallstrom, who has made over 100 appearances for Sweden, will briefly return to his home country before moving to London .","Arsenal new boy Kim Kallstrom was already injured when he signed for the club on deadline day .

A mother's determination to show doctors that she was fit enough to qualify for IVF treatment led her to losing an incredible 7st 7lb. Gail Sim, 36, from Edinburgh, and her husband Steven, 38, were so keen for their daughter Jasmine, aged six, to have a little brother or sister that after trying to concieve naturally they decided that their only option was IVF. By the winter of 2009 Steven and Gail Sim had been trying for a baby for a year and sought options for IVF at a private clinic. The fact they already had a daughter made them eligible for NHS funding. But the couple were told that at 17st, Gail was too fat for treatment. Gail said: 'We had fertility treatment when we were trying to conceive the first time around, so I knew what to expect in terms of tests and preparatory medication. 'But the doctor said I couldn't even start on the medication until I lost 3st. He wasn't able to prescribe the course of treatment to people over 14st. 'My heart sank as I thought it would be impossible to lose that much. It sounded like a very daunting target. 'We had our heart set on having another baby. We'd always said we wanted two children. The thought of not being able to fulfil that dream was quite devastating.' Gail, a secretary, had attempted diets . with little success, and was worried she wouldn’t be up to the challenge . set by the doctor. But determined to give her daughter a sibling, she embarked on an amazing turnaround which saw her shrink down to 9st 7lbs. She said: 'I felt other people were destined to lose weight if they wanted to - but not me. I'd tried slimming programmes, calorie-controlled meals and simply cutting down on food. 'But the pattern was always the same - I'd lose a little bit only to eventually put on more than I'd lost.' Gail's habit of eating convenience foods had seen her reach 17st, requiring her to wear size 24 clothing. She recalled: 'I ate easy-to-prepare meals when I got home from work. Being in a loving relationship with Steven I had become comfortable. We ate a lot of pizzas.' Her weight gain had stopped her from . enjoying having her photograph taken, and she shied away from looking at . snaps from family holidays. Gail (left), daughter Jasmine (centre) and husband Steven (right) were determined to complete their family by having a second child . She . said: 'I didn't enjoy meeting new people because I was worried about . what they would think of me and I didn’t like being in a situation where . someone had a camera out. 'There's a photo of me taken at a theme park in Florida, with me standing by a character from Monster's Inc, which I find very depressing. 'I remember feeling at the time that being in the fun park with my family, I couldn’t do all the activities that I wanted to do. I even worried about fitting into plane seats.' Following her appointment at the . fertility clinic in November 2009, Gail was inspired to succeed this . time and threw out all the convenience foods and tailored her lifestyle . towards healthier options. 'I . thought, ‘either I do it, or live with the regret of not having a . second child’. I knew I had to go all-out to lose the weight. Gail's diet saw her go from a size 24 to a slender size 8 and she is determined to keep it that way . 'Shortly after I made the changes, I saw how quickly my weight dropped off, and it spurred me on.' Before beginning her weight loss programme, Gail typically ate a large bowl of cereal for breakfast, followed by a couple of cheese rolls with crisps and a bar of chocolate for lunch and a pepperoni pizza with chips for dinner. She would snack on biscuits throughout the day. After making the decision to slim down, she ate a grapefruit for breakfast, followed by crispbread with cheese and two apples for lunch and a baked potato with tuna filling for evening meal. She also joined a gym and began exercising weekly. 'At one point I thought I was forever . destined to be the size I was. I’ve proved that’s not true. It’s all . about what you eat and having the willpower to make changes' In May 2011, Gail stepped on her scales to discover she had reached 9st 7lb - a total weight loss of 7.5st. She had shrunk from a size 24 to a slinky size 8. She was approved to receive the IVF treatment that month. She said: 'It all came off in the last six months - at first I was losing weight but it wasn’t noticeable. Towards the end it was quite dramatic how much I changed. 'Being approved for treatment was incredibly exciting. I never thought I’d be able to get to that point.' In July, having been through so much to have the chance to undergo treatment, Steven and Gail Sim were disappointed when they were told the round of IVF hadn't worked. But just two months later, their frustration turned to joy when Gail made the shock discovery that she and Steven, a nurse, had conceived naturally. In April 2013 Gail’s efforts were rewarded with the arrival of their second daughter Saffron, now 9 months old. Saffron . was born five weeks prematurely but, after a week of monitoring in . hospital, the elated couple were finally able to take her home to meet . her big sister. The Sim family's wish came true with the birth of their second daughter, Saffron (not pictured) Gail said: 'Saffron is lovely, happy and healthy. She’s crawling around everywhere at the moment. Jasmine is over the moon - she loves helping me out with her.' Today, Gail remains at 9st 7lb after she managed to lose the 7lb of baby weight she put on while carrying Saffron. She said: 'I’m miles more confident and much happier. At one point I thought I was forever destined to be the size I was. I’ve proved that’s not true. It’s all about what you eat and having the willpower to make changes - noone else can make those sorts of decision for you. 'The key is making a decision, and being strong enough to see it through.'","Gail Sim, 36 wanted a second child but struggled to conceive naturally .

Former News of the World reporter Dan Evans told the Old Bailey he intercepted a message from Mr Craig while working at the Sunday Mirror. The message said, 'I love you, I love you, I love you,' the court was told. Mr Craig and supermodel Ms Moss were widely rumoured to be dating for a few months in 2004, but never publicly confirmed the relationship. Message: Daniel Craig told Kate Moss 'I love you' in a voicemail listened to by a Sunday Mirror reporter, a court heard; the pair are pictured together at an Alexander McQueen fashion show in June 2004 . Reporter: Dan Evans, left, claims he told editor Andy Coulson, right, about hacked voicemail messages . The court also heard that Jude Law was . 'mistaken' in saying he never left a 'threatening' voicemail for Mr . Craig when he learned the Bond star was having an affair with his . then-girlfriend Sienna Miller. Evans insisted a line in a draft story . quoting Mr Law as saying 'Worry about your own girlfriend, pal' was a . paraphrase of what he told Mr Craig in the angry phone message that he . hacked. On Monday, Mr Law . told the Old Bailey trial he confronted his long-time friend over the . phone from Baltimore, but did not leave him a voicemail. Questioned . about the discrepancy, Evans said: 'I would say Mr Law is mistaken. Is . it beyond the realms of possibility he left a voicemail and Daniel Craig . rang him back? He did. I heard it, hence why you have got that quote in . the story.' He said the . 'threatening message' on the voicemail saying 'Hey mate, hope Saskie [Mr . Craig's then girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell] does not find out' had . 'inspired' the quote he later wrote for the newspaper. Later . in today's hearing, Evans admitted fiddling his expenses by claiming a . meal with his partner involved a 'Daniel Craig contact', adding: 'It was . part of our culture at the paper but I don't see what it's got to do . with hacking phones.' On the stand: Evans give evidence under cross-examination from Timothy Langdale QC as Coulson looks on . Affair: Another hacked message apparently revealed that Sienna Miller was in a relationship with Mr Craig, her co-star in 2004 film Layer Cake . Co-stars: The pair appeared together in 2004 gangster drama Layer Cake, pictured . An artist's court drawing from the Old Bailey today. Ms Miller is pictured next to an FBI employee while giving evidence via video link . Evans, who has pleaded guilty to hacking . at the News of the World, claims Andy Coulson, then editor of the . tabloid, knew about his activities and endorsed stories based on hacked . messages. On his fifth day in the witness box at the Old Bailey, Evans was being cross-examined by Coulson's lawyer, Timothy Langdale QC. The . court heard that Evans has already admitted conspiracy to hack phones . at both the Sunday Mirror and the News of the World between 2003 and 2010. Coulson . is on trial charged with conspiring to hack phones and conspiring to . commit misconduct in a public office, alongside former Sun and NotW . editor Rebekah Brooks and five others. All seven defendants deny all the charges against them. The trial heard from a series of emails . between staff at the NotW, including Coulson, discussing information . which two sources close to Mr Law had given to another journalist. Transcripts from interviews read to the court exposed information from the sources described as One and Two. Witness: Jude Law - Ms Miller's boyfriend at the time - gave evidence in the case this week . Friends: Mr Law, Mr Craig and Ms Miller walking together in north London in May 2004 . Source One told the NotW that he first saw Ms Miller with Mr Craig at the London restaurant, The Ivy, and Miller was 'panicking' that the press would make something out of it. The second time, Source One said they were at a house in Notting Hill. Mr Craig left and drove off while Ms Miller hid behind the door, the court heard. Source Two told the NotW that Ms Miller was just 'keeping Jude dangling' while 'going onto her next victim'. Source Two claimed that Ms Miller was 'clingy' and a bit of a 'stalker' so would call both Mr Law and Mr Craig several times an hour. The source said: 'They [Ms Miller and Ms Craig] are constantly on the phone with each other. She is always texting and ringing.' The source asked a NotW journalist if he had access to their phones, and the response was 'No, no, no, that would be illegal,' Mr Langdale said. Source Two told the NotW journalist that Ms Miller had moved out and 'fled the country', adding: 'She not a nice girl, she's not a goody two shoes.' The source went on to suggest that Mr Law wanted the story about the split back-dated to look like Ms Miller 'cheated first'. Mr Langdale put it to Evans that the information in his story about the cheating couple came from these two sources, not a voicemail, but the witness disagreed.","Bond star's voicemail to model allegedly hacked by reporter Dan Evans .

If the mere thought of re-painting the windows or front door of your home fills you with dread, spare a thought for airlines who have to spruce up their planes. But for them time really can fly. For with the help of time-lapse photography, airline Emirates has compressed into just two minutes the near fortnight-long round-the-clock marathon required to strip and re-paint each of its Boeing 777 passenger aircraft. Scroll down to watch the video . Huge: A timelapse video shows how Emirates workers in a hangar in Dubai repaint the airline's planes . Job: The workers begin by stripping the plane's entire coat of paint off in preparation for repainting . Work in progress: The plane after the start of the process, with stripped paint on the floor . Emirates runs the world’s largest aircraft paint hangar owned by an airline. Last year it completed 21 aircraft ‘make-overs’, each one averaging around 312 hours or about 13 days and nights. The Emirates paint hangar at Dubai International Airport is more than twice the size of a football pitch. A Boeing 777 requires a team of 26 to 30 people for a full strip-and-repaint project, which is turned around in 12 to 13 days in the hangar which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Half-way: The plane has lost most of its paint by this point as the work continues around the clock . Bare: The Boeing 777 pictured completely denuded of its paint ready for a new coat . First steps: The white base layer is the first coat of paint to be applied to the plane . Temperature, humidity and airflow have to be regulated to ensure a perfect glossy coat. Adel Al Redha, executive vice president and chief operations officer of Emirates, said: ‘It’s not just about looking good. 'The paint coat has to withstand fierce weather conditions, including severe wind, bitter cold and searing heat, and an exterior coat that is clean of debris and imperfections improves aerodynamics and reduces fuel consumption. ‘Emirates already flies a young and efficient fleet, but with fuel prices at consistently high levels, every little bit of efficiency counts.’ Stencil: Next the name of the airline is reapplied to the Boeing jet by workers . Nearly done: The painting crew put the finishing touches to the plane as they work on the door . Finally! After 13 days of work, the gleaming 777 is ready to go back into service . He added: ‘Our aircraft livery is one of . the most recognisable and visible aspects of our brand. It is what . people see in the sky, and the first thing our passengers see at their . boarding gates. ‘We take pride in maintaining our aircraft to the highest possible standards, and it is important our planes look pristine on the outside as well as on the inside.’ The Dubai-based carrier strips its aircraft of their exterior colour and gives them a brand-new coat after every seven to eight years in service. It has 132 Boeing 777s, one of which is featured in the video, with 201 more on order.","Emirates operates enormous aircraft paint hangar in Dubai .

The project, entitled Anonymous, features images of Bottos with screen caps of the hateful messages posted over the top. The project calls attention to the harsh words people feel emboldened to say about others - especially women -  in an online environment, things that they would most likely never say to someone's face. 'The anonymonity allows people to say whatever they want without any consequences,' Bottos told the Baltimore Sun. 'They want to get a reaction, to bring you down.' Bottos says the hurtful messages are clearly related to her gender. 'I almost exclusively get [cruel anonymous messages] after I post selfies.

The mistress of French president Francois Hollande was today nominated for a French Oscar – for playing a sex obsessed government aide. News of Julie Gayet’s success comes as the Socialist head of state visits Prime Minister David Cameron in Britain. Mr Hollande, 59, had been hoping to avoid questions about his colourful private life, but Ms Gayet’s increasing fame will make them inevitable. Rising star: Julie Gayet, 41, left, has been nominated for a Cesar for her role in Quai d'Orsay. Announcement came as French President Francois Hollande, right,  arrived in Britain to meet Prime Minister David Cameron . Meeting: French President Francois Hollande pictured speaking with Prime Minister David Cameron during a one day summit at RAF Brize Norton . The 41-year-old is nominated for a so-called Cesar, the highest honour in French cinema, for best supporting actress in ‘Quai d’Orsay’. The soap opera is named after the Paris quay where France’s foreign ministry is based, and Ms Gayet plays a mini-skirted adviser who uses her feminine charms to bed powerful men. In real life, Ms Gayet is said to have been having a passionate affair with Mr Hollande while he was still living with his ex first lady, Valerie Trierweiler.The two secret lovers regularly met in a Paris flat, with Mr Hollande arriving on the back of a motor bike with his head hidden by a crash helmet. Such revelations will overshadow Mr Hollande’s first Anglo-French summit, to be held at Brize Norton airfield in Oxfordshire, and a nearby pub. It came as a new poll Harris Interactive poll found 64 per cent of French police did not think Mr Hollande struck ‘the right tone’ in the way he effectively ‘fired’ Ms Trierweiler. Time for a pint? President Hollande and David Cameron arrive for an informal lunch at The Swan Inn pub in Swinbrook, near Burford in Oxfordshire, after their meeting . Business partners: President Hollande visited the UK to discuss Britain and France's joint venture to build a new combat drone . Mr Hollande released an 18 word statement last Saturday confirming that he was no longer living with his 48-year-old ex-girlfriend, meaning she lost her role and all its perks. There were no plans to bring Ms Gayet to the UK today, as Mr Hollande prepared to be grilled at morning press conference. His talks with Mr Cameron will cover defence, European Union reform, Libya and the Syrian civil war. Mr Hollande has so far hidden behind France’s privacy laws, continually arguing that the status of France’s taxpayer funded first lady is nobody’s business but his own. Mr Hollande has also been widely criticised for using Elysee staff to organise his secret visits to Ms Gayet in a Paris love nest, to which he travelled on the back of a moped with his face hidden by a crash helmet. Today’s poll is in Closer, the magazine which exposed his cheating with a series of photographs of him visiting Ms Gayet. Ms Trierweiler, a Paris match journalist, has meanwhile already offered long interviews to a series of glossy magazines, and is set to write a lucrative book about her 19 months as first lady.","Julie Gayet, 41, has been nominated for a Cesar for her role in Quai d'Orsay .

To look at Kelly Simpkin, you would imagine that the head-turning blonde enjoys a jet-set life of frequent celebrity parties, swanky red-carpet events and lavish holidays with her famous hairdresser boyfriend, Nicky Clarke. But the reality is far from glamorous. For the 32-year-old faces a daily battle with the rare and potentially life-threatening disease lupus. This chronic auto-immune condition, for which there is no cure, affects 50,000 people in the UK – a staggering 90 per cent of whom are women. 'I won't give in': Kelly Simpson, 32, girlfriend of Nicky Clarke, 55, suffers from lupus, which causes the body¿s immune system to turn on itself and start killing its own cells . Lupus causes the body’s immune system to turn on itself and start killing its own cells, explains lupus expert Professor David Isenberg, academic director of rheumatology at University College Hospital, London, and Kelly’s consultant. The primary symptoms are inflammation, pain and tissue damage. The inflammation can cause pain, heat, redness, swelling and loss of function, either internally to organs, or externally to the skin. Internal and external symptoms can even be suffered at the same time. Then there are breathing problems and chronic fatigue. When the major organs are affected, survival for lupus sufferers is likely to be shorter than for those with only skin and/or joint disease related to lupus. Lupus patients often suffer unpredictable flare-ups followed by periods of remission. It all means that late-night parties are off-limits for Kelly: two glasses of wine would bring on a severe attack; wearing high heels for more than an hour leaves her knees agonisingly painful; and if  she stays out later than midnight, it takes days to recover from what feels like chronic flu. Her support: Kelly says her boyfriend Nicky Clarke sometimes has to help her get dressed in the morning as she is in so much pain . Some days Kelly cannot even make it out of bed, let alone get dressed and leave the house. She says: ‘Every day I wake with pain – a stinging sensation deep within my bones, which moves around the body. I also have chronic fatigue, so even if I have ten hours’ sleep at night, I wake up utterly exhausted. ‘On bad days, my fingers are so swollen that I can’t make a fist, and Nicky  has to help me get dressed. Sometimes  it flares up for a few days, sometimes  for several weeks, and I can be bedridden. I feel so sorry for Nicky as it is hard living with someone with lupus  – but he’s always been absolutely brilliant about it.’ Kelly first experienced lupus symptoms when she was 17. ‘I began to  feel pain and swelling in my fingers. I was studying computer science at college, and I thought it was repetitive strain injury. ‘The pain then spread to my wrists,  but when I went to see my doctor, I was first told it was growing pains, and then when I changed my consultant, rheumatoid arthritis. I tried to manage the condition with painkillers.’ The condition went undiagnosed, as is the case in many sufferers. Prof Isenberg explains: ‘Lupus can be very hard to diagnose as it mimics other diseases. It is diagnosed via the symptoms, by taking family history and by a series of blood tests. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids and new ‘‘biologic’’ drugs which target the auto-immune system.’ ‘I liken lupus to friendly fire in a war situation,’ says  Prof Isenberg. ‘Our immune system is like  a radar – every day we are bombarded by millions of bacteria and viruses. 'The immune system identifies and fights these off, but with lupus the body cannot distinguish between our own cells and the invading forces.’ Lupus can cause strokes, excessive bleeding, kidney, heart and lung failure and blood clots. In the 1950s, sufferers had only a 50 per cent chance of surviving for five years, but now  about 90 per cent will survive for  at least 15 years from diagnosis. Treatments are advancing swiftly with a new range of biologic drugs – such as Rituximab. The disease’s profile was raised when pop singer Lady Gaga said there was lupus in her family but so far she had had no symptoms. lupusuk.org.uk . Kelly’s pain continued throughout her college course and into her early 20s when she worked as a trader in the City. She continued to try to manage the pain, but at 23 she switched careers and started working in the hairdressing industry, which is where she later met Nicky. The couple, who live in London, have now been together for five years. Hairdressing proved tricky, due to the swelling and pain in her hands, but she persevered as doctors continued to diagnose arthritis. Finally, last year, she saw another specialist and was told she had lupus. ‘I was really shocked, but it made sense and it was a relief to know what was wrong with me and what I was up against,’ she says. The exact cause of the disease remains unknown but lupus is thought  to have a genetic link, and Kelly’s family now believe her maternal grandmother had lupus as she experienced similar symptoms. Since the diagnosis, Kelly has tried  an array of medications and requires weekly hospital care for treatment  and monitoring. Her latest treatment,  a new drug called Rituximab, is a  powerful biological therapy that is designed to reduce the number of  B-cells, the type her auto-immune system over-produces. The Rituximab treatment was combined with a one-off shot of a chemotherapy drug called cyclophosphamide. She has had two treatments of the Rituximab, but takes further drugs and painkillers to manage her condition and her blood is screened in hospital. ‘Rituximab is like gold dust and costs about £5,000 per infusion via the NHS so I’m really grateful to have it, and it is helping as I have noticed some of my symptoms ease slightly since my second infusion,’ she says. She met Nicky, 55, when she joined  his Mayfair salon as a trainee hairdresser and has been able to benefit from her partner’s unwavering support. Kelly says: ‘He’s always known  about my pain and fatigue, since I first started working with him, and he has always been incredibly supportive  and caring. ‘He is constantly researching new treatments – we are now drinking lactose-free milk, as he thinks that  might help.’ Despite the severity of illness, Kelly is determined it will not affect her career. ‘Last June I launched my own fashion label, She Wears A Crown, and I would love to have a family with Nicky, but sadly with lupus you often miscarry so  I know it won’t be easy.’ She is now trying to raise awareness  of lupus. ‘I’m doing all I can to support the charity Lupus UK to help fellow sufferers. In 2015, I’m planning to do a husky sledge ride across Lapland to raise funds. ‘Being well and strong enough for that is my goal for the next year. I won’t be beaten by this.’","Fashion designer Kelly Simpkin, 32, has auto-immune disease lupus .

Multiple sclerosis (MS) may be triggered by a toxin produced by common bacteria found in food, according to a new study. The inflammatory disease of the central nervous system is thought to be triggered in a genetically susceptible individual by a combination of one or more environmental factors, but the triggers are still unknown. U.S. scientists have built on previous studies that suggested epsilon toxin, which is produced by common bacteria, could trigger MS. Multiple sclerosis - the  inflammatory disease of the central nervous system - is thought to be triggered in a genetically susceptible individual by a combination of one or more environmental factors, one of which could be a bacteria found in food. A scan is pictured . MS is known as an autoimmune condition. This is where something goes wrong with the immune system - the body’s defence against infection - and it mistakenly attacks healthy body tissue – in this case, the myelin covering of nerves. This can cause multiple sections of the brain and spinal column to become damaged and hardened, which can disrupt the nerve signals passing through these areas. Exactly what causes the immune system to act in this way is unclear, but most experts think a combination of genetic and environmental factors are involved. This new study finds that epsilon toxin could be one of the triggers. Source: NHS Choices . MS is characterised by blood brain permeability and demyelination - a process in which the insulating myelin sheaths of neurons are damaged. Microbiologist Jennifer Linden of Weill Cornell Medical College, New York City, said: ‘We provide evidence that supports epsilon toxin’s ability to cause permeability and show that epsilon toxin kills the brain’s myelin producing cells, oligodendrocytes - the same cells that die in MS lesions.’ She presented the new research at the ASM Biodefense and Emerging Diseases Research Meeting in the U.S. ‘We also show that epsilon toxin targets other cells types associated with MS inflammation such as the retinal vascular and meningeal cells,’ (cells of the membranes that envelop the central nervous system), she said. ‘Epsilon toxin may be responsible for triggering MS.’ Epsilon toxin is produced by certain strains of Clostridium perfringens, which is a spore-forming bacterium that is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness. Epsilon toxin is produced by certain strains of Clostridium perfringens (pictured) which is a spore-forming bacterium that is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness . Previous studies have suggested that C. perfringens, and in particular, epsilon toxin, may play a role in triggering MS. Late last year Dr Linden and her colleagues discovered C. perfringens type B - a strain that is not known to infect humans and produces the epsilon toxin - in a 21-year-old woman who was experiencing a flare-up of her MS. To further test their hypothesis Dr Linden and her team studied the behaviour of the toxin in mice focusing on which cells it targeted. They discovered that the toxin did target the brain cells associated with MS pathology, but that was not all they found. Dr Linden said: ‘Originally, we only thought that epsilon toxin would target the brain endothelium cells and oligodendrocytes; we just happened to notice that it also bound to and killed meningeal cells (of neurons).’ ‘This was exciting because it provides a possible explanation for meningeal inflammation and subpial cortical lesions exclusively observed in MS patients, but not fully understood.’ They also tested samples of local foods for the presence of C. perfringens and the toxin gene. Of the 37 food samples, 13.5 per cent were positive for bacteria and almost three per cent were positive for the epsilon toxin gene. Dr Linden said the findings are important scientists now know that the epsilon toxin is a trigger of MS. Development of a neutralising antibody or vaccine directed against the epsilon toxin might stop the progression of the disease or prevent it from even developing, she added.","Microbiologists from the Weill Cornell Medical College, New York City, built on previous research that suggested epsilon toxin could trigger M.S.

Twiggy has been in fashion for decades and now she's revealed the rules she abides by when it comes to her timeless style. The 64-year-old model revealed the secrets to her fashion success in an interview for the March issue of Woman & Home magazine. And her top style rule is that your wardrobe should not be restricted by your age. Still in style: Twiggy has been modelling since she was 16 . 'I don't like it when people say ""you're 45, so you should be wearing X and never Y"". For me, dressing is about attitude, not age,' she said. She added that size is not important when it comes to looking good. 'We all have bits that we don't like but you don't have to be a size 10 to look wonderful. 'The trick is to find the style that is right for you. When it comes to trying new clothes my advice is not to take it too seriously - it's all about having fun.' Be adventurous: The designer said women shouldn't be afraid to wear bright colours . She's been in the modelling industry since the age of 16 and has learnt the best kind of style involves taking risks. 'Be adventurous and experiment – don't be afraid to try something new. But if you do feel nervous, start with one on-trend item and build your outfit around it. 'Buy a colourful accessory – bright shoes will give you an instant confidence boost,' she recommended. The Marks and Spencer designer often makes colour one of her wardrobe staples and hasn't shied away from as she's aged, wearing a hot pink lace dress to her daughter Carly's wedding last summer. She received so many compliments that she has now launched it as part of her new M&S collection. 'For special occasions I love pretty . dresses – but nothing too frou-frou! When I was planning my outfit for . Carly's wedding last summer, I wanted something simple, chic and easy to . wear. 'I thought of the black lace dress from my last winter collection . but I thought ""I can't wear grey or black to my daughter's wedding! How . about hot pink?"" The wedding was in the Cotswolds and it was 84 degrees. Everyone loved my dress so we are launching it online in February!' Read the full interview in the March edition of Woman & Home . She admits that she doesn't believe in the urban fashion myth that black flatters everyone, and will always opt for a brighter colour. 'Yes black is slimming but it's not always youthful. The right tone of red, however, is flattering on all women.' Twiggy's collection for M&S follows this ethos revealing pops of red and leather skirts rather than black pullovers and loose-fitted shirts. The model will also open a pop up boutique at the M&S marble arch store on February 27th. Unlike with many other celebrity clothing lines, Twiggy is quick to point out that she's had a lot of involvement when putting together the collection and that she only designs pieces she would wear herself. 'Even before I was discovered in 1966, I used to make my own clothes. I learned how to sew early on and it's still my passion now. I constantly have ideas in my head about clothes so jumped at the chance to do my own collection and am very hands-on. Everything I design I wear and I love.'

A couple who tipped the scales at 45 stone have shed almost a third of their body weight in time for their wedding day. Kim James, 35, and Lee Coggins, 37, from Bristol, gained weight on a calorie-packed diet eating junk food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. On a typical evening, they would consume garlic bread, two large pizzas, ice cream and three bags of chocolate, between them washed down with beer and wine. Kim James (right) and her partner Lee Coggins, pictured here with daughters Georgina and Grace, have lost seven stone each and now plan to get married . At their heaviest, Kim weighed 19st 10.5lbs and was a size 24, while Lee weighed in at 25st 4lbs and had to have his 56-inch waist trousers made online. But after joining a slimming club two years ago they shed 14 stone between them and are now at their ideal weights for their wedding in March. Kim said: 'I couldn’t bear people watching me eat because I was just worried they were thinking why is she eating all that when she is so fat already? 'Sometimes I would deliberately not buy any chocolate but by 7pm we would usually crack and drive to the garage which is literally a few minutes’ walk away.' The couple, here holding their old trousers, used to eat garlic bread, two large pizzas, ice cream and three bags of chocolate in one evening, washed down with beer and wine . Kim and Lee are set to tie the knot in a VW themed ceremony in line with their love for camper vans, which Kim says may not have happened if they hadn't lost weight. She said: 'I would have hated having my photos taken on my wedding day. In fact If I was the same size we would not be getting married. 'There will be some very shocked friends at the ceremony - especially ones that haven't seen us for a while.' The couple decided it was time to lose weight after Kim saw a picture of herself holding her newborn daughter and Lee's weight exceeded the maximum measured by their Nintendo Wii. The parents of Georgina, six, and Gracie, two, joined Slimming World in September 2011 and immediately began to shed their excess weight. Kim and Lee say they are much happier now and that the wedding might never have happened if they hadn't lost weight . Lee said: 'When I found out what my weight was I was actually scared. 'I went on the scales on the Nintendo Wii but it only went up to 23st and then it told me to get off. 'I didn’t think I could be heavier than that but when I did weigh myself I was 25st 4lbs. Unbelievable.' Kim, who lost seven stone, added: 'I always knew I was overweight but until I saw a photo I didn’t realise just how bad I'd become. 'The hardest part was it was a photo with my two girls, one of whom was brand new, and I didn't want to show anybody because I looked awful. 'I had always struggled with my weight but had just avoided having my pictures taken. 'I have no photos with Georgina when she was tiny because I didn't like having cameras anywhere near me. 'It makes me say because I can never have that time back.' Lee, who also lost seven stone, said their decision to shed the pounds has had a beneficial effect on the happiness of the family. He said: 'Now as a family we can do a lot more. We can go swimming or go to the beach. 'It's great being able to go on the adventure playground with the kids and seeing how much happier it makes them. Before we would have sat having a cup of tea and a cake whilst they played.

She was left with scars . The victim of a brutal sex attack has been refused NHS funding for ‘cosmetic’ treatment of her injuries. The decision comes less than a year after an aspiring glamour model revealed her cosmetic breast enlargement had been paid for by the National Health Service. A 24-year-old graphic designer was walking home from a nightclub in Hull when she was followed by a stranger, dragged under a bridge and assaulted. She managed to make a brief 999 call and police sent to the location found the man attempting to rape her. The terrified woman, who cannot be identified, suffered bruising and grazes to her legs, knees and back in the attack last March, which left her needing hospital treatment. She still has painful purple scars on her knees and marks on her ankles. She remains traumatised by her ordeal but was told that treatment to remove the scars – a permanent reminder of the assault – cannot be funded by the NHS because they are ‘cosmetic’. There were no such qualms about paying the £4,800 bill for Josie Cunningham, 23, from Leeds, to have a breast enlargement operation. Funding was recommended by her GP after she complained she had been bullied since her teenage years for having a flat chest. Miss Cunningham, an unmarried mother-of-two, was condemned when she showed off her figure in downmarket newspapers in the hope of launching a modelling career. She later said she wanted the NHS to pay for a reduction and even threatened to sue the Health Service for making her breasts too big. The funding decision caused outrage, particularly as NHS guidelines state that cosmetic surgery should be funded only in rare circumstances ‘to protect a person’s health’. A sex assault victim's injuries weren't treated on the NHS because they are 'cosmetic'. But Josie Cunningham, pictured, won funding for breast implants last year. She has since said she regretted billing the NHS . Similarly, there are a range of methods to reduce or remove scars – including laser treatment – which are not widely available on the NHS as they are regarded as purely ‘cosmetic’. The sex assault victim has been given steroid cream for the scarring on her legs, back and hands, but said yesterday she would like to have laser treatment to remove them. However, her GP told her there was little chance of approval. Priorities? Josie Cunningham, pictured, had the operation last year. She now wants to pay for a reduction . Months have passed, nothing has been done and no NHS laser treatment offered, but she is yet to be told her application has been formally rejected. She asked: ‘Why can people have boob jobs on the NHS? ‘Fair enough if I had fallen over, but I had no control over what happened to me. It frustrates me when I see people getting surgery through the NHS when they don’t really need it.’ To make matters worse for the  24-year-old, her Latvian attacker is costing taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds while he awaits sentence, receiving the best psychiatric care in a £500-a-day private hospital. Rolands Brize, 25, pleaded guilty last April to attempted rape. He is currently being assessed by psychiatrists and has appeared in court 11 times. When he is next up before the judge, the bill for his treatment, legal and prison costs will have reached an estimated £90,000. Speaking after the latest hearing at Hull Crown Court, his victim said: ‘There is all this fuss about his care and how much it is costing, but what about my care? I have to see my injuries every day, yet my surgery is considered cosmetic. It is appalling that I get left behind.’ Her attacker is spending 12 weeks in Chadwick Lodge, a secure psychiatric hospital in Buckinghamshire owned by the Priory Group. It is reported to cost around £500 a day, though the company will not discuss fees charged to local authorities. The victim said she never goes out any more, adding: ‘I am not the same as I used to be.’","Graphic designer, 24, still has painful scars after an attempted rape in Hull .

Sick: Humberto Salvador, 36, is on trial for allegedly raping a woman because she was a lesbian . A man who allegedly raped a woman for being a lesbian uttered, 'you like men now, don't you?' as he assaulted her, she has claimed. The 33-year-old victim, who has not been identified, wiped away tears as she testified about the brutal 2008 gang-rape during the trial of Humberto Salvador, 36, in Contra Costa County, California on Tuesday. She recounted the terrifying moment she was robbed, forced to strip naked, carjacked and passed between three men - an attack prosecutors claim stemmed from her sexuality. 'You like men now, don't you? Tell me you like men,' Salvador uttered after he started attacking her, the woman said. She explained that she screamed 'yes' as she feared for her life. Salvador has been charged with 15 felonies including kidnapping, carjacking and gang rape in the December 13, 2008 attack, the Contra Costa Times reported. If convicted, he faces life in prison. He was allegedly joined that night by fellow gang members Josue Gonzalez - the only one not accused of sexual assault - and then-teenagers Darrell Hodges and Robert Ortiz. Targeted: He and three other men approached her on her street in Richmond, California (pictured), where he allegedly robbed her, smashed her over the head with a flashlight and made her strip naked . Defense lawyers have said that, while . there is no doubt that the rape occurred, they are seeking to prove that . it was not motivated by the woman's sexual orientation. In court, the victim described how she arrived home in Richmond from her job at a pizzeria around 9.30pm when she was approached by a man, who demanded her purse and keys. Photos of the woman's car show it was . marked with emblems of her sexuality, including rainbow stickers . symbolizing gay pride and a rainbow-colored teddy bear on the dashboard. Attack: Josue Gonzalez did not rape the woman but pleaded guilty to carjacking and robbery . She said that the man, identified as . Salvador, then smashed her across the head with a flashlight and showed . the jury the scar that is still visible beneath her short hair. As jurors wiped away their tears, the woman testified that the man forced her to strip naked on the sidewalk. 'He kept insisting and asking whether or not I liked men,' she said through a Spanish interpreter, adding: 'I thought he would kill me.' He proceeded to rape her until the other men warned that people might be coming. They got into her car where Salvador continued to assault her, she said.

Toy boxes, silver rattles and the odd savings bond are all par for the course when celebrating the birth of a new baby. Fortunately Prince George’s parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are equally delighted at the gift of a fatted calf and goat they received in honour of their son’s birth from tribesman in Kenya this month. The couple have now formally accepted the present, considered a great honour in the local culture, and have even responded with a letter written in Swahili thanking the elders for their ‘extraordinary generosity.’ William and Kate have been gifted a fatted bull calf and a goat by Kenya's Samburu people to honour the birth of Prince George . The gift of a fattened black bull and goat was made last week by the Samburu people of Kenya, whom William has spent much time with in recent years when staying on the Lewa wildlife conservancy at the foothills of Mount Kenya. He and his wife also got engaged nearby. After discussions between the prince’s representatives and local cultural leaders, it has been agreed to use the bull to start a new ‘royal herd’. There has, by all accounts, now been an offer of four heifers to go with the bull, and the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT) have agreed to keep the animals on Lewa. In a traditional Samburu ceremony to celebrate the birth of Prince George, elders blessed the animals while their womenfolk conducted traditional dances to celebrate the birth of a new born child. British High Commissioner, Dr Christian Turner, even travelled to Wamba on Their Royal Highness’s behalf to be there for the ceremony. The Samburu people of Kenya sent the royals the unusual gift to celebrate the birth of Prince George . In recognition of the honour, William . sent the community a message of thanks, which read: ‘Kwa niaba ya kijana . wetu, George, Catherine na Mimi ningependa kuwashukuru nyote sana sana . kwa kujitolea kwenu, ukarimu wenu na pia kwa zawadi zenu.’ In . translation it read: ‘On behalf of our son George, Catherine and I . would like to thank you all so very much for the extraordinary honour . and generosity of your gifts.’ The . rest of the letter continued in English: ‘I remember my time with you, . the Samburu, with immense happiness and I could not be more grateful to . you all for this kindness. It . brings me great pride and joy to know that George’s ‘pension’ will be . herded on a land that we love and care deeply for. We only hope that one . day, he will be able to come and see them for himself. ‘Please accept our immense and deep thanks on this special occasion. ‘Asante [thank you].’ Ties: William has spent much time with the Samburu in recent years when staying on the Lewa wildlife conservancy at the foothills of Mount Kenya. He and his wife also got engaged at a lodge (pictured) nearby . Cattle, which are used for milk not meat, are very important to Kenyan tribesman and the subject of mystical beliefs and reverence. Mythology tells of a time when the earth and sky were joined together, until they were suddenly torn apart, with only the wild fig trees left as bridges between the two. As a gift, God - called Enkai - sent herds of cattle down through these trees to earth. Cattle are, therefore, sacred and a direct gift from the heavens. Grass is also considered a blessing and sacred. When passing a fig tree, it is customary for tribesmen to push handfuls of grass between the roots, as homage to the source of their herds. One of the more common greetings is ‘I hope your cattle are well’.","Gift of a fattened black bull and goat made last week by the Samburu people .

But thousands of the 142,300 foreign nationals receiving out-of-work payments are from outside the EU, with huge numbers on the dole from Pakistan, Somalia and Iran. Claimants: Official figures show how tens of thousands of foreign nationals are on benefits in the UK . The Prime Minister has clashed with the European Commission over his claims that Britain’s benefits system is a ‘pull factor’ in attracting people to move here. Latest figures show that in February 9.2 per cent of all Jobseekers Allowance claimants were non-UK nationals. It includes 35,000 from the EU, 35,000 from Africa, 33,000 from Asia and the Middle East and 6,500 from the Americas. Poland tops the league table with 14,610 JSA claimants, followed by Pakistan 7,660, Somalia 7,120 and Portugal 5,860. It also included 4,130 Iraqis, 3,620 Nigerians, 3,290 Jamaicans and 3,120 from France. A major political row erupted this . week when a report from the European Commission revealed there were . 600,000 foreigners from the EU in Britain without a job.

There was a 73 per cent increase in . the number of ‘job-seeking’ EU immigrants in the country in the three . years to 2011, according to the Commission. The findings led Boris Johnson to urge the Prime Minister to demand a change in EU laws to delay migrants’ access to benefits. Mr Johnson said migrants should have to work for ‘quite a long time’ before they can claim any benefits in this country. In . response, Number 10 suggested the right of people from across Europe . could be curtailed under Mr Cameron's plans to overhaul Britain's . relationship with Brussels. The .

As pictures of Mayfield Secondary School's Lionel Klotz surfaced on social media, the Peel School District board was inundated with complaints about the incident. The vice principal was asked to stay home while the school board investigated. Principals: A Toronto school board received complaints from students, staff and the public about their vice principal (second from right) Lionel Klotz's choice of costume . 'I would like to apologize on behalf of the Peel District School Board and senior administration for the hurt caused by this incident,' education director Tony Pontes said in a statement on Monday.

Pity the fool: Lionel Klotz's Halloween costume has caused a furor . 'When I saw the picture it rubbed me the wrong way,' Peel resident Rad Dockery, who posted the photo on Twitter, told the Globe and Mail.

Two Florida men dressed as George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin, complete with bullet wound and blackface, football coaches in San Diego blackened their faces as members of the Jamaican bobsled team, and even actress Julianne Hough, who dressed as the character 'Crazy Eyes' from Orange is the New Black, felt the need to darken her face. 'Blackface, a practice whereby a white actor painted his face black before mocking African slaves and their descendants, is a formula ingrained in the history of North America,' writes Rachel Decoste in Huffington Post.'Blackface minstrelsy was a lucrative and easy form of entertainment for whites from the 1800s onwards. Caricaturing African-American patois, song, and dance created and reinforced racist stereotypes in an era where Blacks were considered subhuman.'

Twitter has named their first female board member to help run the company, announcing the move via Tweet on Thursday morning. Marjorie Scardino was most recently the CEO of Pearson PLC which owns the Financial Times and a major book publishing firm. The 66-year-old, who was born in the U.S. but has taken British citizenship and lives in London, also previously served on the board of Nokia, worked at The Economist Group and was the publisher of The Economist and CQ Roll Call. Milestone: Marjorie Scardino has been named as the first female member if the board of Twitter after the company came under scrutiny for having very little diversity on their board . Twitter, like Facebook before its own IPO, was criticized for not having women or minorities on its board of directors. Faced with its lack of board diversity - three of Twitter's directors are named Peter - CEO Dick Costolo tweeted earlier this year that diversifying the board 'has to be about more than checking a box.' She confirmed the announcement by posting her first Tweet: 'Thank you. There couldn't be a more exciting time in Twitter's history to join!' Facebook named its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to its board after it went public in May 2012. Boys club: Twitter came under fire because so many of the company heads- like (left to right) co-founders Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, Evan Willams and CEO Dick Costello- were white men . Unlike Facebook, though, Twitter still doesn't have any high-ranking female executives. Scardino joins Costolo, Chairman Jack Dorsey, along with co-founder Evan Williams and venture capitalists such as Peter Fenton, a general partner at Benchmark Capital, on Twitter's board. She will replace David Rosenblatt on Twitter's audit committee while Rosenblatt will continue to be on the compensation committee, the company said in a regulatory filing. As part of joining Twitter's board, Scardino was granted a restricted stock unit award of 4,018 shares of the company, which will vest quarterly over one year. Record breaker: Scardino (seen here in 2000) was the first woman to become CEO of a FTSE 100 company when she held the title of Pearson PLC CEO 16 years ago . During her time at Pearson, Scardino was the first woman to become CEO of a FTSE 100 company when she held the title 16 years ago. The index of leading British stocks is similar to the S&P 500 in the U.S. In her words, not much has changed in that time when it comes to gender imbalance. Last year, she told the Telegraph that she 'thought in 1997 that by the time I left Pearson things would be different in terms of how many women there were as chief executives or chairmen or board members. It's not too different and for that I'm sorry.'","Marjorie Scardino, 66, named as the first woman in a major leadership position at the tech company .

It is 11,000 feet high . Two of the flight paths serving nearby Catania Airport, 20 miles from the crater, were closed briefly - but not one plane had to be diverted.

'As soon as it started I was trying to film the build-up on my terrace, then I looked up and the sky was huge and black. I covered my head with a sweatshirt and went out. 'The ash is not heavy but it's extremely sharp. Many cars got scratched and windshields got chipped as the stones are quite big. 'None of us were scared because Etna always reminds us of its presence. Sometimes you can hear it thundering and your windows vibrating - even the doors inside the house shudder.' Mount Etna stands almost 11,000 feet above sea level, looming over the whole Italian island of Sicily. Its last eruption on November 17 was even more dramatic than Saturday's blast and the mountain spewed out rivers of lava. It has been active for thousands of years, although its first eruption of modern times was thought to be in 475 BC.

The heartwarming story of how a Chili's server 'fixed' an autistic child's 'broken' burger has attracted more than half a million Likes on Facebook. Arianna Hill, aged seven, from Midvale, Utah, loves cheeseburgers, but couldn't eat one at her local restaurant chain on Sunday because it came chopped in half. When her older sister Anna MacLean asked what was wrong, the youngster calmly replied: 'Itâ€™s broken. I need another one that's fixed.' Heartwarming story: Arianna Hill, aged seven, who suffers from autism, couldn't eat a cheeseburger because it came chopped in half and appeared 'broken' but she was over joyed when a new 'fixed' one was served . Mrs MacLean, 25, explained the situation to a waitress . and said she was willing to pay for a new meal, but staff happily served up a whole burger and bun free of charge. She said that the act of kindness made a real difference to her day and she was 'touched' by the experience. When the new burger arrived, a delighted Arianna made staff laugh, as she sat showering it with kisses. Mrs MacLean captured the  'burger kiss' moment on camera and posted a photograph on Chili's official Facebook page with a caption detailing the chain of events. 'I was so touched by this experience. Especially since I know people who have been asked to leave restaurants . when their child with autism is being disruptive,' she wrote.

And another praised the restaurant staff for being so understanding and taking care of Arianna's request. 'Nice to see a restaurant staff who could react so positively to your daughter's 'broken' cheeseburger,' they wrote. 'My daughter had similar issues when she was younger and it was not easy to avoid meltdowns sometimes.' Recalling . the incident, Mrs MacLean said that when they arrived at the Chili's diner Arianna ordered her favorite meal - cheeseburger with pickles, french fries, . and chocolate milk. Helping hand: Anna MacLean with her autistic sister Arianna . But when the food arrived she wondered why the cheeseburger was left untouched. Arianna explained that she didn't want to eat the meat and cheese stack because it was 'broken'. Mrs MacLean soon realized that she was referring to the fact it was cut in two. 'Being a child with autism, she has to have certain things in a particular order at all times,' Mrs MacLean describes on Facebook. I've been with Chili's for 13 years and I've never been as proud as I am today' 'One slight change in her routine can change the course of the day instantly.' She told ABC News that Arianna's verbal skills 'arenâ€™t the best' but she can communicate on a basic level. Lauren Wells and Brad Cattermole - the sever and manager at Chili's who were shifting the day Arianna and Mrs MacLean visited - were quick to remedy the situation. Ms Wells happily took away the 'broken' burger and presented Arianna with a 'fixed' one, while Ms Cattermole offered the seven-year-old a heartfelt apology and an extra side of fries. Harrison Dixson, Chili's general manager ,said that he's received dozens of calls from people and authorities thanking him for the way his staff handled the situation. 'I can't tell you how proud I am of those two. I've been with this company for 13 years and I've never been as proud as I am today,' Mr Dixson said.","Arianna Hill, aged seven, from .

Proposals: New parents would get up to 15 months leave between them and be able to switch time off with little notice under Lib Dem plans (library image) Plans to allow new parents to ‘chop and change’ time off work in the first year of their child’s life are in turmoil after a bitter coalition row. To the anger of senior Conservatives, who argue businesses cannot be expected to cope with more rights for employees as the economy comes out of recession, their Liberal Democrat partners have proposed a dramatic extension of Government plans for shared parental leave. According to one senior Tory source, Lib Dems want to extend the maximum time off after the birth of a baby to 15 months and allow parents to repeatedly switch periods of leave between them. Business Secretary Vince Cable and equalities minister Jo Swinson are at odds with Tory colleagues over plans that couples must be allowed to switch leave up to at least half a dozen times, so that one has a spell at home, the other at work, before swapping over time and again. They also suggest that new parents should be guaranteed a return to the same job however long their period of leave. Currently, employers can offer an equivalent post after six months. The proposals are understood to have prompted a major row inside the coalition, with Conservative ministers, including Chris Grayling, Grant Shapps, Philip Hammond and Eric Pickles objecting so strongly that they have now been shelved. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who has condemned existing rules meaning new fathers only get two weeks off work as ‘Edwardian’, was on the point of announcing the extended parental leave package, drawn up by Miss Swinson. The coalition has agreed that new fathers should be able to take up to six months of paid leave from work. The Children and Families Bill will give them the right to ‘mix and match’ childcare arrangements in the first year of their baby’s life from April 2015. Employed mothers will still be entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave. However, working parents will have much greater flexibility about how they ‘mix and match’ their leave. They may take it in turns or take it together, providing it is not more than 52 weeks in total. Outrage: Ministers Eric Pickles, left, and Phillip Hammond, right, were said to be very strongly against the plans . Mothers will have to take at least the initial two weeks of leave after birth as a recovery period, but can then choose to end the maternity leave and parents can opt to share the remaining leave. Legislation to revolutionise the workplace by introducing flexible parental leave prompted dismay from some business leaders, who have said it will be a ‘nightmare’ to administer. The Government insists employees will have to give employers proper notice of their intention to take leave, to allow businesses to plan for absences. Employees must tell employers at least 15 weeks before the week a baby is expected when they want their leave to start, though they can change this with 28 days’ notice. Controversial: The dramatic extension of the government's plans were drawn up by Jo Swinson, pictured, equalities minister . However, according to one well-placed . source, Lib Dem ministers attempted to change the agreed package of . reforms so that couples could ‘chop and change’ shared parental leave . with less notice. The Lib Dems say firms only need eight weeks’ notice . of an employee’s intention to return, while the Tories say it should be . at least 12 weeks. The Lib Dems also are said to have suggested that the total leave period should be increased to 65 weeks and that employers lose the right to offer employees who return after more than six months an equivalent post, not necessarily the same one. ‘The Government has agreed a package of reforms with business and then all this extra stuff was all slipped in by the Lib Dems, even though a lot of it hadn’t even been consulted on,’ said the source. ‘It was actually about to be announced by Nick Clegg. How on earth would the typical small business with three or four employees contend with staff mixing and matching time off with a week’s notice?’ Shared parental leave is designed to smash the traditional assumption that it is the mother who should take time off work to care for a new child. Ministers say the measures will offer more flexibility to modern families where women are as likely as men to be the main breadwinner and allow fathers to spend more time with their children. The issue caused a Cabinet rift with some ministers having argued that pledges to extend parental leave and flexible working rights at a time of economic difficulty. Under existing rules, mothers are entitled to take 12 months maternity leave, of which nine months are paid. Fathers can take two weeks paid paternity leave. Slammed: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has condemned existing rules of two weeks paternity leave as ¿Edwardian¿ in the past . The Deputy Prime Minister said recently fathers should be able to do more of the ‘heavy lifting’ if mothers want to return to work after having a child. ‘We are revolutionising parental leave so it is not paternity leave anymore, it becomes parental leave,’ Mr Clegg said. ‘You and your wife or partner will be able to chop and change, and exchange the block of leave that presently is afforded to the mother through maternity leave, as you wish. ‘I know plenty of women who feel that they want to go back to work earlier than their partners or their husbands do, that’s just the way families are, obviously that’s great. ‘But we’ve got these Edwardian rules - I’ve experienced it myself three times. It’s crazy that when your child is born you’ve got just a couple of weeks, when in a sense you’re least relevant to the child, because they’re barely aware that you’re there.’ Miss Swinson wrote on Twitter that shared parental leave is ‘a fantastic, much-needed policy’. She insisted that Tory claims the Lib Dems had proposed a leave period as long as 65 weeks were ‘just wrong’.","Parents would get up to 15 months of leave between them in plan .

Dark side: Chris Patten blamed the 'dark side of globalisation' for the problem of immigration . Lord Patten has weighed in to the immigration debate by suggesting that British politicians are now unable to cope with the country’s ‘porous borders’. The Chairman of the BBC Trust and former Conservative minister blamed the ‘dark side of globalisation’ for the problem. Chris Patten also suggested that elected representatives were increasingly reluctant to tell people the truth about such vexed issues. His words – delivered to an international audience at the British Embassy in Paris – comes at a time when Britain is preparing to deal with an influx of immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria. Lord Patten said: ‘Today with porous borders, the amount that politicians and political leaders can actually do on their own is very limited, and I think that it’s a pity that people don’t make that point rather more vigorously.’ He said that ‘immigration, organised crime, drugs’ and ‘epidemic disease’ were just some of the ‘aspects of the dark sides of globalisation’ leaving national governments increasingly powerless. Referring to the September 11th 2001 attacks on America in which almost 3000 people died, Lord Patten said: ‘The 9/11 terrorists were paid for with credit cards – that’s the world we live in and I think it’s astonishing that politicians are so reluctant to say we’re not any more facing a series of challenges which are manageable within our own space, we’re trying to cope with a predicament. ‘It’s proved extremely difficult for political leaders to tell people what they may not want to hear and get elected. Worries: His words come at a time when Britain is preparing to deal with an influx of immigrants from Romania and Bulgaria. Pictured are eastern European workers queuing up outside the British Embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria, for visa applications . ‘And the general consequence has been that political leaders only tell people a bit of what they don’t want to hear, which doesn’t entirely prevent the growth of populism and parties on the extreme but can just about secure their election or near election.’ Lord Patten, who is also a former European Commissioner, said the problem with Brussels as it faced up to such problems was its lack of accountability. While ‘the buck stopped’ with leaders like David Cameron in Britain and Francois Hollande in France, there was no-one in Brussels who was ultimately to blame for anything. Lord Patten said: ‘I would give national parliaments a greater role in the legislative process and policy making in Brussels. Weak Brussels: Lord Patten, who is also a former European Commissioner, said the problem with Brussels as it faced up to such problems was its lack of accountability . ‘I would give them a red card as well as a yellow card when it came to proportionality and subsidiarity, and secondly I would create a parliamentary body, a sort of senate in Brussels – a body which represented national parliaments and had some kind of overriding view.’ Lord Patten warned against transferring any more power to the European parliament because ‘currently there isn’t any European demos’. On the growth of power of European institutions, Lord Patten said: ‘I think that at the moment we’re in a crazy world. I bet you would hardly find a single European political leader who thought that the right way to get greater accountability into the system would be by giving more power to the European parliament.’ No demos: Lord Patten warned against transferring any more power to the European parliament (pictured) because 'currently there isn't any European demos' In words which may anger Mr Cameron, Lord Patten also praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He said: ‘Quite interesting how Chancellor Merkel who is probably the most successful politician in Europe at the moment, has been very nervous of ever embracing any agenda for radical change. ‘If you look at the agenda, which she has agreed with her allies in the coalition you can see that confirmed.’ There were also stern words about Russia, whom Lord Patten suggested was living up to its international role as a ‘trouble maker’. Referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and to the disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, Lord Patten said: ‘In Europe we have been pretty weedy, as schoolboys would say, in the way we have dealt with Russia in the European Union. Weedy: Referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and to the disgraced former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, Lord Patten said, 'In Europe we have been pretty weedy, as schoolboys would say, in the way we have dealt with Russia in the European Union' ‘And I think we’re being pretty weedy at the moment in the way we are debating the future of the Eastern partnership and those countries which escaped the Russian empire of the 1970s and 80s and which Mr Putin would like to have back in the hutch. ‘Russia is of course a country with a great history, with great literature and artistic tradition but I don’t see much of that in Mr Putin frankly, and I’m not surprised that his best European friend is Mr Berlusconi.’ Lord Patten was a speaking about international affairs and answering questions on Thursday at an evening celebrating the purchase of the Ambassador’s Residence in Paris by the Duke of Wellington. It was hosted by the current Ambassador, Sir Peter Ricketts.","The former Tory minister blamed the ‘dark side of globalisation’ for issues .

A woman has been seriously injured and three show dogs killed after a lorry smashed into a broken down motor-home on one of Britain's busiest motorways. The incident on the M40 near Banbury in Oxfordshire, shut all three lanes of the northbound carriageway for almost 10 hours yesterday. Several corgis escaped from the vehicle, which had broken down on the hard shoulder, and caused problems on the motorway after the lorry jack-knifed at 5.40am. Smash: The remains of the motorhome, which had contained 12 dogs, can be seen here as police surround the crash site on the M40 . Carnage: Three of the dogs died in the collision, which occurred at 5.40am on Saturday . Response: Emergency services personnel investigate the scene on the motorway while all three northbound lanes were closed . Two other women, named by the Canine Chronicle as dog enthusiasts Lisa Croft-Elliot and Carrie Russell-Smith, were treated at the scene. The third, believed to be their assistant, is understood to have suffered a broken leg in the crash, along with a suspected collapsed lung and other fractures. The crash shut all three lanes of the carriageway after the lorry jack-knifed, according to police. Traffic heading southbound was also disrupted after several dogs which were in the motor-home at the time escaped from the wreckage and ran off, West Mercia Police said. One of the dogs - a male black and white Cardigan Corgi - was initially unaccounted for but was traced safe and well by the owners some hours after the crash, following an appeal on Twitter, Facebook and the Dog Lost website. Inspector Helen Thomas, of West Mercia Police, said: 'A call was received at 5.40am reporting a collision on the M40 motorway northbound between junctions 11 and 12. 'A heavy goods vehicle collided with a motor-home which was stationary on the hard shoulder while it was awaiting recovery. It contained three people and 12 dogs.

A number of the dogs escaped from the vehicle and ran off causing problems on the southbound carriageway. 'Three people suffered injuries; two minor and a third sustaining a broken leg.' She added the northbound carriageway was expected to remain closed until later this afternoon. Escaped: The dogs that escaped from the motor-home were corgis (file picture) A Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said that the two of the people travelling in the motor-home were trapped and had to be rescued by fire crews. The woman who found the dog that was initially unaccounted for, Anna Halcro-Johnston, an animal behavioural specialist, said that having set out to find the corgi, whose name was Darren, she spoke with a passing lorry driver who had seen the animal, and directed her to it. She described the reunion, later, with its owner as 'happy and tearful', adding 'there was lots of tail-wagging'. 'Knowing we've saved them from some of the day's heartache was enormously rewarding,' she said. A spokesman for the RAC said they were en-route to recover the caravan when the crash occured. He said: 'We are extremely saddened to learn that a young woman has been injured and that three dogs have lost their lives as a result of this incident.

Confession: San Jose State University President Mohammad Qayoumi said in a statement he and other school officials could have done more to protect the black student fro0m harassment . The president of San Jose State University has admitted that he 'failed' an African-American student whose white roommates were charged with hate crimes and battery after allegedly clamping a bicycle lock on his neck and calling him ‘three-fifths’ of a person. The . unnamed freshman from Santa Cruz said he was afraid to come home to the . four-bedroom dormitory suite he had shared with Logan Beaschler, 18, . Joseph Bomgardner, 19, and Colin Warren, 18, since late August. The . teens nicknamed the then-17-year-old 'three-fifths,' referring to how . the government once counted black people as a fraction of a person, and . simply 'fraction' when he protested to the name. The roommates allegedly hung the Confederate flag and wrote . the N-word on a chalk board in their living area, and locked the young man in his room. Student protests have been held at the California college since the allegations came to light last week, with some 500 people talking part in a march on campus last Thursday, KTVU reported. Three of the alleged victim’s former roommates were charged with misdemeanor hate crime and battery in connection to the racially charged harassment, which allegedly lasted for two months. They have been suspended from the university. A fourth student, who is a juvenile, faces the same charges, according to the San Jose Mercury News. School officials have said that student also was suspended. Public outcry: Champagne Ellison, left, a senior at San Jose State University, marches Nov. 21, 2013 in a protest over reported racial hazing of an African-American freshman by his dormitory roommates . Calls have been made by prominent black leaders to upgrade the charges against the white students accused of hate crimes . San Jose State University President Mohammad Qayoumi, in a statement on Monday said he and other school officials could have done more to protect the black student. ‘By failing to recognize the meaning of a Confederate flag, intervene earlier to stop the abuse or impose sanctions as soon as the gravity of the behavior became clear, we failed him. I failed him,’ Qayoumi stated. Pictured: Colin Warren, 18, is one of four SJSU students accused of hate crimes and battery . The university will appoint an independent expert to lead a task force that will examine the case and propose reforms, Qayoumi said, adding that campus officials should have helped student residence hall advisors recognize signs of abuse. On Saturday, Reverend Jethroe Moore II, the head of the San Jose/Silicon Valley NAACP, demanded the suspects’ charges be upgraded from misdemeanors to felonies, according to the Los Angeles Times. 'This is not simple hazing or bullying. This is obviously racially based terrorism targeted at their African American roommate,' Moore insisted. 'The community will not stand idly by and allow for any student of color to be terrorized simply due to the color of his skin.' Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen in a statement Monday said he and colleagues ‘understand the outrage’ of those calling for stiffer charges. But he said the charges are not ‘a reflection of the degree of ... racism’ the men are accused of displaying. ‘The charges are a reflection of their criminal conduct,’ Rosen said. ‘To date, we have charged the perpetrators with the most serious crimes based on the facts.' Horrific: Three white San Jose University, pictured, students are accused of committing hate crimes against their black roommate . 'I'm still in shock,' the freshman, now 18, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in a phone interview last week, adding that he'd never experienced such horrific treatment despite being one of only a few black students at his Santa Cruz high school. He said he didn't report the situation to campus police because he hoped it would stop. 'I tried not to dwell on this. But my family is upset and I'm upset,' he said. He later told university police he always locked his door at night because he was scared of most of the other students he lived with and said his grades suffered because he didn't feel safe studying in his room. The young men confessed to the . relentless harassment in police interviews but denied their actions were . racist, insisting instead the incidents were good-humored 'pranks.' Abuse: The suspects confessed to police that they wrestled the black freshman to the ground and put a metal bike lock, similar to that pictured, around his neck . University police, however, recommended District Attorney Jeff Rosen file the case as a hate crime and prosecutor Erin West emphatically agreed. 'The District Attorney's Office has no tolerance for those who criminally prey on others because they are different,' West told the newspaper. The students could face penalties ranging from probation to a year in jail if convicted. The university hasn't determined what sanctions it will hand down as its investigation is ongoing. The bullied student was assigned to live with seven young white men in the house in late August. In mid-October, his parents noticed a Confederate flag draped in the living room of the suite and the 'N-word' scrawled on a surface in the living room. Concerned, they reported it to housing officials who notified campus police and two of the roommates were immediately transferred to a different dorm. However, the San Jose Sentinel cites police reports as saying at least two residential assistants were already aware a Confederate flag was being displayed in the house. But instead of reporting the students, they asked the young men to take it out of a window 'so it could not be seen by the general public.' When asked about the Confederate flag, Beaschler reportedly told police it was a meant as an edgy joke to 'ruffle people's feathers' and referred to his Southern California roots, San Francisco Chronicle reported. The harassment was allegedly spurred on by a two-day orientation session that included sensitivity training. According to reports, the teens blocked the freshman's bedroom door with furniture on multiple occasions to prevent him from coming out. Another time, the suspects confessed to police, they wrestled him to the ground, putting a metal bike lock around his neck. The second time they tried this, he managed to escape but came away with bruises, he told police. In another instance, they took the doorknob from inside a closet and attempted to coerce the claustrophobic freshman to step inside with a series of nasty post-it notes. Nazi symbols, including swastikas and the 'SS' symbol, were found in the apartment and also a picture of Adolf Hitler, the Sentinel reported. When the alleged victim's father talked to the roommates and reported the bullying, the freshman received a sarcastic and at times threatening apology note that cited 'the Beloved Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Jr.' and was signed off 'The Residents.' 'The Residents have welcomed you, it is not advised to ignore the call of The Residents,' read a postscript.","San Jose State University President Mohammad Qayoumi stated that he and other school officials failed to stop the abuse .

His career as a powerful Democratic politician was cut short by his loyalty to mobster brother Whitey Bulger. But despite his forced retirement from the upper echelons of Boston life, William Bulger says he still visits his convicted murderer brother every week. It is typical of their relationship that has seen William Bulger remain publicly steadfast to his brother despite the damage to his career. Former president of the Massachusetts Senate William Bulger (left) has revealed he visits his mobster brother James 'Whitey' Bulger (right) in prison once a week in a show of continued loyalty . He was forced to resign as president of the University of Massachusetts system in 2003 and has kept a low profile since. But his silence has led to persistent . rumours that he knew more than he let on during Whitey Bulger's 16 years on the run. In a rare interview, the former president of the Massachusetts Senate said he just wants to be 'a brother' to Whitey and visits him weekly. William Bulger told WCVB: 'Just . because I visit him, doesn't mean I condone it'. However, he refused to . specify what he meant by 'it', saying he does not 'know what is true or . not'. Whitey Bulger was captured in 2011 and has now been jailed for life after a 40-year career of . murder, extortion, money-laundering, arms trafficking and drug dealing. William Bulger was forced to resign from president of Massachusetts university system after refusing to cooperate with the FBI over his fugitive brother and revealing he took a call from him . His notoriety and list of crimes and corrupt dealings with the FBI created large shadows over William Bulger. In 1970 the younger brother won a Senate seat and eight . years later was elected Senate president by the 40-member chamber, a . position he would hold for a record 17 years. But his relationship to a suspected multiple murderer eventually forced his resignation in 2003. His relationship with Whitey ultimately forced his resignation as president of the University of Massachusetts system in 2003. James 'Whitey' Bulger was jailed for life for murder, extortion, money-laundering, arms trafficking and drug dealing . Among those pressing William Bulger to resign from his university post was then-Republican Governor Mitt Romney. His decision came after he testified before a congressional committee investigating the FBI's ties to his brother, who by then had been revealed as an FBI informant. After receiving immunity, William acknowledged receiving a call from Whitey shortly after he fled. The tone of it was ""Don't believe everything that is being said about me,""' William Bulger said. 'I think he asked me to tell everybody he was OK. ... I think I said I hope this has a happy ending.' Two years earlier, William Bulger had told a grand jury he didn't urge his brother to surrender because he didn't 'think it would be in his interest to do so,' according to a transcript of his testimony obtained by The Boston Globe. 'It's my hope that I'm never helpful to anyone against him,' the younger Bulger said, according to the transcript. 'I don't feel an obligation to help everyone to catch him.' William Bulger did not attend his brother's trial but was at court for his arraignment. During the brief appearance in federal court, Whitey smiled at his younger brother and mouthed the word 'Hi.' William smiled back. Speaking briefly to reporters as he left the courthouse after his brother's arraignment - the first time they had seen each other in 16 years -  the former state Senate president appeared emotional. 'It's an unusual experience,' he said. Whitey Bulger with his younger brothers, William and Jackie . Commentators on the case say William Bulger not only sacrificed his own career, but chose loyalty over stopping bloodshed. Dick Lehr, co-author of 'Whitey: The Life Of America's Most Notorious Mob Boss', points out that it was Unabomber Ted Kaczynski's brother David who eventually led to him being caught.

Tony Blair planned to invade Zimbabwe with South African support and oust Robert Mugabe after the country descended into chaos, it was claimed yesterday. Former South African president Thabo Mbeki said Mr Blair asked for his help in 2000. But Mr Mbeki favoured a negotiated settlement and, despite pressure from Britain to join military action to depose Mr Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party, he refused. Pressure: Tony Blair and Thabo Mbeki in 2006. Mr Mbeki has attacked Mr Blair's interventionist foreign policy . Allegation: Mr Mbeki has claimed that 13 years ago Tony Blair asked him for help in 'invading' Zimbabwe . During his presidency from 1999 until . 2008 he said South Africa and Britain were in stark disagreement over . how to handle Mugabe. He added: ‘The problem was, we were speaking from . different positions. ‘There . were other people saying, “There are political problems, economic . problems – the best way to solve them is regime change. Mugabe must go”. This was the difference. ‘But we said, “Mugabe is part of the solution to this problem”.’ The . South African government helped to broker a power-sharing agreement . between Zanu-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in 2008. It later collapsed. Lord . Guthrie, who was Chief of the Defence Staff during Mr Blair’s first . term, disclosed in 2007 that ‘people were always trying to get me to . look at’ toppling Mr Mugabe by force. However . he did not say these requests had come from the Prime Minister himself, . and suggested he did not consider it a serious proposition. But . Mr Mbeki cited Lord Guthrie’s comments to the Al Jazeera TV channel . yesterday to corroborate his claim against Mr Blair. He added: ‘A . retired chief of the British armed forces said he had to withstand . pressure from Tony Blair, who was saying, “You must work out a military . plan so we can physically remove Robert Mugabe”. Talks: Tony Blair, pictured left with former South African president Thabo Mbeki, has strongly denied plotting military action against Robert Mugabe, right. Mr Mugabe's 33-year rule has included a crackdown on opponents . ‘We . knew that, because we had come under the same pressure, and that we . need to cooperate in some scheme – it was a regime change scheme – even . to the point of using military force, and we said “No”.’ He . claimed the idea was rejected because Britain had no right to decide . who leads African countries, adding: ‘You are coming from London, you . don’t like Robert Mugabe for whatever reason and we are going to remove . him and we are going to put someone else in his place? ‘Why . does it become British responsibility to decide who leads the people of . Zimbabwe? So we said, “No, let Zimbabweans sit down, let them talk”.’ Violent . land reforms in 2000 and 2001 saw some 4,000 white Zimbabweans forced . from their farms, while hyperinflation took the economy to the brink of . collapse. While Mr Blair . condemned the regime and backed tougher sanctions, Mr Mugabe accused . Britain of plotting to overthrow him and ‘recolonise’ Zimbabwe. A . spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘Tony Blair has long believed Zimbabwe . would be much better off without Robert Mugabe and always argued for a . tougher stance against him, but he never asked anyone to plan or take . part in any military intervention.’","Former president questioned how it was British people's responsibility .

England Under-21 captain Andre Wisdom's heart must have sank when his beloved £100,000 Porsche got stuck in a muddy ditch. The 20-year-old footballer was forced to abandon his car after it became submerged in the pit in the middle of remote woods around three miles from the nearest main road. It is thought the expensive car, which Wisdom has boasted about on social networking sites, became stuck in the 2ft deep, 15ft wide, 30ft long puddle sometime on Friday. Oops: Andre Wisdom's £100,000 Porsche got stuck in a muddy ditch in Derbyshire . But it was only discovered the following morning when mountain biker Pete Irons, came across the empty Porsche Panamera Turbo and informed police. Mr Irons, 41, said: 'I didn't really think much of it when I first saw it. I thought whoever it was was unlucky to have done that but I also thought it would be gone by the afternoon. 'When I came back through the woods a little later with friends it was still there. 'We were all joking about the poor guy who had managed to get it stuck and how much money it was going to cost them. The 20-year-old footballer was forced to abandon his car after it became submerged in the ditch in woodland . How did it end up there? The car was discovered by a mountain biker in remote woodland . Submerged: Andre Wisdom's £100,000 Porsche got stuck in this muddy ditch . To get to that point he would have to have come through an equally muddy section, I have no idea what he was thinking. 'I just can't believe he could have got that far to begin with, then to submerge it in that puddle. 'We are miles from any main road and the track doesn't go anywhere, it's just mind boggling how he ended up there. Nevermind: Andre Wisdom was forced to abandon his car after it became submerged in the ditch . 'He would have got so muddy trying to escape it too - there was no way he could have got out without getting covered.' The international footballer who plays in defence is currently on loan from Liverpool to Derby County. His team play six miles from where the car was discovered close to the Breadsall Priory Marriott Hotel on the outskirts of the city. But his hapless driving did not affect his performance on the pitch after Derby pulled off a convincing 3-0 win at home to Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday. It is unknown how the Porsche got into the ditch or how Wisdom escaped but the car was later moved by a Jeep Cherokee and driven away. 'I noticed a Jeep dragging it away later but it was too dark to look at who it was driving,' added Pete. 'It seemed okay enough, just a bit muddy. A neighbour said she saw a very muddy Porsche driving down the road a little after that, apparently it was emitting a massive cloud of white smoke as it was going. 'I think it will definitely need a bit of TLC in a garage.' Wisdom was not available for comment today but Derby County said a Sat Nav error had led Wisdom into the muddy ditch. A club spokesman said: 'Andre visited a local shop on the way to Saturday's game against Sheffield Wednesday and, being new and unfamiliar to the area, he programmed the stadium's postcode into his Sat Nav. 'The route provided took him down a less than traditional road, where conditions were also poor, and ultimately his car got stuck and he, along with the club, made suitable arrangements to ensure he was at Pride Park Stadium on time for the game and his car was recovered on Saturday evening.'","The 20-year-old footballer was forced to abandon his car after it became submerged in a large puddle in Derbyshire woodland .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 01:46 EST, 22 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:46 EST, 22 November 2013 . A reclusive copper heiress' estate is seeking more than $100 million from a doctor and a hospital where she spent two decades, furthering a fight over her fortune after a feud over her disputed will was resolved. Dr. Henry Singman and Beth Israel Medical Center were less dedicated to Huguette Clark's welfare than their own, says a lawsuit filed on Thursday. A public administrator's office, a local government entity, represents the estate of Clark, whose father was a Montana copper baron and founded Las Vegas. Gracious: Huguette was shy, but not sad. Her friends and the few relatives who knew her describe her as cheerful, gracious, stubborn, and devoted to her art. She poses at about age 37 . 'Beth Israel abandoned its duties and responsibilities when it learned that a very rich patient was in its eye,' and Singman 'placed his own interests above those of his patient,' the lawsuit says. Singman's lawyer, Harold L. Schwab, called the lawsuit 'outrageous'. The hospital's lawyer, Lawrence Fox, declined to comment. Clark died at Beth Israel at age 104 in 2011, leaving no close relatives and a roughly $300 million estate. She had glorious homes in New York, Connecticut and California but had lived in the hospital since 1991, though she didn't need its care most of that time. Distant relations raised concerns about gifts Clark had lavished on those around her, including more than $4million to the hospital, more than $800,000 to Singman and his family and about $31 million to her main private-duty nurse, court papers say. The nurse isn't among those being sued in the newly filed case. The questions deepened as it emerged . that Clark had signed two very different wills within six weeks in 2005. The first mainly benefited her distant kin; the second cut them out. A . September settlement in the will fight largely benefited arts charities . and the relatives. It left a door open to further court action over . gifts doled out during Clark's life. Family of fortune: Ms Clark, right, as a child in 1917 with her wealthy father and her sister Andree . The new lawsuit says the hospital and Singman let Clark stay - violating regulations that require discharging patients once they no longer need treatment - to extract presents from her. It also faults Singman for not having Clark undergo psychiatric evaluation and says he and others violated hospital policies against employees accepting personal gifts. The hospital, Singman and others who tended to Clark have long maintained she was mentally sharp, if eccentric, and lived and gave as she desired. Singman was unaware of any gift policy, wasn't a hospital employee part of the time in question and provided care that helped Clark live as she chose, his lawyer said Thursday. ""The concept that Dr. Singman did something improper, in any way whatsoever, is absolutely absurd,"" Schwab said. Any money recovered would be split among Clarks' relatives and arts institutions. A biography about Huguette Clark's life, Empty Mansions, lifts the lid on her mysterious, reclusive life.

A tiny book of psalms from 1640, believed to be the first book printed in what's now the United States, sold for just under $14.2 million on Tuesday, setting an auction record for a printed book. The Bay Psalm Book, which was auctioned at Sotheby's in Manhattan, had a pre-sale estimate of $15 million to $30 million. A copy of John James Audubon's 'Birds of America' was the previous record-holder, selling for $11.5 million at Sotheby's in 2010. Only 11 copies of the Bay Psalm Book survive in varying degrees of completeness. The book sold at Sotheby's was one of . two owned by Boston's Old South Church, which voted to sell it to . increase its grants and ministries. Scroll down for video . Described as 'the world's most valuable book', this Bay Psalm Book, which is the first book ever printed in what is now the United States, sold at Sotheby's for just under $14.2 million . With a pre-sale between $15 to $30 million, the book was published in Cambridge, Mass., by the Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1640 . Samuel Adams was a member and Benjamin Franklin was baptized at the church, which was established in 1669. 'This is enormous for us,' said the Rev. Nancy Taylor, senior minister of the church. 'It is life-changing for the ministries we can do.' The book was bought over the phone by American businessman and philanthropist David Rubenstein, who plans to lend it to libraries around the country. The sale price included the buyer's premium. In April, Taylor called the book 'spectacular' and said it is 'arguably one of the most important books in this nation's history'. The church owned five copies of the 6-inch-by-5-inch book. One is now at the Library of Congress, one is at Yale University and one is at Brown University. The . book was published in Cambridge, Mass., by the Puritan leaders of the . Massachusetts Bay Colony just 20 years after the Pilgrims landed at . Plymouth. It was supposed . to be a faithful translation into English of the original Hebrew psalms - . puritans believed selected paraphrases would compromise their . salvation. The 1,700 copies were printed on a press shipped from London. 'Arguably one of the most important books in this nation's history', the book was bought over the phone by American businessman and philanthropist David Rubenstein, who plans to lend it to libraries around the country. A yellowed title page, adorned with decorative flourishes, reads: 'The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Faithfully Translated into English Metre.' At the bottom, it says: 'Imprinted 1640.' Historians believe an almanac may have come off the press before the Bay Psalm Book. But the chief of rare books and special collections at the Library of Congress, Mark Dimunation, has said the almanac was more of a pamphlet or a broadsheet than a book. No copy of the almanac exists today. Dimunation noted that in the Americas, in general, books were printed in what is now Mexico as early as 1539. 'American poetry, American spirituality and the printed page all kind of combine and find themselves located in a single volume,' Dimunation said of the Bay Psalm Book. The last time a copy came on the auction block, in 1947, it sold for a record auction price of $151,000, surpassing auction prices for the Gutenberg Bible, Shakespeare's First Folio and 'Birds of America.'. The auction record for any book goes to the Leonardo da Vinci Codex Hammer, a personal notebook of scientific writings and diagrams.

Commuters in London could soon pick up Amazon orders at their local underground station under plans to turn ticket offices into parcel drop-off points. Transport for London is reportedly in talks with the online retail giant after it announced it's going to close all 240 ticket offices by 2015 with the loss of 750 jobs. Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced . the closures yesterday, along with a 24 hour tube service on certain lines over the weekend, saying he wants to fully automate tickets . sales instead. But today it was reported that TfL is now in talks with Amazon over possibly converting the hundreds of empty offices into parcel collection points. Plans: TfL are reportedly in talks with Amazon to turn ticket offices, left empty by plans to fully automate ticket sales by 2015, into parcel collection points . 'Click and collect': Pick-up lockers, similar to this one pictured, could be installed in the empty offices . It is thought that pick-up lockers - which allow customers to collect goods bought online and avoid missing a delivery to their home - would be installed in the spaces. The news comes as supermarket giant Asda . announced a deal with TfL earlier this week to launch similar 'click . and collect' services in car parks of six Underground stations. Instead of delivering a parcel an address, Amazon customers can opt for their purchases to be dropped at a locker location. This removes the risk of being out when it is delivered in the post. Once the parcel arrives at the locker, the buyer will get an e-mail notification with a unique pick-up code and a barcode. The email will also include details of when the lockers - often located in supermarkets - are open. When the customer arrives at the locker, they then enter the pick-up code or scan the barcode, releasing the package. Customers have three business days to collect the parcel before it is sent back to the Amazon depot for a refund. The service costs £1.99 for next day delivery or customers can chose a free service - where goods take around two business days to reach the lockers. When contacted today, Amazon declined to comment. Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL said 'We have set out our vision for the future of the Tube which includes the introduction of 24 hour services at weekends, simpler ticketing, easier refunds and Wi-Fi across our network. All Tube stations will continue to be staffed and controlled at all times. 'As part of our broader commercial development, we are working with retailers to transform the services on offer for our  customers. This week it was announced that we are working with Asda on a trial to offer click and collect services at six of our London Underground station car parks and are looking to work with other retailers to offer similar services.' Yesterday Mr Johnson and London . Underground Managing Director Mike Brown announced the radical changes . to the Tube network - which will be implemented over the next two years. They said six major . central London stations will have special customer points to help . tourists with ticket machines, while every station will be staffed while . the tube is running. As well as closing ticket offices, they announced the Tube will run 24 hours a day on Fridays and Saturdays on certain lines. The vast majority of stops on the new night route map are north of the River Thames. The new weekend service will run on core parts of the system - initially the Piccadilly, Victoria, Central and Jubilee lines and parts of the Northern line. Other initiatives announced included improved ticket machines, contactless bank card payment technology from next year, extended Wi-Fi coverage at underground stations, and staff based in ticket halls and on platforms rather than in ticket offices. Announcement: Mayor of London Boris Johnson (left) with London Underground Managing Director Mike Brown (right) announcing the radical changes to the network yesterday . TfL says the changes will be better for customers and help save more than £40m a year. Mr Johnson said: ‘For 150 years the Tube . has been the beating heart of London, its tunnels and tracks providing . the arteries that have transported millions of people and helped to . drive the development and economic growth of our great city. ‘Now . it is time to take the Tube to the next level and so for the first time . in London's history, we will provide a regular 24-hour Night Tube . service at weekends. Radical: The Mayor announced a weekend service will run through the night on the system - initially the Piccadilly, Victoria, Central and Jubilee lines and parts of the Northern line . 'This will not just boost jobs and our . vibrant night-time economy, it will further cement London's reputation . as the best big city on the planet to in which to live, work, visit and . invest.’ But there was threats of retaliation from unions yesterday. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, accused London Mayor Boris Johnson of being the ‘hypocrite of the decade’, saying the announcement would lead to the closure of all 268 Tube ticket offices by the end of next year . The Rail Maritime and Transport union warned of industrial action, adding that staffing levels will be 'decimated'. General . secretary Bob Crow said: 'The Mayor must believe he is some sort of . magician if he thinks he can slash jobs and still run safe services when . everyone knows that staffing has already been cut to the bone while . passenger demand continues to rise. 'Throwing . in the plan for night time operation at the weekends is just a . smokescreen to try and camouflage the real issue which is a savage cuts . to jobs, access and safety. 'We . will work with sister unions and the public to fight these plans and . that means using every campaigning, political and industrial tool at our . disposal and our executive will be looking at a timetable and a . strategy for that campaign, including a ballot for industrial action.' ‘It beggars belief that the Mayor who was elected in 2008 on a pledge to keep open every ticket office is now planning to close every single one, with all that means for safety and jobs.’ They will be campaigning to reverse the decision. Shadow London minister Sadiq Khan criticised a reduction in staff, adding: ‘The Mayor of London has today ripped up his manifesto promise to the people of London. As a result of his plans, Londoners will feel more anxious travelling at times when stations may be deserted. ‘Commuters will have nowhere to turn when their Oyster card is lost, stolen or broken. It will make the daily commute more difficult for everyone but, more worryingly, there are serious concerns about whether there will be enough staff at London's busy stations to respond in emergency situations.’ London Underground said it was committed to delivering the reduction in operational staff numbers ‘without any compulsory redundancies'. Managing Director Mr Brown defended the job cuts. He said: ‘People are at the heart of this vision - our customers and staff. 'My commitment to London is that all Tube stations will continue to be staffed and controlled in future, with more staff visible and available to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journey and keep them safe and secure.’ The plan aims to deliver savings of £270million over the term of Transport for London's business plan to 2020/21.","Mayor of London announced closure of all 240 ticket offices on network .

Virtual currency Bitcoin has passed the $1,000 (£613) mark for the first time since it was introduced in 2009. According to the currency's main exchange, Mt.Gox, the price for a single Bitcoin has more than tripled since its previous record high of $267 (£165) less than three weeks ago . At the start of the month the currency more than doubled its value within a week - jumping from $100 to $266. It then hit $267 on 6 November. The digital currency is increasingly being treated like gold, with some investors using it to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on its rise. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy. The current rises follow the launch of the world’s first Bitcoin ATM, dubbed Robocoin, in a Vancouver coffee shop. The blue and silver ATM machine, which is operated by Vancouver-based Bitcoiniacs and Nevada-based Robocoin, changes bitcoins to Canadian dollars and vice versa. Users scan their hand to confirm identity, and then funds move to or from a virtual wallet on their smartphone. The ATM, named Robocoin, allows users to buy or sell the digital currency known as bitcoins. Once only used for black market sales on the internet, bitcoins are starting to be accepted at a growing number of businesses .

But critics say that also makes Bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities. A Bitcoin investor, Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, recently made more than half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £17 of currency four years ago. The system limits transfers to $1,000 (£623) a day, in an effort to curb money laundering and other fraud. Bitcoiniacs, the local dealer that operates the ATM, will roll out four other kiosks across Canada in December. By the end of 2014, they expect to roll the technology out worldwide. Bitcoin is not a recognised currency in Canada, so Ottawa's anti-money laundering watchdog, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre, does not monitor its trade.

Horrific: Ladner was struck head-on when 67-year-old Barry Belyea crossed into her lane. Both drivers were pinned into what had been their cars but had become a single mangled mass of steel . Abby, a beautiful brunette student at the University of Maine, held the title of Miss Northern Maine at the time of her death. Her fight to stay alive began after the October crash, when 67-year-old Barry Belyea of Portland Maine was driving his ford pickup and veered slightly into a lane of oncoming traffic. Abby had the misfortune of being in that lane, driving straight toward Belyea. Her Honda smashed headlong into the truck, crushing Abby’s car. Police photos from the scene show a mangled mass of steel where there had once been two vehicles. Somehow, Belyea walked away with minor injures. While the driver of the other car walked away with minor injuries, Abby's were severe. In addition to broken bones, she suffered serious brain trauma. After the October 27, she would spend the last three weeks of her life in critical condition at the brink of death . Praying: Abby's family--including her father Troy and mother Saré Giberson--spent the three weeks leading up to their daughter's death hoping a miracle would happen . Abby wasn’t nearly as lucky. Despite wearing her seat belt, she was left with several broken bones and a serious head injury and flown by plane to Eastern Maine Medical Center, according to the Bangor Daily News. She died there on Sunday, November 16 around 3:30pm after three weeks in critical condition. As her family waited in anguish over the course of those weeks to see if their daughter would somehow pull through, the community responded in kind with donations to help her father Troy Ladner and mother Saré Giberson cover mounting medical costs. While her small Maine community prayed for Abby, who was the reining Miss Northern Maine, they rallied around her family and raised thousands to offset her medical costs . Too late: A local radio station organized a dinner benefit for Abby and her family in the days before her death, to be held December 4 . An online fundraiser started in Abby’s name had earned accrued $1,767 by the time Abby succumbed to her injuries, nearly $300 more than its goal. The kindly proprietors of a local radio station must now be reeling as well. Tiny Presque Isle’s Q96.1 station organized a benefit in the days before Abby’s death. They planned to hold a charity dinner for Abby and her family on December 4. Final goodbye: Despite Abby's death on November 16, the supper benefit in her name will go on. Organizers hope to turn it into a memorial service where a devastate community can give a fitting farewell to their beloved beauty queen . Though Abby has now passed on, organizer Brooke Beaulieu says the dinner will still be held and hopes it will serve as time for the grieving small community to give a final goodbye to their tragically killed beauty queen. ‘It is still on, with the okay of the family,’ Beaulieu wrote on the Supper benefit’s Facebook page. ‘It’s a great opportunity to show support and love for Abby’s family during this difficult time as well as celebrate Abby's precious life.’ Though the cause of the tragic crash remains under investigation, police do not believe speeding or alcohol were factors.","Abby Ladner, 19, was a promising college student and the reigning Miss Northern Maine when she was critically injured in an October head on collision .

Ban: Morrisons has banned unaccompanied under-16s from buying energy drinks like Red Bull . Red Bull and other caffeine-loaded energy drinks are taken by millions to pep them up when they are tired or hungover. In bars and clubs, Red Bull is a popular mixer with vodka and other spirits. Sales in Britain top £200million a year. The drink started as a tonic to keep Thai truck drivers and factory workers awake during long shifts. The ban applies to drinks containing at least 150mg of caffeine per litre - including Red Bull (320mg), Monster (338mg), and Relentless (320mg). Morrisons is believed to be the first major UK retailer to bring in this restriction, although similar bans have been introduced in Sweden, Denmark and France. It comes amid health fears about extreme-caffeine intake by children who consume energy drinks. The soft drinks have long been a source of controversy - and have even been linked to deaths. Last month, a family announced it was suing Red Bull for $85million (£52million) following the death of a father-of-one who died from a heart attack after downing the soft drink. Cory Terry, 33, from Brooklyn, consumed the caffeine-based drink 45 minutes after playing basketball at Stephen Decatur Middle School in Brooklyn on November 8, 2011. He then collapsed and died. Checks: Supermarket staff have been told to challenge customers to prove their age if they look under 25 . The ban applies to drinks containing at least 150mg of caffeine per litre - including Monster and Relentless . Mr Terry's relatives are blaming the company which makes the energy boosting beverage for his death. However, a Red Bull spokeman said that health authorities across the world have said it is safe to consume. Shops have come under increasing pressure to stop selling high-caffeine drinks - with a Morrisons insider admitting that the company is frequently lobbied by MPs on the issue. However, some shoppers have not taken kindly to the restriction. Death: Cory Terry, 33, from Brooklyn, died after drinking a can of popular soft drink Red Bull . Kate Webber, 23, said she was shocked to be asked for proof of age before being sold Red Bull at the supermarket's Southwood store in Farnborough, Hampshire. Ms Webber, who was with her one-year-old son Oscar, said: 'At first I thought she was joking but she just sat there and gave me a serious look. 'I couldn’t believe they were asking for ID for a can of Red Bull. I was stunned. I am used to showing proof of age for alcohol because I look young, I have a baby face, but 16?' However, after being informed about the ban, Ms Webber said she had decided to back the restriction. 'It’s sensible. When I was younger I loved Red Bull, it was like an adult drink, a step up from Coke,' she said. 'But I know people worry about the affects it can have, especially on kids, so I think it’s right.' Morrisons spokesman Claire Johnson said the restriction is currently being trialled in selected Morrisons stores, with a view to rolling it out nationwide. 'We understand the concern that exists over the potential impact of high caffeine energy drinks on young people and are taking steps to address this,' she said. 'We adhere to the British Soft Drinks Association (BSDA) code of practice. This states that products containing more than 150mg caffeine per litre must carry the warning ""Not suitable for children, pregnant women and persons sensitive to caffeine"". 'Currently, a number of our stores are not selling high caffeine drinks to under-16s unless they are accompanied by an adult. 'We are also implementing Challenge 25 scheme to ensure this is enforced consistently. 'We will monitor the impact of this policy carefully before deciding whether to roll it out across all of our stores.","Supermarket staff are challenging customers who look under 25 .

"Facebook . By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 04:19 EST, 10 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:36 EST, 10 May 2013 . There is little argument that Facebook has become part of the fabric of social interaction over the past few years. From a forum to share photos and events to a way to reconnect with old friends, there are many positives to the social networking phenomenon, however it also has the ability to drive many of its users mad. Hundreds of new digital social faux pas and annoyances have emerged from Facebook, and vlogger Emily Hartridge, with the help of radio presenter and friend Christian Williams, has identified ten of the worst offenders in her latest video. Emily tackles the downsides of the ever present Facebook in her latest video, complete with her signature comic sketches . 1.    Couples who feel the need to broadcast their love for each other…every day . Whether you are single or loved up yourself, the irritation of couples who post updates on every (perfectly sickening) stage of their relationship is universal. Emily points out: ‘Ok, you’re in love, but I don’t need to be reminded how in love you are everyday on Facebook.’ 2.    People pretend to lead the perfect life . While we all might be guilty of it to some degree, the filtering of life’s highs and lows to leave only posed, smiling faces in fabulous surroundings can begin to grate after one or two scrolls through your news feed. While you might feel anything but happy (left) your Facebook page will still display your life as perfect (right) 3.    It provides a platform for people to brag . An extension of reason two, Facebook also provides a platform for those who, not content with merely implying their life is perfect, feel the need to specifically announce it. You might have a dream job, a loving husband and two perfect children at the moment, but as Emily points out: ‘You know what, not everyone’s life is that perfect right now, so you’re just rubbing your perfect life in our faces.’ 4.    Facebook causes a ridiculous number of arguments . From ‘liking’ the wrong status, accepting a friend request from a friend’s enemy, to the minefield of ‘relationship status’, Facebook causes  arguments at an astonishing rate. Ironically, since it is ultimately designed as a social network to bring people together, Facebook  now causes arguments that prior to its existence, simply would not have happened. 5.    People have personal conversations on it for all to see . A perfect way to indulge your nosy side - or end up feeling very left out - is to go on Facebook. People continue to have private discussions out in the very open forum of the ‘wall’, perfectly aware that their plans to meet up or holiday in-jokes can be read by all their friends. 6.    Tagging when performed by anyone but yourself . Probably the most universally annoying thing about Facebook is the ‘tagging’ function on photos. From drunken nights you’d rather forget, to angles that make you look like a portly gargoyle, everyone will have been tagged in a unflattering photo. Emily puts it well when she says: ‘Tagging, it’s a dangerous game when you’re not in control.’ Facebook causes what may seem ridiculous, but yet are very real, arguments . 7.    Whenever the weather reaches an extreme, everyone feels the need to post it . Come sun, rain or snow, one thing that can be relied upon in the unstable British weather is that people will post about it on Facebook. This despite the fact that we all will be experiencing exactly the same inclement or pleasant climate – for real. 8.    Attention seekers can go to town with cryptic and depressing statuses . Facebook provides a platform like no other for those who wish to illicit a reaction and glean attention from their friends. We all know they want you to ask what's wrong and offer sympathy, but whether or not they are actually sad/depressed/ in crisis, Facebook is not he forum to publicise it. The perils of tagged photographs is demonstrated by Emily's friend, and Capital FM radio presenter Christian Williams . 9.    The new ‘seen’ button means you can no longer pretend to have not read messages . Yet another social faux pas created by Facebook, the ‘seen’ button meaning that sidestepping invitations you’d rather miss or awkward messages you would rather avoid has become much more difficult . 10.    Your only options when someone adds you are ‘confirm’ and ‘not now’ Emily sums this annoyance up best when  she says: ‘Why do I have a choice of ‘not now’? Where is the ‘never’ button?!’ See more of Emily's videos on her Youtube channel here . Follow Emily on Twitter .","You Tube star Emily Hartridge attacks Facebook in latest vlog .

Vacancies: Hundreds of foreign nurses are being flown in to plug a crisis in NHS staffing (file picture) Hundreds of foreign nurses are being flown in to plug a crisis in NHS staffing. At least 40 hospital trusts have actively recruited from abroad, with 1,360 nurses being signed up from countries from Spain and Portugal to Australia and the Philippines. With another 41 planning to launch recruitment drives, and NHS recruitment fairs scheduled for Madrid and Lisbon in January,  the number could easily double. Budget cuts, recruitment freezes, redundancies and a reduction training posts are blamed creating a ‘hidden workforce crisis’, with almost 20,000 nursing, health visiting and midwifery posts vacant. But while the new arrivals will help understaffed wards deal with the extra pressures of winter, there are concerns about the communication skills of some of the staff, as well as their experience and training. While non-EU applicants must pass a rigorous English test, EU rules on freedom of labour have stopped the Nursing and Midwifery Council watchdog from carrying out language tests on Europeans before allowing them on its register. Hospitals can set their own tests but a Mail investigation found that few do, with many assuming the new staff members will have already been asked to prove their language ability. In recent years, patients have been told how they have been forced to use sign language to communicate with staff and some hospitals have resorted to sticking pictures of medical equipment on cupboard doors, rather than written lists, so that nurses know where to find everything. Joyce Robins, of campaign group Patient Concern, said that elderly patients can find communication problems particularly stressful. There are also worries about differences in training, including knowledge of the admin that forms a large part of a nurses’ duties in Britain. In the wake of the Mid-Staffordshire scandal, where staff shortages contributed to the deaths of up to 1,200 patients, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt promised the NHS will recruit an extra 3,700 nurses by 2014.

Penny Venables, of Worcester Acute Hospitals Trust, which has taken on 20 Spanish nurses, told the Independent on Sunday: ‘There is a lot of interest from Spain and Greece and countries where there have been economic challenges. ‘It is something every trust is doing and we would not rule out doing it again.’ Howard Catton, policy director at the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘When employers are getting on planes to recruit nurses, you know you have a crisis in workforce supply. ‘That is happening right here, right now.’ Labour questioned why trainee nursing training is being cut when there is a staff shortage.","1,360 nurses have been signed up from countries like Spain and the Philippines .

The description of the grant goes on to say that the $1.1million will be used to increase the organization's capacity 'to expand its well-established story-bank operation to produce' more stories from real Americans about their experiences with Obamacare. The story was first reported by Capitol City Project - a right-wing investigative news group based out of DC. On its website, Families USA asks users to share their stories relating to the Affordable Care Act in an effort to illustrate 'the human need for health reform.' Storyteller: Ron Pollack, the co-founder and executive director of Families USA said the purpose of the Story Bank is to 'bridge the information gap' for people who can benefit from Obamacare . ‘Now that we’ve crossed the finish line, it's time to educate the public about health reform and how it will affect them,’ the site proclaims. ‘The best way to do that is to tell your story, giving a real example of the status quo and the impact of change.’ In the 'Story Bank' section of the portal, Families USA outlines the kind of examples it's interested in collecting, among them tales of individuals and small businesses who will buy insurance on the new exchanges; people who have been hit hard by the lack of Medicaid expansion in their state; patients with pre-existing conditions who now can get insured, and others. ‘The purpose is to bridge the information gap for people who can significantly benefit from the Affordable Care Act,’ Ron Pollack, the co-founder and executive director of Families USA, told Time Magazine last month.

Great flood: The Colorado River will flood the Grand Canyon on Monday as part of an ongoing experiment to rebuild beaches and restore fish habitat in the iconic gorge . The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation oversaw a similar flood from Glen Canyon Dam last November. The difference this year is that three times the sediment is available to be pushed through the river. The amount is equivalent to filling a football field-sized hole that is 690 feet deep. According to the Arizona Daily Sun, an Olympic-sized swimming pool of water will be pumped into the river every other second.

Full flush: Authorities want to clear out the millions of tons of sediment that settled at the bottom of the river due to the dam . The Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado in northern Arizona has caused many of the beaches downriver to slowly erode. Many have disappeared altogether.

An Italian court today accused Silvio Berlusconi of bribing witnesses in a trial linked to the case in which was convicted of paying for sex with a minor. The accusation came in a written judgment from the trial of three associates of the former prime minister who are charged with procuring prostitutes for parties at his home near Milan.

The court said today that evidence against Berlusconi and others implicated had been sent to prosecutors who are expected to open a new investigation into the case, court documents showed. It said there was evidence Berlusconi had paid 'money and other benefits' to young women who had taken part in the parties near Milan to give false testimony in the case, one of a number of scandals which overshadowed the end of his last government in 2011. It said the regular monthly payments of at least €2,500 (£2,081; $3,400) to witnesses in trials in which the 77-year-old Berlusconi was implicated 'is not an anomaly but an illegal action. It is evidence of corruption.'

Does it matter that Americans are suspicious of one another? Yes, say worried political and social scientists. What's known as 'social trust' brings good things. A society where it's easier to compromise or make a deal. Where people are willing to work with those who are different from them for the common good. Where trust appears to promote economic growth. Distrust, on the other hand, seems to encourage corruption. At the least, it diverts energy to counting change, drawing up 100-page legal contracts and building gated communities. Even the rancor and gridlock in politics might stem from the effects of an increasingly distrustful citizenry, said April K. Clark, a Purdue University political scientist and public opinion researcher. 'It's like the rules of the game,' Clark said. 'When trust is low, the way we react and behave with each other becomes less civil.' He's not alone: Beliefs people develop in their twenties are likely to stay with them throughout the rest of their lives . There's no easy fix. In fact, some studies suggest it's too late for most Americans alive today to become more trusting. That research says the basis for a person's lifetime trust levels is set by his or her mid-twenties and unlikely to change, other than in some unifying crucible such as a world war. People do get a little more trusting as they age. But beginning with the baby boomers, each generation has started off adulthood less trusting than those who came before them. The best hope for creating a more trusting nation may be figuring out how to inspire today's youth, perhaps united by their high-tech gadgets, to trust the way previous generations did in simpler times. There are still trusters around to set an example. Dennis Hess trusts people and even sells his produce next to an unlocked cash box . Pennsylvania farmer Dennis Hess is one. He runs an unattended farm stand on the honor system. Customers pick out their produce, tally their bills and drop the money into a slot, making change from an unlocked cashbox. Both regulars and tourists en route to nearby Lititz, Pa., stop for asparagus in spring, corn in summer and, as the weather turns cold, long-neck pumpkins for Thanksgiving pies. 'When people from New York or New Jersey come up,' said Hess, 60, 'they are amazed that this kind of thing is done anymore.' Hess has updated the old ways with technology. He added a video camera a few years back, to help catch people who drive off without paying or raid the cashbox. But he says there isn't enough theft to undermine his trust in human nature. A true believer in the honor system, Hess has an unattended farm stand . 'I'll say 99 and a half percent of the people are honest,' said Hess, who's operated the produce stand for two decades. There's no single explanation for Americans' loss of trust. The best-known analysis comes from 'Bowling Alone' author Robert Putnam's nearly two decades of studying the United States' declining 'social capital,' including trust. Putnam says Americans have abandoned their bowling leagues and Elks lodges to stay home and watch TV. Less socializing and fewer community meetings make people less trustful than the 'long civic generation' that came of age during the Depression and World War II. Not self serving: This self service farm stand is based on trust and dignity . University of Maryland Professor Eric Uslaner, who studies politics and trust, puts the blame elsewhere: economic inequality. Trust has declined as the gap between the nation's rich and poor gapes ever wider, Uslaner says, and more and more Americans feel shut out. They've lost their sense of a shared fate. Tellingly, trust rises with wealth. 'People who believe the world is a good place and it's going to get better and you can help make it better, they will be trusting,' Uslaner said. 'If you believe it's dark and driven by outside forces you can't control, you will be a mistruster.' African-Americans consistently have expressed far less faith in 'most people' than the white majority does. Racism, discrimination and a high rate of poverty destroy trust. 'They are amazed that this kind of thing is done anymore,' Hess said of visitors from New York . Nearly 8 in 10 African-Americans, in the 2012 survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with principal funding from the National Science Foundation, felt that 'you can't be too careful.' That figure has held remarkably steady across the 25 GSS surveys since 1972. The decline in the nation's overall trust quotient was driven by changing attitudes among whites. It's possible that people today are indeed less deserving of trust than Americans in the past, perhaps because of a decline in moral values. 'I think people are acting more on their greed,' said Murawski, a computer specialist who says he has witnessed scams and rip-offs. 'Everybody wants a comfortable lifestyle, but what are you going to do for it? Where do you draw the line?' Ethical behavior such as lying and cheating are difficult to document over the decades. It's worth noting that the early, most trusting years of the GSS poll coincided with Watergate and the Vietnam War. Trust dropped off in the more stable 1980s. Crime rates fell in the 1990s and 2000s, and still Americans grew less trusting. Many social scientists blame 24-hour news coverage of distant violence for skewing people's perceptions of crime. Can anything bring trust back? Uslaner and Clark don't see much hope anytime soon. Thomas Sander, executive director of the Saguaro Seminar launched by Putnam, believes the trust deficit is 'eminently fixable' if Americans strive to rebuild community and civic life, perhaps by harnessing technology. After all, the Internet can widen the circle of acquaintances who might help you find a job. Email makes it easier for clubs to plan face-to-face meetings. Googling someone turns up information that used to come via the community grapevine. But hackers and viruses and hateful posts eat away at trust. And sitting home watching YouTube means less time out meeting others. 'A lot of it depends on whether we can find ways to get people using technology to connect and be more civically involved,' Sander said. 'The fate of Americans' trust,' he said, 'is in our own hands.'","An AP-GfK poll conducted last month found that Americans are suspicious of each other in everyday encounters .

A man's body was recovered by fire crews on Friday after it is believed he was swept away by swelling waters in the Santa Cruz River, Arizona. Tom Niziol, winter weather expert at The Weather Channel, said: 'By the time this is over, Winter Storm Boreas (the rain and snowy side) will affect more than 32 states and will have impacted more than 200 million people.'

This year, they made it a point to get out earlier to be the first. Best Buy - along with retailers including Macy's, J.C. Penney and Staples -  will open on Thanksgiving for the first time this year. Toys R Us will open at 5pm., and Wal-Mart -  already open 24 hours in many locations - will start holiday deals at 6pm, two hours earlier than last year. In recent years, some retail employees and their supporters have started online petitions to protest stores that open on Thanksgiving - but shoppers keep coming. 'Cancellations are used as a good, preventative measure to avoid cascading delays that can negatively impact travelers thousands of miles away,' Baker said. Heavy rain and high winds would affect travel by air and road in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic and could have a ripple effect on airports with departing and originating flights elsewhere. Heavy rain and breezy conditions were in the forecast Wednesday from the Carolinas to the Northeast, with ice and snow a possibility in the Appalachians, western Pennsylvania and western New York. The storm system could also spawn isolated tornadoes in the Florida Panhandle. The Southeast is set to suffer soaking rain in the coming days, primarily in Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.

As her confidante and devoted personal assistant for more than three decades, Cynthia ‘Crawfie’ Crawford was not forgotten in Margaret Thatcher’s will. The former Prime Minister left 76-year-old Mrs Crawford a tax-free £50,000 and ‘my flower brooch with emeralds and ruby diamonds’. Baroness Thatcher, who died last April, left an estate of almost £4.7million before inheritance tax. It is understood that this is after paying around £750,000 towards the cost of her funeral. Scroll down for video . Devoted to the end: Cynthia Crawford with Lady Thatcher in 2005 . Apart from the bequest to Mrs Crawford, and after paying £1.7million inheritance tax, the remaining £3million or so has been split between her children and grandchildren. Her son Mark and daughter Carol receive a third each. The remaining third was left equally to grandchildren Michael, 24, and Amanda, 19, once they reach the age of 25. The bequest to Mrs Crawford was included in an amendment Lady Thatcher made to her will in 2003. The same amendment said that Amanda - who impressed mourners with a flawless reading during Lady Thatcher’s funeral service at St Paul’s Cathedral - should also receive ‘free of inheritance tax’ her grandmother’s ‘tiger brooch with sapphire’. Last night Mrs Crawford, who began working for Lady Thatcher in 1978 and still saw her regularly in her final years, spoke of her ‘pride’ at being given her long-time friend and employer’s ‘beautiful’ basket-shaped, floral brooch. Speaking from her home overlooking the Malvern Hills around Worcester, she said: ‘It is very kind and thoughtful of her and it will be treasured forever.’ Affectionately known as ‘Crawfie’ by Lady Thatcher, she spoke of her immense grief following her dear friend’s death. ‘My relationship with Lady Thatcher was very close,’ she said. ‘It has been a very hard year and I miss her terribly. I will always remember her with such great affection.’ Testing times: Mrs Crawford, right, is shown being rushed away from the Grand Hotel in Brighton with Lady Thatcher and her husband Denis, after it was bombed by the IRA in 1984 . Lady Thatcher’s health had been deteriorating since last Christmas and she died, aged 87, at the Ritz hotel in London in April after suffering a stroke. Her will was drawn up in 1997 and probate records show she left an estate of £4,694,605. The will included a tax-free legacy of £1million to her husband Sir Denis - who died aged 88 in 2003 - and stated that everything else should be left in trust and split between twins Mark and Carol, now aged 60, and two grandchildren from Sir Mark’s marriage to his first wife, American Diane Burgdorf, which ended in 2005. Carol has no children. As Sir Denis died a decade before his wife, it is assumed that the £1million legacy did not take effect and remained part of Lady Thatcher’s estate. Grief: Mrs Crawford is pictured at Baroness Thatcher's funeral in April of this year . Left-wing critics had predicted that her funeral procession and service would cost £10million, but government figures released in July showed the actual bill for the taxpayer was just £1.2million. At the time, Downing Street confirmed that Lady Thatcher’s family would be making a contribution and the will states that ‘my funeral and testamentary expenses’ should be paid out of her estate. Grocer’s daughter Lady Thatcher raised millions of pounds for charity through the Thatcher Foundation, which she set up in 1991. When she left Downing Street in 1990 her personal fortune was a reputed £9.5million. In later years she became increasingly frail and suffered from dementia, rarely leaving her Belgravia home. A family friend said yesterday: ‘The bulk of her money was spent on her care.’","Lady Thatcher included personal assistant Cynthia Crawford in her will .

It's not known what the circumstances were surrounding Rick's parting with the vehicle - perhaps his growing family forced him to sell the Mustang for a more practical model. Over the years, Lookebill talked about finding the car, even seeing it once in Clinton, Illinois back in 1999, but recently he redoubled his efforts to locate it. Glory days: The Mustang in the years before Lookebill had to give it up . All the while, his son was also secretly on the lookout for the Mustang, and in April this year, he found it in Florida.

U.S. intelligence officials say they are worried about a 'doomsday' cache of highly classified, heavily encrypted material they believe former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden has stored on a data cloud. The cache contains documents generated by the NSA and other agencies and includes names of U.S. and allied intelligence personnel, seven current and former U.S. officials and other sources briefed on the matter said. The data is protected with sophisticated encryption, and multiple passwords are needed to open it, said two of the sources, who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. NSA intelligence leaker Edward Snowden speaks in August - officials from British and American intelligence are said to be terrified over a cache of secrets he has stored online . The passwords are in the possession of at least three different people and are valid for only a brief time window each day, they said. The identities of persons who might have the passwords are unknown. Spokespeople for both NSA and the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. One source described the cache of still unpublished material as Snowden's 'insurance policy' against arrest or physical harm. U.S. officials and other sources said only a small proportion of the classified material Snowden downloaded during stints as a contract systems administrator for NSA has been made public. Some Obama Administration officials have said privately that Snowden downloaded enough material to fuel two more years of news stories. 'The worst is yet to come,' said one former U.S. official who follows the investigation closely. Edward Snowden (3rd R) receives the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence Award (SAAII) in OCtober alongside UK WikiLeaks journalist Sarah Harrison (3rd L) who took Snowden from Hong Kong to Moscow earlier this year . Snowden, who is believed to have downloaded between 50,000 and 200,000 classified NSA and British government documents, is living in Russia under temporary asylum, where he fled after traveling to Hong Kong. He has been charged in the United States under the Espionage Act. Cryptome, a website which started publishing leaked secret documents years before the group WikiLeaks or Snowden surfaced, estimated that the total number of Snowden documents made public so far is over 500. Revelations: Glenn Greenwald, was among the first to reveal Washington's vast electronic surveillance program - and the NSA fears he and Edward Snowden may reveal more secrets . Given Snowden's presence in Moscow, and the low likelihood that he will return to the United States anytime soon, U.S. and British authorities say they are focused more on dealing with the consequences of the material he has released than trying to apprehend him. It is unclear whether U.S. or allied intelligence agencies - or those of adversary services such as Russia's and China's - know where the material is stored and, if so, have tried to unlock it. One former senior U.S. official said that the Chinese and Russians have cryptographers skilled enough to open the cache if they find it. Snowden's revelations of government secrets have brought to light extensive and previously unknown surveillance of phone, email and social media communications by the NSA and allied agencies. That has sparked several diplomatic rows between Washington and its allies, along with civil liberties debates in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. Among the material which Snowden acquired from classified government computer servers, but which has not been published by media outlets known to have had access to it, are documents containing names and resumes of employees working for NSA's British counterpart, the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), sources familiar with the matter said. The sources said Snowden started downloading some of it from a classified GCHQ website, known as GC-Wiki, when he was employed by Dell and assigned to NSA in 2012. Compromised: The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) logo is displayed in the lobby of CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia . Snowden made a calculated decision to move from Dell Inc to another NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, because he would have wide-ranging access to NSA data at the latter firm, one source with knowledge of the matter said. Glenn Greenwald, who met with Snowden in Hong Kong and was among the first to report on the leaked documents for the Guardian newspaper, said the former NSA contractor had 'taken extreme precautions to make sure many different people around the world have these archives to insure the stories will inevitably be published.' 'If anything happens at all to Edward Snowden, he has arranged for them to get access to the full archives,' Greenwald said in a June interview with the Daily Beast website. He added: 'I don't know for sure whether has more documents than the ones he has given me... I believe he does.' In an email exchange with Reuters, Greenwald, who has said he remains in contact with Snowden, affirmed his statements about Snowden's 'precautions' but said he had nothing to add. Officials believe that the 'doomsday' cache is stored and encrypted separately from any material that Snowden has provided to media outlets. Leaked: Headquarters of the MI6 (British Secret Intelligence Service) located on the Albert Embankment along the River Thames . Conservative British politicians, including Louise Mensch, a former member of parliament, have accused the Guardian, one of two media outlets to first publish stories based on Snowden's leaks, of 'trafficking of GCHQ agents' names abroad.' No names of British intelligence personnel have been published by any media outlet. After U.K. officials informed the Guardian it could face legal action, the newspaper disclosed it had destroyed computers containing Snowden material on GCHQ, but had provided copies of the data to the New York Times and the U.S. nonprofit group ProPublica. Sources familiar with unpublished material Snowden downloaded said it also contains information about the CIA - possibly including personnel names - as well as other U.S. spy agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which operate U.S. image-producing satellites and analyze their data. U.S. security officials have indicated in briefings they do not know what, if any, of the material is still in Snowden's personal possession. Snowden himself has been quoted as saying he took no such materials with him to Russia.","British and U.S. intelligence officials say they are worried about a top-secret cache of highly classified documents that Edward Snowden may still release .

Sexual crimes against women and children are reported every day in Indian newspapers, and women often complain about feeling insecure when they leave their homes. Since the bus gang-rape incident dozens of rapes cases in India - against both Indian women and tourists have been highlighted. The attack forced India to confront the reality that sexually-assaulted women are often blamed for the crime, forcing them to keep quiet and discouraging them from reporting it to authorities for fear of exposing their families to ridicule. Activists say passing new, strong laws is not enough, and that the government must ensure that police and the justice system crack down on crimes against women.","Witnesses said man seemed to be on drugs during assault in Rio de Janeiro .

A video of three Korean women dancing in leotards is rumoured to be the 'sex tape' Kim Jong-Un used to justify the execution of his ex-girlfriend. The seemingly innocuous clip shows the trio dancing to a version of Elvis' Aloha Oe in cowboy hats and tasselled skirts. However reports from China - North Korea's only ally - that it was this video that led to the execution of Hyon Song-wol and 11 other entertainers. This video of three Korean women dancing is rumoured to be the 'sex tape' used to justify the execution of Kim Jong-Un's ex-girlfriend Hyon Song-wol and 11 other entertainers . Chinese media identified this dancer as Hyon but reports are almost impossible to verify . Hyon Song-wol, right, was reportedly put to death by her ex-boyfriend Kim Jong Un, left, on August 30 . A South Korean newspaper reported last . week that Hyon had been killed by machine gun fire amid claims that she . had been appearing in pornographic videos. Twelve singers, musicians and dancers from two pop groups are said to have been executed on August 20. It was reported that they were accused of making videos of themselves performing sex acts and then selling the recordings. Some . of the musicians were also reported to have had Bibles, which are . banned in North Korea, when they were detained and all were treated as . political dissidents. The isolated and secretive state has not commented and reports are almost impossible to verify. A . user on China's video-sharing website YouKu uploaded the video of the . dancing trio and said it was the supposed 'sex tape', reported The Daily . Dot. The video has been watched 700,000 times. Hyon rose to fame with her hit song A Girl in the Saddle of a Steed, or 'Excellent Horse-Faced Lady' The killing has led to speculation Kim's wife Ri Sol-ju (left) was to blame . China's chnqiang news website said one of the dancers was Hyon. Because Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju,  was . once a member of the same group as the executed singer, North Korea . analysts suggested that she might have given her consent to the . execution. Fuelling the speculation, there have been rumours that her husband was still seeing Hyon. Without . facing trial Hyon, said to be 28, and other members of North Korea’s . most famous pop groups were marched in front of a firing squad and . gunned down while their families and other members of the groups were . ordered to watch. The victims’ families and friends were then taken away to a labour camp, having been found ‘guilty  by association’. Kim with his wife Ri Sol-ju, who apparently played alongside Hyon in the Unhasu Orchestra . North . Korea has very little contact with the outside world and it is unlikely . that the reason for the execution will ever be confirmed. But . Professor Toshimitsu Shigemura, a Japanese expert on Korean affairs, . said it was ‘simply not believable’ the entertainers were executed for . making pornography, as they could simply have been made to ‘disappear’ in the prison system. He said: ‘As Kim’s wife once belonged to the same . group, it is possible that these executions are more about Kim’s wife.’ Kim, . 30, who succeeded his late father as supreme leader of North Korea in . 2011, met Hyon ten years ago when he returned from studying in . Switzerland. However, his father, Kim Jong-il, disapproved of the . relationship and ordered the friendship to end. Hyon went on to marry an officer in the North Korean military and is believed to have had a baby. But . rumours circulated that Kim was still secretly seeing her, which might . account for reports that he was seen with a mystery woman in the months . before his marriage to Ri, which was disclosed last  July. Ri and Kim . are said to have a baby daughter. Hyon and Kim knew each other as teenagers then had an affair when he was leader . Such . is the secrecy surrounding Kim’s life it was initially reported that Ri . was the singer who performed a series of bizarrely titled patriotic . songs that had, apparently, stirred the nation. However, . it was really Hyon who had recorded Footsteps of Soldiers, I Love . Pyongyang, She is a Discharged Soldier and We are Troops of the Party. Ri . was also given credit for Excellent Horse-Like Lady – also known as A . Girl in the Saddle of a Steed – another of Hyon’s songs. Kim . has already displayed the ruthlessness that has made his family the . world’s only communist dynasty, beginning with grandfather Kim Il-sung . at the end of the Korean War in 1953. He . is said to have purged his stepmother from her position as a senior . official in the ruling party to show his absolute power and had a . minister executed by mortar round for showing disrespect by drinking . during the official mourning period after Kim Jong-il’s death.","Video of dance trio reported to be 'sex tape' by some Chinese media .

Most everyone likes their hash browns golden brown and their toast nice and crunchy, but new research says that the crispier some breakfast foods are cooked, the more likely they are to give you cancer. That’s thanks to a chemical called acrylamide, which is found mostly in plant based foods and appears to accumulate the longer those foods are cooked. And breakfast may be the biggest source of acrylamide since fried potatoes and toasted bread are some of the biggest sources of the menacing chemical. Golden goodness? Maybe not. New research says the longer you cook potatoes, the more they'll accumulate acrylamide--a chemical found to cause cancer in mice . According to the FDA, acrylamide has likely been around forever in food but has recently been found to cause cancer in lab mice. It seems to form in the largest quantity when foods are prepared with high-temperature cooking. That means frying, roasting or baking. So some of the worst offenders are French fries and other fried potatoes because the tuber is already more likely than other foods to form acrylamide. When you cook the taters to a delicious, golden brown, voila: more cancer-causing acrylamide. Like your toast burnt? You may want to think twice since it could have far more cancer-causing acrylamide, which the FDA now says to reduce in your diet by eating more veggies and fruits and by cooking foods in less heat-intensive ways . Grout for breakfast? Acrylamide isn't just found in overcooked foods, it's also used industrially in grout, water treatment products, and plastics . The chemical isn’t likely to be found in meat, fish or dairy and doesn’t seem to form when foods like potatoes are prepared through steaming or boiling. Acrylamide isn’t just found in foods, it’s also used in commercial products and manufacturing. Aside from a perfectly brown potato, the chemical is found in plastics, grouts, water treatment products, and cosmetics. And, not surprisingly, in cigarette smoke. Short of telling consumers to quit eating fried, baked, or roasted foods altogether, the agency suggests a vegetable and fruit rich diet with whole grains and lean proteins. By displacing a largely burnt toast and fried potato diet with a more varied one, you can sneak an acrylamide-containing morsel once in a while without having to worry. Shocker: Not surprisingly, the FDA says that smokers are getting a healthy dose of the cancer causing compound as well .","A chemical called acrylamide is prevalent in plant-based foods and the longer they're cooked, the more of it that forms .

'Elvis wore these shoes on stage and the soles have circular wear on them - proof of Elvis' stage moves. 'For years they took centre stage at the Elvis-A-Rama Museum is Las Vegas until it shut down in 2006. There was even a magazine article written about these very shoes.

But it is Elvis' cover version released the following year that many associate the song with, despite it only reaching number 20 in the charts.

It seems the spirit of Ebenezer Scrooge is alive and well... in a small town in East Yorkshire. Council officials in Goole ordered the top of a 30ft Christmas tree to be lopped off - because it blocked a CCTV camera. The tree went up earlier this month in the town centre, reaching the dizzy heights of the 90-year-old clock tower next door. Pruned: The top of the Christmas tree in Goole, East Yorkshire, was lopped off - because it blocked CCTV . Blocked: The camera had less than a good view after a 30ft conifer was placed next to it in the town centre . But the tower has a CCTV camera placed on top - which the conifer completely blocked. So Goole Town Council had the top removed, leaving many residents scratching their heads. Former trawlerman Donald Walker, 70, said: 'Why couldn't they just take a bit off the bottom before they put it up, not take the top off? Where is the star going to go? 'They took it off because the camera couldn't see the shopping precinct,' he added. 'It . looked like about five-and-a-half foot they chopped off the top, which . is a shame because it looked like the biggest tree we have had.

Lopped: The clock tower, left, and former fisherman Donald Walker, 70, with the discarded top of the tree . Town clerk Brian Robertson denied there was a problem - telling regional newspaper The Press that the tree had been 'shaped' so it would still have a triangle on top. He added: 'I wouldn't say it was five-and-a-half foot that was taken off. We sent the contractors out there with radios and they liased with the control room as to how much to take off. 'The view of the camera was totally obscured by the tree so it had to be taken off.' A town of 20,000, Goole is on the River Humber and has one of the most important ports on the east coast. Its clock tower was erected in 1926 to celebrate the town's centenary - but sits slightly unceremoniously on a roundabout.","Decision by town council left residents perplexed in Goole, East Yorkshire .

They called for the Government to put more pressure on the . authorities in Tanzania, which has overall control of the . semi-autonomous island. Mr . Trup, 51, a multimillionaire dental surgeon and property developer, said . his daughter was ‘progressing well mentally and physically’ after . suffering severe burns to her shoulder and back. He told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Kirstie is doing well, she’s moved to university.

Mr . Morris said he expected the Foreign Office to ‘move hell and high . water’ to bring the attackers to justice but that there did not seem to . be ‘any sense of urgency to conclude matters’. Mr Trup added: ‘I’m particularly upset with the Tanzanian authorities. I think they just hope this  will go away. Horror: Kirstie Trup, looked drained and scared as she arrived at hospital after the attack in Zanzibar . Badly hurt: Katie Gee was comforted by a fellow traveller as she was driven to hospital in Tanzania . ‘The . Foreign Office do send us emails, but the emails say the same every . single time and they seem  to imply that the British Foreign Office has . clout, it has a voice, but clearly none of that is working because we . are not getting any progress whatsoever. ‘I . would like to see whoever threw that acid brought to justice. I don’t . blame the country, I don’t blame the religion. I blame the person. He . needs to be brought to justice. ‘Above . all, the girls want to know why he did it and we would like to know why . he did it. Was it racial, was it a religious thing? We have no idea why . this person did it.’ Police . in Zanzibar have interviewed several people, including eyewitnesses, . and are believed to have identified a possible culprit.

A 'military enthusiast' who threatened two nurses with a gun a day after shooting himself in the hand by mistake has been jailed for life. Armed police arrested Christopher Turkington, 41, at Salford Royal Hospital, Greater Manchester, after reports that a man had grabbed two nurses and was waving a gun. Firearms officers were able to arrest him and he was found to be in possession of four loaded revolvers. Jailed: Christopher Turkington, 41, was sentenced to life after admitting four counts of possession of a firearm with intent. His wife Victoria Turkington, 40, got two years after a judge took into account extenuating actions . At Manchester Crown Court he was jailed for life after he admitted four counts of possession of a firearm with intent. He must serve a minimum of five years before he can apply for parole. His wife Victoria Turkington, 40, who was with him at the time of his arrest, pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and was jailed for two years. The court heard that Turkington had four antique guns at his home in Salford, Greater Manchester, along with other military antiques including stun grenades and machetes as well as military clothing. Fearing impending Armageddon, he had also stockpiled tents and tins of food, as well as explosive manuals and chemicals, as well as crafting 218 bullets himself. He had turned up at hospital on Thursday, 24 May, telling doctors he had injured his hand with a drill. But when he was examined he admitted that his injury was a gunshot wound and a bullet was lodged in his hand. Surgeons operated to remove the bullet and contacted police who questioned Turkington after he came round on the Friday, but did not arrest him. Fearful that his arsenal would be discovered if police searched his home, he rang his estranged wife and told her to move his four guns and other weapons to her house. Salford Royal Hospital: Turkington had turned on May 24 telling doctors he had hurt his hand with a drill. But when he was examined he admitted that his injury was a gunshot wound and a bullet was lodged in his hand . Later that day he checked himself out of hospital and, plagued by 'voices in his head', went to his wife's home nearby where he took the guns loaded them with ammunition and returned to the hospital at 9.20pm. He went to the hospital's Hope Building on surgical ward H5 and was seen waving a gun, before holding a nurse hostage at gunpoint and demanding access to a drugs cupboard. The incident lasted around 10 minutes before firearms officers arrested the pair. Nobody was injured in the incident. At court Julian Taylor, prosecuting, . said that Turkington had initially taken himself to hospital complaining . of having a drill bit embedded in his hand. He said: 'The police were informed and inquiries were made. 'After . Mr Turkington discharged himself from hospital he later returned with . four firearms, all loaded. He pressed the buzzer for assistance at . 9.20pm. 'He asked nurse for . drugs and became insistent. He was seen by another nurse putting his arm . around another nurse. He then produced a gun.' Mr Taylor said Turkington was shouting: 'Don't worry I'm not going to hurt you.' The court heard that he then added: 'If you don't get me any drugs soon I'm going to shoot myself.' One of Turkington's antique revolvers: He had four antique guns at his home along with other weapons including stun grenades and machetes . When armed response officers arrived he raised his arm, putting the gun to his head but he was arrested after the nurse he was holding courageously grabbed his arm, knocking the cocked weapon from his hand. He later said of the hand wound that he doesn't have accidents as he has experienced knowledge of bullets. Mr Taylor said that Turkington's psychiatric report stated that the injury was the result of a botched suicide attempt. He said: 'Mr Turkington told police that he went back to the hospital to shoot himself. 'He thought that when he went back armed police would be there waiting for him and if he did not shoot himself they would do it for him. He was disappointed when they weren't there and said he needed to make it convincing.' The court heard that the Turkingtons had been married for 18 years but had been living separately for seven. Turkington had never been in trouble with the police before . Elizabeth Nicholls, for Victoria Turkington said that she had pleaded with her husband to stop and even stood in front of the nurse to protect her. Sentencing Turkington, Judge Peter Openshaw said: 'Over the years he had developed an interest in weapons. He developed considerable skill in loading these weapons with ammunition and turned them into deadly weapons. 'It does not follow, therefore, that the events of the 25th May took place in isolation. He was making this arsenal of prohibited weapons. 'On this occasion he became fixed on the idea of suicide to the point where he cared about nothing else. 'I am willing to accept that he did not intend to shoot other people, but to shoot himself or to create a credible risk for the police to shoot him. It is all very well to claim the incident did not last long. His conduct put many people at risk and the outcome could have easily been very different. 'I cannot say that after serving two thirds of his sentence he would no longer pose a risk. I therefore pass a life sentence.' A Derringer-type pistol: When armed response officers arrived Turkington put a gun to his head but he was arrested after the nurse he was holding grabbed his arm, knocking the cocked weapon from his hand . Of Victoria Turkington he said: 'I am . quite prepared to find that there are extraordinary and exceptional . circumstances for my not sending her to prison for five years. 'What she did, as she herself well knows, was profoundly wrong. 'A . prison sentence must be passed and I am unable to suspend it. A message . must plainly go out that anyone who does possess or move weapons in . this way must face unpleasant consequences. I reduce her sentence to two . years imprisonment.' Box with bullets in: Fearing impending Armageddon, Turkington had stockpiled tents and tins of food at his Salford home, as well as explosive manuals and chemicals, and had crafted 218 bullets himself . Bullets recovered from Turkington: He later said of the hand wound that he doesn't have accidents as he has experienced knowledge of bullets . Detective Chief Inspector Ben Ewart said: 'This was a terrifying ordeal for three members of staff caught up in this incident, not least the nurse who was kept near Turkington for the best part of ten minutes. 'At some point or another, each of these people thought their life was in danger and that Turkington could lose control. 'Not only were they worried about themselves, but also the other patients on the ward. 'Despite these trying circumstances, however, the victims remained calm and compliant to ensure Turkington's anxiety levels did not increase and they all showed extreme bravery throughout their ordeal. 'As for Turkington himself, our detailed investigations uncovered an alarming pattern of behaviour and a concerning level of interest in warfare.'","Christopher Turkington went to hospital after shooting himself in the hand .

A mural of Jesus blessing two military officers has been unveiled after 60 years hidden for being 'too militaristic'. St Peter's Chelsea Church in Manhattan first displayed the painting by a former colonel in 1946 as a tribute to the men who fought in the brutal Second World War. Tim Witonski, who enlisted the day after Pearl Harbour, gave 'Our Lord Blessing A Soldier And A Sailor' - one of his many works - to the parish which took him in on his return. Unveiled: Our Lord Blessing A Soldier And A Sailor has been hidden for 60 years in St Peter's Chelsea Church, Manhattan, after the congregation decided it was 'too militaristic' in 1954 . It shows two men kneeling before Christ in their uniform. But in 1954, as America became embroiled in the Cold War, the congregation ruled the mural was 'too militaristic' and covered it with a curtain. Home: Peter Witonski, son of artist Colonel Tim Witonski, was partly brought up at the church which took his father in at the end of World War Two . Now, almost 60 years later, the curtain has been drawn to reveal Mr Witonski's masterpiece once more. Crowds gathered in the chapel during mass at 10am on Remembrance Sunday for the unveiling. It has shocked most of today's congregation who were unaware the five-foot-tall masterpiece has been hanging by the altar for six decades. Peter Witonski, his son, applauded the decision. He told CNN: 'He simply wanted to show that Americans won the war, and here they are - having won the war - not going out and getting drunk, but kneeling down and praying.' Having moved away in the late 1940s, Mr Witonski, who died in the 1970s, never knew his work was covered up. 'I think he would have been hurt,' his son said. 'It was a labour of love. He did not charge money for it.' He told CNN he is looking forward to seeing the painting restored to its public place, adding: 'I feel that my father will be watching, somehow.' Witonski produced a large body of art that has been exhibited by a number of prestigious institutions. The interim pastor, Stephen Harding, who discovered the piece told CNN that, now unveiled, he hopes the work will give people an opportunity to think about the history of the parish and the nation. Found: Interim pastor Stephen Harding ordered for the painting to be unveiled when he found it this year . Military support: Pastor Harding, here seen blessing a veteran, has many former servicemen in his congregation . Excited: Peter Witonski,  pictured on Sunday with his wife Anila, said: 'I feel my father will be watching somehow' The chapel was first leased to the congregation in 1832 by Clement Clarke Moore - who famously wrote 'Twas The Night Before Christmas... It ran numerous outreach programmes in the 19th century, helping to educate children and support families. However, when attendance numbers plummeted in post-war 20th century, St Peter's could not support itself as an independent church and in 1954 became a mission of the Diocese of New York.","Colonel Tim Witonski gave Our Lord Blessing A Soldier And A Sailor to St Peter's Chelsea Church, Manhattan, as a tribute to WW2 soldiers in 1946 .

Megan Thomason, 21, spent six days in hospital with serious complications from the injury after taking advantage of cheap drinks promotions in bars. Doctors feared she could suffocate or develop blood poisoning, Miss Thomason said, adding that she ‘nearly died’. Her neck and face swelled up and her bulging cheeks made her ‘look like a hamster’. Megan Thomason, 21, was admitted to hospital after vomiting for 24 hours straight following a heavy night out . Miss Thomason, who is studying business and management at Hull University, has said she will give up alcohol and warned of the dangers of binge drinking. She accepted responsibility for making herself seriously ill, but added that cheap drinks deals offered by bars and clubs pose a big health risk to young people. She said: ‘We automatically think if it’s cheaper we can afford to drink more and that’s not good. ‘People can have ten or 20 drinks a night. 'You don’t realise what one night out could do. It was the worst experience of my whole life. People say they get hung over but I nearly died.’ Sticking to orange juice from now on: Miss Thomason pictured on a recent night out (left) has given up drinking after her ordeal in June last year . Miss Thomason went on a night out . with friends in York in June and downed three triple vodka and cokes . that cost only £2.89 each, thanks to a special offer. The student from Barlby, North Yorkshire, said: ‘Being drunk is classed as normal and I gave in to peer pressure. ‘I’d had three drinks but because they were triples it was actually the equivalent of nine drinks and you don’t think of that at the time.’ The group went to two more bars, where Miss Thomason had more vodka-based drinks before going to a friend’s house. Her stepfather picked her up early the next morning and she started a 24-hour period of vomiting and retching, which caused damage to her throat. Hospitalised: Megan pictured in hospital recovering from her ordeal . She was prescribed anti-nausea medication, but when it did not improve her condition she was taken to hospital.

My cheeks looked a bit like a hamster with all the food in them,’ she said. ‘Basically it felt like bubble wrap inside my cheeks and my mouth and chest.’ 'She . spent the next six days in hospital, not eating or drinking, as her . throat healed. She added: ‘It is only now I realise just how serious it . was. ‘If I had eaten I could have got blood poisoning from the food or I could have choked if it had gone into my lungs. ‘It was just one night out for a few drinks and it left me in hospital for a week – I could have died.’ Miss Thomason has now been told that her body lacks the enzymes needed to break down alcohol properly. Her mother Justine Bean, 45, an administrator, and site supervisor stepfather Gary Bean, 48, have urged her not to drink again. Professor Paul Wallace, the chief medical adviser to alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said: ‘The main danger of drinking alcoholic drinks is the alcohol itself and its effect on your brain and your body. ‘It doesn’t much matter whether you drink it in wine, beer, spirits or anything else – the alcohol is what causes the effect on your brain and your body.

But one evening just before Christmas last year, while taking a shower, Andy noticed a small lump under his right nipple, about the size of a tiny pea. It was causing no pain or discomfort, so he thought nothing more of it. 'I assumed it was a cyst and that it would go away. I knew I was fit, and I had no previous medical conditions, so there was nothing to make me worried,' says Andy, 59. At the time, he was looking forward to an exciting new chapter in his life. He and his wife, Marilyn - with whom he has two children, both in their 20s - were enjoying life in their new apartment in Dubai and having the occasional visit to the UK, where they have a house in Glastonbury, Somerset. They were planning to see more of the world together because Andy had opted for semi-retirement two years earlier after more than 22 years working in finance, latterly as chief financial officer for the international division of Pepsi. Andy was exceptionally fit for his age, having clocked up ten marathons and 50 half-marathons, in addition to playing cricket and football to a high standard in his youth. When he went for a routine medical in Dubai in January, he mentioned the lump in his breast in passing. He was given an ultrasound scan, but the surgeon to whom Andy was referred couldn't tell what it was. He says: 'When I got the ultrasound images I emailed them to Marilyn, who at the time was back in England. I also sent them to my 26-year-old son Cameron, who's a medical student. There was no panic at all on my part. I just thought Cameron might find the images interesting.' Cameron found them deeply worrying - and immediately telephoned his mother, who spoke to her GP. 'I was given the name of Simon Cawthorn, a breast cancer specialist at the Spire Bristol Hospital, and made an appointment to see him,' says Marilyn. 'I did my homework and felt strongly that it was, in fact, cancer. But the hard part was getting Andy to concentrate and treat the issue urgently. I told him to get on a plane.' Spreading the word: Andy and his wife Marilyn want to increase awareness of male breast cancer . It was only when he and Marilyn walked into Mr Cawthorn's consulting room in mid-April, a full month after the medical, that Andy realised the gravity of his situation. 'Simon said he was 99 per cent certain it was cancer and that the normal treatment is a mastectomy,' says Andy. 'I reeled in shock. I knew that men could get breast cancer, but I had no idea what a mastectomy would involve for a man. 'In those first few days I went through many emotions - anger, sadness, self-pity, a sense of “Why me?” Then I thought: “I can get through this.” ' Breast cancer in women has been one of the success stories of health campaigning, with most now knowing to regularly check their breasts for changes. But what's far less well known is that the disease also affects men - around 370 in the UK a year. As for women, early detection raises the chances of successful treatment. 'The prognosis for men with breast cancer is worse than it is for women, but  we don't know why,' says Mr Cawthorn. 'It's also the case that breast cancer in men often goes undetected for longer because the disease does not register with men as it does with women.' Research suggests men who have breast cancer in the family are at raised risk (there is no history of it in Andy's). 'I reeled in shock. I knew that men could get breast cancer, but I had no idea what a mastectomy would involve for a man.' Another known cause is a rare genetic condition called Klinefelter's syndrome, where men are born with an extra X (female) chromosome. Lifestyle factors, such as obesity, lack of exercise and high alcohol intake might also increase the risk of male breast cancer, although this hasn't yet been established for certain. Professor Anthony Swerdlow, from the Institute of Cancer Research, has been carrying out a study on 1,000 men with breast cancer across England and Wales since 2007. 'We have already found several genetic factors associated with risk, and are optimistic that we can find a great deal more about the cause of this cancer in men,' he says. Thankfully, in Andy's case, his cancer was caught early enough to be successfully treated. Within 24 hours of seeing Mr Cawthorn, he was booked in for surgery and had the operation a week later. A mastectomy is essentially the same for both men and women, but in Andy's case the cancer had spread into his armpits to the lymph nodes, and they had to be removed, too. The four-hour operation was successful, but then there was a wait while the lymph nodes were sent to the U.S. for testing with a technique called Oncotype DX. This can predict the chances of a tumour returning and, therefore, establish how effective chemotherapy would be. 'No one wants chemo unless it's absolutely necessary,' says Mr Cawthorn. 'On the other hand, no one wants to risk a recurrence, which is why women and men should be offered this test to help them decide.' The NHS rationing body, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, has recommended that breast cancer patients in Britain should be offered the Oncotype DX, and a decision is due next month. Andy's results showed that the chances of the cancer returning were low, so he didn't need chemotherapy, sparing him the gruelling treatment. Male victims: Breast cancer affects around 370 men in the UK each year . This was a great relief, he says, since his son Cameron's wedding was planned for early August, and Andy had visions of himself in the official photographs either bald or wearing a wig. Instead, Andy was prescribed Tamoxifen, a drug often given to women with breast cancer as it suppresses production of the hormone oestrogen, which is known to fuel the growth of cancer cells. Men have lower levels of oestrogen, but still enough to keep cancer cells alive. Andy expects to take Tamoxifen for ten years. Some patients suffer  side-effects such as hot flushes and weight gain, but not Andy. In fact, he has shed about 20lb since the operation, mainly through better diet and exercising. Not only did he attend his son's wedding with a full head of hair and a clean bill of health, but - to the surprise even of Mr Cawthorn - nine weeks after his surgery he went ahead with a 1,000-mile cycle ride from Land's End to John o' Groats, planned before he became ill. 'My wife thought I was bonkers and she was probably right' says Andy. 'But Simon was supportive, otherwise I would not have done it.' Andy secured £6,500 for BUST, a small charity in the Bristol area that raises money for equipment to diagnose and treat breast cancer. He has not had any reconstructive surgery (reconstruction is uncommon in male patients). Andy's chest on this side is flatter. But that doesn't bother him, and his scar is 'merging nicely into the background'. But what Andy and Marilyn don't want to fade away is the importance of making people more aware of breast cancer in men. Marilyn says: 'In the beginning, I think he thought: “How can I tell people I have breast cancer, because that's a woman's disease?” I told him he would be a trail-blazer and that he could help other men.' Andy is now happy to talk openly about his experience. 'The fact that men can get breast cancer at all is seldom mentioned,' he says. 'And that means there's a big chance it will go undetected. 'I'm one of the lucky ones. Now I want to do something about it.' n Visit bustbristol.co.uk.

The founder of athletic label Lululemon pointed the finger at 'some women's bodies' as part of the reason why a line of yoga pants were recalled earlier this year for being too sheer. Founder Chip Wilson told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday: 'Frankly, some women’s bodies just don’t actually work.' Mr Wilson, along with his co-founder and wife Shannon Wilson, made the remarks as their company released its Full-On Luon pants, a style which claims to have 'major support and coverage'. Scroll down for videos . Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, pictured with his wife Shannon, said that some women's bodies 'don't work' for Lululemon yoga pants . When speaking about how some customers' complained about the pants' fabric pilling, Mr Wilson  continued: 'It’s really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time and how they much they use it.' The founder's remarks caused Bloomberg TV host Trish Regan to cut in and ask: 'Interesting, not every woman can wear a Lululemon yoga pant?' Mr Wilson responded: 'No, I think they can. I just think it’s how you use it.' In March, the Canadian company was forced to recall 17 per cent of its yoga pants due to an . unacceptable 'level of sheerness' created during the manufacturing . process. At the time, the . company said that it was not sure why the pants were so sheer since they . hadn't changed the materials used or switched manufacturers.

After spending nearly seven hours explaining 'in great detail' his claims of the harassment he suffered in the Miami Dolphins locker room, 'bullied' offensive tackle Jonathan Martin says he plans to continue his career in the NFL. Martin met with league officials and NFL investigator Ted Wells on Friday to discuss the alleged bullying he suffered at the hands of teammate Richie Incognito - and others - that ultimately led to his leaving the team last month to seek treatment for depression. Following the meeting, the 6-foot-5, 312 pound Martin declined comment on the details of the meeting, only saying that he planned to return to professional football. Scroll down for video . 'Bullied': Jonathan Martin says that he plans to return to football after leaving his team over hazing practices . 'Although I went into great detail . with Mr. Ted Wells and his team, I do not intend to discuss this matter . publicly at this time,"" Martin told reporters outside of the NFL's New . York City headquarters. 'This is the right way to handle the situation.' Martin went on to say that, 'beyond that, I look forward to working through the process and resuming my career in the National Football League.' Martin still . could sue the Dolphins for big money under a variety of workplace laws, . and could turn to his own legal eagle mother - and attorney specializing in employment law - for advice. The employment legislation . makes employers liable for bullying, harassment and discrimination - . even if the team's hierarchy didn't know about it, according to several . legal experts. Dolphins owner Stephen Ross also . plans to meet with Martin at a later date. Moving forward: Martin declined to discuss what he shared with NFL investigators, only saying he wanted to move forward and continue his career in the NFL . Martin's . mother, Jane Howard-Martin, spent almost 20 years practicing employment . law and wrote numerous articles in legal journals on such issues as . workplace discrimination and harassment. It's not known whether she has . any role in her son's decisions; Howard-Martin is now assistant general . counsel for Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. in Los Angeles. The league currently is trying to gather information about the harassment Martin says he was subjected to by Incognito to determine an appropriate penalty and remedy to what several NFL players have described as a 'culture' of bullying in NFL locker rooms. Suing the Dolphins could be more . successful than bringing criminal charges against Incognito, who was suspended by the Dolphins after . Martin left the team two and a half weeks ago. Martin's attorney, David Cornwell, says Martin was repeatedly harassed . by Incognito and others in ways that 'went far beyond the traditional . locker room hazing'. Miami Dolphins Tackle Jonathan Martin left the team over allegations of bullying . The alleged bullying includes racial slurs, harassment and Incognito allegedly forcing Martin to pay $15,000 for Dolphins players to take a trip to Las Vegas. Martin paid the money, but did not go on the trip. Incognito, who has a history of drunken antics and on-field thuggery, claims he's not a racist and that he and Martin actually are good friends. For Martin to win a lawsuit against the Dolphins, Nova Southeastern University law professor Bob Jarvis said he'd have to show that the harassment went above and beyond the norm in terms of locker room hazing. 'It . will be crucial for Martin to convince a jury that even with a rough . workplace, there is a line that cannot be crossed and it was crossed . here,' Jarvis said. One path for Martin to take would be filing a grievance with the NFL players union or a complaint with the NFL itself. Aside . from that, legal experts say there are several avenues he could take to . sue the Dolphins. Cornwell did not respond to an email asking for . additional comment on any of these options. Two labor-employment lawyers at Venable . LLP in New York, Michael Volpe and Nicholas Reiter, said in a written . analysis of the Martin matter that employers can face lawsuits related . to bullying if the harassment involved a victim's race, religion, sexual . orientation or disability. Richie Incognito is accused of bullying his teammate Jonathan Martin . 'Even if the Dolphins were unaware of Incognito's alleged behavior, which may be the case, the organization could still face claims of liability,' they said. There have also been reports that Incognito was told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin, which could show the team did have knowledge about the harassment, the two lawyers said. Still, it's no slam dunk for Martin. For Incognito himself, the main issue would likely be his future NFL playing career. The NFL players' union announced Thursday that Incognito has filed a grievance over his indefinite suspension by the Dolphins. The union statement says that Incognito is requesting an expedited hearing so he can resume playing football immediately. Tamara Lave, a law professor at the University of Miami, said the current national focus on bullying and hazing in schools and at the workplace would figure in Martin's favor should he take legal action. Especially, she said, because he is a physically imposing NFL player — 6-foot-5, 312 pounds — who is typically perceived as having few weaknesses. 'The fact that you have a 300-pound man who feels so threatened and uncomfortable that he leaves, that's an indication of how serious it was,' Lave said. From the criminal standpoint, former prosecutor David S. Weinstein said it's possible but not likely that Incognito could be charged with extortion if he made threats to force Martin to pay the $15,000 for the Vegas trip. Another option would be written threats to do bodily harm, based on Incognito's texts to Martin making threats about his mother. 'However, I don't really see the (state prosecutors) going after Incognito, but I could be wrong,' Weinstein said. Florida does have an anti-hazing law, but Jarvis said it applies only to educational institutions and not adult workplaces.","Martin says he looks 'forward to working through the process and resuming my career in the National Football League'

A larger-than-life sculpture of the the famous Times Square kiss at the end of World War II got a special visitor this week at its home in Sarasota, Florida. The statue is based not on the famous picture taken by Alfred Eisenstaedt and published on the cover of Life, but an alternative picture of the couple snapped from a different angle by a Navy photographer and published in the New York Times. Carl 'Moose' Muscarello of Plantation, Florida, is one of several men who claims to be the sailor in the famous image . Revisited: Carl 'Moose' Muscarello is one of several men who claim to be the kissing sailor in the famous Life magazine picture. Above, he recreates the smooch with his wife below a larger-than-life sculpture of the famous image . Elation: Unconditional Surrender is a sculpture by artist Seward Johnson in Sarasota, Florida (left). It shows the famous subjects of a Life magazine cover kissing in Times Square on V-J Day 1945 (right) Another perspective: Unconditional Surrender is actually based on a different image taken of the famous couple from another angle by a Navy photographer that was published in the New York Times . He was 18-years-old on August 14, 1945, and on leave from the Navy in New York, walking around Times Square with a buddy when victory over Japan was announced. Mr Muscarello personally lost six friends he grew up with in Brooklyn, and was so grateful the conflict was over he kissed nearly anything in sight. 'I was very, very happy,' he told WTSP. 'I would kiss all of the girls who would stand still - I even kissed a couple of guys. I was just in a kissing mood, it was great.' Time and place: Mr Muscarello was 18-years-old on August 14, 1945 when victory over Japan was announced. At the time, he was on leave from the Navy and in New York wandering around Times Square with a friend . Mr Muscarello's story sounds a lot like the soldier that Eisenstaedt captured for the famous Life magazine cover. 'In Times Suare on V-J Day I saw a sailor running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight. Whether she was a grandmother, stout, thin, old, didn't make a difference' the photographer recalled in his book Eisenstaedt on Eisenstaedt. 'I was running ahead of him with my Leica looking back over my shoulder but none of the pictures that were possible pleased me. Serial kisser: Mr Muscarello recreated the kiss again with a local Florida reporter . In the moment: The reporter was taken by surprise when Mr Muscarello actually planted a kiss on her . 'Then suddenly, in a flash, I saw something white being grabbed. I turned around and clicked the moment the sailor kissed the nurse. 'If she had been dressed in a dark dress I would never have taken the picture. If the sailor had worn a white uniform, the same. I took exactly four pictures. It was done within  a few seconds.' Also present to see the sculpture this week was one of the picture's other subjects - a sailor in a white uniform in the background identified as Tom Bozza who traveled down to see the sculpture from Brandenton, Florida. Reunited: Another one of the picture's subjects was in town to see the sculpture. Tom Bozzo (right) was the man in the white uniform in the background, and says he met Mr Muscarello on V-J Day but that they hadn't seen each other since . 'I was there amongst thousands of veterans who were sharing the day. The war was over and this gentleman was kissing the nurse,' Mr Bozza said. Mr Bozza and Mr Muscarello met on V-J Day but yesterday was the first time they had seen each other since that monumental meeting. For Mr Muscarello, the sculpture doesn't convey a personal moment in his life, but a collective sigh of relief. 'That statue's not of me, but of what it represents,' he said. 'It represents the unconditional surrender. We were happy the war was over.' The sculpture was originally erected in Sarasota in 2009, but was taken down after a car crash damaged the sculpture in April, 2012. The statue was again put up last December.","Carl 'Moose' Muscarello is one of several men who claim to be the kissing sailor in the famous Life magazine cover .

Ban: Joy Tomkins with her £1 doll that has been withdrawn from sale because it has an Olympic outfit and is in breach of copyright laws . With her big blue eyes, blonde mane and a hand-knitted 2012 Olympics running kit, this doll would make a perfect addition to any little girl’s collection. But not if the jobsworths of the Olympics authorities have anything to do with it. Rigid copyright rules over the London 2012 logo mean the widow who made the doll’s outfit cannot put her into a church fundraising sale. Joy Tomkins, 81, spent hours creating the kit for the second-hand doll, which was to go on sale with a £1 price tag. But after hearing that Olympics officials jealously guarded their logos, she decided to check with trading standards officers about the tiny GB 2012 and Olympic rings she had embroidered on the T-shirt. To her shock, she was told to withdraw the doll from sale to avoid legal action. The grandmother of six, from Downham Market, Norfolk, says the rules are ‘21st-century silliness’ and she has written to Olympics chief Lord Coe to complain. ‘This is absolutely ridiculous. I thought that the hoops symbol was universal and I think it is disgusting that they can make rules about such little things. It’s Olympic correctness gone mad,’ she said. The doll was handed in to Mrs Tomkins’ charity knitting group by a member of public and she decided to replace its tired outfit. Red-tape: The tiny GB 2012 and Olympic rings on the doll's knitted jumper were enough to breach strict copyright rules . Rules: Strict laws have been brought in to ensure that only official stores can sell London 2012 Olympic merchandise . In the UK selling anything with Olympic Games or London 2012 names or logos is illegal unless you are an official sponsor. That is why companies like Coca-Cola and McDonalds pay so much for the privilege. In the UK, special laws have also been passed to give extra protection. People are being prosecuted under the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 and anyone found guilty will get a fine of at least £10,000 and a potential jail term. But many innocent members of the public are being threatened with the same legislation. Last year the British Sugarcraft Guild was told it could face court proceedings. Its annual festival of cakes was planned with an Olympic theme but had to be dumped after they were told it would be illegal. They wanted to depict the 2012 games logos in icing and marzipan but the the International Olympic Committee banned them from copying any of its official symbols, including the five rings. It was about to go on a stall at a fundraising sale at a church earlier this month when the retired magazine worker was warned about Olympic copyright. Mrs Tomkins said: ‘The doll was taken off the stall and the next Wednesday when I met the group they were in high dudgeon. They were all for marching on the issue. ‘I have considered sending a picture of the doll in her outfit to Lord Coe with two added words emblazoned across it – Spoil Sport. Maybe I should have just sewn “Global gathering of top athletes in England’s capital this year” but unfortunately the T-shirt just wasn’t large enough.’ The 10in tall doll named Olympia was being sold to raise money for the group’s wool fund. A Locog spokesman said permission to reproduce the rings had to be given by the International Olympic Committee. ‘It’s like selling something with the Nike logo – even for £1 that would be wrong,’ he added. But we’re not like Big Brother. We’ll take things on a case-by-case basis.’ A spokesman for Norfolk County Council said: ‘We were asked whether there was any legislation covering the sale of goods carrying the Olympic rings and we said yes there is, which is indeed the case.’ The official London 2012 website states: ‘There may be cases where the unauthorised use of our brand is the result of pure enthusiasm for the Games without consideration of our commercial benefit or understanding our legal rights. In such cases, we will factor this into our approach.’ Those breaching the rules face civil action for damages.","Joy Tomkins was told that the doll could not be sold because it was emblazoned with tiny Olympic trademarks .

Family secret: The Bishop of Durham, Justin Welby, has revealed his father was a one-time bootlegger in Prohibition America . As a contender to become the next Archbishop of Canterbury, he may not appear the type to harbour a racy family secret. But the Bishop of Durham, Justin Welby, has revealed his businessman father was a one-time bootlegger in Prohibition America – who then became an executive for a company that survived the alcohol ban by selling Communion wine. Recently published letters have also revealed that the Bishop’s late father introduced John F. Kennedy to his first mistress, a 21-year-old Swedish aristocrat, weeks before the future President’s marriage to society beauty Jacqueline Bouvier. Bishop Welby, 56, only became fully aware of the story when the letters surfaced in 2010. The Cambridge-educated Old Etonian, who has been tipped  by senior Church insiders as a  potential successor to Dr Rowan Williams, said his father Gavin was a ‘mysterious character’. He told The Mail on Sunday that his father spoke of sailing to New York from London as a teenager after his mother went bust in the 1929 financial crash. ‘I remember my father telling me she gave him £5 and put him on a boat,’ said Bishop Welby. ‘He said he went to New York in 1929 and traded whisky. Big player: The Bishop's father was romantically involved with actress Vanessa Redgrave (left) and introduced John F Kennedy (right) to his first mistress, weeks before the future President's marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier . 'When I was studying history, the penny dropped that Prohibition ended in 1933 and  he had a lot of friends who had Italian ancestry, so he was bootlegging. He was illegally trading whisky. ‘He went on to become successful in the whisky business and must have met the Kennedys by moving in the right social circles.’ This newspaper has discovered that Gavin became New York import manager for National Distillers Products Corporation, one of America’s biggest liquor distributors. After the 1919 Prohibition Act, the company announced that it would manufacture and market wine for religious services and alcohol  for medicinal and industrial use. Gavin became one of New York’s most prominent party-givers and was linked in the gossip columns to Pat Kennedy, JFK’s sister. After the Second World war, he stood unsuccessfully for Parliament and in 1955 married Jane Portal, a private secretary to Winston Churchill, and Justin’s mother. They divorced when Justin was two. Well connected: Gavin Welby married Justin's mother Jane Portal (left), private secretary to Winston Churchill (right), in 1955 . In a 1955 letter to his first mistress Gunilla von Post, which was auctioned in 2010, JFK wrote: ‘Did you see in the paper that our friend – the cold, frozen Mr Gavin Welby – got married to Mr Churchill’s secretary? Something must have happened.’ Gavin later became romantically involved with actress Vanessa Redgrave, but the relationship ended under pressure from her family, who deemed him ‘a rotten piece of work’.

Frank Fearing had no idea if he would ever see young Helen again, but he made her a solemn promise. Everywhere the American GI went with his unit, he would carve their names into a tree. The first was on Salisbury Plain, where he was stationed before joining the push towards Berlin in the wake of the D-Day invasion. The rest were spread across France and Germany, carved whenever time allowed. Fascinating work: Chantel Summerfield, 24, has become the world's only expert in military tree carvings by using the bark graffiti to trace soldiers' life stories . Helen Fearing never knew if it was . just a romantic bluff, or if he had simply made up the story to impress . her. But they clearly didn’t reckon on the determination of British . student Chantel Summerfield and her remarkable archaeological quest. More than six decades later, and . several years after Frank died, the 24-year-old specialist in military . tree carvings tracked Helen down from the information on the Salisbury . tree – and showed her the proof. Love message: Miss Summerfield traced American GI Frank Fearing, left, and his wife Helen after finding the message he carved in 1945 on a tree, right, on Salisbury Plain . Joy: Miss Summerfield then sent Helen Fearing a photograph of the tree her late husband engraved for her on the other side of the world shortly before she died .

"By . Jonathan Gornall . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:56 EST, 18 September 2013 . Every morning after breakfast, before Sophia Zepeda leaves the house for university, the 23-year-old knocks back something a little stronger than just a coffee to help her get through the day. As she pops two Nurofen Plus tablets into her mouth, the law student says: 'It's a preventative measure. They give me the confidence that I can spend each day virtually pain-free. On other days, I take paracetamol and Migraleve.' It may sound extreme, but Sophia, who lives with her parents in Barnet, North London, is part of Generation Painkiller, the phrase coined after a recent report found a third of all 18 to 24-year-olds in the UK take over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication daily. Nine years of addiction: Sophia Zepeda started taking Nurofen Plus tablets aged 14 (right) after suffering from a series of debilitating headaches that plagued her adolescence . Take Sophia's pill-popping habit. She began dosing herself with painkillers aged 14, after the first of a series of debilitating headaches that went on to plague her adolescence. Her parents suffered from migraines and Sophia's GP decided she did, too. But his recommendation, she says, to start taking codeine-based OTC painkillers saw Sophia unwittingly embark on an entirely legal opiate addiction, which still has her in its grip nearly a decade later. Most of us have a packet of painkillers in our bathroom cabinet - but just because you can buy them in a chemist or supermarket without a prescription doesn't mean they're safe. Few people realise that codeine, available in a variety of OTC painkillers, is a potentially addictive opiate - a narcotic, like morphine and heroin, derived from the opium-producing poppy plant. And just this week, research showed that paracetamol-based Calpol - the most seemingly innocuous drug of all - could even be responsible for increasing rates of asthma in children. 'We certainly encounter significant numbers of people who do abuse painkilling medication,' says Nick Barton, of the charity Action on Addiction. 'It is an increasing problem.' Sophia admits she would be very nervous about giving her tablets up: 'I still get headaches all the time but they don't progress to migraines very often and I'm convinced that's because I'm dependent on painkillers.' Trapped: Aspiring novelist Rachel Sirotinina started taking painkillers when she was 16 to try and alleviate her stress headaches . Regular codeine users quickly become dependent, explains Fayyaz Ahmed, a consultant neurologist at Hull & East Yorkshire Hospitals Trust, and chairman of the British Association for the Study of Headache, because they soon find they need more and more of it to relieve the same pain. 'When they stop taking it they get withdrawal symptoms: irritability, insomnia, restlessness, sweating, anxiety,' he says. 'So they take more.' There are restrictions - pharmacists are not supposed to sell more than one pack of 24 tablets of codeine-based painkillers at a time - so Sophia stocks up whenever she can: 'My bag is always filled with them. I feel panicky if I forget to put some in my purse.' Stress is a major factor in Sophia's continuing usage - as it was for most of those interviewed for the report, who said they took painkillers to relieve tension headaches; almost half think their generation faces more stress than any other. 'There's a huge amount of pressure on my generation, to do well at university and then to get a good job and a mortgage - something that's never been tougher,' says Sophia. She lives with her parents and works hard to fund her studies, giving piano, maths and English lessons to children on the side. 'I can't let headaches stand in the way of my commitments or my future.' That's a sentiment that Daniel Johnson echoes. When the 25-year-old events manager from Brighton began suffering from a bad back, that caused headaches and pain in his neck, he started taking codeine-based painkillers to allow him to carry on working. Six months later, he's still taking them - despite the warning on the packets that they should not be taken for more than three days. 'They're a saviour in enabling me to get on with my job,' he explains. 'As an event manager I can be on my feet for 15 to 20 hours a day. The painkillers give me the peace of mind that I'll be able to do so.' He recognises that he is now utterly reliant on painkillers: 'I imagined that the amount of codeine in the tablets I buy in the chemist wouldn't cause a problem, but I can't function properly without them due to the pain. I'm at a crucial stage in building my career and savings so that I can eventually buy a house. 'I'm devoted to my job and don't want to have to take any time off sick with a back problem. I feel that it's not something I should have at my age.' It's an easy trap to fall into, as 34-year-old Rachel Sirotinina, an aspiring novelist from Durham, knows. When she was 16, her mother, eager to end her daughter's constant stress headaches, brought home a packet of Syndol, an OTC painkiller containing paracetamol and codeine. 'He was groggy, not his normal self, and I thought: “I take these things every day and this is what it does to a grown man?” ' They worked instantly, but quickly turned into a daily habit - and Rachel discovered that unless she upped her dose, her headaches got worse and worse. Most days, she would take two tablets - on bad days, it could be four or six. But neither she nor her parents realised there was anything wrong: 'We didn't see it as a big deal. It was like taking a cough sweet or something,' she says. Soon, the once bright and athletic teen became too exhausted to do anything. Whenever Rachel stopped taking it, her withdrawal symptoms left her anxious, sick and drained of energy - and, ironically, gave her more headaches. She was 29 - 15 years into her dependence on codeine - before she realised the drug might be the source of her problems. 'My boyfriend, Nik, had a headache, and I said: “Oh, take a couple of my tablets.” He took some and was absolutely floored - he fell asleep for a couple of hours and afterwards said: “How do you take these all the time? I feel terrible.” 'He was groggy, not his normal self, and I thought: “I take these things every day and this is what it does to a grown man?” ' Rachel's GP referred her for counselling - and when she confessed to taking a packet of Syndol a day, she was horrified to be told she was addicted to the codeine: 'I don't smoke, don't really drink, don't agree with drugs at all - I just thought they were innocuous.' Rachel was then referred to an addiction treatment centre - where they proposed putting her on methadone, which is usually used to wean addicts off heroin. 'It was an immense shock,” she says. 'They were saying things like “When did you last shoplift?”, “How did you meet your dealer?”, and I'm thinking, “I go to the chemist! I've never shoplifted in my life. I'm in completely the wrong place”.' Fighting it: Rachel, pictured here in her twenties when she well into her addiction, eventually went to an addiction treatment centre and mastered her dependency . And codeine can also be a killer. In the past decade the annual number of deaths in which some form of codeine has been implicated has almost tripled, from 46 in 2001 to 120 in 2012. That's not far short of the 154 deaths in 2011 caused by the opioid-like Tramadol, a prescription-only painkiller the Home Office is now looking at reclassifying as a Class C drug. For doctors such as Fayyaz Ahmed, who see the consequences of such codeine addiction daily, the answer is clear - he would like over-the-counter codeine banned in the UK, as it is in the U.S. and many other countries. Yet the government regulator says that it has never considered making codeine solely a prescription-only medicine. And OTC painkillers are big business to the pharmaceutical industry. In the last year, sales of adult painkillers hit an all-time high of more than 25 million packs - at least 754 million pills. Though Daniel and Sophia are still struggling to cut down their intake, for Rachel, hooked on codeine from the age of 16 to 29, there has been a happy ending. Shocked by the suggested methadone treatment, she decided to go 'cold turkey' on her own: 'It was horrible, but it passed and I'm really glad I did it,' she says. Deadly pills: The number of deaths in which codeine has been implicated over the past decade has almost tripled . 'As the weeks went by the fog started to clear, the exhaustion lifted and, for the first time in 15 years, I started remembering what it was like to feel normal.' Once a college drop-out who struggled to find a job, in 2011 Rachel celebrated by marrying Nik, the man who helped her kick the codeine habit. She has since completed a masters degree in creative writing, and is working on a novel. 'I can't believe I lost so many years to over-the-counter drugs,' she says. 'Now I just want to warn people about the dangers of medication. We all assume anything we can get over the counter is harmless, but that's not the case.'

The laptop was designed to be used in developing countries with limited electricity and to 'accelerate education' in these countries. It was also designed with a tough outer casing and the company calls it the 'all-terrain, off-road, sport utility laptop'. WeWi Telecommunications currently make hardware and software for the military and law enforcement. SOL runs on the Ubuntu operating system and has solar panels built into the laptop's lid. When the battery gets too low the panels can be unfolded to start harvesting solar energy. The website claims the SOL laptop is environmentally-friendly and 'during its lifetime, SOL is expected to clear about one tonne of CO2 emissions' by not connecting to a power grid. There are three models of SOL laptop. The basic SOL will be mainly . distributed in South Africa, the Middle East and South America. SOL . Marine is treated with 'hydrophobic nano coating' and can be completely . submersed in water. The SOL X is a high-end machine and specifications of the SOL X have not yet been released.

'We've looked deeper into it and saw a . need for people desiring to get into education through technology but . with no means – especially where there are many places with scarce access . to a power grid.' The first countries to receive SOL will be Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. It will then be released in the Middle East followed by Europe. Snir told us that the price will change from one place . to another but the company is planning to market it between $300 to $400 (£188 to £250).

WeWi is not the first company to build solar-power into a product. The BigBelly Solar bin is currently being trialled in London and harvests energy from the Sun. It uses this energy to compact any waste that is put into it to an eight of its size. The cost of leasing the high-tech bin is £1,000 a year when leased for five years but because of its huge capacity, it could save councils money in vehicle journeys and fuel to collect waste.

Sweeping attack: Lord Sumption, pictured, made his case against the European Court of Human Rights in a speech in Malaysia . One of the country’s leading judges yesterday compared the behaviour of the European Court of Human Rights to the methods of Communist East Germany. The human rights judges in Strasbourg say they are democratic but in reality they dictate the law, just like the communist bosses did, said Supreme Court Judge Lord Sumption. In a sweeping attack on the way the court has been run, he said it was contributing to a ‘mundane and insidious’ decline of parliamentary powers and accused it of an Orwellian attempt to corrupt democracy. Lord Sumption said the Strasbourg court had gone far beyond the rules written for it in the European Convention on Human Rights and had instead become ‘the international flag-bearer for judge-made fundamental law’. In a speech delivered in Malaysia and published in London yesterday he said the court had ‘a significant democratic deficit’. He condemned the Strasbourg judges for demanding that Britain must give the vote to convicted prisoners, saying they had ‘disregarded’ Parliament and instead ruled that prisoner voting ‘was not a matter for democratic determination at all’. ‘To give the force of law to values for which there is no popular mandate is democratic only in the sense that the old German Democratic Republic was democratic,’ said Lord Sumption. Strasbourg uses the word democracy merely as a term of approval for its decisions, he said, and quoted George Orwell, who wrote that ‘if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought’. His attack on Strasbourg was the second in two days by a senior judge. On Wednesday Appeal judge Lord Justice Laws called on British courts to ignore instructions from the European court, saying that obeying Strasbourg had been ‘an important wrong turning in our law’. Lord Sumption’s speech was the first by a senior British legal figure to accuse the European court outright of undermining parliamentary democracy. He said it had transformed the convention on human rights from the ‘safeguard against despotism’ that was intended into a ‘template for many aspects of domestic legal order’. Condemned: Lord Sumption's speech was an unprecedented attack by a senior UK legal figure . He said Article Eight of the Convention, which guarantees the right to private and family life, was devised as a protection against the surveillance state of totalitarian governments. ‘In the hands of the Strasbourg court it has been extended to cover the legal status of illegitimate children, immigration and deportation, extradition, aspects of criminal sentencing, abortion, homosexuality, assisted suicide, child abduction, the law of landlord and tenant, and a great deal else besides,’ said Lord Sumption. ‘None of these extensions are warranted by the express language of the convention.’ Lord Sumption dismissed the idea that because Parliament passed the Human Rights Act in 1998, this means it approves of Strasbourg decisions. New laws made in Strasbourg were ‘in practice incapable of being reversed by legislation, short of withdrawing from the convention altogether’, he said. He said democracies ‘are rarely destroyed by a sudden external shock or unpopular decisions’. The process was usually more ‘mundane and insidious’ as they were ‘slowly drained of what makes them democratic by a gradual process of internal decay and mounting indifference’.","Lord Sumption, a judge in the Supreme Court, attacked Strasborug judges .

"By . Sadie Nicholas . PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 19 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:03 EST, 19 June 2013 . Flare up: Sadie and a rash caused by her nickel allergy . For nearly five years, the lesion on my stomach simply refused to heal. What started as a ten pence-sized cluster of red bumps just above my belly button, developed within weeks into an angry red sore patch the size of my palm. Impossibly itchy, it wouldn't clear up, despite liberal applications of just about everything from antiseptic and anti-histamine creams to calamine lotion. Scratching, naturally, only made the condition worse. But what had caused this extreme reaction? A tropical insect bite? A rare skin infection? No. When I eventually consulted a private dermatologist, it turned out a belt buckle and the button on the fly of my jeans were to blame. Why? They both contained the everyday, silvery-white metal, nickel, which is found in everything from costume jewellery to small change. Despite never having had a problem before, suddenly in my mid-20s I'd become highly allergic to it. Since then I've been caught out by bra clasps, chain straps on handbags and even sunglasses with metal arms, all of which left angry welts on my skin, sometimes within minutes of coming into contact with them. So when I read last week that there's been a massive surge in nickel allergies - one in ten Britons is now a fellow sufferer - I wasn't surprised. It's an allergy that seems insignificant until you actually suffer from it yourself, and it is reported that one in five women, like me, does. That's because nickel is everywhere in places you'd never imagine. It's used in over 300,000 items from batteries and cooking utensils, to pans and, yes, the proverbial kitchen sink. It's found in paper clips, toasters, zips, car keys, bath plugs, door handles, scissors and even in the metal trims and keypads of many mobile phones. Earlier this month doctors deemed it a 'public health concern' after a study revealed that even loose change could be sparking severe allergic reactions. Analysis has shown that the five and ten pence coins introduced since January 2012 contain four times more of the metal than they used to. Cheaper to produce than the old coins, which were made from an alloy of around 70 per cent copper and 25 per cent nickel, the new slightly thicker coins are steel with a nickel coating. Experts have warned that handling these coins regularly could trigger contact eczema or dermatitis, and cause painful cracked and sore skin. There are increasing amounts of nickel in coinage . Lindsey McManus, of Allergy UK, says many nickel allergy sufferers already report having to wear rubber gloves when handling coins, and with the new 5p and 10p pieces she fears the problem may become even more prevalent, especially among workers such as shop cashiers and bus drivers who handle money all day. Nickel can even penetrate cloth, so men who put their loose change in their pockets can find it aggravates the skin on their legs underneath. Prevalent in the earth's crust, nickel is easily available and cheap. It's also hard-wearing and doesn't corrode, which makes it a popular choice in manufacturing. It can even get into our food from the equipment used to handle, cook or store it. Tinned tuna, for example, contains nickel from the can. As a trace element, nickel occurs naturally in soil and, as it is absorbed through the roots of many plants, it is found in most vegetables, fruits and nuts. Cocoa, raspberries, peanuts and chickpeas are high in nickel, as are many of the products derived from them including chocolate and wine. Thankfully I've yet to suffer a reaction to either, but that's not to say I won't in the future. The allergy has a way of creeping up on sufferers. Consultant dermatologist Dr Tabi Leslie warns that a nickel allergy can strike anyone at any time. 'Like most allergies, it can develop suddenly at any age due to changes in the body's immune system and exposure to an irritant,' she says. 'Women have a higher risk simply because they are more likely to be exposed to nickel through jewellery. 'In a nutshell, the more we're exposed to it, the more likely we are to become sensitive to it and, with the increasing use of nickel, the numbers will only continue soaring.' She explains that sensitisation occurs when the body starts thinking it's under attack and the immune system goes into overdrive, attacking healthy cells and tissue, and resulting contact eczema or dermatitis. Five years ago I developed hives - a bumpy red rash - after swapping my usual breakfast cereal for porridge. Initially, make-up and a new moisturiser were chief suspects until my dermatologist told me that rolled porridge oats contain high levels of nickel. Within days of giving up porridge, the eczema was less itchy, and within a few weeks it had disappeared. And a nickel allergy can also trigger a reaction on other patches of skin that haven't been in contact with it, what Lindsey McManus calls 'a referred reaction'. 'It can be baffling for people who aren't yet aware they're allergic to nickel,' she says. Even the nickel in bra clasps and straps can trigger a reaction in someone with an allergy . Though rare, some people are so sensitive to nickel that it can trigger an immediate, and potentially fatal, reaction known as anaphylactic shock, where the airways close in on themselves. The nickel allergy problem has become so great that Europe has introduced strict new rules on how much nickel can be used in items worn next to the skin such as watchstraps, earrings and necklaces. Coins were excluded because it was thought they did not release enough nickel to trigger reactions. But researchers from the St John's Institute of Dermatology at St Thomas' Hospital, London, now say the high nickel levels in coins will dramatically escalate the problem of allergies in Britain. So what can you do if you're a sufferer? As I found out myself, painting offending items with clear nail varnish can act as a barrier but it isn't foolproof. 'Anti-histamine tablets and creams help to break the itch-scratch cycle and relieve discomfort,' adds Dr Leslie, 'but to get rid of contact eczema you need a prescribed emollient to act as a barrier and reduce the dryness, and a topical steroid cream to reduce the immune reaction.' It was a long course of steroid cream that eventually helped clear up the patch on my stomach. Unfortunately, what's best is avoiding the metal completely, something that's increasingly difficult. Having a nickel allergy is a pain, quite literally, but perhaps it's not all bad. In 2011, Danish researchers found that those who reacted to common irritants such as perfume or nickel were less likely to develop three different cancers. This may be because contact allergies, where the body falsely believes it is under attack, help prime the immune system to be super responsive and fight off other threats. As the saying goes: 'Every cloud has aâ€¦..' Actually, I'd prefer a gold lining.  Silver often contains nickel to strengthen it.","One in ten Britons now suffers from nickel allergies .

A former contracting colleague of Edward Snowden's has spoken out in an effort to fight back against the way that he is being depicted by government officials. A coworker has revealed that despite the picture that has been painted of Snowden- which casts him as a man who stole colleagues passwords and hid his feelings about the controversial surveillance tactics used by the NSA to collect citizens phone records- the reason why he was given so much access is clear. 'That kid was a genius among geniuses,' the unidentified colleague told Forbes. Not all bad: One of Edward Snowden's former NSA colleagues spoke out about how the hacker was granted access because of his unparalleled skill . 'NSA is full of smart people but anybody who sat in a meeting with Ed will tell you he was in a class of his own... I've never seen anything like it.' Forbes is not revealing the source's name or gender, only saying that the individual felt compelled to come forward in order to defend Snowden against the claims that he was a traitor. 'I won't call him a hero, but he's sure as hell no traitor,' the source said. 'I was shocked and betrayed when I first learned the news, but as more time passes I'm inclined to believe he really is trying to do the right thing and it's not out of character for him. I don't agree with his methods, but I understand why he did it.' Looking back at Snowden's behavior before the leak should have raised some red flags for his supervisors. The clearest indication of his possible ulterior motives was the fact that he sometimes wore a hoodie sweatshirt that had a parody NSA sweatshirt that showed AT&T cables and eavesdropping headphones instead of the standard seal of the agency. He also kept a copy of the Constitution at his desk and regularly used it during debates with his bosses about practices that he thought were illegal. Ironic fashion statement: Snowden apparently wore a sweatshirt just like this one to work at the NSA and his colleagues thought it was just a funny fashion choice rather than a warning sign . The source told Forbes that because Snowden was such a skilled consultant, his superiors gave him full administrative clearance without running him through the proper background channels because they wanted to make use of his talents. 'Big mistake in hindsight,' the source told the news site. 'But if you have a guy who could do things nobody else could do, and the only problem was that his badge was green instead of blue, what would you do?' Before making his controversial move, Snowden allegedly tried to help the NSA in beefing up their security protocols, reporting glitches that were apparently never fixed. The source also revealed that one of Snowden's bosses, whose name has not been released, gave Snowden his password while he was on vacation. NSA investigators have not found that account to have been misused during that time by Snowden. His supporters: Journalist Glenn Greenwald (left) and his partner David Miranda (right) are trying to help him secure asylum in any number of South American countries, including Miranda's home country of Brazil . He was also offered a higher position on a more prestigious team- called Tailored Access Operations- and Snowden declined in favor of a consulting position at Booz Allen. The move also kept Snowden from becoming a fully-fledged government employee which would theoretically increase the number of criminal charges he could be prosecuted with post-leak. The source's stories, while not taking the blame away from Snowden, certainly paints him in a better light than other recent interviews by former CIA director Michael Morell told 60 Minutes. ‘I do not believe he is a whistle blower,’ Mr Morell told the CBS interviewer on Sunday. ‘I do not believe he is a hero, I believe he has betrayed his country.’ Snowden's case got a boost from a District Court judge who placed a temporary injunction against the government from making unlawful searches and seizures of two specific citizens. The ruling was seen as a major victory for Snowden and his advocates as it is expected to be brought to the Supreme Court. Today, Snowden penned an open letter to the people of Brazil- whose president has publicly condemned the U.S. for their surveillance tactics- offering to help them prevent further spying. He claimed the letter was not a plea for asylum, but many viewed it that way since his permission to stay in Russia will expire after one year.","His former colleague tells how Snowden wore a hacker sweatshirt to the NSA offices in Hawaii and kept a Constitution on his desk .

Thus shopping, by restoring control over one's situation, can reduce sadness,' the researchers explain. The study showed two groups: 'browsers' - window shoppers - and 'choosers', twelve different items. The study found that 79 percent of the choosers felt that they were more in control while choosing, while just 2 percent of the browsers felt that way. Researchers also found that the choosers were three times less sad than the browsers. The perfect excuse to hit the shops? Researchers claim that sadness is strongly associated with a sense that situational forces control the outcomes in one's life. Thus shopping, by restoring control over one's situation, can reduce sadness . According to The Huffington Post, this is backed up by a 2011 paper that claimed shopping helps boost our mood and that 'the consumption of self-treats can be strategically motivated.' While treating ourselves to . something nice may improve our mood, there has also been plenty of contradictory research over the years. A study from the . University of Chicago suggests that shopping as a cure for loneliness is . futile - and could in fact make us feel more lonely. In . fact, the very act of fending off loneliness by shopping can create a . vicious cycle where one shops because they are lonely, feels more lonely . because they have shopped, and continues shopping in a misguided . attempt to cure the loneliness.","Revealed in study The Benefits Of Retail Therapy: Making Purchase Decisions Reduces Residual Sadness .

A New Yorker who fascinated doctors because he was resistant to H.I.V. and AIDS has committed suicide, aged 66. Stephen Crohn was dubbed 'The Man Who Can't Catch AIDS' by The Independent in 1996 after his boyfriend and scores of his friends passed away from the disease but he remained healthy. Bravely, he volunteered to have his white blood cells exposed to H.I.V. but doctors were unable to infect him - even at concentrations thousands of times stronger than anything that would occur outside a test tube. But on August 23, he committed suicide, his sister Amy Crohn Santagata said on Friday. 'My brother saw all his friends around him dying, and he didn't die,' Ms Santagata said, according to The New York Times. 'He went through a tremendous amount of survivor guilt about that and said to himself, ""There's got to be a reason.""' She added: 'He was quite extraordinary, and then also quite ordinary.' Mr Crohn's boyfriend, Jerry Green, a handsome gymnast, was among the first people to die of AIDS in 1982 after contracting the disease in 1978. Mr Crohn cared for him as he lost 30 . pounds, went blind and was eaten away by the mystery illness.

In the . years that followed, scores of the couple's friends died of AIDS but he . never got ill, despite being as sexually active as them all and not . taking any special precautions. When he realized he was different, he volunteered to work with doctors to find out why. 'I couldn't infect the CD4 cells,' Dr . Bill Paxton, who the worked at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center . in New York, said. 'I'd never seen that before.' Break-through: The research based on Mr Crohn's defective blood cells has led to a drug maraviroc, pictured, that blocks the CCR5 receptor, keeping infection from spreading once patients have caught H.I.V. Years . later, researchers isolated the reason. H.I.V. gets into the white . blood cells by fitting into two receptors but Mr Crohn's second receptor . was flawed due to a genetic defect. The anomaly, found in less that 1 . per cent of the population, saved Mr Crohn's life. 'What . he contributed to medical knowledge is really quite extraordinary,' Dr . Bruce D.

Mr Crohn was a prolific painter, sculpture and editor and also worked as a social worker in New York. He had recently moved out of Manhattan where he had a studio for many years to Malden-on-Hudson in upstate New York. In addition to Ms Santagata, Mr Crohn is survived by two other sisters, Carla Crohn Friedman and Judith Bloom, and their children whom he loved. 'My brother was, at times, my best friend,' Ms Santagata wrote on her blog in a memorial to Mr Crohn, adding that he had become depressed in the past decade.

We were partners in practical jokes and he was wonderful with my children until the dark clouds overcame him sometime at the turn of the 21st century, a milestone for all us baby boomers.' Carla Crohn Friedman wrote on Crohn's Facebook page: 'We are all shocked and devastated by this loss and will miss his laughter and big hugs. 'Family was most important to him and he adored being an uncle and great uncle to all of his many nieces and nephews. He was witty, funny, silly and charming. He was very bright and talented in so many areas. He is now at peace and with people who he loved so much on this earth.' Dr Paxton said he and Mr Crohn remained friends over the years.

The demise of Comet ISON was deemed inevitable, with scientists around the world saying it would disintegrate as it flew close to the sun. However, the latest images from Nasa and the European Space Agency suggest that the comet, or at least fragments of it, may have survived. At around 6.35pm GMT on Thursday, the so-called 'comet of the century' was spotted on a trajectory towards the sun before seeming to disappear. Yet, shortly afterwards bright lights were spotted that some scientists have claimed could be the comet's nucleus. Scroll down for video . At 6.35pm GMT on Thursday the so-called 'comet of the century' was spotted on a trajectory towards the sun before disappearing. Shortly afterwards bright lights (pictured top left) were spotted that some scientists have claimed could be the comet's nucleus . Fire in the sky: In this frame grab taken from an enhanced video made by Nasa's STEREO-A spacecraft, comet ISON, left, approaches the sun on November 25. ISON, which was discovered a year ago, was closest to the sun on Thursday . 'Initially when something came out (after close approach), we thought this is just the dust trail and there's not much left, it's just going to fade away,' astronomer Matthew Knight told CBS News. 'And then images keep coming in and...the last few, it seems pretty definitely like it's getting brighter. So we do not have a good answer as to what's going on.' Some scientists feared the delicate comet had already started to disintegrate, even before it grazed the 'surface' of the sun, 1.2 million kilometres away. Dr Dan Brown, an expert in astronomy at Nottingham Trent University, told MailOnline that when the comet entered the sun's hottest outer layers it was exposed to a temperature of several million degrees. Some scientists feared the delicate comet (pictured, bottom right, as it approached the sun) had already started to disintegrate, even before it grazed the 'surface' of the sun, 1.2 million kilometres away . The bottom image shows Comet ISON blazing towards the sun on Thursday morning. By almost 1pm it is captured looking faded, pictured top . Here, Comet ISON is shown entering the field of view of the ESA and Nasa's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory on November 27. In this picture, called a coronagraph, the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible. The comet is seen in the lower right . Comet ISON was discovered by two amateur Russian astronomers in 2012 and travelled within 730,000 miles of the sun on Thursday . Comet ISON entered the view of NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on 21 November, where it could be seen with Earth, Mercury and comet 2P/Encke . Earlier this week, NASA released a high-resolution image of the streaking comet that looked like a swimming tadpole. It was captured by the H-1 camera on board NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on November 21. Nasa said ISON, which is officially labelled as Comet C/2012 S1, appeared to still be intact in its video and can be seen in these images along with Earth, Mercury and Comet 2P/Encke. The tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles - called the solar wind - that flows out from the sun. A composite image from the European Southern Observatory's TRAPPIST telescope in Chile shows Comet ISON streaking toward the sun on Nov. 15. The image combines four different 30-second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths . If it has survived, ISON, pronounced EYE'-sahn, should be visible with the naked . eye through December, at least from the Northern Hemisphere. Discernible at times in November with ordinary binoculars and . occasionally even just the naked eye, it already has dazzled observers . and is considered the most scrutinised comet ever by NASA. But the best . is, potentially, yet to come if the comet really has survived its solar flyby. Dr Brown told MailOnline: 'This close encounter with the sun offers a unique opportunity for astronomers to analyse the composition of a comet. Comets are icy, dusty snowballs - the remains from the formation of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago. 'The long tail containing the material frozen in the comet and released through the heat of the sun offers astronomers the chance to identify different elements. 'It has already been bright enough for astronomers to capture amazing pictures. However, if the comet survives its burning close encounter with the sun it may have a huge and impressively long tail with a brightness that might make it an easy to spot object even with the naked eye. ISON, which has been dubbed the 'comet of the century', has been visible to the naked eye this month. German amateur astronomer Waldemar Skorupa recorded this image from Kahler Asten, in Germany, on 16 November . 'This happened in 1965 with the comet . Ikeya Seki that had an enormously long tail; but some comets, like . Lovejoy three years ago, have been ripped apart during their close . encounter by the sun's gravitational force. 'The . magic limit for survival of the comet seems to be the size, which has . to exceed 2 km so it does not get boiled away or ripped apart by the . sun. ISON is estimated to be that size, so we should all cross our . fingers and await our early Christmas comet,' he said. The . place to see the ‘comet of the century’ is in a clear dark sky where . the horizon is unobstructed, such as in the countryside. It can be seen with the naked eye, but binoculars will highlight details such as its tail, streamers and bumps in the surface. It should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky. ISON passed within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface yesterday at around 18:35 GMT. Detected just over a year ago, the . comet is passing through the inner solar system for the first time. Still fresh, this comet is thought to bear the pristine matter of the . beginning of our solar system. It's . believed to be straight from the Oort cloud on the fringes of the solar . system, which is home to countless icy bodies - most notably the frozen balls of . dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets. For . whatever reason, ISON was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward . the heart of the solar system by the sun's intense gravitational pull. The closer the comet gets to the sun, the faster it gets and in January, it was clocked at 40,000 mph (64,000 kph). By last Thursday, the comet had accelerated to 150,000 mph (240,000 kph) but by the time ISON slingshots around the sun, it will be moving at a mind-boggling 828,000 mph (1,332,000 kph). The comet, top right, has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout December - if it has survived. It could be the brightest for 100 years . The comet has been creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle of late as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail . Whether it has survived or is torn apart, humans have nothing to fear. The . comet will venture no closer to us than about 40 million miles (64 . million kilometres), less than half the distance between Earth and the . sun. The closest approach to Earth will occur on Boxing day - if the comet has survived. Then it will head away in the opposite direction forever, given its anticipated trajectory. ISON . is named after the International Scientific Optical Network, used by a . pair of Russian astronomers to detect the comet in September 2012, but . it officially is known as C/2012 S1, which indicates when it was . discovered. Take heart: The 'C' means it is not expected here again.","At around 6.35pm GMT the Comet ISON flew towards the sun .

British design experts have added a revolutionary new weapon to the armoury of time-starved families who are fed up with the daily chore of cleaning. The Dyson Hard is effectively a cross between an old-style mop and a vacuum cleaner. The hi-tech device uses a wet wipe on a pad on the bottom to clean away stains on hard floors, removing dried on kitchen spills. Scroll down for video . The hi-tech device uses a wet wipe on a pad on the bottom to clean away stains on hard floors . Separately, there is a vacuum which sucks up all the toast crumbs and accumulated dust. Arguably, the new £249.99 device is the biggest innovation since Sir James Dyson first launched his bagless vacuum cleaners 20 years ago. Importantly, it taps in to the growing desire among householders for cordless machines, which are not tied up in a cat's cradle of cables. The Dyson Hard also serves as an alternative to plug-in steam mops, which have become enormously popular for cleaning hard floors in the past two years. Again, the new device has the advantage that it is more convenient. There are no power cables, no water tank to fill or delay while it heats up. Innovation: The Dyson Hard also serves as an alternative to plug-in steam mops . Sir James said: ‘Good technology should make everyday tasks quicker and easier. ‘Dyson’s high-speed motor technology has enabled Dyson engineers to develop a cordless machine capable of vacuuming dirt and wiping away stains simultaneously. One machine doing two jobs, in one action.’ The company will sell packs of wet wipes, which are wrapped around the base and clamped in place. These will be either standard versions or ones specifically for wood floors. The machine is compatible with packs of wipes available from other manufacturers. The cleaner head of the machine, also known as the DC56, can be removed to add a crevice and combination tool for cleaning hard to reach places. The company will sell packs of wet wipes, which are wrapped around the base and clamped in place . Dyson's range of innovative gadgets have become a staple of homes. The bagless vacuum cleaner, made 20 years ago, has even made it onto the list of 100 gadgets of . the past century that we can’t live without. Here are some of the other inventions that have made life easier for consumers: . Ballbarrow: A wheelbarrow with a ball replacing the wheel . Trolleyball: A trolley that launched boats . Bagless vacuum cleaner: The Dyson cleaner was the first bagless vacuum . Dyson Ball: Vacuum cleaner using the ball from the Ballbarrow . Dyson Airblade: Fast-working hand dryer . Air Multiplier: Bladeless fan . The fact it is cordless means that it is also useful for cleaning the car or worktops. The cleaner is powered by the Dyson digital motor V2, which is one third of the size of conventional motors, yet spins at 104,000rpm. While this is backed up by a powerful lithium-ion battery, which delivers 15 minutes of fade free performance. For stubborn dirt, there is a boost setting for six minutes of high intensity cleaning. The machine’s body is made from ABS Polycarbonate, which is the same material found in riot shields, while the lightweight reinforced wand is aluminium. The DC56 was slammed into obstacles from a number of different angles 39,154 times to ensure it was robust and durable. It was also subjected a tumble test with the machine spending over an hour in a rig simulating the effects of a giant cement mixer. Dyson has become one of the UK’s few modern day manufacturing success stories, with massive sales around the world. While its machines are now made in Malaysia it invests nearly £1.5 million a week into research and development, mainly in this country. The company employs hundreds of engineers and scientists at its Research and Development headquarters in Wiltshire and will recruit 250 more this year, including many recent graduates. The ‘Dyson Hard’ will first go on sale in Tesco from tomorrow(thrs) under an exclusive deal before becoming more widely available.","Uses a wet wipe on a pad on the bottom to clean away stains .

Only one in every 67 reports of illegal immigration result in a person being booted out of the country, a damning report by MPs reveals today. Incredibly, in 94 out of every 100 cases, immigration officials are not even bothering to properly follow-up on tip offs from concerned members of the public. This is despite David Cameron personally urging people to ‘report suspected illegal immigrants’ a to new Border Agency database so they could be deported. Police and Border Agency officials evict Rumanian immigrants from a derelict site in London. Despite raids such as this a report has found that just one in every 67 reports of illegal immigration result in a person being deported . MPs say that, as a result of the inaction by officials, people will lose confidence and could soon stop bothering to ring the authorities to report illegal working or visa over-stayers. The revelations are contained in yet another critical report on the UK’s border controls by Westminster’s home affairs select committee. The report revealed that between its introduction on September 30 last year and June 30 this year, the illegal immigrant database received 48,660 allegations - about 178 a day. But, in the eight months to May this year, allegations resulted in only 2,695 investigations with visits by Immigration Enforcement officers, 1,840 arrests and 660 removals. MPs said this was the equivalent of only around 6 per cent of claims leading to an investigation and 1.5 per cent to removals. Home affairs select committee chairman Keith Vaz said there was a backlog of more than 430,000 Border Agency cases . The study also said the UKBA had a backlog of 432,029 immigration and asylum cases when it was scrapped at the end of March - which at current levels will take five years to clear. After a raft of damning reports, Home Secretary Theresa May abolished the UKBA earlier this year, and replaced it with UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, under the direct control of ministers. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘There are still over 430,000 cases languishing in the backlogs, enough to fill Wembley Stadium almost five times over. ‘As we have said on numerous occasions, the backlogs must be cleared as a matter of priority. Only then will the Home Office be able to tackle the deeper problems in the immigration system.’ The committee also took aim at the government's recent efforts to reduce Britain's 'pull factor' for immigrants by introducing charges for access to the NHS. Under the proposals, temporary migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including those on a route to settlement in the UK, will face a healthcare surcharge of around £150 per year for students and around £200 per year for others. The MPs claimed it could unfairly hit victims of people trafficking and said a fairer scheme would be to force visa applicants to take out private health insurance. The committee backed the Home Office's policy of trying to persuade illegal immigrants to go home voluntarily, with government support. MPs agreed this was cheaper than forced removals, which cost around £11,000 each. But they joined attacks on the so-called 'racist van ', which toured London advising illegals to 'go home' or face arrest. The vans were scrapped by Mrs May last month after proving ineffective. Protestors demonstrating against UK Border Agency fishing raids in Chinatown, London, last month . The report said: 'Tough enforcement action should be taken against those who are determined to remain here illegally, but for the target audience of potential voluntary returners, the effectiveness of the carrot is potentially undermined by the ostentatious brandishing of the stick.' Mr Vaz said: ‘If the Government wants to get tough on illegal immigrants it needs to take effective action. When people make allegations about those here illegally the Home Office must act. ‘Currently only six in 100 reports of illegal immigrants result in an actual investigation and only 1.5 in 100 result in removal. This is a very poor record and does not give confidence to those who go out of their way to help the Home Office.’ Mr Vaz lamented the 'chaotic summer for immigration policy', citing the controversial 'go home' vans, allegations that Capita asked British citizens to leave their own country, Twitter being used to publicise raids and the U-turn on visa bonds. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'The UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation since its formation in 2008 and its performance was not good enough. That is why we split the Agency and brought its work into the Home Office under two distinct directorates. 'We have already made some progress and it is welcome that the backlog according to the Select Committee has been reduced by 70,400 or 14 per cent in the quarter. Our newly created UK Visa and Immigration directorate is focused on delivering a high-volume, high-quality visa service while Immigration Enforcement is getting tough on those who break our immigration laws. 'We are building an immigration system that the public can have confidence in. We have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010.'","MPs warn people will lose confidence and stop reporting illegal working .

Generous: Jack MacDonald has left $187m to charities - despite giving the impression he was poor . A Seattle attorney who wore sweaters with holes in, collected coupons and rode the bus to work has left a staggering $187.6 million to charities after passing away. Jack MacDonald, who had lived in a retirement community in the city for nearly 20 years, led people to believe he was poor despite his secret inherited fortune. When he passed away in September after suffering a fall in July, he left a charitable trust to Seattle Children’s Research Institute, the University of Washington School of Law and the Salvation Army. The donation is the largest philanthropic gift in Washington state this year, and the sixth-largest in the country in 2013, Children's officials told the Seattle Times. He was born in British Columbia and grew . up in Seattle, where he worked as an attorney for the . Veterans Administration for three decades. And even though 40 per cent of his . fortune went towards children's research - and is the biggest donation . ever given in the U.S. for pediatric research - he didn't have any . children of his own. He married wife Mary, a widow who already had two grown children of her own, in 1971, when he was in his 50s. Relatives said she opened his eyes to what they could do, and together they traveled throughout Europe and Australia, Canada and Africa. But apart from these trips, they were happy to live simply. 'They were happy the way they were,' Mary's daughter, Regan Dennis, said. 'They were very comfortable, and they had a beautiful garden.' Together: MacDonald is pictured with his wife Mary in 1984. They enjoyed traveling together but lived a largely humble life and moved into a retirement community in Seattle in the 1990s . His wealth was inherited from his parents, who owned MacDonald Meat Co. in Seattle, and he sought to boost the funds by investing their money. His stepdaughter, Regan Dennis, said he was amazing at knowing where to put his money. 'He didn’t . trust a lot of other people to do his research,' she said. 'He directed what he . wanted [to be] bought, and he really knew what he wanted.' In the years before his death, he gave smaller donations, such as $536,000 to Children’s, where his mother had previously been a longtime fundraiser. 'I thought of him in many ways as a . gentle giant,' Doug Picha, president of the Seattle Children’s . Foundation who had known MacDonald for 30 years, told the Times. 'He was tall, . very shy, very understated, humble. You would never have known that he . had great wealth.' Benefactors: Forty per cent of his trust will go towards the Seattle Children's Hospital, where his mother had been a fundraiser. It is the biggest donation for pediatric research in the U.S. ever . Alma Mater: The University of Washington School of Law, where he earned his law degree in 1940, is also named in the trust. His donation is the biggest the law school has ever received . Picha would visit MacDonald and his wife at their retirement community home after they moved there in 1997. Mary died two years later, and MacDonald focused on his stocks - and wearing holey sweaters so no one would know about his wealth, his step-daughter said. Every day, he worked out, visited the grocery store and walked to his stockbroker to check on his accounts, Picha told the Times. He also visited the hospital to listen to the children's stories. Over the years, he also sent $150,000 to Elora in Canada, where his parents were buried. This donation helped with town projects, such as building an ice rink and the town hall. After the donation, the town's central square was named in his honor. He has been buried there with his parents. He also knew he wanted money to go to the law school in Washington after his death, as it was where he had earned his degree in 1940. It is the largest gift the law school has ever had. Humble home: He spent his last two decades at Horizon House, a retirement complex in Seattle . The trust will now support student scholarships and other education needs at the school. The remaining 30 per cent of the trust's income will support The Salvation Army Northwest Division, which MacDonald wanted to support as his father had worked with blue-collar workers. Officials said it was a surprise to them, explaining a statement: 'We didn’t know him, but he definitely knew us.' In July, MacDonald fell and was rushed to hospital for treatment for a head injury - and even when he was there he said he didn't 'want those expensive brand-name drugs'. Dennis said her step-father had told her that he wanted to be remembered as a philanthropist. 'He felt really good about what he was doing with his money,' Dennis said, 'and our family feels good about what he’s doing with his money.'","Jack MacDonald gave the impression he was poor - but he had inherited a secret fortune from his parents and bought good stocks .

A woman not seen by neighbours for 30 years has been found dead with her daughter after complaints of a pungent smell coming from their dilapidated house. Police who broke into the property found the body of Caroline Jessett, aged in her 50s, but were forced to flee amid fears the house would collapse on them. When they returned today they discovered her mother, Pauline, who was aged in her 70s. Grim find: A police officer stands guard outside the crumbling home where the bodies of Caroline Jessett and her elderly mother Pauline were found . Unsafe: Police found Caroline's body on November 21 but had to leave the house because they feared it could collapse on top of them . Following the initial call to the house on November 21, construction experts spent a week shoring up the walls. The women were thought to have been dead since at least June, and in the case of Mrs Jessett potentially for much longer. Neighbours described both women as reclusive and some said they had not seen Mrs Jessett for 30 years. Those living in the street in Littlemore, Oxfordshire said that curtains at the Jessett home were always drawn, and the women always refused to  answer callers’ knocks on the front door. Detectives were treating both deaths as 'unexplained', but not suspicious. A post mortem examination already carried out on the daughter’s decomposed body, was unable to find any clues to her death. Probe: Forensic officers were seen coming in and out of the property as police investigated the deaths . 'I haven’t seen Pauline for over 30 years,' said one woman neighbour, who declined to be named. 'She became a recluse after her husband died when he was in his 40s, in the 1980s. 'Their daughter, Caroline, went to school, but she never went to work afterwards. 'You would occasionally see the . daughter going out to do the shopping in the early morning and she would . always walk with her head down. Inside look: Police broke into the end-of-terrace home after neighbours complained of a strong smell coming from the house . 'She would say ‘hello’ if you spoke to her but I don’t think I have seen her for six months. 'She was a bit strange, but I think that was a bit about her upbringing.' The woman told how Mrs Jessett had a riding accident when she was in her late teens and had walked with a stiff leg and arm. 'The curtains in the house were always pulled and you couldn’t see in,' said the woman. 'You never saw anyone take the bins out or anything like that, they were not normal neighbours. 'The house looks terrible from the outside and I dread to think what it must look like on the inside.' Another . elderly neighbour said: 'Many years ago I used to knock on the door to . see if they were okay in there, but nobody ever answered and the . curtains never twitched. 'It was all very strange.' Neighbours told how in the summer they had seen flies swarming around inside the house. 'There were flies everywhere around the home in July,” said one resident. 'It seems likely that the bodies were already decompoising at that stage,' added the neighbour. Forensic . experts wearing white boiler suits were seen coming in and out of the . property, which has a large two storey extension to rear.

The largest and brightest cosmic explosion ever witnessed has been captured 3.7 billion light years away. Astronomers have called the gamma ray burst 'the monster' because it created five times more energy than the largest previously-known blast and if it had been closer to Earth, our planet could have been destroyed. Orbiting telescopes spotted the blast in April and it is believed that the only bigger display astronomers know of is the Big Bang. Scroll down for video... The cosmic explosion happened 3.7 billion light years away in April 2013. Nasa said the blast created energy bursts five times stronger than the largest known blast and the only larger display astronomers known of was the Big Bang . A gamma ray burst happens when a . massive star dies, collapses into a brand-new black hole, explodes in . what's called a supernova and ejects energetic radiation. The radiation . is as bright as can be as it travels across the universe at the speed of . light. A planet caught in one of these bursts would lose its atmosphere instantly and would be left a burnt cinder, astronomers say. Scientists might be able to detect . warning signs of an impending gamma ray burst but if a burst were . headed for Earth there wouldn't be anything anybody could do about it. However, astronomers put the chances of that happening at around 1 in 10 million. 'This burst was a once-in-a-century cosmic event,' said Nasa astrophysics chief Paul Hertz. Nasa telescopes have been seeing bursts of various sizes for more than two decades, spotting one every couple of days. However, this one, witnessed on 27 April this year, set records, according to four studies published in the journal Science. Researchers say it took the light from this event 3.7 billion years to reach us. The burst is said to have flooded Nasa monitoring instruments with five times the energy of its nearest competitor, a 1999 blast, said University of Alabama at Huntsville astrophysicist Rob Preece, author of one of the studies. It started with a star that had 20 to 30 times the mass of our sun but was only a couple of times wider, meaning it was incredibly dense. Researchers claimed it exploded in a certain violent way. In general, gamma ray bursts are 'the most titanic explosions in the universe,' and this one was so big that some of the telescope instruments hit their peak, continued Preece. 'I call it the monster.' One of the main reasons the April burst was so bright was that relative to the thousands of other gamma ray bursts astronomers have seen, it was pretty close by cosmic standards. The burst is said to have flooded Nasa monitoring instruments with five times the energy of its nearest competitor, a blast from 1999. It started with a star that had 20 to 30 times the mass of our sun but was only a couple of times wider, meaning it was incredibly dense . A light-year is almost 6 trillion miles (almost 10 trillion kilometers) and most of the bursts Nasa telescopes have seen have been twice as distant as this one. This burst was so bright telescopes on Earth saw a brief flash in the constellation Leo. For . scientists, this was a wow moment: 'These are really neat explosions,' said Peter Michelson, a Stanford physicist who is the chief scientist . for one of the instruments on a Nasa gamma ray burst-spotting telescope. The gamma-ray burst is extremely bright and is the most luminous object in the field, as seen in the image on the left. The right image is a close-up of the gamma-ray burst, taken by the ultraviolet/optical telescope on the Swift satellite . 'If you like fireworks, you can't beat these. Other than the Big Bang itself, these are the biggest there are.' The burst 'is part of the cycle of . birth and life and death in the universe,' Professor Michelson added. 'You and I . are made of the stuff that came from a supernova.' Some claim that a mass extinction on Earth 450 million years ago was caused by a gamma ray burst in a nearby part of our galaxy. The Swift satellite has three instruments on board. They work together to get as much information about each gamma-ray burst as possible .","The cosmic explosion happened 3.7 billion light years away in April 2013 .

This is the huge steel arch that will entomb Chernobyl's reactor four, and slash the risk of another radioactive disaster. The construction, which is one of the biggest engineering projects in history, is being built to seal off nuclear fuel buried inside reactor four which blew up in 1986. Standing 360 feet tall, and 843 feet wide, the arch will be held together by 680,000 bolts. The Chernobyl arch is one of the biggest engineering projects in history . A workman directs a crane at the Chernobyl site . People working have an annual allowance of radiation that they are allowed to be exposed to. When this allowance runs out they must stop work . The huge arch will seal off the reactor at the plant, which blew up in 1986 releasing deadly radiation across Europe . The arches are being constructed a safe distance away from the reactor site, and will be moved into place when they are completed . Costing £1.5billion to build the feat of engineering is a small price to pay to prevent another disaster like the one which blighted generations in the Ukrainian region. Radiation from the blast also spread across the former USSR and Europe prompting fears at the the time about the safety of nuclear power stations. Don Kelly, an American nuclear industry veteran, is overseeing the project. Workers and experts from 24 countries are working on the prestigious project .

A fractured aristocratic family is caught up in a venomous court dispute over the estranged oldest son’s claims that his grandfather denied him 25 years of income from a 1,000-acre Hampshire estate. Old Etonian, John Sheffield, 50, claims the family patriarch deprived him of his due until the day he died, although a 25 per cent stake in the family’s rolling land-holdings,had been gifted to him in 1983. As a result, he lost out on rent, farm yields and income from shooting rights on the estate, in Laverstoke in the heart of Hampshire’s tranquil Test Valley, London’s High Court has heard. Laverstoke House in Hampshire on 1,000-acre estate at the centre of the row between the aristocratic Sheffield family . However, Eason Rajah QC, representing his father, Julian Sheffield, told the court that John has 'gradually cut himself off from his family' over the past 18 years, believing his parents were 'responsible for physical abuse he believes he suffered at the hands of one of his nannies'. The estate was established by John’s grandfather - John Vincent Sheffield - in 1968 'in the fervent wish' that Julian and his heirs 'would continue to own and look after the estate for future generations', the court heard. Mr Sheffield, who died aged 95 in 2008, was the youngest son of the sixth baronet of Normanby, who 'rescued the family fortunes' after the Sheffields were threatened by crippling death duties following World War Two. Julian, now 74, followed his father into bank notes manufacturing business, Portals, where he later became chairman, and is now facing his own son across a tense courtroom. During an enormously costly 10-day trial Mr Rajah insisted that Julian and his father had acted in good faith throughout and that John had always understood that his share in the family trust that holds the estate was given to him by his grandfather in 1983 'as part of succession and tax planning'. 'The (family) understood John and his grandfather had reached an understanding at the time of the gift that John would allow his grandfather to receive all the income from the estate while he was alive,' said the QC. 'They understood that his grandfather and his wife would continue to occupy their home at New Barn House, on the estate, and generally he would be treated during his lifetime as if he was still the owner'. 'John says nobody told him his rights,' said Mr Rajah, but the barrister argued that the astute economics graduate 'was party to the gift and knew and understood what he was signing'. There was, in any case, 'no dispute' that the estate’s trustees are 'bound to account' to John in respect of his 25 percent share from May 2008 - the date of his grandfather’s death, said Mr Rajah. Julian insisted in court that his son had been well aware of the true position, adding that he was in line to receive 'a huge benefit - because he would ultimately own 25 per cent of a valuable estate'. Father and son sat in court just yards apart - separated by a document-strewn desk. Two of John’s siblings - Simon Sheffield and Nicola Graham - also stepped into the witness box to back their father’s account. Mrs Graham, 40, recounted a conversation with her grandfather, when she was aged 16, in which he 'told me he was passing on his interest in the estate to John but that he was to keep all the income until he died'. 'I remember thinking how lovely it was that John - who at the time was a lovely person and full of life and a great older brother - that the estate would be passed onto the next generation through him,' she told the court. Mrs Graham, who described her grandfather as a 'wonderful man', said he had told her his plan because he 'wanted to share it with me'. John had for years accepted the status quo without demur, claimed Mr Rajah, and his father had described him as 'everything we could have wished for in an eldest son'. However, by the end of the 1990s, family relations were becomingly increasingly strained, the court heard, prompting group therapy sessions 'in an attempt to reconcile the family’ relationship with John'. The family had also made 'strenuous efforts' to mediate the dispute before reaching court, but without success, said Mr Rajah. The dispute has its origins in 2005 when John first challenged his father and grandfather about his entitlement to a quarter share of the estate’s income. John’s QC, Christopher Pymont, said it was never spelt out in 1983 that his grandfather was retaining his right to income from the estate. 'The point of the trust is to effect a gift. There was no word about reserving for John’s grandfather a life interest in the income of that trust,' he said. 'Although they knew that the gift was made and, indeed, intended the gift to be made, they didn’t follow it through and give effect to the rights that the gift gave to John.' The barrister said that, having gifted John his 25 percent share, but with his grandfather still needing income from the estate, the trustees were left having to 'square the circle'. He added: 'What they actually did was ignore John from thenceforth.' Judge Mark Pelling QC has now reserved his ruling on the case .","The Sheffield family own a 1,000-acre Estate in Laverstoke, Hampshire .

Royal Mail shares could be worth more than £6 in a year, Goldman Sachs said yesterday – just weeks after the same bank told the Government they should only be  valued at £3.30. Critics say it is now clear the price was far too low and that the taxpayer has lost out on millions as a result. In a research report by the bank’s team of equity analysts, Goldman Sachs said its ‘target price’ for the shares in 12 months was £6.10. Goldman Sachs said yesterday that Royal Mail shares could be valued at more than £6 within a year . This is nearly 85 per cent higher than the price at which Royal Mail was floated. The news fuels growing fears that Royal Mail was sold cheap, ripping off the taxpayer. Despite this, Goldman Sachs was paid £2.8million as joint global  co-ordinator of the sale, and is in line for an £800,000 ‘discretionary fee’. The bank tried to lay the blame for the low share price on the threat of strikes from Royal Mail workers . Last night, Labour MP Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Commons business select committee, said: ‘The research report reinforces all the suspicions that the general public have about the way that Royal Mail was sold.’ He said it would be ‘completely wrong’ if the bank was paid the extra £800,000 – a decision yet to be made by Business Secretary Vince Cable. Mr Bailey added: ‘It would be completely out of order to give them more money for getting something so comprehensively wrong and making money out of it.’ A director of the bank told MPs last week how it had valued Royal Mail at between £3billion and £3.75billion in its pitch to win its advisory role. But the bank’s latest target price would have valued the former State monopoly at more than £6billion. Mr Bailey expressed his surprise this week at the decision to appoint Goldman Sachs, which has been involved in a long court case, accused of pricing the American firm eToys too cheaply when it was floated. It agreed to a multi-million-dollar out-of-court settlement in September, but denies liability. He said the decision to appoint Goldman Sachs for the Royal Mail sale was like asking Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs ‘to have an appointment with Securicor’. During a grilling by MPs on the committee last week, the bank’s managing director, Richard Cormack, said: ‘I think, in the context, this was a well-executed transaction.’ He claimed it would have been impossible to sell 600million shares at current prices.

Jeremy Hunt says hundreds of thousands of sufferers are condemned to a life of fear and anxiety because they are receiving no help . More than half of those with dementia are not receiving medicine or support from the NHS, the Health Secretary reveals today. Jeremy Hunt says hundreds of thousands of sufferers are condemned to a life of fear and anxiety because they are receiving no help. Stigma is a ‘huge part of the problem’, with patients terrified to seek a diagnosis and too many GPs thinking there is no point in doing so. The fight against diseases such as Alzheimer’s is as ‘significant as that against cancer, heart disease and HIV’, Mr Hunt will say, as it is revealed the national diagnosis rate for dementia is only 48 per cent. In addition, an unforgivable postcode lottery means people living in neighbouring cities have hugely varying chances of being diagnosed, with 75 per cent of cases in the best area being diagnosed – compared with 33 per cent in the worst. It means hundreds of thousands of people are living without medication to stave off their condition and their families are not receiving help from the State. It appears that a distinct North/South divide on dementia exists – with diagnosis rates in the South and East of the country much lower than in the North and West. The failings mean many people are being forced into expensive residential care much earlier than necessary, when they could live happily in their homes for much longer if they had been diagnosed. On the eve of the launch of the first-ever national survey of dementia diagnosis, Mr Hunt said: ‘In too many parts of the country, people think that there is no point in getting it diagnosed because they think nothing is going to happen. The fight against diseases such as Alzheimer's is as 'significant as that against cancer, heart disease and HIV', Mr Hunt will say, as it is revealed the national diagnosis rate for dementia is only 48 per cent . ‘And sadly, in some parts of the country that is true. We need to ensure that when someone is diagnosed, the system swings into action and gets people the support they need. 'There is a demographic time bomb but we are not giving people the care we should be giving them.’ Of all the conditions that occur in later life, dementia is the most feared. A poll found that 39 per cent of 55-year-olds fear getting Alzheimer’s above any other disease, including cancer. Mr Hunt said there is a lot GPs can do these days including medicines to stave off the condition . About 670,000 people in England live under the shadow of dementia, and experts expect this number to double over the next 30 years. Mr Hunt said Britain had a moral responsibility to fight dementia. ‘There are still some GPs who think there is no point giving someone a dementia diagnosis, and in the past they would have had a point. 'But now there is a lot they can do – medicines to stave off the condition, support for families. 'We need to get the message out that things are changing. ‘In the 60s, people were terrified of cancer and people were terrified of talking about it. 'In the 80s, it was Aids. Unless we start talking about dementia, we will not be able to improve the situation.’ The Health Secretary spoke ahead of the publication of a report showing how well dementia services fare across the country. It looks at how many sufferers would be expected in an area based on the local demographic profile, and what proportion have diagnoses. The best performing area is Corby in Northamptonshire on 75 per cent, followed by South Tyneside on 71 per cent. At the other end of the scale are Herefordshire and Harrow, North-West London, both on 33 per cent. It shows that diagnosis rates vary wildly between neighbouring areas. Birmingham Central has a diagnosis rate of 64 per cent, while nearby Walsall is on 37 per cent. The North London borough of Islington has a diagnosis rate of 64 per cent, compared with 33 per cent in nearby Harrow. Last night Liz Kendall, Labour’s spokesman for older people, said: ‘If David Cameron was serious about improving the quality of dementia care, he would not have cut council budgets for older people’s social care to the bone.’","Jeremy Hunt says thousands are condemned to a life of fear and anxiety .

One half of a randy couple ended up in court for causing criminal damage after their bed collapsed while having sex. Adam Disney, 28, and his unknown partner also pulled down window drapes in the bedroom during the tryst following a night out in Liverpool. A court heard that instead of going to one of their houses, they were unable to contain their passions and let themselves into a bedsit that Disney used to rent. Unfortunately for Disney, he was spotted hanging out of the property’s window enjoying a post-passion cigarette. Passion: The building (centre) containing the flat where Adam Disney brought down drapes and made the bed collapse. He admitted criminal damage. The betting shop was not thought to be involved .

A court heard it was the best he and his partner could do without offending public decency . Police visited the flat in Wavertree High Street after neighbours heard 'noises', Liverpool magistrates heard. They found Disney in the empty flat - his companion had already left - and first charged him with burglary until he admitted the full story. Dan Lupton, defending, blamed 'sexual antics' and said: 'This is a curious case of the morning after the night before. 'They had been drinking and the couple were passionate in their interest to have sexual relations. 'On this occasion they were seeking to avail themselves rather quickly.

Disney, of Widney Lane, Solihull, admitted criminal damage to the double bed and curtain rail, but denied breaking the windowsill when he leaned on it. Chairman of the bench Stan Golding ordered him to pay £355, split into a £100 fine, £85 costs, £150 compensation to the owner and a £20 victim surcharge. The flat's owner had asked for £500 and claimed the lock was damaged, but Mr Lupton described the premises as a 'shabby bedsit'. He said: 'The windowsill was loose and they hadn’t done a good job of securing the curtain rail.

But the size 8 mum struggles to fit into her clothes . Ever looked at Victoria Beckham’s clothes and wished you could raid her vast wardrobe, just for a day? Me too. I’ve recently started to admire VB’s fashion sense. Only one small problem - small being the operative word. Even though I’m a size 8-10, I fear squeezing into Posh’s frocks would be a stretch too far. So when I heard the Beckhams were giving away clothes to raise money for the Philippines, I knew it was my chance not only to support a worthwhile cause, but finally to see if I could fit into Victoria’s frocks. My daughter, Elsa, 14, who is a slim size 6, is just as excited. ‘Make sure you buy something I could wear Mum!’ she says, before going to school. And so I queued up outside the British Red Cross shop in Chelsea, West London, yesterday, elbows sharpened, to see what I could get my hands on. ‘Remember this is a charity shop. It’s for a good cause, so no squabbling’, says the woman on the door. Inside there are rails of cast-offs from Beckingham Palace — but sadly it’s fashion Siberia in there. Where are the iconic Versace gowns or the Herve Leger body-cons? Most of the items look like tat from the early . Noughties. There’s cami tops, cowboy boots and flared jeans as far as the eye can see. Then there’s a pair of red Dolce & Gabbana heels that I recognise from Posh’s back catalogue — these 4in beauties would have cost her £700 — some orange Jimmy Choos and some pretty ghastly boots from her Spice Girl days. There is also a white D&G tuxedo, previously modelled by David that I pause over... but no, my husband would kill me. In the end, I manage to get my hands on five of her designer cast-offs but, up close, Victoria’s clothes look even more childishly proportioned — after all, she has a legendary 23in waist. So will they really fit me, or is the only person who stands a chance of getting into them my teenage daughter? This frock is an actual size four - also known as the mythical size zero. Like the giant panda, I have never seen one in the flesh before. It takes me ten minutes of crowbarring to get it on and even then, as you can see (left), I couldn’t do up the side zip - not even close. I’ve barely got one boob in it and am aware my tummy is hanging out. I don’t know how Victoria does it - the woman must be built like a pencil! But . Elsa looks wonderful in this dress. It is a little big around the bust, . but that’s to be expected considering that Posh has had some help in . this area. Otherwise, it’s a perfect fit. The leather feels wonderfully soft, but sadly, the good news stops there. It’s so small I can barely dip my toe into this skirt, let alone fit it round my waist. It would be better worn as a sleeve. My ego is plummeting as I really expected to be able to get more of these clothes on. This skirt could have looked so elegant on me... Even Elsa struggles to get into it, which is claimed to be a size eight. I had to help zip her into it and she could barely walk because it was so tight. I find it extraordinary that a grown woman can fit into something a 14-year-old can’t. This has the potential to be an elegant dress, but it is just absurdly small. It has no size in the label, for which I’m almost thankful, but it can’t be any bigger than a size 4. I’ve never seen anything like it. As I struggle in, I think this that just can’t be meant for adults. Incredibly, I get it on but it rides up unbearably high on my thigh, thanks to my stomach stretching it in the wrong direction. The whole thing is so narrow and sheer it feels like slipping into a pair of tights. I’m thrilled to get it on - but devastated by my reflection. Obviously, Elsa looks amazing. I am so depressed. It fits her perfectly - which is unbelievable. I can’t imagine what Victoria looks like in real life if my tiny teenager can fit into her clothes. She clearly doesn’t have hips, never mind a muffin top. I don't have the best legs in the world, but I thought I might be in with a shot with these jeans. I’m a 28in waist and these say 24in, but they do look stretchy. Not stretchy enough, it turns out. I can’t get them above my thighs. This brand is one of VB’s favourite - I must have seen 40 identical pairs at the sale. Then Elsa puts them on and I am blown away. Her legs look phenomenal and she reminds me of a Seventies siren. My depression deepens. Mysteriously, this top doesn’t have a label. It looks like a one-off, with exposed wobbly seams, but the highest quality lace embellishments. I wouldn’t be surprised if one of VB’s designer friends knocked this up. I just manage to get into it, but the cup size is outrageously small. How do Posh’s ginormous boobs fit in this? It looks dated on Elsa (right), though it fits her perfectly.","Annabel Cole was delighted to buy some of Victoria Beckham's clothes .

Freedom at a cost: George Zimmerman racked up legal fees of $2.5million dollars as he was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin earlier this year . George Zimmerman racked up $2.5million in legal fees defending himself against a murder charge, his defense attorneys have revealed. The 30-year-old was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin earlier this year, but his freedom has come at a cost. He received the legal bill from lead attorneys Mark O'Mara and Don West two months ago. O'Mara initially took the case on in April 2012 at no charge to Zimmerman. But he later found out that the Zimmerman family were raising funds to fight the charge via a website appeal. More than $400,000 was donated to the fund by his supporters. The lawyer said during the trial that he and Mr West had not been paid but hoped that they would be in the future. They were paid a 'minute amount' following Zimmerman's acquittal, according to Mr O'Mara. The attorneys are thought to have benefited financially from the case even if they haven't be paid. O'Mara spent more than $52,000 on 'law firm support and infrastructure' - upgrading computer software, improved office security and new phones - earlier this year. The pair also formed the Timber Run Enterprises LLC partnership and bought the building next to O'Mara's existing Orlando office for $270,000. O'Mara has denied that the building was paid for using Zimmerman's defense money and said that instead it was leased to O'Mara's firm and that the defense money was used to pay rent. Zimmerman was acquitted in July of all charges, including second-degree murder over the shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, during a five-week trial. He told police that he shot the teenager in self-defence after the unarmed youngster attacked him. Expensive: Mark O'Mara was one of Zimmerman's defense attorneys during the trial. He and his partner hope to be paid the $2.5million legal bill one day . Not guilty: Zimmerman was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin, 17, back in July in a controversial case . Both the killing itself and the trial verdict prompted widespread demonstrations across the US. Orlando criminal defence lawyer Richard Hornsby described the $2.5million bill as 'mind-numbing' Clients are more often than not charged a flat rate fee rather than a by the hour rate. Former girlfriend: Zimmerman is currently faces charges in a domestic violence case in Seminole County involving Samantha Scheibe, pictured . In other cases where the client cannot afford a defense team, a nonrefundable retainer is paid to the lawyer and that covers legal costs until it runs out. After that money has been exhausted lawyers tend to charge by the hour. But the attorneys describe the charge as reasonable given that O'Mara charges $400 an hour and West $350. According to court paperwork, Zimmerman had no funds when the case begun and is unemployed and going through a divorce at present. He is also facing charges in a domestic violence case in Seminole County. Zimmerman is free on $9,000 bail on charges of aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief. He has pleaded not guilty. It emerged earlier this week that he had five guns and more than 100 rounds of ammunition with him when deputies arrested him. A search warrant made public on Tuesday by the Seminole County court clerk shows that Zimmerman had a 12-gauge shotgun, an AR-15 assault rifle and three handguns when he was arrested on November 18 at his girlfriend's house. The girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe, told deputies that Zimmerman pointed a shotgun at her during an argument.","Attorneys Mark O'Mara and Mark West billed Zimmerman two months ago .

At least 26 people have been killed after a train hit three vehicles on a level crossing in Egypt. Most of the victims are believed to come from the same family and were thought to be travelling back from a wedding in Cairo. Another 28 are still in hospital with fractures, crush injuries and missing limbs according to the head of Egypt's emergency services, Ahmed el-Ansari. Scroll down for video . At least 26 people have died following a train crash in Egypt in which a bus believed to have been carrying family members back from a wedding was hit on a crossing near Cairo . Another 28 people were reported to be in hospital with crush injuries, fractures, and missing limbs . He added that the identities of the victims was not immediately clear. The train, coming from Aswan and passing through Bani Swaif, crashed at a crossing near the Giza district, state media said. The head of the Giza security sector, Kamal el-Dali said the wedding bus had been making its way to the southern city of Fayyoum. While the initial death toll was 24 it rose to 26 after two people later died of their wounds in hospital. Security officials said the scene was now clear of victims. El-Dali said the train, which was carrying construction materials, also hit a small truck coming in the opposite direction. Officials have said that at least three vehicles were involved, including the bus and a small truck . The Egyptian rail minister said the  barriers of the crossing were down at the time of the accident . The head of Egypt's railway, Hussein Zakaria, told Nile News that initial reports indicated the crossing gates of the tracks had been closed and the train's driver was surprised to see vehicles still crossing. 'What could the guards have done? Stand in front of the bus?' Zakaria said. 'The initial reports show no negligence ... We shall wait for the investigation.' A security official said the train was traveling from the southern city of Beni Suef when it hit at least three vehicles near the village of Dahshur, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Cairo. The cargo train was travelling from the southern city of Beni Suef when it hit at least three vehicles near the village of Dahshur, about 25 miles south of Cairo . Last year 51 schoolchildren were killed in a similar accident to this one, blamed on Egypt's ageing rail network . The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters. Egypt is notorious for train collisions and has a poor safety record that is mostly blamed on decades of badly maintained equipment. Almost exactly a year ago, a train crashed into a bus, killing 51 children traveling to school in the governorate of Assiut, some 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of Cairo.

A baron's son who allegedly attacked . his BBC  presenter wife during a row was pepper-sprayed as he fought . with a policeman who was trying to arrest him, a court heard. The Hon Edward Charles d’Olier Gibson . is accused of punching an officer despite being sprayed twice in the . face and struck repeatedly in the shins with a baton after resisting . arrest for assaulting his wife. Police were called to the former city . financier’s £1million home after he allegedly dragged his wife of 12 . years, BBC World News presenter Tanya Beckett, by the hair as they rowed . about whether they should get a divorce. Claims: Charles Gibson, left, the son of a peer, is alleged to have fought with a policeman after a fight with his wife Tanya Beckett, right . Gibson, 45, appeared at Oxford . magistrates’ court yesterday charged with assaulting 47-year-old Mrs . Beckett and PC Aaron Walker. The Oxford-educated son of Edward Barry . Greynville Gibson, 80, fourth Baron Ashbourne, denies both charges. PC Walker told the court that Gibson . had made him fear for his well-being after the father managed to throw . him to the ground. The officer said he was called to the five-bedroom . detached home the couple shared near Watlington, Oxfordshire, in the . early hours of  June 8. Mrs Beckett had reported that Gibson . had threatened her and grabbed her hair during a discussion about . getting a divorce. Strength: Gibson, pictured with his wife at a Mayfair party in 2006, carried on fighting while handcuffed and simply wiped pepper spray out of his eyes . The officer said that the couple, who have three . children, had been drinking heavily and that when he arrived, he . discovered one of Gibson’s shotguns was unaccounted for. The policeman told District Judge Tim Pattinson that this led to a search of the grounds of the home. Then, at around 2.30am, the . defendant’s car pulled into the driveway. PC Walker said Gibson ignored . his instruction to stay put. After he tried to restrain Gibson, the pair grappled for 11 minutes. PC Walker, who said he weighs . 13-and-a-half stone, told the court that even though he handcuffed one . of his hands, Gibson managed to throw him off as if he weighed . ‘nothing’. 'Dragged by the hair': Police attended after Mrs Beckett reported that Gibson had threatened her and grabbed her hair during a discussion about getting a divorce . He added: ‘At some point, he has taken . a swing at me, which I moved to avoid. He said to me, “you’re not . arresting me, I’m going home”. ‘I then reached for my capacitor . (pepper spray) and sprayed it directly into Mr Gibson’s eyes. He stood . there, wiped it from his eyes and called me a coward. 'That is the first . time I have ever had a capacitor fail on me.’ The officer said he then drew his baton and hit Gibson as hard as he could, three times on his shins, which also had no effect. He said: ‘This was an “Oh no” moment . on my part, because I have never come across a person I have not been . able to physically overpower.’ PC Walker then described being punched in . the side by Gibson as he tried to grab him again. Wife: Gibson is accused of assaulting BBC World News presenter Tanya Beckett, whom he married in 2001 . Presenter: Gibson, pictured top left with colleagues at the launch of LBC radio in 2003, is a broadcaster . The policeman claims . Gibson then told him that he was ‘nobody and did not have the power to . arrest somebody like him’. The armed response unit had to be called as back up before Gibson was eventually taken into custody, the court heard. Edmund Gritt, defending, suggested to . PC Walker that his client had never said such words and the officer had . failed to identify who he was. The officer denied this. The trial was adjourned until later this month.","Charles Gibson, 45, 'fought with wife Tanya Beckett about their divorce'

A couple who ate 5,000 calories a day each and reached a combined weight of 44st went on to lose 13st by following the Hairy Bikers diet. Samantha Williams, 46, and boyfriend Dave Exelby, 36, both habitually consumed 5,000 calories - the equivalent of ten double cheeseburgers - every day before embarking on a life-changing health kick. At his heaviest Mr Exelby tipped the scales at just under 26st, while Miss Williams weighed 18st. Before their weight loss Dave weighed 26 stone (left) and Samantha tipped the scales at 18 stone (right) The couple lost 13st using the 'Hairy Bikers' diet, swapping their huge portions for low calorie alternatives . The couple, from Goole, East Yorkshire, lost 13st between them by following recipes in The Hairy Dieters cookbook, popularised by Strictly Come Dancing star Dave Myers and fellow Hairy Biker Si King. Miss Williams said: 'We enjoyed relatively healthy meals most of the time, including roast dinners, pasta, pizza and curry - the problem was the huge quantities we consumed. 'We would dig into massive portions at meal times and indulge in snacks in the meantime.' Miss Williams and Mr Exelby, who have ten-year-old twins named Georgia and Joseph, were prompted to change their eating habits as they increasingly found daily life exhausting. Miss Williams said: 'Looking after our twins as they grow up is a full-time job and Joe requires constant care as he is autistic. When we were overweight I wished we were in better shape so we could keep up with them. The pair, now at a trim 17st (left) and 14st (right) respectively, lost weight using the Hairy Bikers diet . Samantha and Dave admit they ate large portions and also indulged in snacks, although they had tried to exercise in the past they had failed to shift the pounds . Samantha and David before their weight loss at their twins christening. The couple found it hard to keep up with the twins, now 10-year-old, due to their size . 'We tried exercising to shift the pounds but it had no effect. We used to take our ten-year-old twins swimming but we were far too embarrassed to join a gym. 'The thought of dragging our bodies into a gym packed with slim people was terrifying.' The couple stumbled across ‘The Hairy Dieters’ cookery show in September 2012. Miss Williams said: 'We were amazed at how quickly the bikers had lost their bellies and we wondered whether it could work for us. 'Dave turned to me and said: ""That’s it. We’re going to give that a go.""' Dave, a lorry driver, found that the type of meals he could easily find on the road were unhealthy . The pair said they were too embarrassed to join a gym due to their large size . Samantha at 18 stone with her daughter Georgia, aged 10 . The pair bought the series cookbook the following month and embarked on a strict diet which reduced their calorie intake by a third. Miss Williams said: 'It wasn’t easy. At first I felt hungry all the time, but gradually I came to enjoy the low-calorie recipes. 'The first dish I attempted from the book was a low-calorie lasagne which used slices of leek instead of pasta sheets. It was delicious. 'For a while it felt as if I was cooking all the time, as I struggled to switch from shoving a frozen pizza in the oven to making a whole meal from scratch.' Dave's waistline has shrunk from 54in to 38in (left with daughter Georgia), while Samantha (right) says it's lovely to able to shop in the normal sized ranges on the high street now she has lost the weight . Eventually the pair started regularly exercising in a bid to shift the pounds. 'We bought a cross-trainer for the house so we could exercise together at home,' said Miss Williams. 'Dave bought himself a bike, but at first he struggled to cycle half a mile. Keen fisherman David says he loves their new active lifestyle . 'I watched him huffing and puffing along and realised I had never, in the 17 years we had been together, seen him riding a bike.' Mr Exelby, a lorry driver, found exercise a chore after being stuck behind the wheel for hours at a time for his job. Often the only food readily available to him had been fast food and greasy service station fry-ups. But today, a year since they started their diet, Mr Exelby weighs 17st after losing an impressive 9st. His waistline has shrunk from 54in to 38in. He said: 'Now I take healthy meals to work - pasta salad, natural yoghurt flavoured with some ginger, carrot and celery sticks and some low calorie popcorn for my sweet tooth. 'Our lives has changed completely. I feel incredible now. I’m out on my bike all the time. I love our new active lifestyle. 'I cannot wait until we get Joe a three-wheeled bike, so we can all go cycling together as a family - something I never thought would happen.' Miss Williams said: 'The kids know they can mess around with Dave now and he will chase after them. He can even chase them up the stairs - we could hardly walk up those stairs a year ago. 'We’ve had to replenish our wardrobe several times over the past year too. I love being able to shop in normal high street stores. It’s such a treat not to have to go to the back of the rail, where the XXL sizes hide. 'I have kept just one big coat from when I was really big. I still get it out now - but only as a reminder.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:03 EST, 20 December 2011 . The St Paul’s protest camp has become a ‘magnet’ for criminals, alcoholics and drug addicts, the High Court heard yesterday. The churchyard where anti-capitalist demonstrators have pitched 200 tents is also unsanitary and stinking, it was alleged. The claims were made as the City of London Corporation started legal action to evict the Occupy London protest which has been in the cathedral grounds since October 16. Scroll down for video . Occupy London protesters moved to the steps of the High Court today for the first day of legal proceedings to evict them . David Forsdick, representing the Corporation, said: ‘The protest camp has acted as a magnet for people who have caused significant disorder and a substantial increase in crime in this area.’ Social workers are concerned about the mentally ill, alcoholics and drug addicts who have been attracted to the camp, the court heard. On sanitation, Mr Forsdick said foul water and ‘other debris’ was being flushed down rainwater drains. He added: ‘There is an odour problem.’ The camp is damaging businesses near the cathedral and impairing worship, he said. And while the Corporation had not been able to establish how many tents were occupied at night, all the evidence suggested that a large number of protesters were ‘day visitors only’. The City and the court could not lawfully tolerate a position in which the rights of worshippers were seriously affected on an ongoing basis, Mr Forsdick said. He also said the rights of staff and clergy to go about their day-to-day business without unacceptable behaviour towards them were seriously impaired, and there was a substantial overall impact on trade in the area. The location was also unsuitable for such a major protest camp because of the disposal of waste and cleansing issues, he added. The City of London Corporation is trying to evict those in the Occupy London camp, some of whom turned up at the Royal Courts today . While many of the protesters were making efforts to try to ensure that it was kept clean, sanitary and hygienic, urination and defecation were significant problems, Mr Forsdick said. The City had also been concerned about the wellbeing of those suffering from mental illness, alcoholism or drug addiction who had been attracted to the camp, he said. The evidence from many witnesses was of chaotic and vulnerable people causing significant disorder at the camp, the court heard. 'This is a threat to them and to others,' Mr Forsdick said during the proceedings, which are due to last for four days. But in an act of defiance as the legal bid to evict them gets under way, Occupy London protesters are planning a two-week party. The demonstrators say they will be welcoming revellers, particularly the homeless, to join them. And they will be offering live music and free food - including turkey on Christmas Day, the Times reports. Parting shot: Anti-capitalist demonstrators announced plans for a two-week celebration outside St Paul's as a High Court bid to evict them got underway today . However, the festivities could be seen as a parting gesture from the protesters. As the likelihood grows that the protesters will be evicted, it is believed the camp leaders are discussing proposals to reduce their presence on the steps of St Paul's. Currently around 150 people are in the camp, which has been there for 60 days. A source from within the group told The Independent there was 'widespread consensus' that the time has come to end the main demonstration, although they are considering leaving behind a scaled-down presence. But the decision by protest leaders to move on before they are forced to go is seen as a chance for them to retain goodwill at the end of a saga that has split the Church of England. Protesters hope that by volunteering to leave they will retain some goodwill among the public . It is thought that a compromise would also allow the Church to save face after a protest which saw the cathedral close its doors for the first time since the Blitz and forced the resignation of Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser. Giles Fraser's resignation as canon chancellor was seen as legitimising the protest . His decision, after a vote for a legal challenge that would have had protesters forcibly removed, was seen as legitimising the occupation. The camp source said: 'There is widespread consensus that resources at the camp are stretched, and concerns about the long-term viability of the site. We are looking at restructuring and how best to use our other sites.' Mr Forsdick said: 'The City is not bringing these claims to protect the banks, nor is it bringing them to prevent peaceable protest against the financial sector. Nor is it bringing these claims to stifle freedom of speech. 'It is bringing these claims solely to remove the semi-permanent protest camp because, after very careful consideration, it has concluded it is necessary to do so. 'It is a pressing social need in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others.' Proceedings were launched after protesters, who began the camp on October 16, ignored a November 17 deadline to clear the 'public highway' and tore down eviction notices from their tents - some of which are pitched on the footpath next to shops surrounding the cathedral, with the rest in the churchyard. The corporation, the local authority which runs the Square Mile, has expressed concern over 'worrying trends' at the camp, including late-night drinking, and the fact that companies near the cathedral have complained about losing business. Camp occupants are expected to vote on the decision to move on within the next few days, but in the meantime it is party mood. One protester, retired chiropodist Richard Trevan, 55, told The Times: 'We are going to have a party, and throw it open to the homeless, to everyone. 'The next phase is actually to make this camp more mellow...but at Christmas it'll be inspirational; one big family celebrating.' In papers submitted to Mr Justice Lindblom, Michael Paget, for the defendants, said their views were genuinely held on an issue of ‘extreme public importance’. The hearing continues. The protesters have now occupied the area in front of St Paul's for two months and many do not want to be moved on .","Occupy London leaders will vote on ending demonstration .

Wang Lulu, the grieving widow of British businessman Neil Heywood, has begged for help to flee China . The grieving widow of British businessman Neil Heywood begged for help to flee China yesterday. Chinese-born Wang Lulu made a dramatic visit to the British Embassy in Beijing. She is understood to have asked for a visa to escape to the UK with her two young children. Friends said they were ‘very worried’ about her safety, days after Chinese authorities named the wife of prominent politician Bo Xilai as a suspect in Mr Heywood’s murder. His widow is afraid that the people who killed her husband might now come after her and her family. The scandal has become the biggest political storm in decades in China and has prompted allegations of corruption in the emerging superpower’s highest echelons. Visitors to the Heywood family home in an exclusive gated compound in Beijing were turned away by troops from the People’s Liberation Army. The presence of the crack troops triggered fears that Mrs Heywood would be barred from fleeing the country, and sources said police had ordered her not to communicate with international journalists. The Chinese government routinely clamps down on relatives and friends of dissidents who threaten its rule, and commentators fear it will show typical ruthlessness to Mrs Heywood as it prepares for a once-in-a-decade leadership transition this autumn. Mr Bo, 62, was tipped for a place at the very top of the ruling Communist Party’s national leadership until his family was engulfed in the scandal surrounding 41-year-old Mr Heywood’s death. Jeremy Browne visited Chongqing on November 17 last year, three days after the discovery of Mr Heywood's body in a hotel room in the city . Gu Kailai is in custody and her husband, politician Bo Xilai, is under house arrest. Mr Bo has accused his political enemies of 'pouring filth' on his family . The Old Harrovian was found in a hotel room in the city of Chongqing, western China, in November. His death was initially blamed on excess alcohol and his body was cremated without a post-mortem examination. But friends said he rarely drank and the case was reopened when a former police chief told U.S. officials he believed the British expatriate was poisoned. This week, Chinese authorities named Mr Bo’s wife Gu Kailai as a suspect in the investigation and the Communist Party suspended her husband. Mrs Gu is now in police custody and her husband under virtual house arrest, facing an investigation for serious disciplinary violations. A servant at the family home was also named as a suspect in the ‘intentional homicide’. Visitors to the Heywood family home in an exclusive gated compound in Beijing were turned away by troops from the People's Liberation Army . Mr Heywood knew the powerful couple for more than a decade and helped their son Bo Guagua, whom he had taught English, win a place at Harrow before studying at Oxford. Mrs Gu was said to be godmother to the Heywoods’ 11-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son, who both attend the Beijing branch of Dulwich College, an international school for expats and privileged Chinese children. But friends said Mr Heywood feared for his safety following an angry confrontation with Mrs Gu, 54, in which she allegedly ordered him to divorce his wife and swear a Mafia-style oath of allegiance to her family. He reportedly gave a file detailing the Bo family’s finances to a British lawyer and described the papers as his ‘insurance policy’ should anything happen to him. The business consultant was also said . to have approached British authorities in 2010 about applying for . citizenship for his wife. A spokesman for the British Embassy . in Beijing refused to confirm or deny Mrs Heywood’s visit yesterday, but . confirmed the family had been offered consular ‘protection’. Party boy: Gu Kailai's son, Bo Guagua, embraces two young friends in a series of snaps posted on the internet. He has been in hiding since the scandal that engulfed his family . He told the Daily Mail: ‘Mrs Heywood . is a Chinese national. If she wants to leave she can apply for a visa. Her children have British passports.’ Mrs Heywood has refused to discuss the case, saying only that she is ‘so sad’ about her husband’s death. A source said she had been warned to say nothing, saying: ‘Police officers questioned her recently and warned her not to speak to foreign media.’ Friends said they were worried for her safety as she struggled to cope with her grief and raising her children alone. One said: ‘If a friend of yours  had died of some natural causes or had been bumped off on the other side of the world, and he was married and had two children, would you be concerned? ‘All his friends are concerned. We are all worried about all of them.’ Schoolfriends of Mr Heywood angrily rejected suggestions yesterday of any connection between the Harrow ‘old boy network’ and the murky circumstances surrounding the Briton’s murder. According to one report, an ‘Old Harrovian Group of Four’, said to be doing business in China, fell out with Mrs Gu in 2005 over an alleged joint business venture. Bo Guagua was sent to the famous Harrow School where he was mentored by Neil Heywood . Mr Heywood helped her son Bo Guagua get a place at Harrow, which charges fees of £7,345 a term, despite her husband’s political salary being little more than £300 a month. After Harrow, Bo Guagua studied at Balliol College Oxford and is now at Harvard, where he has been in hiding since the scandal engulfed his family. Edmund Robb gave the eulogy at Mr Heywood’s funeral in Battersea, south London, before Christmas. Mr Robb, who has lived and worked in China and describes Mr  Heywood as ‘my oldest and best friend’, described claims about a ‘Group of Four’ as ‘bizarre’  and added: ‘We will be taking the appropriate action. We have referred the matter to the Press Complaints Commission.’ Additional reporting: Peter Simpson in Beijing.","Chinese-born Wang Lulu afraid those who killed her husband will come after her and her two young children .

Elwood Osman shot dead his beloved wife of 64 years, Mildred Osman, on the fourth floor of Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pennsylvania shortly after 1 p.m. on Tuesday. Staff heard gunshots and when they entered the room, they found Mrs Osman dead in her bed and the body of her husband, in what authorities are calling a murder-suicide. Relatives have described how the couple . were inseparable, and how Mr Osman had struggled to cope after his wife suffered a stroke earlier this month. She moved to the hospice last week. Tragic: Elwood Osman, left, shot dead his wife, Mildred Osman, right, in her hospice bed before turning the gun on himself. Mrs Osman had suffered a stroke and her husband was unable to see his life without her . 'Madly in love': Relatives said that the couple was inseparable and acted like teenagers in love . Mrs Osman was left paralysed on her left side and could not walk, feed herself or go to the bathroom alone, her family members told WFMZ. Her husband was left 'absolutely devastated, completely beside himself,' according to the couple's granddaughter, Sarah Kehm. '[He] had no idea what to do.' She said that, even in their 80s, they looked like a young couple in love. 'They were madly, madly in love with each other,' she told WFMZ. Their daughter, Linda Mullin, added: 'They were always together. Never went anywhere without each other.' Happy days: The Osmans, who were married 64 years, are pictured on their wedding day in the 1940s . Family: The couple lived in Allentown, Pennsylvania, surrounded by their family, including their children . Hospital authorities agreed Mr Osman shot dead his wife as he could not cope without her. 'It's a love story,' James Geiger, senior vice president of the hospital, said. 'The elderly gentleman could . not bear to see his wife suffering, and the family, I believe, have . observed that he just could not envision living without her.' The Lehigh County coroner's office said autopsies on both are . scheduled for Wednesday, but authorities said each had a single gun shot wound. Geiger added that he was not aware of any note left behind. In love: Relatives said Mr Osman was 'beside himself' when his wife suffered a debilitating stroke on March 1 . Nothing without her: Mr Osman shot himself because he could not imagine life without her, authorities said . Clues: Neighbours near their home, pictured, said Mr Osman had been upset to put his wife in the hospice . No other patients or staff members were harmed or threatened, and the hospital wasn't evacuated, officials said. No one witnessed the shooting, and the man gave hospital staff no . indication that he was about to harm his wife, who had entered the . hospice more than a week ago, said police Capt. Glen Dorney. 'The first thing that drew their attention was the sound of the . gunshot,' he said. 'They heard a second gunshot and came to . investigate.' Like most hospitals, Lehigh Valley Hospital doesn't use metal . detectors to screen visitors, though wands are used when hospital . security has reason to believe a patient has a weapon, Geiger said.

When Aly Femia asked doctors when she should get married so her sick mother could be there for the big day, they answered: 'Tomorrow.' So she did. Aly’s mom, Mary Quinn, had gone to check up on a pain she felt in her neck less than two weeks ago. Little did anyone expect the diagnosis to come back as lung cancer, which had spread to her brain. After initially hoping there were treatment options, Mary and her family were told her condition was incurable, according to BuzzFeed. She now only has a short time left to live. Aly Femia was married at Vale New Haven Hospital on Wednesday January 29 after her mother was suddenly diagnosed with incurable cancer . Mom Mary Quinn was able to see every part of the ceremony from her hospital bed . Aly and Anthony Femia managed to pull together their wedding in 24 hours, much to the credit of staff at Yale New Haven Hospital . The ceremony was officiated by the hospital chaplain . Mother-of-the-bride: Aly's mom, Mary Quinn, went to the doctors for a neck pain last week and was told she had lung cancer that had spread to her brain . Aly met her boyfriend, Anthony, at Greenwich High School in Connecticut. In December 2012, Anthony proposed to her during a weekend getaway. They celebrated their engagement with friends and family and were originally supposed to get married in September 2015. Despite the short notice, Aly wasn't prepared to walk down the aisle without her mother present. So in 24 hours they planned a wedding. The nuptials were held at a room in Yale New Haven Hospital, with Mary able to watch from her bed.

A 33-year-old single mom claims to have been drugged and sexually abused by a 72-year-old Long Island millionaire who took her and her son in after they lost everything in Hurricane Sandy. According to a lawsuit filed in Queens Supreme Court, horse trainer Francesa Riccardi charges that Frank Villano - a prominent New York businessman who owned Mickey Mantle's and Solera restaurants in Midtown - would lace oatmeal with Ambien and Xanax before abusing Riccardi as she slept. Villano, a divorced father-of-four, was a friend of Riccardi's mother, the New York Post reported. The suit claims the abuse was witnessed by Riccardi's 10-year-old son, who would be in the same bed as his mom inside Villano's $3 million Glen Head mansion when the alleged acts were taking place. Single mom Francesca Riccardi claims to have been abused by Frank Villano while staying at his Long Island mansion as a guest between November 2012 and January 2013. She said she was alerted to the alleged acts by her 10-year-old son, who was sleeping in the same bed as her and witnessed what was going on . Frank Villano is the owner of restaurants Mickey Mantle's and Solera in Midtown, New York. He is accused of sexually abusing Francesca Ricardi, 33, while she stayed at his home in Glen Head, Long Island . Francesca Riccardi, a horse trainer, is seeking unspecified damages from Frank Villano, claiming he drugged her and  sexually abused her at his house . 'Villano would enter their room, disrobe Riccardi in her sleep, and put his hands on her body,' the suit claims. 'Villano would even kiss her face and moan while he was molesting her.' Riccardi - who lost all her belongings when the Staten Island apartment she was living in was flooded by Hurricane Sandy - said she was alerted to the abuse by her son. On January 2, 2013, she didn’t take the pills. Villano came into her room at 2am and sexually assaulted her, she claims, adding that she screamed and pushed him off. Riccardi then moved out and filed complaints with Nassau County cops. However, Villano was not arrested or charged. Villano’s lawyer, Aida Leisenring, called Riccardi a 'gold digger' and said the complaint was 'ridiculous' and 'a complete lie'. 'It’s transparent that she wants money,' Leisenring said. In court papers, Villano says they had 'consensual sexual contact'. Horse trainer Francesca Riccardi claims Frank Villano was 'obsessed' with her and hired a private detective to follow her every move. Villano says the claims are lies and that she is only after money . Wealthy 72-year-old businessman Frank Villano served Francesca Riccardi (pictured) Ambien and Xanax with oatmeal nightly in his Long Island mansion, then undressed and touched her in her sleep, a lawsuit claims . However Riccardi says Villano - who has founded several businesses, including a software company that served Fortune 100 clients - was 'obsessed' with her. He threatened to make her life 'a living hell' if she ever moved out and allegedly told her: 'You belong to me and nobody else.' The suit claims Villano installed a GPS tracking device on a car he loaned Riccardi, sent her 930 texts, called her incessantly and stole her AOL password in an attempt to cut her ties with an ex-boyfriend. Villano posed as Riccardi and told the ex via online exchanges that she planned to marry Villano, the suit says. The sleeping and anti-anxiety pills Villano is accused of administering to Riccardo were prescribed to him, the suit says. Riccardi and her son moved first in with Villano in November 2012. Francesca Riccardi is seeking unspecified damages for the alleged abuse she suffered at the hands of Frank Villano, a New York businessman and restaurateur . Riccardi, who now lives in Queens with her son, seeks unspecified compensation and punitive damages. In 2007 Villano received a Distinguished Alumni Award by Long Island University. In 2005, he donated $1 million to a Greenwich Village child-protection center. 'He acted like a father figure,' said Riccardi’s lawyer, Joseph Tacopina.

Embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was greeted with audible jeers and a few loud cheers during Saturday’s Super Bowl hand-off ceremony, which came on the heels of explosive revelations about the so-called Bridgegate scandal. The incident cast a pall over Christie at what could have been a moment of triumph for the man considered a leading candidate for the Republican Party’s nomination to run for president in 2016. The Super Bowl will be played Sunday in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The governor's introduction was met with a chorus of boos interspersed with chants of support from the thousands of people gathered in the area for a Super Bowl street fair in New York City. Scroll down for video . Frosty reception: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was greeted with audible boos during Saturday's  Super Bowl hand-off ceremony . Bad timing: The event at Times Square came just a day after shocking revelations about the bridge closure scandal . Mr Christie did not mention the politically motived bridge closure during brief remarks in which he thanked the NFL and his New York counterpart and Super Bowl co-host, Governor Andrew Cuomo. A portion of a huge crowd that gathered in the middle of Broadway erupted in jeers when Christie took the stage during the event marking the ceremonial hand-off of the Super Bowl to next year's host state, Arizona. The governor spoke for just over 30 seconds on a large state set up for a group of dignitaries, including Arizona Governor Jen Brewer, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and other officials. ‘I was proud to be in New Orleans last year to accept the hand off on behalf of the region and we look forward to hosting everybody in this group that's got a ticket tomorrow to watch the greatest sports spectacle in the world,’ Christie said. ‘Congratulations to the NFL and congratulations to the host committee.’ Not a happy camper: Christie appeared sullen as he sat on a stage in the middle of Broadway with other dignities . Passing the baton: NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, center, stands between Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, left, and Gov. Christie, right, who show off souvenir helmets after a ceremony to pass official hosting duties of next year's Super Bowl to Arizona, . Buck up: The beleaguered government briefly cheered up before leaving the stage without taking any questions from the press . The negative public sentiment was unusual for Christie, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association who coasted to re-election as governor in November with 60 per cent of the vote. In the weeks since starting his second term, Christie has been dogged by scandal since it emerged last month that some of his aides and appointees orchestrated traffic jams around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey. State and federal investigations have been launched into the lane closures in September, which came after the town's Democratic mayor declined to endorse the governor's re-election bid. Christie has adamantly denied any knowledge of the lane closures and cut ties with two of his top advisers for their apparent role in the scheme. David Wildstein, Christie’s boyhood friend and one of his appointees at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which managed the bridge, resigned from his post after it emerged he oversaw the closures. On Friday, an attorney for Wildstein said ‘evidence exists’ Christie knew of the closures when they were happening. The letter did not indicate Christie involved himself in the closures in any way, did not specify exactly when he became aware of the jams and offered no evidence to back up the claim. Famed sense of humor: NFL Commissioner Goodell (left) is pictured sputtering with laughter in reaction to something the famously irreverent governor might have told him . 'Evidence exists... tying . Mr Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period . when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the governor stated . publicly in a two-hour press conference,' stated the letter to the Port Authority of New York and New . Jersey. The missive also claimed that the governor . lied to the public during his marathon January 9 press conference. During that nationally-televised appearance, Christie said he accepted . responsibility for the scandal but denied ordering the closures or . knowing that they had been orchestrated by his appointees and members of . his staff. The document also included allegations that the bridge was closed to gain leverage for development deals. 'There . have been reports that certain Commissioners of the Port Authority have . been connected... to land deals involving the Port Authority, that Port . Authority funds were allocated to projects connected to persons who . supported the administration of Governor Chris Christie,' the letter . reads. Additionally: 'That Port Authority funds were held back from those who refused to support the Governor.' The . three-page letter was written by Mr Wildstein's attorney as an attempt . to get the Port Authority to pay for his legal bills as several . agencies, including the FBI, investigate the scandal. 'I knew . nothing about this,' Christie told the nation. 'And until it started to . be reported in the papers about the closure, but even then I was told . this was a traffic study.' Keeping it short: Christie spoke for only 33 seconds, thanking the NFL and briefly recounting how he accepted the hand-off from Louisiana last year . As Christie attended Super Bowl events Saturday, his office fired back against Wildstein with a vigorous defense of the governor. The email to the governor's friends and supporters accused Wildstein of seeking immunity amid an ongoing probe by state lawmakers and a U.S. attorney into the shutdown. ‘Bottom line - David Wildstein will do and say anything to save David Wildstein,’ the email stated. The email entitled ‘5 Things You Should Know About the Bombshell That's Not A Bombshell,’ was posted on the political news website Politico.com and confirmed by Colin Reed, a spokesman for the governor. The email also took aim at Wildstein's credibility after he claimed that he could ‘prove the inaccuracy’ of some of Christie's denials. The letter describes the order to close the lanes as coming from ‘the Christie administration,’ but does not say that Christie himself orchestrated the closures in any way. Christie's team denied that Christie knew about the traffic jam or its political motive until after it was over and bashed Wildstein on a variety of fronts, characterizing him as a litigious teenager, a controversial mayor of Livingston, where Christie and Wildstein attended high school together, and for his past career as an anonymous political blogger. Much of the letter quoted newspaper articles that took critical looks at Wildstein, who resigned in December from a $150,000-per-year job that he got with Christie's blessing. Blame game: David Wildstein, who personally oversaw the George Washington Bridge lane closures, says he has evidence that Chris Christie lied . Telling the truth? Christie staked his reputation on a January 9 press conference in which he repeatedly denied knowing about the closures or having any involvement . The Christie email notes that a 2012 article in The Record of Bergen County says Wildstein ‘was a very contentious person.’ Christie said he was blindsided by his advisers' involvement and promised to cooperate with various state and federal investigations. Local newspapers on Saturday said the governor's political career could be doomed if it was proven he knew in advance of the four days of lane closures that caused massive delays for commuters, ambulances and school buses. The New York Daily News said in an editorial that Christie now ‘stands on the brink of ruin’ if he cannot defend himself against the latest claims. ‘In that event, Christie's governorship is over and he should prepare to face a federal criminal probe as a private citizen. Resignation would be a must. Otherwise, impeachment would be a snap,’ it said. Charles Stile, a columnist for the Bergen Record, a major New Jersey newspaper, wrote today that if Wildstein produces evidence that ‘turns out to be the damning, incontrovertible kind, then Christie's career will be in tatters, if not over.’ King of All Media: Governor Chris Christie attended a birthday party for shock-jock Howard Stern on Friday . Shortly after Wildstein's attorney's . letter emerged, the Christie administration said it contained nothing to . contradict Christie's position that the governor had ‘no prior . knowledge’ of the closures. A . bipartisan committee of state lawmakers is investigating the episode, . as is the office of Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. Wildstein . is among 20 people and organizations close to Christie who must comply . with a new round of subpoenas by Monday.  His lawyer said he would . testify if granted immunity from prosecution. Amid the firestorm that erupted Friday, Christie attended a birthday party for shock-jock Howard Stern, hobnobbing with celebrities like Jon Bon Jovi and Jimmy Fallon. Christie arrived at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan about 6:30 p.m. - after his motorcade zipped past reporters. Just before 7pm, the governor took the stage at the party to wish 'The King of All Media' a happy birthday - and to introduce New Jersey native Bon Jovi, joking that he is not the 'representative from New Jersey.' 'The representative of New Jersey you want to see right now ... is one of New Jersey's favorite sons, one of my good friends, and a great artist' Christie said. 'Ladies and gentlemen, Jon Bon Jovi.' Joker: Comedian Joan Rivers joked with the governor, asking 'how was the traffic' on his way to the party . All but two lanes of the Fort Lee approach to the George Washington Bridge were closed for four days in September - paralyzing the borough and frustrating tens of thousands of commuters . Bon Jovi performed his 1987 hit 'Wanted Dead or Alive, and Christie left the event shortly after 7pm. Comedian Joan Rivers also was at Stern's shindig and had some fun on her Twitter page at the expense of the embattled governor. 'A surprise guest at Howard Stern's birthday was Governor Christie. I asked him how the traffic was coming in,' Rivers joked. Christie, who has a reputation for engendering loyalty and insisting on discipline among his subordinates, explained at a December news conference that he learned of his aides' involvement when an original batch of subpoenaed emails was published. Backup: The gridlock caused by the lane closures led to major traffic problems in Fort Lee - including delays for ambulances and police officers .","Christie delivered brief remarks during ceremonial handing off of Super Bowl to Arizona .

For example, according to the map, if you live in New England, chances are you're a New England Patriots fan. If you live in Texas or the lower Midwest, you're likely a Dallas Cowboys fan. However, there are a few interesting allegiances that don't seem to make any sort of geographical sense. Alaska, for example, appears to be a bit confused - which makes sense considering the closest NFL team is located in Seattle, which is nearly 1,500 miles away. According to the map, Alaskans are primarily loyal to the Green Bay Packers, but there are several counties within the state that like other teams, like the San Fransisco 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers. J-E-T-S Jets, Jets, Jets: The New York Jets are the only team to have but one county in the entire country backing them . Florida is a bit of an anomaly, as well. According to the map, Floridians tend to like teams from all over the country - Despite having three NFL teams of their own, there are pockets of the state that are home to Giants, Patriots, Steelers, Packers, and Bears fans. Florida's random allegiances likely are due to the fact that the state is home to a large community of transplants, many of whom are retirees from cities all across the country - who bring their football loyalty with them. If you're a New York Jets fan who doesn't live on Long Island, there's a good chance your Sundays feel awfully lonely - according to the map, the Jets are the only team to have the supports of just one county: Nassau, which is the western half of Long island.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 02:09 EST, 2 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:34 EST, 2 February 2014 . Talk about dirty politics. On Saturday Night Live, Melissa McCarthy played a crazed congresswoman, parodying the recent threats made by Rep. Michael Grimm (R-NY) against a reporter after being pressed on fundraising allegations. Framed as a local news report, SNL cast member Taran Killam played a Delaware 1 news anchor named David LaPierre. His report included updates on the shocking behavior of freshman Delaware congresswoman Sheila Kelly, played by McCarthy -- whose behavior outdoes Grimm's. Confronted by a reporter on illegal campaign finances. Kelly says 'We will talk about the planning committee and nothing else.' When pressed, she adds 'We're done here.' Fictional freshman congresswoman Sheila Kelly, played by Melissa McCarthy, shows she is not to be messed with on Saturday Night Live . At one point her character gets so angry all that is intelligible is 'angry gibberish' Kelly's anger escalates, imitating Grimm's threats to throw a reporter off of a balcony -- at one point yelling 'You ever been thrown out a window, bro? Because you know what? Because when I do it, I don't open it first. So you go down with the glass. You get that?' Her character berates the reporter, saying 'You're not a man [...] you're a little baby and I'm going to put you in a stroller.' She refers to the famed baby stroller scene in 'The Untouchables' -- and that there is no Andy Garcia character to save him. The congresswoman is caught in other camera angles, becoming increasingly hostile. 'You f****** filming me?' she asks. She engages in a physical altercation, yelling 'I am freshman congressman Sheila Kelly and I am invincible!' The skit soon shows the congresswoman kicking a car from a parking garage camera, getting completely out of control. 'I'm going to blow your f****** eardrums!' she yells to a man in the garage. In a drastic move, McCarthy's Kelly then shoots the security camera straight on. Killam's character then shows the latest footage capturing the politician's erratic behavior. When confronted by two policeman in the skit, she kicks them and manages to steal a car and yell 'I'm going to live forever!' 'You ever been thrown out a window, bro? Because you know what? Because when I do it, I don't open it first. So you go down with the glass. You get that?' she yells in the skit . The skit poked fun at the behavior of Rep. Michael Grimm, who threatened to throw NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto off the Capitol balcony when asked about campaign finances earlier this week. MailOnline earlier reported that Grimm said to Scotto 'you ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this f***ing balcony' before threatening to break Scotto in half 'like a boy'. Media website Gawker has even publicly wondered if Grimm's attacks were made because Scotto is gay. The website poses the question: If Scotto didn't ask Grimm anything about his or anyone else's sexuality, then why did the congressman fire back a stream of insults aimed at questioning the reporter's masculinity. In real life, earlier this week Rep. Michael Grimm (right) threatened to throw NY1 political reporter Michael Scotto (left) off the Capitol balcony after being questioned on fundraising allegations . Grimm has not been charged in light of his recent comments against Scotto. Earlier this month, the FBI charged Grimm’s donor Diana Durand with exceeding the maximum allowable contribution to the Republican’s campaign by asking her friends to donate $10,000. Grimm, 47, has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged. This is not the Congressman's first threat of violence -- The New Yorker reported in 2011 that he got into a fight with a man at a Queens nightclub more than a decade earlier. He allegedly said the man 'don’t know who he’s f***ing with...I’ll f***in’ make him disappear where nobody will find him'. A video skit on SNL also poked fun at the fact that February is Black History Month. Keenan Thompson, Jay Pharoah, and Sasheer Zamata are seen as students in a classroom doing a class presentation. The trio list '28 reasons to hug a black guy' to their white classmates and teacher -- listing reason number one as 'We deserve a chance' ... and reasons two through 28 as simply 'Slavery.' Pharoah raps, repeating the word 'slavery' over and over, while Zamata sings the hook for the catchy tune. Thompson, Pharoah and Zamata (from left) list reasons 2 - 28 for 'hugging a black guy' to be slavery . In the video skit, the trio is seen also performing in the school hallways . Thompson's character raps that black people love white people too. 'We love Michael MacDonald and Daryl Hall,' Thompson says in the video. Bobby Moynihan, playing a clueless classmate, says 'Let me plays devil's advocate' -- before being quickly silenced by his teacher. Towards the end of the video, Thompson, Pharoah and Zamata lead a chant saying 'When I say ""slavery"" you say ""sorry!"" Slavery! Sorry!'","McCarthy played 'freshman congresswoman' Sheila Kelley .

The star witness in the case against former Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez is now viewed by prosecutors as 'completely unreliable.' According to documents filed Friday, Carlos Ortiz, 27, who is charged with accessory to murder after the fact in the shooting death of Odin Lloyd, will no longer be called as a witness in Hernandez's murder trial at all. Ortiz was one of two men allegedly in the car with Hernandez before Odin Lloyd was shot to death. Unreliable: The prosecution won't be calling Carlos Ortiz after he changed his story . He was arrested last summer in . connection to the murder and told police that Hernandez and another man, . Ernest Wallace, 44, were outside their vehicle at the North . Attleborough Industrial Park when Lloyd was shot five times. Ortiz . said he was asleep in the vehicle when he was awoken by the sound of . gunshots, after which Hernandez and Wallace returned to the car. He . also told police that he saw Hernandez carrying a handgun and mentioned . a 'flophouse' in Franklin which 'other football players used,' where . police recovered evidence including clothing and ammunition, according . to the Taunton Gazette. However, Ortiz has now changed his story to say that Hernandez was alone with Lloyd outside the vehicle. Prosecutors also requested copies of Aaron Hernandez's phone calls from Bristol County Jail and records of visitors on Friday, alleging that he has used ‘coded messages’ to discuss the Odin Lloyd murder from prison, authorities claim. Accessory: Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to being an accessory after the fact in the murder of Odin Lloyd . On trial: Prosecutors allege Aaron Hernandez has been speaking in code about the murder of Odin Lloyd to his cousin and his fiancee . A . Thursday court filing from the Bristol County (MA) District Attorney . accuses the former New England Patriots tight end of talking about the . murder with fiancée Shayanna Jenkins and cousin Tanya Cummings . Singleton. The recorded . conversations mostly took place during visits the two women made to the . county jail since Mr Hernandez was incarcerated in June, the papers . first reported by the Boston Globe said. The DA made the filing to request copies of the conversations from the county sheriff as further evidence in their case against Mr Hernandez. ‘We did file a motion, and what’s in the documents is pretty self-explanatory,’ DA spokesperson Gregg Miliote told MailOnline. He declined to provide further details while citing a gag order issued by the court. ‘During those conversations, the defendant has discussed the following matters directly relevant to the circumstances surrounding the murder of Odin Lloyd,’ said the affidavit. The former all-pro is accused of discussing what he believes is his criminal liability, related prior offenses, denials of ownership of a vehicle impounded by police, his control of persons outside the jail and the whereabouts of others implicated in the slaying, said the filing. Ms Singleton and Ms Jenkins have been charged as co-conspirators. Accused co-conspirators: Cousin Tanya Cummings Singleton (left) and fiancee Shayanna Jenkins (right) face charges for their involvement in the murder case, and are accused of receiving the coded messages . ‘Both of these co-defendants have been charged as accessories in the underlying offense of murder on the theory that they provided assistance to the defendant after the commission of that offense,’ the affidavit said. These conversations took place despite all three of the accused being advised the conversations were being recorded, authorities said. Most happened during visits, but some were outbound calls placed from prison. The recordings can be used against all three during court proceedings. Only calls between Mr Hernandez and his attorneys are off-limits during trial. Messages left by MailOnline seeking comment from Mr Hernandez’s legal team were not immediately returned. An attempt to reach the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office was not successful. The . motion was filed the same day Ms Singleton posted bail after spending . months behind bars for aiding accomplice Ernest Wallace’s flight from . Massachusetts. Back in court soon: The next pretrial hearing in the case is scheduled for Wednesday . Also filed Friday was a motion by Mr Hernandez’s legal team seeking clarification as to whether authorities believe he fired the shots that killed Mr Lloyd or if he acted in concert with co-defendants Mr Wallace and Carlos Ortiz. ‘If Hernandez is alleged to be a joint venturer as to the murder count, the bill of particulars should identify the alleged principal or principals,’ the filing said, according to the Fall River Herald News. Mr Hernandez is due again in court on Wednesday for another pretrial hearing.","Carlos Ortiz will not be called by the prosecution in Aaron Hernandez's murder trial .

A new poll conducted by NBC News/ The Wall Street Journal found that 40 per cent of Americans prefer that their children don't play football. According to the survey, there is a large gap based on household income of whether or not people worry about their children playing football or not. About half the poll-takers in the highest income bracket (more than $75,000 per year) said they'd opt for their children to play a different sport. 40 per cent of Americans polled said that they didn't want their kids to play football . Of those in the lowest income bracket (less than $30,000 per year) only 28 per cent said that they wouldn't want their child playing. The poll comes out just in time for Super Bowl weekend and also was tallied at the same time an ongoing lawsuit regarding football players and sports related injuries is gaining lots of attention. Last Year the NFL reached a $756 million settlement in a lawsuit with thousands of former players who sought coverage because they were suffering from concussion related injuries. Two weeks ago, a federal judge denied the settlement because the amount may not be enough to cover the seemingly infinite medical costs for the 20,000 retired players. The poll also asked about the NFL's efforts to prevent concussion related sports injuries. 20 per cent said they don't think the NFL is doing enough to prevent injury. Quarterback Brett Favre has spoken out about his own sports related injuries and has said that he would be 'wary' of his child playing football . 2,000 retired players are seeking money from the NFL to pay for their medical bills-and a federal court said $765 million isn't enough . 41 per cent said they felt the NFL has taken appropriate action to avoid the concussions. The Mail Online covered a story in November about Brett Favre and how he has spoken out about the danger of Concussions from football and how coaches did little to nothing to protect players later in life. Favre has been tackled 525 times, more than any other quarterback, and is starting to feel the negative effects on his brain. In an interview with a Washington D.C. radio station in October, the ex Green Bay Packer said that he was unable to remember an entire summer of his daughter playing youth soccer. Favre also told Matt Lauer that if he were to have a son he may not want him playing the game. The interview with Lauer will air on Monday. 'I would be real leery of him playing football. In some respects , I'm almost glad I don't have a son because of the pressures he would face,' Farve told Lauer. President Obama recently told New York Magazine, 'I would not let my son play pro football.'

After losing his wife and unborn baby daughter, and then spending . weeks locked in a legal battle to have the brain-dead woman taken off . life support, Erick Munoz may now be forced to pay thousands of dollars in . medical bills. Marlise Munoz was declared legally dead after her paramedic husband found her unconscious at their Texas family home November 26, possibly due to a blood clot. But because she was 14 weeks pregnant, doctors refused to take her off life support under a pro-life state law. After winning a lengthy court battle, Mrs Munoz's life support was switched off Sunday and both she and the 23-week-old fetus, which was said to have abnormalities because of oxygen deprivation, died at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth. Speaking with CNN's Anderson Cooper Wednesday, Mr Munoz revealed that he has been receiving hospital bills at his home, although he is not sure at this time what he will be expected to pay for his wife's forced medical care. Scroll down for video . Paying the price: Erick Munoz (left) said in an . interview with Anderson Cooper that he has been receiving hospital bills . at his home for his dead wife's medical care . Erick Munoz said that he had promised his wife to respect her wishes and take her off life support; her mother, Lynne Machado, recalled that towards the end, she could see her daughter's body decaying . 'They have not come to me and said how that’s going to work,' Mr Munoz said on Anderson Cooper 360. 'But I believe I’ve heard several media outlets…saying that they’ve . asked about that. They have asked that question. They [the hospital] said they would . continue normal billing.' According to the site ThinkProgress, John Peter Smith Hospital has declined to disclose how much, if anything, the Munoz family would have to pay, saying that patients' billing information is covered by privacy laws. A recent report from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project stated that the average cost per hospital stay was $9,700 in 2010. However, that number varies greatly depending on the type of insurance coverage, or lack thereof. During the interview, Erick Munoz was joined by his mother-in-law, Lynne Machado, who said that she knew her daughter's battle was over the moment hospital staff brought her to the ER after she coded. Marlise Munoz's mother added that she and the rest of the family had known for years that the woman never wanted to be artificially kept alive. ‘I promised her, I told her, I will honor your wishes,’ Erick Munoz recalled telling his legally dead spouse. Mr Munoz added that even his wife's doctors did not know at first about the existence of the arcane state law that prohibits hospitals from turning off a patient's life support if she is pregnant. Lynne Machado described in agonizing detail in the interview how towards the end, her daughter's body had begun to visibly deteriorate, making it difficult to look at an empty shell of what had been her beloved daughter. 'When I go by her head, I smell death,' she recounted. Both Munoz and Machado said they are now speaking out publicly about their ordeal because they want to encourage families to have a conversation about end-of-life decisions. Mr Munoz had previously revealed that he named what would have been the couple's second child  Nicole after his wife's middle name. Bitter victory: Erick Munoz, pictured after winning his court battle in Texas Friday, has revealed he named the unborn fetus after his wife's middle name, Nicole . Mother: Marlise Munoz was already a mother of one. She was a few months pregnant when she suffered a blood clot and went brain dead . He said doctors at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth indicated to him that the fetus would likely have been a girl, although his attorneys previously claimed the fetus suffered from a lower body deformation that made it impossible to determine its sex. 'They think it was a female,' Mr Munoz said in a brief telephone interview with The Associated Press. Mr Munoz also told WFAA-TV in an interview which aired on Monday evening that he has seen many negative comments about his decision, but he feels he made the right choice. 'I'm just glad they are not in my shoes. I hope every day that no one ever has to go through what I went through,' he said. Mr Munoz said his wife will be cremated and there are no plans for memorial or funeral services because the family is concerned that protesters would show up. 'She made me a better man, and I thank her for it. I thank her very much,' he said. Both the hospital and his attorneys agreed the fetus could not have been born alive that early in the pregnancy, and the fetus was not delivered when John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth complied on Sunday with a judge's order to pull any life-sustaining treatment from Marlise Munoz. What she would have wanted: Husband Erik Munoz says his wife wouldn't have wanted to keep living in her condition . Tense weeks: Erick Munoz stands with a photograph of himself, left, with wife Marlise and their son Mateo, in Haltom City, Texas. Marlise was removed from life support on Sunday after the family's high profile fight to let the pregnant woman die . Doctors said Mrs Munoz, then 16-weeks pregnant, was brain-dead in November after Erick Munoz found her unconscious in their Haltom City home, possibly due to a blood clot. But the hospital had kept on machines to keep her organs functioning for the sake of the fetus, which it said was per Texas law. The case inspired debates about abortion and end-of-life decisions, as well as whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus. Mr Munoz's attorneys, Heather King and Jessica Hall Janicek, had issued a statement last week saying that according to medical records, 'the fetus is distinctly abnormal'. The attorneys said the fetus also had fluid building up inside the skull and possibly had a heart problem. Mr Munoz told AP earlier that he believed in God but felt his training as a paramedic suggested the fetus would have been seriously harmed by his wife's condition. Unborn: The couple is pictured here with their first son Matteo . Filing suit: Erick Munoz filed suit against John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas to force the hospital to remove the life support keeping his pregnant brain dead wife alive . He sued the hospital because it would not remove life support. He said his wife, also a paramedic, had told him she would not want to be kept alive under such circumstances. In refusing his request, the hospital cited Texas law that says life-sustaining treatment cannot be withdrawn from a pregnant patient, regardless of her end-of-life wishes. Legal experts told AP that the hospital was misreading the Texas Advance Directives Act and that the law isn't an absolute command to keep a pregnant woman on life support. Judge R.H Wallace Jr sided with Erick Munoz on Friday, saying in his order: 'Mrs Munoz is dead.' The case has been noted by Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry and the two leading candidates running to replace him, but none has called for any new laws or action yet. In recent years, the Legislature has enacted several new anti-abortion restrictions, including setting the legal guideline for when a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks. During a debate among the four big-name Republicans running for lieutenant governor on Monday night, all of them said the judge erred in ordering that Marlise Munoz be removed from life support and vowed if elected to tighten state law so that a similar outcome couldn't happen again.

From the risque to the downright dark, there's only one way to get better advertising than forking out for ad space during the Super Bowl - having your ad banned from playing during the Super Bowl. As advertisers and Super Bowl fans know, the biggest spectacle at the game doesn't happen on-field - it happens during the commercial break. Advertisers pull out all the stops to create buzz about their brands during the biggest television event of the year. Figured it out: Scarlett Johnnsen actually says during her banned SodaStream commercial, 'How can I get this to go viral?' Banned Bud: This banned ad for Bud Light features officer workers getting naked for free beer . Bro love: This commercial featuring two friends kissing, for ManCrunch, a gay hook-up site, did not make the cut . In the effort to be the topic of . conversation around the water cooler on Monday, though, some go a little . too far and are deemed inappropriate to air by the network or the NFL. This . is sometimes even more beneficial to the company than going to air . would have been, creating a clamor the see the ad that's too rude for . TV. This year, Israeli . company SodaStream's ad featuring Scarlett Johannsen was rejected . because it calls out SodaStream’s direct competitors by name. At the end . of the 33-second spot, Johansson says: 'Sorry, Coke and Pepsi.' Fox . requested that SodaStream omit the last line, presumably because Pepsi . is a sponsor of the Super Bowl’s halftime show. SodaStream complied and . the edited ad will air on Sunday night. The uncensored version has been viewed YouTube more than eight million times in five days. The . NFL's decision to ban rifle maker Daniel Defense from airing a . commercial during Superbowl XLVIII has led to protests from America's . gun lobby. Unsatisfied: The network did not air this Snickers ad featuring two men inadvertently kissing . Controversial: This ad for a company called 'Jesus hates Obama' had its ad banned after Fox said it was 'not acceptable to run' In the clip, a former marine speaks about protecting his family in their quaint, suburban home. He pulls into the driveway and then stops on the front walk, briefly scanning the neighborhood for snipers and suicide bombers. 'No one has the right to tell me how to defend them,' he says of his wife and baby. The company's logo then flashes on the screen - a silhouette of 'the most effective tool for the job', an AR15 assault rifle. The . ad was banned last month for flouting the NFL's gun rule which state: . 'Firearms, ammunition or other weapons are prohibited; however, stores . that sell firearms and ammunitions (e.g., outdoor stores and camping . stores) will be permitted, provided they sell other products and the ads . do not mention firearms, ammunition or other weapons.' Following . the NFL's ruling, Daniel Defense offered to replace the company's logo . with an American flag and/or the words 'Shall not be infringed'. The company was willing to replace the . gun with an American flag or the words 'Shall Not Be Infringed'. But . the NFL wouldn't budge. In . an interview on Fox and Friends, Daniel Defense CEO Marty Daniel said: . 'We actually went to the rule box and pulled out their set of rules and . got a big no.' Petitions in . support of the ad have followed - such as one titled 'Allow Daniel .

Less than 20 years ago, a half-minute of Super Bowl ad time . cost less than $1 million. That money now buys the largest TV . audience in the U.S. Two years ago, a record of more than 111 million . Americans watched the Green Bay Packers beat Pittsburgh Steelers, and . many paid close attention to the dozens of commercials aired during game . breaks. Stephen Master, head of sports for Nielsen, which tracks viewership, said: 'There's nothing to compare it to. Maybe the Oscars or some of the music (awards) shows, but not really.' One . poster, Shawn Butt, said: 'Alcohol and automobiles are both responsible . for more deaths than firearms. But the NFL doesn't seem to have a . problem with either of those.' A . YouTube video in response to the ban complaining that the NFL has . become 'politicized' now boasts more than two million views - far more . than the original commercial.

Two Chinese monkeys, named Ningning and Mingming, have become the first genetically-modified primates to be born using a powerful ‘cut and paste’ DNA technique. Scientists claim the technology could usher in a new era in genetic medicine and help combat diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Dubbed CRISPR-Cas9, the technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code and could create more realistic research models of human disease. Two Chinese monkeys, named Ningning and Mingming, have become the first genetically-modified primates to be born using a powerful 'cut and paste' DNA technique . In this case, it was used to manipulate two genes in fertilised monkey eggs before they were transferred to surrogate mothers. Writing in the journal, Cell, the team from Nanjing Medical University reported the successful delivery of twin female long-tailed macaques using the technique. Five surrogate mothers miscarried and four more pregnancies are ongoing. Scientists have previously used the new genome-editing technology to delete, insert, and modify DNA in human cells grown in petri dishes. The ladder-rung patterns in an image of a DNA gel show that genome editing successfully modified a gene in two macaque infants (shown in the central columns), but not in an untreated animal (right column) CRISPR-Cas9 technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code . Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the CRISPR-Cas9 system targets the genome’s source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. The DNA cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally, for instance after chronic sun exposure. But unlike UV rays that can result in genetic alterations, the CRISPR-Cas9 system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome. When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome. But the new study shows for the first time that CRISPR-Cas9 can create healthy primates with their DNA modified at specific targeted genes. Jiahao Sha, who led the Chinese team, said that CRISPR-Cas9 could be used to create monkeys that carry genetic faults that lead to diseases in humans for animal testing. The technology can also be used to grow human organs in the lab, and used to test drugs, or to monitor how serious diseases can affect the body. Precise changes in DNA are also being investigated as a way to make people resistant to HIV. Scientists believe CRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of currently available gene-silencing techniques. ‘We can now use this technology on a genome-wide scale, giving us the ability to interrogate any gene we want,’ said Feng Zhang, a member of the Broad Institute and assistant professor at MIT. CRISPR-Cas9 technology precisely changes target parts of genetic code. Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the CRISPR-Cas9 system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level . Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the CRISPR-Cas9 system targets the genome’s source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. The DNA cut – known as a double strand break – closely mimics the kinds of mutations that occur naturally, for instance after chronic sun exposure. But unlike UV rays that can result in genetic alterations, the CRISPR-Cas9 system causes a mutation at a precise location in the genome. When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA, making a gene non-functional. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome. The CRISPR-Cas9 procedure has been welcomed by geneticists in labs around the world because of its huge potential. But this recent breakthrough has created opposition by some groups opposed to animal testing. 'Our study shows that the CRISPR/Cas9 system enables simultaneous disruption of two target genes in one step without producing off-target mutations, said study author Jiahao Sha of Nanjing Medical University. 'Considering that many human diseases are caused by genetic abnormalities, targeted genetic modification in monkeys is invaluable for the generation of human disease models.'","CRISPR-Cas9 technique can be used to create monkeys with genetic faults .

Laura Bush has spoken out against the superficial scrutiny given to the First Ladies and hopes the eventual First Gentlemen is given the same treatment. She said that while she thinks too much attention is paid to a first lady's hair and make up, 'I don't think we can get around it'. 'Maybe when we finally have a first gentleman. And maybe we should be that way about the first gentleman also, and really critique the way they look all the timeâ€”their choice of tie or their hairstyle or whatever. Or maybe their weight,' she said. Looking back: Former First Lady Laura Bush said that the first spouse should 'Stand back and be quiet' 'It'll be interesting when it finally happens what the First Gentlemen will do. I hope they take on men's health perhaps,' she said, making an underhanded slight at the pattern of initiatives that are seen as 'appropriate' for First Ladies to handle falls mostly in the realm of women's and children's health. Mrs Bush was interviewed by C-SPAN as part of their ongoing series of interviews with former First Ladies. In the clips released ahead of the full program, which will air on March 2, Mrs Bush dismissed the theory that those married to the President should receive a salary. 'I don't think so. There are plenty of perks, believe me!' she said. 'A chef, that was really great! I miss the chef. Highlight: Mrs Bush said that one of her favorite moments during her husband's terms was when she unexpectantly took over the speech at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2005 . 'I think the interesting question really is not should they receive a salary but should they be able to work for a salary at their job that they might have already had and I think that's what we'll have to come to terms with. 'Certainly a first gentlemen might continue to work at whatever he did- if he was a lawyer or whatever he did. So I think that's really the question she should ask is should she have a career in those years that her husband is president in addition to serving as First Lady.' She talks at length about questions of protocol that will arise when a woman is elected president and her husband is given the title of First Gentlemen- but doesn't once mention the most likely candidate: former President Bill Clinton. She did have one key piece of advice for any first spouse, however. Breaking the mold: In her interview, Mrs Bush never explicitly names Bill Clinton as the potential 'First Gentleman' but he seems like the most likely candidate (with the Clintons and Mrs Bush seen here at a 2004 event at the White House) 'Stand back and be quiet,' she said with a smile. Mrs Bush is just the latest to be featured in the ongoing series, and her mother-in-law's turn came out earlier this month. In it, the elder Mrs Bush said that while she 'loves' Bill Clinton but not his politics. If she had her way, neither her son Jeb Bush nor Hillary Clinton would run for the White House in 2016- even though they are among the most likely candidates for their respective parties. 'I think this is a great American country, a great country, and if we can't find more than two or three families to run for high office that's silly because there are great governors and great eligible people to run,' she said in a new interview. 'I think the Kennedys, Clintons, Bushes- there are just more families than that.' Twice is enough: Barbara Bush said that should her younger son Jeb decide to run for president in 2016, that would be pushing the amount of time that one family had been in the White House .","Former First Lady also said that the President's spouse should not receive a salary for their work while in the White House .

The Caribbean Princess left the Pasadena . port on January 25 and headed to the Caribbean with more than 4,200 people . aboard. It was supposed to return Saturday. But it returned to the port late on Thursday night and started letting passengers off on Friday. The cruise company said it would pay for hotels for people with flights booked for the Saturday. Princess Cruises, owned by Carnival Corps., said the norovirus had spread quickly and that the Centers for Disease Control officials will board the ship on Friday to ensure thorough sanitation. Norovirus is a contagious illness that can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Victim: Passenger Murray Sharkey felt cruise staff weren't honest about why they were returning . CDC spokesman Llelwyn Grant told the Houston Chronicle that once the outbreak was identified, ship employees increased cleaning and disinfection procedures. Princess Cruises spokeswoman Julie . Benson said the ship 'will be undergoing a . thorough sanitization' before its next cruise, which is . scheduled for around 4 pm on Saturday. The company had said in a statement on Thursday that the trip was cut short because of fog - but it did acknowledge that dozens of people had been treated for a virus. 'Caribbean Princess has experienced an increase in the number of cases of gastroenteritis among passengers, which has been confirmed to be norovirus,' the statement said. 'Because of the increased sensitivity surrounding norovirus by both cruise lines and the (CDC) in this winter season, we notified the CDC... to ensure all appropriate measures are followed for an extensive sanitation of the ship prior to the next cruise departing February 1.' But passengers said they feel like the staff where using the fog as an excuse.

Justin Bieber's private plane has been held at a New Jersey airport and police have searched it because it allegedly smelled like marijuana. The latest updates reported that the 20-year-old and all other passengers on the plane have been released from police custody after a search found no drugs on the plane. It had been previously reported that the pop star and his father were headed to New Jersey today for the Super Bowl from Canada after hiring a private jet. The plane has now been spotted at Teterboro airport, which is commonly used for private flights, but 20-year-old Justin nor his father have been allowed off the aircraft. Scroll down for video . False alarm: A police search found nothing suspicious and Bieber and his entourage were free to go . In trouble again? Justin Bieber, seen here on Wednesday, may have once again come under suspicion for using drugs . The New York Post reported that police detected 'a strong odor of pot' and sent drug sniffing-dogs on board. According to a TMZ report, the singer was flagged by US. Customs officials upon landing in New Jersey because he has two criminal cases pending in Florida and in his native Canada. Though it has not been confirmed that Bieber was on the plane that was being searched, the travel timeline aligns with the singer's schedule. News of the latest incident tops off a week full of legal trouble for the Canadian star.On Wednesday, he turned himself into Toronto authorities after being charged with assault. TMZ reported that the fight with the limo driver began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up. The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself. The driver swatted his hand away and then it errupted into a full-on smack fest as Bieber then hit the driver in the head multiple times. He already faces a charge of driving under the influence after getting caught drag racing in Miami. Bieber has pleaded not guilty to DUI, resisting arrest without violence and driving without a valid license in the Miami case. A preliminary toxicology report released Thursday showed that he tested positive for marijuana and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. Bieber told police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had taken a prescription drug, saying that his mother gave him the medication. Being held: The private plane that allegedly brought Bieber, his father, and their entourage to New Jersey's Teterboro airport was searched by authorities after landing . Role model: Bieber's father, Jeremy, is said to be going to watch the Super Bowl with his music star son this weekend . Bad week: Bieber was arrested for DUI in Miami last Thursday (pictured) and turned himself in on assault charges in Canada on Wednesday, but also has outstanding vandalism charges against him in California . His father was with him while they were in Florida and was at his side in Canada on Wednesday. Late Thursday, Bieber posted a photo of his father, Jeremy, with a praise-filled caption. 'I have the greatest Dad in the world. He's taught me how to love, learn, and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my superehero,' he wrote on his Instagram photo. In California, the singer remains under investigation for an egg-tossing incident that left his neighbor's house with thousands of dollars in damage. If Bieber is charged in that case, a California judge may look at him more harshly in light of the Florida and Toronto cases, said Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles. Bieber has not addressed the vandalism claim in California, and his attorney Howard Weitzman has said the singer's legal team believes their client is innocent in the Toronto case.

As statements go, last week’s assertion by the mayor of Sochi that there are no gays in the resort hosting the Winter Olympics deserves a gold medal in gibberish. Ridicule was immediately heaped on Anatoly Pakhomov, a burly Vladimir Putin supporter, after his views were broadcast on the BBC’s Panorama programme, prompting yet more concern over Russia’s fitness to host the Winter Games – the  ‘Putin Olympics’ – which open in five days’ time. Now, one local gay man has written a scathing open letter to the 53-year-old mayor, making it clear that he is definitely not the only gay in the Olympic Village. 'There are many gays in Sochi': Andrei Tanichev, . co-owner of the Mayak gay club in Sochi, with two drag queen cabaret . stars. He says that Mayor Anatoly Pakhomov is aware of his club, . despite denying knowing any gays . ‘The absurdity of your statement is similar to the old canard that there was no sex in the USSR,’ said 24-year-old tour guide Andrey Ozerny. ‘You are mistaken or simply pretending when you say you do not know one single gay person. 'Believe me, there are enough of them in your own administration, and you probably often share meeting rooms or offices with them.’ How could the mayor, born and bred in Sochi, not notice? Take Zerkala, one of several night clubs aimed at gays in the city. Offering a male striptease show among other entertainments, it is situated in the shadow of the mayor’s office, making his apparent ignorance even less explicable. ‘I’ve been here a few times,’ said Elena, 31, a lesbian, who has lived with her partner in Sochi for two years. ‘It’s fun. This city is cool, definitely more relaxed than many places in Russia.’ Then there is the Oblaka Hotel, which promises ‘fun, hedonism, old friends and new faces’. It is nine miles from Putin’s palatial Sochi residence, from where he has overseen the £31 billion Olympic constructions, the costliest ever. ‘This gay hotel is run on a high European level. I’ve travelled all around Europe, and while I don’t like the tone of the Russian debate on homosexuality and the persecution people can face, this place is somewhere you can relax,’ said Dima, 27, an entrepreneur from Moscow who stayed here last summer. The best of the best: A poster for the Mayak gay club pokes fun at the forthcoming winter Games . Another more famous gay club – Mayak – . offers nightly drag shows for up to 400 customers in a dimly  lit, . one-storey building close to the seafront. There . is no sign outside because it has been ripped down so often by . homophobic youths. The dancers include a Muslim former butcher, an . Armenian who also owns a strip club, and a Ukrainian who loves to sing . like Whitney Houston and dress like Adele. Misrepresented? A spokesman for Anatoly Pakhomov's office said the mayor's comments were taken out of context by the media . In . a gold sequin dress, drag queen Andrei Kavaltshian, 44, is well known . in Sochi. He powders his cleavage before risking a joke about Putin: . ‘Our president has sensual lips and such a toned body.’ The mayor’s strange lack of knowledge is tackled by Andrei Tanichev, co-owner of the Mayak. ‘There are many gays in Sochi, more than in most Russian cities,’ he said. ‘Our mayor knows this. He is fully aware of our club, and was in touch with us long before this TV programme.’ Mr Tanichev, openly in a relationship with another man, said he had attended meetings with the mayor over improving the gloomy lighting outside his club. ‘He invited us to his office. The major knows we are a gay club and there was no problem about it. We have discussed matters of safety and tolerance with him. About a month before this BBC story, there was a meeting in Sochi when the mayor invited representatives of all ethnic communities for a discussion on tolerance towards gay people who attend the Winter Olympics.’ So how did the mayor come to make his claim? Mr Tanichev’s explanation is that the BBC mangled the meaning of the politician’s words. He has been told Mr Pakhomov was under the impression he had been asked whether there were gay activists or gay organisations in Sochi. A source in the mayor’s office said: ‘The phrase was taken out of context, because the next thing he said was that naturally there are gay people in  Sochi. 'He was saying that we don’t parade it – for example, we don’t have gay parades.’","Sochi is host to several well-known gay clubs and a gay-friendly hotel .

New claims: According to GPS records obtained by TMZ.com, Justin Bieber couldn't have been drag racing at the time of his arrest on 23rd January . Justin Bieber was not drag racing at the time of his arrest, new reports have alleged. According to TMZ.com, who claim to have obtained the print-out of the GPS records from the Lamborghini Bieber had rented and was driving at the time of his arrest in Miami last week, the records would have shown a higher driving speed if the 19-year-old had been drag racing his friend Khalil, as police initially claimed. Miami Beach police primarily accused Bieber and Khalil of racing at speeds of between 50 and 60 miles an hour. However, judging by the TMZ print-out, the maximum speed reached by Bieber in the car was 44mph, which was when he left Club Set in Miami Beach at 4.07am, before the speed dropped to a maximum speed of 27mph just two minutes later. The website claim that the significance behind the figures is that the 27mph reading came on the 3700 block of Pine Tree Drive - where the speed limit is 30mph - and that if Bieber had been drag racing at that point, the reading would have been significantly higher.

The vehicle isn't registered to have begun moving again until 4.06am, and didn't stop until Bieber was pulled over - dismissing claims that it was used to facilitate the race. TMZ claim that if the GPS records are correct, the figures will cause issues for prosecutors in the case, as it will mean that Bieber's car was pulled over for a reason that doesn't actually exist.

'You can lose perspective, but you can also lose them in the long run if you're not a role model. Hopefully, what he does on stage and the way he dances and the way he sings, he will apply that to his real life. 'There's a discipline in what he's doing.

"PUBLISHED: . 19:08 EST, 4 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:25 EST, 5 December 2013 . Charles Saatchi subjected Nigella Lawson to ‘a long summer of bullying and abuse’, she claimed yesterday. Miss Lawson admitted her ten-year marriage to the businessman may have been doomed from the start. She felt she had to ask permission to do what she wanted, and was ‘punished’ if she displeased him. Frequently referring to him as Mr Saatchi, she said he had set out to ‘destroy’ her after their divorce in July.  Her experiences with the multi-millionaire art collector were ‘wounding and very difficult’ leaving her with ‘emotional scars’, the jury was told. Departure: Nigella Lawson leaves court today after admitting taking cocaine and smoking cannabis during her marriage to Charles Saatchi . Testimony: Nigella Lawson told the jury that 'no one can be in any doubt' her ex-husband Charles Saatchi has a temper . Miss Lawson talked at length about her ex-husband’s irritability saying: ‘Yes, he did have a temper and I don’t think that anyone can be in any doubt he had a temper.’ She added that Elisabetta Grillo, who is on trial along with her sister, may have heard him shouting and swearing – and that Miss Grillo found him so unpleasant she moved out of free accommodation in the family home to be away from him. At one point Miss Lawson said she confided in Elisabetta, saying: ‘I can’t take this any more.’ Mr Saatchi, she added, did not enjoy family gatherings, and was also bemused as to why the Grillo girls both wanted to be off at the end of December until Miss Lawson ‘explained to him that it was Christmas’. The couple split in June this year after the infamous picture outside Scott’s which resulted in Mr Saatchi accepting a police caution for assault. But the ordeal for Miss Lawson did not end there, the court heard. The TV cook said yesterday that Mr Saatchi – who on Friday told the court he still adored his former wife – begged her to return to the marital home and to clear him of being a wife beater. She was asked why in October she had threatened to withdraw from giving evidence in the trial – when claims of the Grillo sisters describing her as a drug addict were published on a public relations executive’s internet blog. 'Choking': Nigella Lawson separated from Charles Saatchi after this picture was published which appeared to show him choking her outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, central London . Miss Lawson replied: ‘My relations with Mr Saatchi were not good. ‘He said to me that if I didn’t go back to him and clear his name he would destroy me – and also started spreading false allegations of drug use, and in particular that awful incident at Scott’s. ‘I feel his way of getting this out was to use this case.’ She added: ‘Drug allegations came out in September which indirectly Mr Saatchi had menaced me with in August, and I just said, “What drug allegations? There aren’t going to be any”. ‘These allegations appeared in a PR blog that had been dedicated to salvaging Mr Saatchi’s reputation and savaging mine. ‘They had been circulated on the internet and sent to every media outlet. Testimony: The TV chef, 53, spoke about the breakdown of her ten-year marriage to the millionaire art dealer . ‘I thought this would not become a fraud case – I would be put on trial and actually that is what has happened. ‘I’m going to have to answer allegations in front of the world’s press – and it comes after a long summer of  bullying and abuse – and I  find it just like another chapter in that.’ She also discussed a venomous email Mr Saatchi sent her in October accusing her of being a drug addict, and revealed what seemed to be long-standing problems. Denying a suggestion in the email that she had been seeking a ‘pass’ to enjoy all the drugs that she wanted, Miss Lawson said: ‘I had once  made reference to a “pass” because I had been punished for going to my girlfriend’s birthday party. ‘I hasten to say I don’t mean that I was beaten, rather an emotional abuse. It was very wounding and very difficult, and of course we know how things accelerated.’ She then seemed to make the remarkable suggestion that Mr Saatchi may have been secretly colluding with the Grillo girls. Miss Lawson said: ‘He had, I felt, been in contact with the defendants when he talked to me about drugs in August. ‘I’m not saying he did directly but it seemed he knew about these witness statements before they were published on the internet.’ The celebrity chef then told how her ex-husband in October threatened to sue her for some half a million pounds when she threatened not to give evidence against the Grillos.

Michael Gove was unrepentant yesterday about his decision to axe the Labour-supporting head of the schools watchdog. The move not to renew Baroness Morgan’s contract as head of Ofsted has prompted a fierce Coalition row over appointments to top jobs. The Education Secretary insisted the decision to sack the former close aide to Tony Blair was not based on politics but because he wanted a ‘new perspective’. Unrepentant: Education Secretary Michael Gove (left) insisted the decision to sack Baroness Morgan (right), a former close aide to Tony Blair, was not based on politics but because he wanted a ‘new perspective’ However, he refused to rule out the appointment of a former Conservative donor and private equity boss as her replacement. Privately, Tories said that criticism over making political appointments to public bodies was misplaced. Some pointed to the record of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown on handing out posts to sympathetic figures. Many New Labour appointees still hold influential positions in quangos, the NHS and other public bodies. Meanwhile, David Cameron has given jobs to a string of Labour figures, including making former minister Alan Milburn, a social mobility tsar. One senior Tory said: ‘The truth is, our record on this is pretty hopeless. We’ve been criticised by own side for giving positions to people affiliated with other parties. So this attack on us over Sally Morgan is pretty absurd.’ The baroness, whose contract expires . this year, has protested: ‘I really do think that it’s just I am the . latest of a fairly long list of people now who are non-Conservative . supporters who are not being re-appointed.’ Link: The baroness, whose contract expires this year, was a former close aide to Tony Blair (pictured) The . decision not to retain her as chairman for another three years has been . heavily criticised by Mr Gove’s Liberal Democrat deputy David Laws. Labour outrage over the sacking of Lady  Morgan contrasts with their string of appointments to public bodies. They include: . Party sources said he was ‘absolutely furious’ at what he saw as ‘blatant attempts to politicise Ofsted’. There . has been speculation Mr Gove wants to install Theodore Agnew at Ofsted. He is chairman of the Department for Education’s academies board and . has given £144,000 to the Tories. But one Lib Dem insider said they would ‘absolutely not’ countenance his appointment. A Conservative source in Downing Street accused Mr Laws of stoking up the row in an attempt to distance his party from Mr Gove’s agenda. In John Major’s last year in office, . 57 per cent of those appointed to a public post who  had a known . political allegiance were Conservatives, with 32 per cent associated . with Labour. A year after . Mr Blair came to power in 1997, the percentage of Labour appointees was . up to 75 per cent and the Tory share down to 13 per cent . .Under Mr Cameron, 77 per cent of those . with political backgrounds taken on to public bodies were allied to . Labour, with the Tory figure at 14 per cent. Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said: ‘Labour grandees regard quango appointments as theirs by right: hence their genuine bewilderment and petulance when they lose one.’ On the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme, Mr Gove was asked if Mr Agnew was in the running to replace Baroness Morgan, . He said an independent panel would take charge of the decision, but added the new Ofsted chief will be chosen ‘on merit’. He added: ‘There is nothing wrong with Sally. She is Labour, but let me be clear – this  Government is perfectly happy to appoint people whatever their political backgrounds.’ Official sources said there was ‘no great falling out’ but cast doubt on Lady Morgan’s willingness to drive through changes. Deputy Lib Dem leader Sir Malcolm Bruce criticised Mr Gove for failing to consult his deputy Mr Laws. He told Radio 5 Live: ‘They are trying to politicise something that should be kept outside of politics.

Supermarket workers have been given electronic listening devices so conversations with customers can be recorded. The system has been adopted by Sainsbury’s at 600 of its ‘Local’ convenience stores as a safety measure to protect staff from violence and abuse. However, campaigners fear it is yet further evidence of a surveillance state that is invading the privacy of shoppers and could be abused. The system has been adopted by Sainsbury's at 600 of its 'Local' convenience stores as a safety measure to protect staff from violence and abuse . Shoppers are already familiar with the CCTV cameras that monitor their every move, plus the collection of information on buying habits through loyalty cards and the security tagging of everything from razor blades to premium steaks. Now supermarkets are going even further and using the fob type listening devices, which are attached to uniforms or sit on a lanyard around the neck. Sainsbury’s insists the monitoring system, which it calls a personal safety device, is entirely legal, above board and necessary to protect staff. It said the listening devices are triggered on average around 30 times a week by workers if they are abused, racially harassed, verbally or physically threatened. However, it refused to provide precise details of how the system works or name the outside company that runs the regime on its behalf, citing security reasons. It has placed small yellow signs in stores where the system operates, which carry the wording: ‘For the safety and security of our colleagues and customers, audio may be monitored and recorded’.The director of Big Brother Watch, Nick Pickles, said most people would be unaware that they could be spied on in this way, while buying their groceries. However, campaigners fear it is yet further evidence of a surveillance state that is invading the privacy of shoppers and could be abused . ‘People should not be subject to secret filming and audio recording unless there is an extremely serious situation,’ he said. ‘It frankly isn’t good enough to justify such an intrusive capability by posting a small sign up at the shop entrance. ‘People should be clear such technology can be used and if it is being used, it should be done in a way that customers have an opportunity to complain if they feel it is not justified. ‘Sainsbury’s must be transparent about how many times these systems have been used to record their customers and why. ‘They should also make available much more information about how the systems work and when staff can use them. Without such transparency it is impossible to have confidence that the systems are not being abused.’ While Sainsbury’s would not give details about its system, it confirmed the devices are similar to those used by community workers in the NHS and among some other retailers, such as petrol stations. The NHS system is run by a company called Reliance Protect. The devices include a panic button on the back, which, once triggered, connects via the mobile phone network to a central security station. Here, a security officer listens in and records the conversation to decide whether to alert the police. The device includes a GPS satellite tracker to pinpoint the location of the wearer. Tesco said that some staff in its Express convenience stores have personal alarms which, if triggered, alert security officers to watch the CCTV screens and decide whether to call the police . Asda said it did not have anything like the Sainsbury's system in place . Sainsbury’s said the point of recording what is said is to gather evidence that could be used in any subsequent prosecution of the shopper. It said it is only used in 600 convenience stores as staff numbers are low and a colleague may not be available to help in an emergency. It said that once members of the public start abusing or harassing staff it does not consider this to be a conversation or the individuals involved to be customers. A spokesman said: ‘Some colleagues in small stores wear a personal safety device, which is only activated when they or other customers are threatened or when a crime is taking place and they need to raise the alarm. ‘It operates for about ten seconds to help determine which emergency service to call. The same personal security system is used by the NHS and is recommended by the police. We take the safety of both our colleagues and customers extremely seriously.’ The use of recordings and CCTV fall under the Data Protection Act, which is policed by the Information Commissioner’s Office. A spokesman said: ‘Organisations must only record people’s conversations where it is a clearly justified response to a pressing need. ‘Use of audio recording should be exceptional and only triggered in response to a specific event, like when a member of staff is being abused or assaulted and it may stop further abuse or would be needed as evidence. ‘Individuals should be made aware audio recording may take place, staff should be trained in its responsible use and once the recording is made, it must be kept securely and be deleted once it is no longer required.’ Sainsbury’s main two rivals, Tesco and Asda, have their own CCTV and other security systems in place, but nothing that involves listening to and recording conversations. Tesco said that some staff in its Express convenience stores have personal alarms which, if triggered, alert security officers to watch the CCTV screens and decide whether to call the police. Asda said it did not have anything like the Sainsbury’s system in place.","System adopted by Sainsbury’s at 600 of its ‘Local’ convenience stores .

Bill de Blasio has picked the former New York police commissioner who cleaned up the city in the 1990s to lead the department once again. William Bratton, 66, rose to national fame under Mayor Rudy Giuliani for his 'zero tolerance' approach to policing and his 'broken windows' strategy of targeting small infractions as a way to combat more serious crimes and lower murder rates. He also pioneered CompStat, the data-driven system of tracking crimes that is now used by nearly every major police force in the nation. Critics have already chimed in, saying that Bratton is a bad choice if the mayor-elect wants to move away from tactics like stop-and-frisk and improve NYPD relations with the city's black and Hispanic communities. City Councilman Charles Barron called . Bratton's appointment 'unconscionable' and said he was the man who . invented stop-and-frisk and other strategies that disproportionately target . minorities. Scroll down for video . Controversial choice: Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio, right, picked former NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, left, to lead the police again. One councilman says Bratton is the man who invented stop-and-frisk . Bratton, right, rose to fame under  New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, left, in the 1990s for overseeing a massive drop in crime with his 'zero tolerance' policies . De Blasio made reducing stop-and-frisk one of the keys to his candidacy as mayor. His opponents claimed this meant he would be soft on crime and would return New York to the 'bad old days' of high murder rates. But Bratton has supported such tactics in the past - even calling stop-and-frisk 'essential to every police department in America.' As Los Angeles Police Chief he oversaw a 49percent increase in police stops. He was nearly the top cop in London, as well. Prime Minister David Cameron wanted him to lead the Metropolitan Police Service, but his nomination was blocked by the Home Office, which said the Met Commissioner must be both familiar with British laws and a British citizen. On Thursday de Blasio introduced Bratton as a 'proven crime-fighter' - signaling that he wanted a man with a history of tough tactics to lead the city's 34,500 officers. 'Together, we are going to preserve and . deepen the historic gains we've made in public safety - gains Bill . Bratton helped make possible,' de Blasio said in a statement. Bratton, who has also led the Boston and Los Angeles police departments, will succeed Raymond Kelly, the NYPD's longest-serving commissioner. He is arguably the most important administration appointment for de Blasio, a Democrat who takes office January 1. Bratton beat out a black and a Hispanic candidate for the job of New York's top cop - but de Blasio said his hiring will still pave the way for better relationship between the NYPD and minority groups in. He said the city can keep its crime rates low by 'rejecting the false choice between keeping New Yorkers safe and protecting their civil rights. This is an administration that will do both.' The bad old days: When Bratton took over, murders topped 1,500 a year and middle class families fled for the suburbs in droves . Bratton, holding a library book called 'Your Police,' which inspired him to go into law enforcement, pledged to forge a better relationship between the NYPD and minority communities . When William Bratton was hired as New York Police Commissioner in 1994, there were 1,561 murders in the city. When he left in 1996, there were 983. He oversaw a 60percent drop in homicides in just two years - and he says he did it by focusing on vandals, petty thieves and squeegee men who harassed motorists. Bratton adopted a 'zero tolerance' policy toward crime and employed the 'broken windows' theory that small-time lawlessness leads to big-time crime. Police fanned out across the city and cracked down on small crimes. Combined with civil efforts spear-headed by Mayor Rudy Giuliani, broken windows were fixed and graffiti was washed away. Crimes such as subway fare evasion, public drinking and public urination were no longer ignored. The tactic remains controversial - though some see it as the precursor to 'stop and frisk.' Proponents say stop and frisk works by getting guns off the streets and by putting criminals on notice that they are likely of being caught if they carry drugs or weapons - even if they appear to be doing nothing wrong. Subsequent studies, however, have disputed the efficacy of 'broken windows' policies. He said Bratton can 'heal some of the wounds, reopen the communication' and that Bratton would 'avoid focusing resources where they don't belong, which is on innocent, hardworking New Yorkers, particularly on our young men of color.' At the press conference announcing his appointment, Bratton held up a children's library book, 'Your Police,' which he said made him decide to became a police officer. He pledged responsive, responsible policing. 'This is not deja vu all over again,' Bratton said. 'If we get it right, if we make the city safe, if we do it in a way that the public trusts us, then the benefits are extraordinary. If we get it right here, this is in many respects a beacon that can light the world. 'I don't want to do it all over again the same way. I want what (de Blasio) is promising - a new day.' He said some stop-and-frisk tactics are necessary - but suggested they will be scaled back from the current level under his leadership. 'Stop and frisk is essential to every police department in America. But itâ€™s also essential that it be done constitutionally and respectfully. And that is my commitment to this mayor and to the city that it will be done that way,' he said. That promise isn't enough for New York City Councilman Charles Barron, who said that Bratton 'failed us' when he was commissioner in the 1990s. 'Bratton is the architect of racial profiling stop and frisk,' he told NBC New York. Center for Constitutional Rights, which is spearheading the legal action over stop-and-frisk, sounded a note of caution. 'We hope Bratton's appointment is not a signal from de Blasio that the NYPD will be ramping up so-called 'broken windows' policing, surveillance, and numbers-driven policing. As Mr. Bratton himself has stated, constitutional policing is not inconsistent with effective policing,' the group said in a statement. Bratton made the cover of Time magazine in 1996 for his success at lowering the crime rate in New York City . Bratton, a Boston native, got his start in the national spotlight as the Boston Police Commissioner. He pioneered the 'CompStat' strategy of policing through the analysis of crime statistics . Civil Rights leader the Reverend Al . Sharpton acknowledged he has been both an ally and adversary to Bratton . during his previous tenure, but hopes the leaders can work together 'to . continue the decrease of violence and crime in our community.' Bratton, known for his outsized personality and fondness for the limelight, was police commissioner under Giuliani, a Republican, from 1994 to 1996. He emphasized the broken-windows theory of police work: that criminals who commit small crimes, such as vandalism, also commit more serious crimes. Bratton helped spearhead the use of CompStat, a data-driven system of tracking crimes that allows police to better allocate their resources to high-crime areas. The real-time system is still used today. Crime immediately plummeted under Bratton, who benefited from an influx of new police officers. The year before Bratton took office, there were 1,946 murders citywide; by contrast, in 1996 there were 983, the first time it had dipped under 1,000 since 1968. But Bratton frequently fought with Giuliani over who deserved the lion's share of the credit. He resigned after two years. William Bratton is the only man to ever lead the police departments in both New York and Los Angeles. And he would have been the police commissioner in London, as well, if David Cameron had had his way. The 66-year-old Bratton is recognized as one of the foremost experts on policing in the world and pioneered tactics that are used in nearly every major city in the country today. He began his career as a beat cop in his native Boston after serving in the Vietnam War. He quickly rose through the ranks and served as Boston Police Commissioner for six months from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, Giuliani appointed Bratton NYPD Commissioner - continuing his 'broken windows' strategy that he pursued when he was New York Transit Police Chief from 1990 until 1992. Crime fell dramatically under Bratton's tenure - but he quickly clashed with the mayor over who deserved credit for making the city safer. Giuliani also disagreed with some of Bratton's policies. He resigned from the department in 1996 amid allegations of ethics violations - which Bratton allies said were minor and politically-motivated. In 2002, he was hired to lead the LAPD as the department sought to repair its reputation in the wake of the Los Angeles riots. He lowered crime and was widely credited with improving police relations with the community. He served in Los Angeles until 2009 - when he left to work as a private consultant. In 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron offered to make him commissioner of the Metropolitan Police in London, as the city recovered from riots and spike in crime. Home Secretary Theresa May objected, however, and said he could not lead the force because he was neither a British citizen nor familiar with British laws. Instead, he joined as a consultant. For his work, he was awarded the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.","Bratton first served as NYPD commissioner under Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s when crime dropped dramatically .

U.S. citizens should avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations, as even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. 'U.S. citizens traveling to, or remaining in, Libya should use caution and limit nonessential travel within the country, make their own contingency emergency plans, and maintain security awareness at all times.' 'He was supposed to leave this week but he said he would stay around for our midterms and sent his family. He was going to join them.' Mr Smith's students took to Twitter to post emotional tributes about their chemistry teacher with the tag #ThankYouSmith.

Gadahn . released an audio speech to militant websites last Saturday saying that . al-Libi had no role in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in . Africa because he had left al-Qaeda and formed a new group. U.S. special forces snatched al-Libi in October and detained him on a U.S. warship before bringing him to the U.S. to stand trial.

Sex worker Maria Duque-Tunjano, aged 48, was found dead in a £2million London apartment . Police investigating the murder of a prostitute in a multi-million-pound apartment block have released a picture of a man they would like to trace. Maria Duque-Tunjano was found dead in a five-storey white stucco property in London’s Earls Court Square. Detectives have today said they are looking to locate Robert Richard Fraser, who is also known as Robert Aleem and Shia Robert Jackson, in connection to the death. The area where the the sex worker was once home to the likes of Bond actress Rosamund Pike and Depeche Mode singer David Gahan. Police believe the prostitute was using the apartment in the Victorian square, where two bedroom flats fetch upwards of £2million, for her work when she was robbed and bludgeoned to death. The body of the British sex worker, who lived in Streatham but originally came from Columbia, lain undiscovered for three days in the vice den after she vanished on Tuesday night. Police weren’t called until Friday lunchtime when they found that a quantity of cash had also been taken from the victim’s bloodied body. Last night shocked residents living in the mansion block recalled seeing the victim always smiling. A member of the Earl’s Court Square Garden Committee said she had been made aware of the murder by a neighbour on Friday. ‘It’s very sad. This is usually a safe area.’ Several bunches of flowers and cards were left outside the property last night.’ One message read: ‘To Jenny, I’m so sorry about what happened. Love Koko’. Miss Duque-Tunjano appears to have also been known as Danielle, according to neighbours and messages left at the scene. Another card left alongside a bouquet was written in Spanish. Robert Richard Fraser, who is also known as Robert Aleem or Shia Robert Jackson, is wanted by police in connection to the death . Earls Court Square was historically home to Major Sir William Palliser, an Irish-born politician and inventor and MP for Taunton from 1880 to his death and also Howard Spensley, a British Liberal politician. The wider area has undergone a renaissance and is now home to the likes of singer Gary Barlow. Last night forensic police officers were still combing the area. Police said inquiries had established that the victim was a sex worker who used the flat for her work. A post-mortem at Westminster Mortuary yesterday gave the cause of death as ‘blunt trauma to the head’. It is believed she was robbed of a quantity of cash during the fatal assault. Next of kin have been informed. Earls Court Square, one area pictured, was historically home to Howard Spensley - a liberal politician. Homes in the area sell for around £2million . Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, of the Met’s Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ‘We have established that Maria was last seen alive on Tuesday January 28. ‘We also understand she was in the company of a man and our primary focus is to trace him as part of this investigation.’ Police are linking the murder to an earlier attack on another sex worker in Paddington on January 18 when a woman was robbed but she escaped without serious injury. No arrests have been made. The officer added: ‘We have spoken to organisations with links to those who work in the sex industry to make them aware of this incident and pass on the message that personal safety of sex workers is of paramount importance.’","Maria Duque-Tunjano found dead in five-storey Earls Court Square property .

Ross Kemp has been caught on camera in a terrifying face-off with armed guerillas as he filmed his latest show in Papua New Guinea. The 49-year-old former EastEnders hardman and his crew had hiked into jungle near the city of Hagan to interview 'The General', the leader of a gang of violent robbers who terrorise the slums. But the expedition nearly ended in disaster after three men wielding rifles and shotguns emerged from the bush and pointed the weapons at Mr Kemp. The actor is seen pushing away one of the rifles and yelling ‘Are you gonna kill me? No one’s gonna f*****g kill me!’. He was eventually allowed to leave unharmed. Scroll down for video . 'You're not going to f****** kill me!': Ross Kemp stares down guerrillas in the highlands of Papua New Guinea . 'I don't know if they were going to hurt us, or if they were just testing us': The Eastenders star refused to back down when armed gang members ordered him . Ross Kemp was in Papua New Guinea filming Extreme World 3 when a meeting with a guerrilla leader went sour . The extraordinary stand-off unfolded while Mr Kemp was in PNG, a notoriously violent country, filming his show Extreme World 3. They were taken to The General's remote hideout by a local guide called Lucas. He accompanied them most of the way before telling them to go on without him, an instruction which Mr Kemp says should have set ‘bells going off’. However, they continued with their journey and were met by a group of men with black-painted faces wearing combat gear, one of whom was the General. The meeting was initially calm, and Mr Kemp was offered beetlenut and a cigarette. Safe soil: Ross Kemp back in London earlier this month . It was at this point the three armed men appeared from between the trees and screamed at the actor to get on his hands and knees. In an interview for Sky 1 after the event he said, ‘You know if get down on your hands and knees you know you are going to become a victim at that point. What they're going to do you don't know.’ Cameraman Jonathan Young caught the entire incident on camera. The journalist's defiant approach seems to have worked, as the General called off the gunmen and then agreed to be interviewed by him. ‘I don’t know to this day if they were going to hurt us … or if they were just testing us, testing our mettle to see if we’d capitulate, and because we didn’t, we earned his respect I think,’ said the star. Mr Kemp described Papua New Guinea as ‘one of the most violent societies I’ve ever encountered’, and said that while he tries not to be judgmental when making his documentaries, ‘when you look at the stats in terms of how much violence is committed against women in particular… there are some things that I would suggest are unacceptable.’ Two thirds of women in PNG have experienced domestic violence and 50 per cent have been raped, an Amnesty International report found in 2011. A 2013 study conducted on behalf of the United Nations found that 41 per cent of men in Papua New Guinea admitted to raping a non-partner. Mr Kemp is best known for playing Grant Mitchell in EastEnders. After leaving the soap in 2006, he has forged a career as a investigative journalist, visiting some of the most troubled parts of the world including Afghanistan. He has won a number of awards for his work. The presenter was married to former News International executive Rebekah Brooks. They divorced in 2009 and his second wife is lawyer Renee O'Brien.

The son of a senior British diplomat was arrested under anti-terror laws after he innocently signed for a parcel while his neighbours were out, it was revealed today. James Sutcliffe, 19, whose father Nicholas is a first secretary to the Foreign Office, was later released without charge after Scotland Yard officers reportedly ‘messed up’ after a mysterious tip-off. His arrest over the weekend led to dozens of officers, some wearing biohazard suits and using breathing equipment, spending days 'tearing up' his parents' home and garden in South London. 'Torn apart': The home of senior British diplomat Nicholas Sutcliffe was raided by anti-terror police after his son James, 19, signed for a mysterious package . Mistake? The family of Mr Sutcliffe, a first secretary to the Foreign Office, claim police may have 'messed up' after a tip-off which led to the garden being dug up . The teenager was bailed but has now been told he faces no further action. Police feared the package, which has never been found, may have contained a poison called Abrin, which could have been ordered online and sent from America. Officers said after 'following intelligence' they realised it had been sent to James' neighbours, who it later emerged also knew nothing about it. They were never arrested. After days of police activity at the Sutcliffe's £650,000 home ended yesterday, a friend said they 'just want to be left alone to get on with their lives'. 'The family understand that the police have to do their job and check out information they have been given', the woman told the Evening Standard.

Sources close to the police investigation suggested that the 19-year-old had been evasive about what happened to the package. A friend of the teenager said yesterday: 'My understanding is it's all a bit of a mess–up'. The teenager lives with his father Nicholas, 56, and his mother Carole, 54.

"By . Charlotte Kemp . PUBLISHED: . 17:18 EST, 2 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 02:55 EST, 3 February 2014 . Paying the price: Charlotte with her charity shop 'bargains' From the contents of my shopping basket, you’d think I’d just hit the end of the January sales. A cosy Jigsaw jacket for £25, a red Gap top for £7.99, a Monsoon frock for £25 and a Radley handbag for £40. But, in fact, these are some of the price tags on the clothes rails of a few local charity shops near my home in Kent. What would be a bargain haul for discounted new clothes is arguably rather a high price for someone else’s cast-offs. Certainly, the days are gone when you could pick up second-hand clothing for a couple of quid. In the stores I visited, I found dresses for £50 and £60, tops for £14.99 and worn shoes for £20, not to mention handbags from shops such as Marks & Spencer and New Look that were almost as much to buy second hand as they would be new. In one Oxfam store, I dressed myself from top to toe in labels from a powder-blue Cath Kidston cardigan to a black evening dress with sparkly waistband by Ann Louise Roswald — but the total came to more than £100. Perhaps no wonder, then, that charity shops stand accused of abandoning their traditional clientele. Many shoppers believe they are turning into boutiques — with prices to match. So, why have charity shops suddenly become so much more expensive? There’s certainly more of them than ever before. According to the latest statistics, they outnumber shoe shops in Britain, having increased by 30 per cent over the past five years. As their number increases, many high streets, like the High Street in Orpington, pictured, now have numerous charity shops . This boom is changing the face of our towns. Orpington High Street in Kent, for example, has 12 charity shops in one short stretch — and that includes two branches of Cancer Research UK that are almost facing each other. While many independent shops and established chains are having a hard time of it, charity shops — staffed by volunteers and benefiting from free stock and business rate discounts — are able to expand. Take Barnado’s, whose profits from its 538 shops have increased from just £1.8 million five years ago to £10.9 million in 2012/13. No wonder it has plans to open 87 more shops in 2014/15. Oxfam reported sales of £90 million in 2011, an all-time record, and 5 per cent higher than the previous year. In one Oxfam store, Charlotte dressed herself from top to toe in labels from a powder-blue Cath Kidston cardigan to a black evening dress with sparkly waistband by Ann Louise Roswald ¿ but the total came to more than £100 . ‘The charity shop sector is going well and growing,’ says Wendy Mitchell, head of policy and public affairs at the Charity Retail Association. ‘It is partly to do with the economic climate and attracting new audiences — some one million more people.’ But as this investigation reveals, it may well be consumers who are paying the price for this success. No one would deny the importance of the money raised by the shops — £220 million a year. Nor would anyone want to knock the sterling work of the thousands of volunteers who staff the shops. But it does seem ironic that at a time when we are all feeling the pinch, many charity shops are more expensive than Primark. The hike in prices is certainly a hot topic of debate online, with consumers noticing a change as charity shops increasingly market themselves to a more well-heeled clientele. Gone are the days when clothes were a ragtag assortment of sizes and colours. Now, many shops are colour coded, High Street labels are prominently displayed and prices are marked accordingly higher. On one internet forum, a former volunteer reveals that she was put under pressure to put high price tags on good labels. ‘They have got very, very greedy,’ she confides. Take Cranbrook in Kent. Three clothes boutiques have closed down over the past 18 months, but the number of charity shops has increased to four. Clothes in the Oxfam branch are beautifully presented and there’s a smattering of high-end High Street labels and a few designer numbers. But they don’t come that cheap. My eye is drawn to a Top Shop skirt priced at £5.99, which isn’t bad. But the Next polka dot blouse beside it is £7.99. There are similar chiffon tops in the Next sale for £8 and even a full-price, new blouse starts at around £20. Then there’s an evening dress for £50 by a designer I’d never heard of and a glitzy sequin number for £60. The dress was elegant and in good condition — but £60 for a dress in  a provincial charity shop? That seems excessive when you bear in mind that it cost the charity shop nothing in the first place. The accessories are just as pricey. I found two rather worn Marks & Spencer Limited Collection handbags for £15. You can buy a brand-new one for  just £15 more. As I’m working my way through the rails, I hear a customer sigh: ‘Is it me or is everything in here £20?’ to which the sales assistant replies: ‘Not everything.’ Barnado's profits from its 538 shops have increased from just £1.8¿million five years ago to £10.9¿million in 2012/13. No wonder it has plans to open 87 more shops in 2014/15 . But there were few bargains to be had. The only ones I saw were on a small sale rail where a lurid and well-worn floral Dorothy Perkins top originally priced at £6.99 was £1. A few doors down, in a shop that raises money for a hospice, some of the prices were a little more reasonable, but I still found Monsoon dresses for £20, when new ones are only £40. In London, the prices are even steeper. In the Westbourne Grove branch of Oxfam, a Topshop black blazer is on sale for £32. A new equivalent would be £45. There’s also an H&M silk tunic shirt for £19. Other blouses are on sale in H&M for a full price of £19.99 — just 99p more. There are some designer finds that are true bargains — a purple three-quarter-length sleeve Stella McCartney dress for £45 and a Marc Jacobs black tunic at £45. But in every charity shop I go to the High Street labels are hugely marked up. One has a black bodycon dress from Oasis for a staggering £95. Karen Shoesmith, 46, a full-time mum from West London, told me: ‘I know it’s for charity, but the shops are pricing people out.’ In a Central London Oxfam, a white Primark cardigan is £12, the same price it was new.Retail expert Clare Rayner says: ‘The old way was to sell incredibly cheaply, more like a jumble sale, but there has been a huge trend shift as people have realised that the second-hand clothes market can be lucrative,’ she says. ‘Charities want to get the best price they  can for their donations.’ In other words, if the charities don’t mark up the prices, someone else will. After all, there are profits to be made on eBay and in vintage shops. An Oxfam spokesman said: ‘We believe the best way to thank our donors for their generosity is to get the best price we can for their donations. Each shop team uses their judgment to decide prices in their location. ‘Customers know their money will be well spent to help the world’s poorest people.’ But science teacher Tina Murray, 50, is not impressed after popping into the Oxfam store on Marylebone High Street where there is a Mango dress for £50, the same price as new. She says: ‘I’ll still donate to charity, but I’d rather go to Oxford Street than spend that much money here.’","Charity shops are accused of abandoning their traditional clientele .

A dog owner is refusing to have her pet put down – even after it savaged her three times. One of the bullmastiff’s attacks left Angela Fielder needing emergency surgery to save her hand. Another mauling caused wounds to her face, ear and arm that required more than 60 stitches. Despite her injuries, the 39-year-old insists she will not get rid of her 10st dog Boris and will not even make him wear a muzzle. Mauling: Boris the bullmastiff, left with his owner, mauled Angela Fielder three times but she insists she will not put him down - or even make him wear a muzzle. Right, a scar on Mrs Fielder's hand after one of the attacks . Scarred: Angela Fielder needed more than 40 stitches to her arm, pictured, after the 10st dog launched at her . A dog's life: Boris lives in Wallsend, North Tyneside, with Mrs Fielder and her gas fitter husband Rob, 39 . ‘The bites were my fault,’ said Mrs Fielder, who describes six-year-old Boris as her baby. ‘He lashed out because I was telling off our other dog, Wallis. She is his daughter and he was simply being protective. After the attacks he showed genuine signs of regret, cuddling up to me.’ Mrs Fielder added: ‘Many people might have had Boris put to sleep. You wouldn’t put a child down just because it lashed out in temper. So why do people think differently about a dog?’ She and her gas fitter husband Rob, 39, who have no children, bought Boris as a puppy. He was no trouble until last February when Wallis – Boris’s pup by a friend’s bullmastiff – came to live at their house in Wallsend, North Tyneside. As Mrs Fielder told Wallis off for chewing the vinyl floor in the kitchen, Boris lunged at her and sank his teeth into her forearm. She was treated at hospital but left to be with her dog. 'Doctors wanted to keep me in,' she said. 'But I went home because I knew Boris would be like a frightened child worrying where mummy had gone – and he was full of remorse. Man's best friend? Though he looks placid, Boris flipped out when he was told off for chewing the kitchen floor . Relaxed: Mrs Fielder raised Boris from when he was a puppy, and said she had no problems until recently . ‘Back home Boris was sorry. I could see from his eyes he was upset.’ But two weeks later Boris . attacked again. Mrs Fielder believes Boris thought she was about to tell . Wallis off again. Angela Fielder: 'The left side of my face was also slashed open' ‘I turned round to see him flying through the air at me. I raised my left arm to defend myself. It was only when I saw blood pouring from my arm I realised I’d been bitten and my left earlobe had almost been severed. 'The left side of my face was also slashed open.’ She had 24 stitches to her face and more than 40 to her arm.

We’ve now solved this by ensuring he’s always behind a gate if I have to tell Wallis off.’ She added: '‘As soon as I saw Boris I fell in love with him.‘Just a glance at me with those big soulful eyes he has always makes me melt.

A man whose life was saved by a stranger six years ago after he tried to jump off a bridge has been reunited with the person who saved his life following a global Twitter campaign. Two weeks ago, Jonny Benjamin, now 26, appeared on ITV’s Daybreak appealing for the man who encouraged him not to jump off Waterloo Bridge, in London, to come forward. He had launched the #FindMike appeal - desperate to say thanks to the kind stranger who talked him down from the bridge. Today, Mr Benjamin was back on the television programme, but this time to reveal that following the search which went worldwide he has been reunited with the Good Samaritan - Neil Laybourn.

Celebrities including Stephen Fry, Kate Nash and Boy George tweeted their support. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg backed the campaign. Speaking to Aled Jones and Lorraine Kelly, Mr Benjamin said he couldn’t believe he has been reunited with the man who persuaded him not to kill himself six years ago. He said: 'It was really overwhelming to be reunited with him again. It still feels like a dream. 'He was determined not to let me jump and that was what pulled me back over the edge.' Personal trainer Mr Laybourn, 31, from Surrey, said when he saw the tweet he knew straight away Mr Benjamin was looking for him. The pair were reunited on Tuesday.

Ex-Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown has spoken of being caught up in a car crash in which a man died . Former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown and his wife have been involved in a three-car collision which left another driver dead. The 72-year-old peer and his wife Jane have spoken of their devastation at the crash on a notorious accident black spot near their Somerset home. It is thought a Vauxhall Corsa driven by Mark Hurford clipped the Ashdowns' Renault Scenic as it came round a corner. Both the peer and his wife walked away unscathed but Mr Hurford, who was 49, died at the scene. Police are appealing for witnesses of the incident to come forward. Lord Ashdown, of Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, said: 'We were coming back from the station and my wife was driving me home. 'We were about a mile outside Crewkerne and a car came around the corner. 'My wife was in the driver's seat, and miraculously and thankfully she was unhurt. 'However, the young man was dead by the time I reached him.' The peer added: 'We are very shaken by it, but of course very concerned for the young man's family and wife. 'I have been in touch with his wife and we are devastated for them and send them our prayers and condolences.' Crash victim: Vauxhall Corsa driver Mark Hurford died in the three-car crash in Somerset which Paddy Ashdown was involved in . The crash happened just after 5pm on January 24 at Turnpike Cross on the A356, between the A303 and Crewkerne. Police are looking into the circumstances of the crash and have appealed for witnesses. However the incident has sparked members of nearby Chiselborough Parish Council to renew their calls for safety measures along the A356. The road is a notorious accident black-spot and has been the subject of a campaign for safety improvements by local residents. A 29-year-old passenger in a Transit . van also involved in the incident was taken to Yeovil District Hospital, . Somerset, after suffering a dislocated shoulder and back injuries.

A violent 20-stone thug was behind bars tonight after he left a frail pensioner crippled and unable ever to walk again during a brutal robbery in her own home. Michael Sines, of Windsor, Berkshire, admitted he was 'scum' as he received a six and a half year sentence for shoving 84-year-old Veronica Manser to the floor in the hallway of her flat and stealing £150 from her purse. The 6ft 5in brute bundled the OAP over, shattering her pelvis as she used her Zimmer frame and has left the previously independent OAP wheelchair-bound for the rest of her life. He fled the scene, leaving her lying on the floor in distress until her daughter found her half an hour later. After three unsuccessful operations, the victim suffers from depression and now struggles to leave her home in Crowthorne, Berkshire, the court heard. Jailing the heroin addict at Reading Crown Court, Judge Richard Parkes said: 'All you cared about was getting your drugs and you have caused this woman pain and the loss of her independence. 'The aggravating factors of this case is Mrs Manser was vulnerable and elderly. By your reckless actions, you caused serious life-changing injuries to her.' The judge had heard how Sines conned his way inside the gated block of flats where Mrs Manser lived before targeting her as she slowly walked back to her home after delivering a letter to a nearby post box. 'You wanted her purse and did so without considering the consequences to her, the judge told Sines. 'You are a heavily-built man of 39 years of age; she is a frail old lady. The consequences were life-threatening. 'She . is now confined to a wheelchair and unable to walk. She's in constant . pain despite taking painkillers and wakes up several times in the night. 'The violence you did to her means she is now dependent on carers as she was not before. 'She is depressed and finds it hard to keep control of her emotions without breaking down.' Devastated: 84-year-old Veronica Manser in hospital after 20-stone thug Michael Sines broke her pelvis during a robbery at her home . The criminal stared straight ahead without expression as the judge made his damning sentencing remarks. Prosecutor Jonathan Sank had told how the frail OAP was making her way indoors with her Zimmer frame when Sines attacked on October 24, 2012. 'She was just back inside the front door when she felt what she says was the ""most enormous push"",' said Mr Sank. Shattered: Mrs Manser's daughter Sue Coffey, said: 'We as a family feel great sadness that our mother is now a shadow of her former self because of his actions' 'After the push, he took Mrs Manser's purse from a compartment attached to her walking frame. 'Inside that was £150 in cash which had been withdrawn by her a day or two before. 'He fled. Mrs Manser pressed her lifeline button and help was summoned.' Sines' victim was still on the floor when her shocked daughter Sue Coffey, 53, turned up at the flats and found her a short while later. His shove during the crime had broken her pelvis, leading to three unsuccessful operations causing constant pain and depression, the court heard. Mr Sank said: 'She contracted infections as a result of the aggressive treatment which was required and the situation was life-threatening. 'As a consequence of one infection, she suffered hallucinations. 'However, Mrs Manser was sufficiently lucid to recall the extreme stress she was in and the nature of the hallucinations and feelings of being under attack; lashing out at things that are not there, and screaming.' Mr Sank went on: 'Although she has now returned home, she will never walk again. Even now, 15 months later, she is in constant discomfort. She wakes two or three time a night in pain. 'She can't go out on her own and she's lost a considerable degree of her independence.' Sines was said to have more than 50 previous convictions going back to the early 1990s for theft, burglary and violent assaults stemming from a long-held addiction to Class A drugs. The court heard the violent heroin user was jailed for five years in 2005 for stabbing a Homebase store manager during a row over a £50 pounds refund. The manager suffered a collapsed lung but survived the attack. His defence barrister Nick Cotter told the judge his client was 'genuinely remorseful' and had been clean of drugs before the attack. He said Sines' drug-taking and offending had started again after he struggled to deal with his mother's death in 2010. 'He has come round to a very firm conclusion that what he did that day was a very nasty thing to do to a fellow human being,' Mr Cotter told the judge. 'He says, in his own language, that ""this is the scummiest thing I have ever been involved in"".' 'He wishes through me to apologise to the victim and her relatives for what he did. He appreciates of course he can not turn the clock back. 'If only he could.' Speaking after the case, Mrs Manser's daughter Sue Coffey, said: 'We as a family feel great sadness that our mother is now a shadow of her former self because of his actions. 'We are delighted that he is now in prison for a long time. It has been a very long two years. We are delighted he has been caught and he now has to face the punishment for it. 'I hope his apology is genuine and that he now can reflect on what he did to my mum.' Mrs Manser also thanked Thames Valley Police for bringing Sines to justice in what she called a 'very difficult case'.","Michael Sines admitted he was 'scum' after attack that crippled OAP .

Afghanistan's president angered the families of British soldiers yesterday by suggesting the presence of Nato troops over the past 13 years had made his country worse. The US-led invasion in 2001, a response to the September 11 attacks, was launched to drive out Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But describing the Taliban as 'brothers' and America as 'rivals', Afghan leader Hamid Karzai said: 'The mission, in terms of bringing security, has not been successful, particularly in Helmand. 'What they did was create pockets of wealth and a vast countryside of deprivation and anger.' Asked by The Sunday Times whether it would have been better if British troops – many of whom are based in Helmand province – had never gone there, Karzai replied: 'I guess so. Yes.' His remarks were labelled an insult by relatives of some of the 447 British soldiers who have lost their lives there. Joan Humphreys, whose 24-year-old grandson Kevin Elliot, a Black Watch infantryman, was killed in Afghanistan in 2009, said: 'He has been hinting at this for a while but never said anything this blatant. I find his comments vile.' Britain's commander in Afghanistan, Lieutenant General John Lorimer, disputed Karzai's claims. He said: 'Amazing things have been achieved here.' British troops are due to be withdrawn later this year. Elaine Bell, whose son Private Martin Bell won the George Medal after being killed trying to save a colleague from the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, told the Mail: ‘The president is entitled to his opinion but those lads and girls do a fantastic job out there. I can see why a lot of people will be infuriated by his comments.’ She added: ‘All we hear about are the deaths and horror stories but our soldiers are out there building schools. They have also been out there trying to close down terrorist training grounds and if they were not to keep a lid on it, we wouldn’t be able to sleep so soundly.’ Comments: Karza, pictured shaking hands with David CAmeron outside No.10 in October, particularly criticized NATO action in Helmand, where British soldiers are based . The president was also accused by other relatives of ‘spitting on the graves’ of British soldiers. Jacqui Janes, from Brighton, the mother of 20 year-old Guardsman Jamie Janes, who was killed by an IED in 2009, said: ‘His government’s corrupt and he’s a proper turncoat. 'I don’t know what he hopes to gain from saying this. It’s wrong and it’s disgusting. ‘He may as well as have just come and spat on our sons’ graves. It’s such an insult to everyone who lost their lives.’ Carol Valentine, whose son, Sergeant Simon Valentine, 29, died from injuries after an explosion while on foot patrol near Sangin, northern Helmand, in 2009, said: ‘He makes some very rash, weird statements and in the next breath he wants to come over and shake people’s hands. 'So many families are now suffering because of the support that this country gave to Afghanistan.’ Britain’s most senior commander in Afghanistan, Lieutenant-General John Lorimer, disputed that Afghanistan had been left in a worse state because of Nato involvement : ‘I don’t agree,’ he said. Anger: The families of British soldiers who have served in Afghanistan since 2001 were 'disgusted' and 'insulted' by Karzai's interview (stock image) British troops keep watch at a checkpoint, where a man shot and killed three British soldiers, in Helmand province in 2012, an area singled out by Karzai . The involvement of international troops meant al-Qaeda had been denied a safe haven in Afghanstan and that local security forces had developed into a ‘pretty impressive’ force. He added: ‘Amazing things have been achieved here, if you go look at governance across country it has improved at province and district level.’ David Cameron provoked controversy when he recently suggested that the mission had been accomplished in Afghanistan. Britain plans to withdraw its troops from the country this year, after 13 years of involvement in the country. Mr Karzai is refusing to sign an agreement to allow American and other Nato soldiers to stay on until after this year to train Afghan forces. He is understood to want to leave it to his successor to decide, who is due to be elected in the April presidential elections.","President Karzai call the Taliban ‘brothers’ and America ‘rivals’

This is the British mother facing three years in a Dubai prison in after she was accused of abducting her own three-year-old son in an acrimonious custody battle with her ex-husband. Afsana Lachaux, 46, from London, is facing charges of kidnapping her toddler Louis after officials in the United Arab Emirates said she had failed to turn up to a pre-arranged access visit. However, the mother-of-three said she had not attended because her former husband Bruno Lachaux, who was awarded custody of the boy by a Dubai court, had threatened to kill her on their last meeting. Accused: Afsana Lachaux, 46, from London, is facing charges of kidnapping her three-year-old son Louis and if found guilty could be sent to a prison in Dubai for three years . Allegations: Officials in the United Arab Emirates said she had failed to bring Louis to a pre-arranged access visit with her French ex-husband Bruno Lachaux . Mrs Lachaux will go on trial in Dubai next week and if she is found guilty at the hearing on February 11, she could be put in prison for three years. She then risks being deported back to the UK, leaving her youngest child behind. Mrs Lachaux was a senior civil servant in east London before moving to the UAE in 2010, shortly after she married her former partner, a 38-year-old aviation engineer. Their son, who has dual French and British nationality, was born in Dubai. She claims her French ex-husband snatched little Louis from his pushchair after he tracked her down to a shopping centre near her home. She has not seen the boy since. 'The idea I may never be able to hold him again is unbearable,' she told the Sunday Mirror. Battle: Mrs Lachaux claims her French ex-husband snatched little Louis from his pushchair after he tracked her down to a shopping centre near her home . 'I am scared about being sent to prison but I am more scared about being kept apart from Louis.' Mrs Lachaux's two older sons, Rabbhi Yahiya, 26, and Shabbir, 23, who have a different father, still live in London but had visited their mother several times in Dubai. She had told them in November 2010 that she was having marital troubles, claiming that Mr Lachaux had hidden Louis's passport. Mrs Lachaux left her husband in April 2011, after she was persuaded to by Rabbhi. Although she was awarded custody of Louis, she was ordered to allow Mr Lachaux to see the child. However, in March 2012 she failed to take him to an access meeting in a park, leading to the abduction charge. She strongly denies the accusation and told a court at an earlier hearing: . 'I did not kidnap my son. But after one of our court hearings, my . ex-husband threatened to kill me if I didnâ€™t give him the boy so I got . scared and stayed away from him.' She claims she has been living in poverty . 'trapped' in the country since the authorities took away her passport . following a travel ban obtained by her wealthy ex-husband, and alleges . that Mr Lachaux has exploited Dubaiâ€™s legal system, based in part on . Islamic sharia law, to gain custody of the little boy and have criminal . charges brought against her. Separation: Mrs Lachaux said that although she was afraid of going to prison, she was 'more scared about being kept apart from Louis' She also claims Mr Lachaux divorced her and successfully sued for custody of Louis in a sharia court without her knowledge. Under sharia law if 12 months have passed without the court's decision being challenged it is upheld and can not be appealed. In a letter submitted to prosecutors on February 18 last year her ex-husband wrote:  'She would forget his vaccinations, prevent the father from providing him with medical care, since he suffers eczema, and leaves the boy with strangers during her repeated travels and staying up late at parties with her friends.' Mrs Lachaux, who, unlike her husband is a Muslim, has been told she must produce three witnesses who support her defence, that she did not turn up because she had allegedly suffered domestic abuse. She has been unable to work and is surviving on what her family have been able to send her from the UK. Her family have also been trying to raise the profile of her case, and in a blog post Rabbhi wrote: 'On one occasion Afsana and her baby were flung into Bur Dubai jail where her baby was denied food and water and she was assaulted by a prison guard. 'Her incarceration was at the insistence of her husband. No investigation or action was taken into the false imprisonment or assault.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have been providing consular assistance to her family since her arrest, and she is also being backed by her friend Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse.","Afsana Lachaux, 46, from London, is accused of kidnapping her son Louis .

That's why two of the world's wealthiest men are refusing to back down in their on-going 'mine's bigger than yours' battle to be the owner of the world's largest yacht. Mega-rich Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, who currently owns the world's biggest private superyacht, appears to have been forced to carry out some urgent extensions after Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid launched a bid to regain the title. Great white: Roman Abramovich's 158 metre yacht Eclipse is covered in tarpaulin and scaffolding as it undergoes a refit at the dock in Barcelona . It was only two years ago that Mr Abramovich bought his 557ft-long vessel and stole the crown from the Sheikh 532ft yacht called Dubai. But, in the wake of rumours that Sheikh Mohammed is having his boat extended to recapture the title, Mr Ambramovich has perhaps not surprisingly booked his own yacht in for a refit in Barcelona harbour. The mega-yacht is currently moored in the harbour, where it is covered in tarpaulin and scaffolding while the secret work is carried out by Marina Barcelona 92. It is not known exactly what alterations are being done to the yacht, which Mr Abramavich - who will be in Munich tomorrow for the European Cup final - initially bought for around £330 million. The final cost was believed to be £1billion by the time he paid for extra luxury fittings and security measures. All aboard: It is unclear clear what work is being done behind the shied of white, but the refit comes amid rumours that fellow billionaire Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum is attempting to reclaim the world's largest yacht crown .

The yacht comes with features including two helipads, a submarine, multiple hot tubs, a pool and a missile-detection system. It is said to have two swimming pools - the larger of which converts into a dance floor when drained - bullet-proof glass, six-foot home cinema screens in each of the 24 guest cabins and a master cabin where the roof opens to allow Mr Abramovich and girlfriend Daria Zhukova to sleep under the stars. The yacht also has armoured-plating around the master suite and a laser system designed to dazzle long-lens photographers. Around 70 crew members are needed to operate the yacht, which has nine decks and can accommodate 30 guests. It costs 50 million dollars to run each year and single re-fuelling costs around 650,000 dollars each time. Last summer Mr Abamovich hired it out for £2 million a week.

Hundreds of thousands more union members will be able to play a more active role due to Ed Miliband's reforms, McCluskey has said . Union baron Len McCluskey yesterday hailed Ed Miliband’s reforms to Labour’s links with the trade unions as ‘music to my ears’. The Unite general secretary, whose union has given Labour more than £8 million since Mr Miliband became leader, said they would allow potentially hundreds of thousands more union members to ‘play a more active role’. Labour HQ insists its plans to change the way the party elects its leaders and takes money from the unions is Mr Miliband’s ‘Clause Four moment’, a reference to when Tony Blair changed its constitution. Deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted that allowing union members to pay £3 to affiliate to Labour and then vote in the leadership elections would ‘breathe fresh life’ into the party. She accused critics of being ‘phobic’ about trade union, telling the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘What it’s about is opening up the Labour party to people at workplaces up and down the country, broadening the base of the Labour party. ‘I don’t know what you mean about ‘a trade union direction’; if you mean people who care about more people being able to get jobs, being able to have the living wage, caring about decent terms and conditions, caring about equality and social justice, well yes, that’s a good thing, that’s what the Labour party believes in.’ Mr Miliband says he wants to ‘mend, not end’ Labour’s link to the unions, and asked former trade unionist and Labour general secretary to draw up proposals that will be discussed this week by the party’s ruling body. Individual members of an affiliated trade union  will be given a straight ‘yes or no’ choice about whether they want to pay a small sum that will be given to Labour. Those that want to pay this fee will also be asked if they wish - at no extra cost - to become an ‘affiliated supporter’ who has a direct relationship with the party as an individual. Mr Miliband said: ‘This is about completing unfinished business from the past 20 years and creating a One Nation Labour Party built on the principle of one member, one vote. ‘And it is about letting the people back into our politics: giving people a real choice and a real voice in our party; changing Labour so that Labour can change our country.’ The Tories - and some Labour critics -- say the changes will make it easier for union members to determine Labour leadership contests, greatly increasing the number who can vote and diluting the power of Labour MPs over the outcome. Mr Miliband - whose received £8m from Unite since he became leader of the party - says he wants to ¿mend, not end¿ Labour¿s link to the unions . They also warn that giving individuals a choice over whether or not to pay affiliation fees means more cash will acculumate in unions’ political funds, which leaders can then choose whether or not to hand to the party. Mr McCluskey told BBC Radio Five’s Pienaar’s Politics: ‘For me it wasn’t necessarily a question of gaining or losing power when Ed [Miliband] made his statement back in the summer of last year. He was talking about giving an opportunity to ordinary trade unionists – maybe hundreds of thousands - to play a more active role within the Labour party. That was music to my ears, which is why we welcome the proposals.’ Paul Kenny, head of the GMB union, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics, said the proposed changes to leadership elections were ‘very sensible’ and the perception of a union ‘bloc vote’ has always been a myth. Professor Roger Seafert, a trade union expert, said: ‘It is not clear that Miliband believes that this change will reduce union influence. It just changes the nature of that influence. But fundamentally those people who pay the bills, the unions, will still have a big say in party policy.’ Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed Miliband promised to loosen the trade union barons’ grip on the Labour Party.

London bus drivers will no longer accept cash payment on board their vehicles when new measures are introduced this summer. Transport for London has announced a raft of changes, including allowing passengers with insufficient Oyster card credit to travel for a whole journey before they need to top up. TfL said dwindling numbers of bus passengers using cash has prompted the change, following a consultation in which it said 99% of customers already use Oyster, prepaid tickets, contactless payment cards or concessionary tickets. Transport for London says it will remove the option to pay by cash for buses by mid-2014 . Leon Daniels, managing director for TfL surface transport, said: 'The decision to stop accepting cash fares on London buses reflects the changing way that people pay for goods and services in our city, including journeys on the bus network. 'Paying with Oyster or a contactless payment card is not only the cheapest option, but also speeds up boarding times at bus stops and reduces delays. 'It costs £24million a year to accept cash on London’s buses and by removing this option we will generate significant savings which, like all of our income, will be reinvested in improvements to the transport network.' TfL said the changes will be brought in by mid-2014, once tests on the new technology have given the upgrade the green light. During a recent public consultation, around a third of respondents agreed with the proposal to remove cash fares, TfL said. Tfl says that 99 per cent of its customers now use contactless cards and allowing cash payments as well currently costs £24million-a-year . Around three quarters of responses to the consultation came from people who indicated that they do not themselves pay cash fares on the bus. TfL said its new “one more journey” feature will allow passengers with less than the single bus fare (currently £1.45) - but who have a positive balance on their card - to make one more bus journey before they have to add credit to their card. The operator will also provide refreshed guidance for all 24,500 London bus drivers to ensure a consistent approach is taken when dealing with vulnerable passengers, it said. The card was publicly launched on June 30 2003, with around 60 million cards issued since then.","Tfl says it will remove the option to pay by cash by mid-2014 .

Probe: A former inspector accused of 'acting on behalf' of Jimmy Savile by contacting Surrey Police officers before they interviewed the paedophile presenter is being formally investigated . A former police inspector ‘acted on behalf’ of Jimmy Savile before his controversial interview over sex assaults of teenage girls, it was claimed last night. The West Yorkshire-based officer is alleged to have contacted Surrey Police before its detectives interviewed Savile in 2009. Transcripts of the interviews – released by the force this week – provoked anger as they appeared to show detectives adopting a kid-glove approach to the DJ and paedophile who was being accused of sexually assaulted girls at a school in Staines during the 1970s. And today a former Leeds police officer revealed that Savile was notorious within the force - but no one ever dared challenge him. Ex-officer Paul Leonard, 68, told the Daily Mirror he once discovered the television star in his Rolls Royce with a young girl. When he approached the car, Savile said: 'I'm waiting for midnight when she turns 16... so p*** off if you want to keep your job.' The former officer - who had his name changed - said he was told by his Sergeant that the star had 'friends in high places' when he tried to bring it up. Mr Leonard's allegations emerged as it was revealed that during interviews with Surrey Police, Savile boasted of his ‘collection’ of police contacts in Leeds. The disgraced broadcaster told detectives that he had been targeted with false claims by blackmailers, and said: ‘I have up in Yorkshire, where I live in Leeds, a collection of senior police persons who come to see me socially, but I give them all my weirdo letters.’ The informal meetings between Savile and police at his flat in Leeds were known as the ‘Friday Morning Club’. But it has emerged that the interview took place months after the West Yorkshire inspector first contacted Surrey Police over their plans to quiz Savile about the ‘historic’ sex allegations. The officer told Surrey Police that he knew the DJ ‘personally’ and allegedly brokered the interview with Savile. A previously released Surrey Police report on its dealings with Savile referred to the officer as ‘Inspector 5’, and said he had phoned the force as it tried to set up an interview with him over the sex claims. Last night the Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed that a preliminary probe had been launched into the claims but this would now become a full investigation. Victim: Jill Bartlett fell pregnant after being raped by Jimmy Savile when she was 16. She criticised the police's questioning techniques . In the interview, lasting just 56 minutes, Savile denied claims he forced one girl to touch his groin, made another perform a sex act and stuck his tongue down a young girl’s throat. He claimed that the women were looking to make money out of the allegations, which were put to him during an interview in his office at Stoke Mandeville Hospital on October 1, 2009. It was not clear last night whether the officer, who has since left West Yorkshire Police, was among those officers who attended Savile’s ‘Friday Morning Club’. Victims of Savile and child protection campaigners called for an independent inquiry into the police dealings with the Top of the Pops star. The Radio 1 DJ is thought to have raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450 people, including some as young as eight, according to an official report. He died two years ago, aged 84. Surrey Police released this transcript of an interview with Jimmy Savile in October, 2009, following sexual assault allegations at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and a children's home . Last night, Jill Bartlett, who was raped by Savile, falling pregnant at the age of 16, said there should be an inquiry. She said: ‘Jimmy Savile was very persuasive, but police should have training so they’re not fooled. All kinds of criminals and psychopaths are persuasive and the police should be above that. ‘I think there should be a full inquiry into their dealings with him. He was known as someone who liked young women, and the police should have known about it and acted.’ Keir Starmer promises changes over abuse charges . Caroline Moore, who was 13 and recovering from an operation on a children’s ward at the hospital when Savile stuck his tongue down her throat, called for an inquiry into the police. The 54-year-old, who is disabled and from Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, said: ‘There should be a proper investigation into all the social meetings Savile said he had with police. Not an internal police investigation, because no one really has faith in them any more.’ Sylvia Edwards was 19 when she was groped by Savile after he put his hand up her skirt during a live broadcast of Top of the Pops in 1976. Cameras caught her shrieking and moving away from him. Yesterday, she said: ‘I honestly think the police should be held accountable. There should be an inquiry and people should be made to stand up. The (police officers) should be named.’ Asked whether Surrey Police missed an opportunity to prosecute Savile while he was still alive, she said: ‘I don’t think they missed it, I think they deliberately ignored it because of who he was.’ Child protection expert Mark Williams-Thomas, a former Surrey Police detective, said: ‘It’s clear that over a period of time complaints were made about Savile and information was held about him and I think it’s fair to say West Yorkshire Police’s report was a whitewash. It was very poor.’ Operation Newgreen, a West Yorkshire Police report published this year, found no evidence that Savile was shielded from arrest and protected from prosecution by his relationship with the force. A spokesman for the IPCC said: ‘The Commission has begun an independent investigation in relation to the alleged actions of a former inspector with West Yorkshire Police. 'The allegations refer to the officer having “acted on behalf” of Jimmy Savile by inappropriately contacting Surrey Police ahead of a police interview.’ Accusations: Jimmy Savile visited Duncroft Approved School for Girls in the 1970s, pictured here in 1974, where he allegedly attacked several young women. It is not suggested that any of the women are in this picture .","Officer called Surrey Police detectives before questioning started in 2009 .

Michael Schumacher may take weeks or months to come out fully from the artificial coma he has been in for five weeks following his skiing accident, say experts. There are still no guarantees the seven-times Formula 1 champion will recover his health completely.As the anaesthetic keeping him under is slowly reduced, doctors treating him will expand the tests on his reflexes. ‘These are to ascertain if the nerves leading to the brain and back to the muscles are functioning,’ said Professor Heinzpeter Moecke, head of the Institute for Emergency Medicine in Hamburg. Scroll down for video . Michael Schumacher is being slowly brought out of his induced coma, his manager has said. His wife Corinna insists her husband is a 'fighter' who will not give up . He has been in an induced coma in Grenoble University Hospital since then, although his condition stabilised following surgery after initially being described as critical. Schumacher, who spent his 45th . birthday in the medically induced coma at Grenoble Hospital, is having . his joints and limbs massaged daily to prevent muscles atrophying. Earlier this week he was said to be  ‘responding to instructions’ as doctors gradually bring him out of his coma. The seven-time Formula 1 world champion is also reported to have blinked during brain tests. He . has undergone a number of neurological exams since Monday and has . responded ‘positively’, according to L’Equipe newspaper which cited . ‘very reliable sources’. After gradually reducing the sedation of the patient, the team of head doctor Emmanuel Gay have been testing his neurological reflexes since Monday. 'Deeply moved': Schumacher's Rolf Schumacher and brother Ralf arrive at Grenoble Hospital earlier this month. His family have issued a heartfelt thank you to fans around the world for their support . Strain: Corinna Schumacher and their children have been maintaining a constant bedside vigil since his crash . To promote healing the German driver has been kept in a medically induced coma as well as having his body temperature reduced. This is because a traumatic head injury can cause the brain to swell and there is no room for it to expand in the skull, causing tissue damage. The thinking is that if doctors can try to reduce the energy requirements of the brain, this reduces blood flow and pressure, and allows the brain to rest. The anesthetic propofol is commonly used for induced coma - it is not known what doctors have used in Schumacher's case. Weaning the patient out of the medically induced coma means tapering the amount of barbiturates down slowly. It can take a different amount of time depending on the patient and their injuries. A quick withdrawal of this kind of medication could have deadly consequences. A patient will be returned to the medically induced coma if the acute signs such as intracranial pressure or seizure activity resume during the weaning period. 'During the early stages the patient blinked,' the leading sports newspaper reported. Schumacher suffered serious head . injuries when he fell and hit the right side of his head on a rock in . the French resort of Meribel on December 29. He . has been in an induced coma in Grenoble University Hospital since then, . although his condition stabilized following surgery after initially . being described as critical. 'Michael's . sedation is being reduced in order to allow the start of the waking up . process which may take a long time,' Schumacher's manager, Sabine Kehm, . said in a statement. Schumacher was being kept artificially sedated and his body temperature . was lowered to between 34 and 35 degrees Celsius (93.2 and 95 degrees . Fahrenheit), to reduce swelling in the brain, reduce its energy . consumption and allow it to rest. Kehm . said she was only providing an update now on Schumacher's condition to . clarify media leaks, and that no further details would be provided. French newspaper l'Equipe first reported on Wednesday that doctors had started trying to wake up Schumacher. Experts . said it was a good sign that Schumacher's doctors were trying to bring . him out of the coma and that the first 24 hours would be critical. 'It . means they have probably seen the pressure in his skull reduced,' said . Dr. Clemens Pahl, a brain trauma expert at King's College Hospital in . London. Pahl warned that if Schumacher hasn't recovered enough to wake up on his own, doctors might need to put him back in the coma. 'It . could be that swelling in his brain hasn't come to an end yet so they . might need to increase the medications again,' he said. Pahl . said that wasn't uncommon in patients with brain injuries and that . sometimes it took several attempts to bring someone out of an induced . coma. Probe: Investigators at the site of Schumacher's crash earlier this month where he smashed his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in Meribel, France . Brain experts . said it will be fundamental to determine whether Schumacher was aware of . his surroundings and could respond to basic commands from doctors, like . raising his hand. 'This . is a test to see what his function is like,' said Dr. Anthony Strong, . an emeritus chair in neurosurgery at King's College London. He said that once the sedatives wear off, Schumacher's doctors would . see if he can breathe on his own and if he responds to mild pain . stimulus, like gentle pressing on his eyebrows. 'Doctors . will want to see if he can say `hello,' if he probe his recollection of . events and to see if he can recognize family members and remember his . own identity,' Strong said. Get well soon! Cologne and Schalke stars hold out a banner wishing Michael Schumacher good health . If . Schumacher doesn't respond to their voice, they will also look to see . if he tries to pull out any of the tubes in him or rip the dressing off . his wounds - which would be a sign that he is aware of where he is. Still, . experts said it would likely be months before Schumacher's prognosis . becomes clear - and that lasting brain damage was a possibility. 'If he pulls through, he may not be the man he was,' said Dr. Tipu Aziz, head of neurosurgery at Oxford University. 'Given the length of time he's been in (intensive care), he has clearly had a very severe head injury,' he said. 'It's too early to know how intact he will be, but I would guess there is going to be some kind of lasting damage.' Schumacher earned universal acclaim for his uncommon and sometimes ruthless driving talent, which led to a record 91 race wins. He retired from Formula One in 2012 after garnering an unmatched seven world titles. His accident happened on a family vacation in the Alps as Schumacher was skiing with his 14-year-old son.","Michael Schumacher is being taken out of artificial coma gradually .

Jeremy Hunt has said he will back a call for parents to be banned from smoking in cars containing children . The controversial move to ban smoking in cars carrying children has won the backing of the Health Secretary. Jeremy Hunt says there is a compelling case for outlawing smoking when youngsters are in a vehicle. Critics claim the amendment to the Children and Families Bill, approved by the House of Lords last week, is unenforceable and an extension of the nanny state. And Mr Hunt had previously rejected Labour’s proposed change in the law, saying it was not the Government’s place to dictate what people did in private places. But the father of two has changed his mind over regulations that would make it an offence for a driver to ‘fail to prevent smoking in the vehicle when a child or children are present’, with parents who defy the ban facing a £60 fine. The Government opposed it in the Lords but David Cameron has since said he would look again at the issue. The call for the new law has been led by Labour public health spokesman Luciana Berger. It was initially opposed by her boss, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, who says he has changed his mind for the sake of his children. MPs will be given a free vote when the  Bill returns to the Commons. Many  Liberal Democrats – including Nick  Clegg – remain opposed. Campaigners  welcomed the Lords vote, claiming a ban would protect half a million children who are exposed to second-hand smoke in cars every week. The Deputy Prime Minister, who has struggled to give up smoking, argued that the law would ‘subcontract responsible parenting to the state’. Parents who defy the ban would face a £60 fine. The policy was a step closer to becoming law when peers voted lat week to pass an amendment to the Children and Families Bill which was about ‘protecting children’. The Labour move was backed by 222 votes to 197, a majority of 25, in the House of Lords. Campaigners welcomed the result of the Lords’ vote, claiming a ban would protect half-a-million children who were exposed to second-hand smoke in cars every week. The toxic fumes deployed from smoking in a care are 11 times more concentrated than lighting up in an open space. If the law is introduced, it will see smokers fined £60 if they are caught lighting up in a vehicle with a child . A Department of Health survey found 300,000 children a year visited GPs in England every year with problems linked to second-hand smoke. Passive smoking is linked to respiratory infections such as pneumonia and chest infections in youngsters. It can also trigger asthma attacks in sufferers and contribute to sudden unexpected infant death. Last year, the then public health minister Anna Soubry said she would back a ban on smoking in cars on ‘child welfare’ grounds. Despite the government’s opposition to a ban at the time, Miss Soubry told a local government conference: ‘I would ban smoking in cars where children are present. ‘I would do that for the protection of children. I believe in protecting children. I would see it as a child welfare issue. ‘I think it is something we should at least consider as government.’ Miss Soubry, who is a former smoker herself and now a defence minister, made it clear she was expressing her own views. Critics have warned that a ban on smoking in private cars is a sign that the ‘nanny state’ is overreaching itself and it could lead to outlawing cigarettes in family homes.","Health Secretary is backing law despite previously opposing it .

One in five lung transplant patients are given organs from 20-a-day smokers, research has  revealed. Overall, almost a half of donated lungs come from someone who had smoked, according to a major  British study. Using lung transplants from smokers is a way of boosting supply as there is a constant shortage of donor organs. Discovery: Transplant patients who are given smokers' lungs (right) are just as likely to survive as those who receive organs from non-smokers (left), a study has revealed. Some patients even had higher survival rates . But for one in five patients, their donors had smoked a packet a day or more for at least 20 years. Despite . this, the researchers said patients' survival rate  was not harmed by . receiving  a smoker's lung and the research should ease patients' fears . about donors who had smoked. The . study showed that patients who received lungs from non-smokers actually . had a slightly lower one-year survival rate. The research was carried . out at Harefield Hospital in north-west London. It . analysed the difference in short and medium-term survival rates between . patients given lungs from both smokers and non-smokers. Since 2007, 237 lung transplants have been carried out and 90 per cent of them were double-lung transplants. In . total, 53 per cent were given lungs from non-smokers, while 29 per cent . got lungs from donors who smoked for less than 20 years and 18 per cent . were given the lungs of people who smoked 20 or more a day for at least . 20 years. Concern: The use of smokers' lungs in transplants has sparked controversy - largely because of its perceived risk to patients (file picture) Discovery: . One-year and three-year survival rates were about the same for all three groups. Non-smokers . performed relatively poorly in the short term with 77.7 per cent of . transplant patients surviving one year compared to 90.8 per cent with . smokers' lungs. There was no significant difference in the overall . effectiveness of the lungs, time spent in intensive care and in . hospital. AndrÃ© Simon, . director of heart and lung transplantation and consultant cardiac . surgeon at Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, said: 'Donor lungs . from even heavy smokers may provide a valuable avenue for increasing . donor organ availability.' He . said the results showed that even donors with a heavy smoking history . 'may provide a much-needed lease on life to the critically ill patient . whose chances of survival diminish with every day or week that passes by . on the waiting list'. He . added: 'I believe that candidates significantly decrease their chances . of survival if they choose to decline organs from smokers.' Mr . Simon said that although it may 'seem strange' that smokers' lungs . perform just as well, he stressed that all organs are assessed before . operations go ahead to ensure 'maximum quality and safety'. UK Transplant Registry data shows that only 20 per cent of patients get transplants within six months. The . figure rises to 51 per cent after three years, but by that time nearly . one in three patients has died waiting for a transplant. Lung . transplants are carried out for patients with a range of serious . ailments including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic . fibrosis.

Convicted: Summers admitted taking £60 from her victim's bag over the course of a week .

Cannock Magistrates Court gave Ms Summers a suspended sentence after hearing how she was filmed at the . property in Perton, near Wolverhampton, three times between November 5 . and December 12 last year - stealing a total of £60. Prosecutor Giles Rowden told the court: 'She was employed as a carer for a vulnerable person whose abilities are limited. 'On November 4 the victim came out of hospital. She realised the following day that money was missing from her purse. 'It became a fairly frequent occurrence and her family set up CCTV cameras which captured the defendant removing money from her purse and putting it into her bra. 'She accepted she was responsible on three occasions of stealing £20.' In a written statement read out in court Mrs Nardone, who suffers from Multi System Atrophy (MSA), said she had 'lost what little trust and faith I had left'. She said: 'Nadia's actions have cost me so much more than just £60 from my purse or £1,000 for cameras. 'She has taken away what little trust and faith I had left. It has been hard for me to accept that I need help, and allowing strangers into my home as carers has been yet another challenge. 'I felt helpless to accuse the people who care for me, fearing a 'my word against theirs' situation. 'I was frightened to upset them in case they took it out on me. I depend on people. 'I hope Nadia can never again cause any other vulnerable person the distress and heartache that she has caused me. 'Nobody deserves to feel like a victim in their own home at a time when what they need and deserve the most is support and care and dignity.' Loss of trust: Mrs Nardone, who suffers from Multi System Atrophy (MSA), said she had 'lost what little faith I had left' after she was robbed . MSA is a degenerative disorder, similar to Parkinsons disease, the average lifespan for a sufferer after diagnosis is eight years. Speaking after the hearing Lynette's furious daughter Kate Lowbridge blasted the 'intolerable' stress her mother was put under. The 40-year-old said: 'The whole situation has been a complete nightmare. I know it is only £60 but the stress it has caused my mother has been intolerable.

An art-loving businessman faces the prospect of seeing one of his treasured paintings thrown into a furnace to be destroyed after it featured on a BBC show about fakes and forgeries. Martin Lang bought what he thought was an original work by Russian-born artist Marc Chagall in 1992 for £100,000. More than 20 years later his son called in experts from BBC1's Fake Or Fortune to examine it. Martin Lang, who has been told a painting he paid £100,000 for will be burned after it was ruled a fake, at home in Leeds with his wife Jackie and son Frazer . The 'Chagall' painting bought by Yorkshire businessman Martin Lang for £100,000 which has now been ruled a fake . Viewers of tonight's show will see the watercolour, a nude said to date from 1909-10, undergo a series of scientific tests in an attempt to prove whether it is genuine before it is finally sent to the Chagall Committee in Paris for examination. But the committee, which is run by the artist's grandchildren to protect his reputation in the art world, said it is a fake and told the show that under French law they will have the painting burned. The show's host, Fiona Bruce, said: 'A decision like this forces the owner of any painting to play a kind of Russian roulette with their precious artwork. 'The only way for Martin to authenticate his painting was with the Chagall Committee, he had no other choice. Master: Russian-born artist Marc Chagall, pictured in 1933 . Martin Lang bought what he thought was an original work by Marc Chagall in 1992 . 'But it was never made clear to him that if they didn't like the look of his painting that they would burn it. How can anyone ever approach this committee with a painting again if this is how they react?' Mr Lang, 63, a property developer from Leeds, has asked the committee to mark the painting as a forgery and then return it or give him a guarantee he will be reimbursed if it is later ruled as genuine but is still waiting for a reply. He said: 'I had no idea that anyone would take such a draconian view. They say they want to counter forgery but I think this will have the opposite effect of deterring honest people like myself from coming forward.' Chagall, who died in 1985, is regarded as a pioneer of modernism and his work can sell for millions of pounds.","Martin Lang, 63, bought the painting in 1992 for £100,000 .

It's a problem that blights towns across the country - postmen dropping rubber bands used to hold bundles of letters together on the streets. Now one retired teacher has decided to take a stand - collecting 3,000 of them over three years to shame the Royal Mail. Keith Neal noticed large numbers of rubber bands left on the streets near his home in Hale, near Altrincham, Greater Manchester. The retired teacher soon realised the culprits were postal staff who dropped them as they sorted through bundles of letters for posting. Keith Neal has spent three years picking up almost 3,000 rubber bands (some pictured right) dropped by postmen from his nearby streets . Since 2011, Mr Neal has been involved in a one-man crusade against the littering postmen - by collecting over 3,000 of the elastic bands. Each year, Mr Neal sends a large bundle of them back to the Royal Mail for recycling - and to make a point about their antics. Last year alone the grandfather collected more than 1,000 of the bands that are used by Royal Mail to bundle deliveries. Mr Neal, a former biology teacher at the presitigious Manchester Grammar School, said: 'It is my way of fighting back against the problem of litter - but I do wish the postmen would be a bit more careful with their elastic bands. 'It is bad enough that we have a litter problem as it but noone expects one of the big culprits to be the Royal Mail. I keep picking up the elastic bands for them to use again but as fast as I do that, they're being dropped on the streets again. The retired teacher first noticed the dumped bands when walking to church in 2011 . 'I appreciate postmen have much bigger deliveries to make these days but littering the streets like this affects us all. Sometimes the streets look an awful mess and the postmen and women should know better than to just drop their rubbish all over the place. 'We all need to care more for our environment and show through example that we can all do our bit. I just think the Royal Mail should do their bit too.' Mr Neal said he began to notice the elastic bands on his regular one-mile walk to church and decided to start picking them up. He said: 'I do quite a lot of walking and I always notice how much litter is around. Where I live, the church is about a mile away and I go three times a week and you see litter in the street like empty cans of soft drink, takeaway wrappers and such like. 'Then I noticed the number of rubber bands that were being left around the street. I knew instantly they were from the Royal Mail because they were the distinctive red they use in deliveries. 'Obviously I can't pick up all the empty cans and takeaway wrappers but I thought picking up the elastic bands would be me doing my bit to tackle litter - and to make a point to the Royal Mail. Every year Mr Neal sends piles of the bands to Royal Mail as an attempt to make a point about the antic . Lat year alone the grandfather picked up 1,000 rubber bands near to his home in Hale, Greater Manchester . 'After a while I was amazed at how many I was collecting. With most litter you can't identify the people responsible for dropping it, but the elastic bands are clearly dropped by the Royal Mail. 'I've not got anything against the Royal Mail but some of their staff do drop a lot of elastic bands. I find myself collecting them every time I leave the house and it is not my job to do that kind of thing. 'I started it out of habit of wanting to keep things tidy but I was really surprised at how many I was finding. The other day for example I picked up five. As far as I know the bands are biodegradable but that would take years and they are so unsightly. 'I am sure that Royal Mail just think the council will sweep them up but that doesn't happen. In my eccentricity I have been keeping a record of how many bands I've collected. Royal Mail said they recycle millions of bands every year and regularly remind staff not to drop them on the street . 'Last year it was 660grams, which is about 1,000. They year before it was 500g. I keep the bands in my study in a carrier bag and then at the end of the year I present them at the local sorting office - yet no-one from the Royal Mail has ever even acknowledged it. 'I know it's an eccentric pastime but on the other hand we do have a litter problem in this country and this is my way of showing that we can all do our own little bit. 'I decided to focus on the rubber bands because it was so obvious who was dropping them. I don't go around picking up other litter, like sweet wrappers or takeaway packaging it would completely overwhelming.' Mr Neal estimates he walks over 250 miles every year collecting the elastic bands. Helen Bingham, from environmental charity Keep Britain Tidy, said: 'Keith is setting a fantastic example to everyone by showing that we can all do our bit to tackle the problem of litter that blights our streets.' Over the years, the charity has encouraged Royal Mail to play its part by getting its postal workers to keep hold of the bands. Royal Mail spokesman Val Bodden said: 'We regularly remind our postmen and women of the importance of avoiding litter and the benefits of re-using bands. 'We re-use millions of rubber bands each year and the vast majority are recycled within delivery offices and mail centres.'","Keith Neal first noticed the rubber bands left on the streets in 2011 .

The widow of PC David Rathband who hanged himself after their marriage broke down has found love with a prison guard. Kath, 44, whose former husband was blinded by gunman Raoul Moat, met the warder last year and is now living with him, it was reported today. The mother-of-two's relationship with the unidentified man follows the collapse of her marriage to the traffic officer who committed suicide 20 months after he was blasted while on duty. Kath, the ex-wife of Pc David Rathband who was blinded by maniac Raoul Moat, is now living with a new partner . A friend told the Sunday Mirror: 'Everyone is just so pleased that Kath has managed to find someone and can try to get on with her life after the nightmare she has been through.' Last month a coroner ruled that being shot and blinded by maniac Raoul Moat was the 'first step' in the series of events which led to Pc David Rathband killing himself. The traffic officer who became a national hero grew desperate after the collapse of his marriage and struggled to cope with his sudden and irreversible disability. Raoul Moat, who shot dead Chris Brown, 29, who was in a relationship with Moat's ex-girlfriend, Samantha Stobbart . He was found hanging at his home 20 months after he was blasted while on duty. Moat hunted down his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart and her boyfriend Chris Brown, 29, and shot them in cold blood using a shotgun two days after he was released from HMP Durham in 2010. Ms Stobbart survived the attack, while her ex-boyfriend went on the run and the next day shot and blinded PC David Rathband. Moat was hunted down by police and found in Rothbury, Northumberland, where he shot himself after a week on the run. Coroner Eric Armstrong urged none of those involved in the hearing to blame themselves. The inquest heard Mr Rathband, 44, had made threats to kill himself and told his lover he attempted to hang himself but could not go through with it. But his widow Kath and police colleagues she alerted, while concerned for his well-being, did not consider him to be at immediate risk of suicide. Mr Rathband was found hanging at his home in Blyth, Northumberland, on February 29 2012. He lived there alone, having left the family home following a domestic dispute the previous August. The three-day inquest, at Newcastleâ€™s Moot Hall, heard his wife put up with previous affairs, but his last - with 7/7 London bombing survivor Lisa French - effectively ended the marriage. Mrs Rathband broke the news to her husband prior to him flying out for a holiday in Australia with his identical twin Darren. The mother-of-two's relationship with the unidentified man follows the collapse of her marriage to the traffic officer . While on holiday, Mr Rathband made desperate attempts to contact his wife, ringing her up to 50 times on some days. The messages were unpleasant, abusive and threatening, she told the hearing. In one he pretended to be a police officer ringing to say her husband was dead. But he would be rational and pleasant if she spoke to him directly, she told the hearing. On another occasion he threatened to video-call his wife and kill himself while she watched. Mrs Rathband visited him for the last time on the night he died. She said she thought he looked 'awful' and decided he needed support. But she felt she was not the right person to be with him and contacted his sister Debbie Essery in Staffordshire and his welfare officer Inspector John Heckles. Mrs Essery contacted Det Con Brown with a Facebook message to pass on her concerns. That evening, officers including Mr Heckles eventually broke into his home and found him hanging in the darkness, with music playing from his phone.","Kath Rathband met the warder last year and is now living with him .

Just before she was killed by her husband and her body slow cooked until only her skull remained, Dawn Viens was stashing money and preparing to runaway. That is the latest revelation from a new investigation into the gruesome crime for which chef David Viens, 50, attempted suicide over and is now serving 15-years in a Californian prison. Local businessman and friend Joe Cacace claims Dawn gave him more than $1000 to hold for her a week before she went missing in October 2009, then when he confronted David Viens about his wife's disappearance was stunned by his brazen 'lying'. Scroll Down for Video: . Escape attempt: Dawn Viens was preparing to leave husband David Viens before her disappearance in October 2009 - her body has never been found . Cacace told CBS News' 48 Hours that he developed a very close rapport with Dawn and that he 'loved her'. The 39-year-old hostess, who worked with her husband at their own restaurant in the sleepy village of Lomita, confided to Cacace that David Viens had become too controlling. One day she handed him $700, 'And she said... 'If I bring more, can you put it in there?' I said, 'Yeah, it's your spot. You can put anything you want.' Cacace claims that Dawn had saved more than $1000 and had wanted to bring it over on Monday for him to look after. However, Monday came and Dawn never showed up. After a few days he went to confront Viens - who claimed he had dispatched his wife to rehab because she had a drinking problem. Day of reckoning: David Viens, a chef who told police he cooked his wife's body in boiling water, was sentenced in Los Angeles to 15 years to life in prison for second-degree murder in March 2012 . Last-ditch effort: Viens delivered a rambling . 45-minute speech at his trial in March 2012 in a failed attempt to get a new trial, telling the . court that he loved his wife and did not cook her . 'I'm just stunned. I'm thinking to myself, 'Did you forget who I am? I'm over your restaurant every night, your wife's over here every day,'Cacace said. 'This isn't flying. You're - you're lying to me...' The lengthy report by CBS News also reveals that Viens was a middling drug dealer with convictions in Florida and Vermont for pushing narcotics. Before the two moved to California, Dawn and David Viens had lived on Anna Maria Island off Florida's Gulf Coast. In 2005, Viens was arrested for selling marijuana in Manatee County, Florida and in return for a lesser sentence of one-year, helped authorities break up the drug ring he was involved in. In September, 2012 at his trial, David Viens' daughter from a previous marriage said that her father drunkenly confessed that his wife choked on her vomit after he tied her up and taped her mouth shut. 'For some reason I just got violent': David Viens pleaded not guilty to the murder of his wife Dawn - who disappeared in October 2009 . The body of Dawn Viens, 39, has never been found after she vanished in October 2009. Jacqueline Viens told the court her body would never be found and had previously joked that cooking someone was a good way to get rid of the body. Police tore up the floors and walls of Viens' Thyme Contemporary Cafe in Lomita with shovels and cadaver dogs to try and find her remains, but to no avail. His daughter recalled the conversation she had with her father one night in 2009. She recalled him saying that Dawn Viens had been needling him and he just wanted to sleep. He'd tried barricading their bedroom door with a dresser but when that didn't work, he tied her up and taped her mouth. The next morning, Dawn Viens was dead. She said her father told her, through tears, that her body would never be found. When he was arrested, he told investigators a similar story. Body search: Police excavated the Thyme Contemporary Cafe but found no trace of Dawn Viens . Viens claims his wife ran away to the mountains from their restaurant 16 months ago after an argument over whether she should go for drug rehabilitation. But authorities were suspicious because of ‘inconsistent statements’ he gave and the fact she left behind her wallet, mobile phone and other personal belongings. His new girlfriend, Kathy Galvan, then took over Mrs Viens’s job and moved into her home, before he was seen throwing out his wife’s belongings into a dustbin behind his restaurant, police said. Speaking about this, Jacqueline said she had been asked by her father to bag up Dawn's clothes and take them to a storage unit. The rest were thrown out. The 22-year-old also said that Dawn Viens was no saint. 'She'd wake up in the morning and drink all day long,' adding that the pair had done cocaine together. She also told jurors yesterday that after the 'drunken confession', her father asked her to send a text message from Dawn Viens' phone to one of his wife's friends saying: 'This is Dawn. I'm OK. I'm in Florida and I'm here to start over.' Then she got rid of the phone to protect her dad. On trial: David Viens told investigators they couldn't find his wife's body because he had cooked it for four days in boiling water until little was left but her skull . Suicide bid? The cliffs near the Point Vicente Interpretive Center in Rancho Palos Verdes in California. Viens jumped over cliffs in the area as he was being chased by police, falling 80ft, but 'amazingly' survived . During his trial, Los Angelese Superior Court jurors heard Viens make a similar confession during a recorded interview with sheriff's investigators. 'I just slowly cooked it and I ended up cooking her for four days,' Viens could be heard saying on the recording, according to the Los Angeles Times. Viens gave detectives the interview as he lay in a hospital bed in March 2011, after leaping off an 80-foot cliff in Rancho Palos Verdes when he learned he was a suspect in the late 2009 disappearance of his wife, Dawn Viens, 39, whose body was never found. Viens, whose injuries from the leap have him attending his trial in a wheelchair, said in the interview that he stuffed his wife's body in a 55-gallon drum of boiling water, keeping it submerged with weights and mixing what remained with other waste before disposing of it. He said the only thing left was his wife's skull, which he stashed at his mother's house. But a search of the house turned up nothing, nor did an excavation of his restaurant Thyme Contemporary Cafe in Lomita, Los Angeles. Cover up?: Police say he may have remodelled the café with new floors and walls to conceal his wife's body but his daughter believes he may have cooked her . On the recording played in court, sheriff's Sgt. Richard Garcia asked Viens what happened on Oct. 18, 2009, the night his wife disappeared. 'For some reason I just got violent,' said Viens, who has pleaded not guilty to murder. During his sentencing in March of 2012, Viens repeated his innocence and said, 'I loved my wife. I didn't cook my wife.' Viens said that he did not remember making the confessions, including one that took place after he underwent 12 hours of surgery following his plunge, which he said was accidental. The convicted killer also said that his former attorney should have presented more evidence about his medical condition and allowed him to testify. During the trial, those who knew the Vienses testified that their marriage had been in trouble, with Dawn telling one of her friends her husband had choked her and David telling another friend he wanted to 'kill that bitch' because he suspected her of stealing $300 from the restaurant. Following Dawn Viens' disappearance, her husband told people that his wife had left him. In an attempt to conceal the truth, prosecutors said the chef sent fake text messages from his dead wife's phone to her friends. But the victim’s sister was not convinced and filed a missing persons report in November 2009. In February 2011, when Mr Viens learned that he has become a suspect in his wife's disappearance, he attempted to end his life by leaping off a cliff.","Dawn Viens, 39, disappeared in October 2009 after allegedly putting money to one side to leave her husband David Viens .

His stellar career made the beautiful game look like child's play - and that's exactly what David Beckham has been indulging in since he retired. The former England football captain has spoken again about his love of Lego, revealing the children's toy 'calms him down'. He told the Sunday Times Magazine he loved making Lego creations with his children and even bought a £210 model of London's iconic Tower Bridge. Chill out: The former England captain, pictured at the GQ Man of the Year Awards, likes building Lego . Brave: The £210 Tower Bridge kit is not for the faint-hearted, and recommended only for over-16s . 'The last big thing I made was Tower Bridge,' he told the magazine. 'It had about 1,000 pieces. I think Lego sometimes helps to calm me down.' The Tower Bridge model costs £210 and is more than 3ft long, including more than 80 windows, a black taxi to drive across and a drawbridge which opens and closes. But the price was small fry compared to the value of one of the football legend's previous purchases - a Lego Taj Mahal. The 5,900-piece kit is no longer sold by Lego and has become a collector's item, commanding a second-hand price on Amazon of £1,300. One model is on sale for more than £2,900. But despite its value, Beckham never finished building the marble mausoleum. Revealing his love of the toy bricks in 2010, he told a Q&A by search engine Yahoo: 'It's going to make me sound really weird but when I was in Milan I had such a big amount of time on my hands that I found online that there's a Taj Mahal Lego that you can buy.

'I only built some of it because I got injured halfway through... not building the Lego! 'I know it's not a career but I love doing it. My boys are the same - they're obsessed with building Lego.' The former England captain's love of Lego is well-documented - and his career highlights were even immortalised in plastic blocks last year by Japanese filmmakers Mori Pictures.

Robert Chambers, who runs and hosts a Tennessee shopping channel show called The Coin Vault,  is currently battling a treatable form of cancer which he was first diagnosed with in March. Chambers was well enough to take his employees to dinner at the steakhouse’s downtown Nashville branch on Friday, but towards the end of meal he started to feel the cold and so put the beanie hat on his head. Dress code: Cancer patient Robert Chambers was told to remove his hat because it broke Morton's restaurant rules . ‘The chemo I had last gives me a cold sensitivity at the end of the day. It doesn't matter what I've done, there's a certain point.’ Chambers told NashvilleScene.com. ‘So I'm sitting there at the table, freezing and I put my toboggan on. We're two or three minutes away from walking out and the manager comes up behind me and says, “Would you please take that off in the dining room.” I said, “Sure.”’ Chambers was informed that he was in violation of the restaurant's dress code, even though it doesn’t actually say anything about hats and only suggests men wear business attire or smart casual wear. While Chambers quickly obliged with the manager’s request, other members of the party - including his 23-year-old son - tried to explain that their was a perfectly legitimate medical reason for wearing  the hat indoors.

From the High Street to high-end boutiques, cropped tops are everywhere this season. But if you’re over  40 or a mum — or both, like me — I bet you’ve never tried one, and are happily letting this trend pass you by. Big mistake. In my job as a TV presenter on Daybreak, I’ve interviewed stars such as Elton John, Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna. Sitting next to such icons I have to look my best, so I go for fitted dresses and pencil skirts. A midriff-revealing crop-top would be the last thing on my mind when choosing an on-air outfit. At 47, the moment for flashing my tummy has passed. I have two children, Francesca, nine, and Jack, four, and these days my stomach isn’t my best feature. I’d never dream of airing it in public. But when I saw a friend layering a crop-knit over a slinky top, I realised that shrunken styles don’t automatically equal bared belly buttons. You just need some clever styling tricks. It’s revolutionary: the cropped shape tricks the eye, elongating your bottom half, making you look taller, slimmer and drawing attention away from your stomach as the hem falls at the slimmest point of your waist.

A crop top is a modern substitute for a shawl and brilliant for concealing upper arms. I can’t believe this top and dress together cost less than £100! I love the drama of the kimono-style sleeves. The thick fabric of the dress is very forgiving, skimming over the tummy rather than accentuating it. I’m also a fan of nude shoes as they lengthen my legs.

Michael Schumacher is said to be  ‘responding to instructions’ as doctors gradually bring him out of his coma. The seven-time Formula 1 world champion is also reported to have blinked during brain tests. He has undergone a number of neurological exams since Monday and has responded ‘positively’, according to L’Equipe newspaper which cited ‘very reliable sources’. Scroll down for video . Michael Schumacher is being slowly brought out of his induced coma, his manager has said. His wife Corinna insists her husband is a 'fighter' who will not give up . He has been in an induced coma in Grenoble University Hospital since then, although his condition stabilised following surgery after initially being described as critical. After gradually reducing the sedation of the patient, the team of head doctor Emmanuel Gay have been testing his neurological reflexes since Monday. 'During the early stages the patient blinked,' the leading sports newspaper reported. Schumacher suffered serious head . injuries when he fell and hit the right side of his head on a rock in . the French resort of Meribel on December 29. He . has been in an induced coma in Grenoble University Hospital since then, . although his condition stabilized following surgery after initially . being described as critical. 'Michael's . sedation is being reduced in order to allow the start of the waking up . process which may take a long time,' Schumacher's manager, Sabine Kehm, . said in a statement. 'Deeply moved': Schumacher's Rolf Schumacher and brother Ralf arrive at Grenoble Hospital earlier this month. His family have issued a heartfelt thank you to fans around the world for their support . Strain: Corinna Schumacher and their children have been maintaining a constant bedside vigil since his crash . To promote healing the German driver has been kept in a medically induced coma as well as having his body temperature reduced. This is because a traumatic head injury can cause the brain to swell and there is no room for it to expand in the skull, causing tissue damage. The thinking is that if doctors can try to reduce the energy requirements of the brain, this reduces blood flow and pressure, and allows the brain to rest. The anesthetic propofol is commonly used for induced coma - it is not known what doctors have used in Schumacher's case. Weaning the patient out of the medically induced coma means tapering the amount of barbiturates down slowly. It can take a different amount of time depending on the patient and their injuries. A quick withdrawal of this kind of medication could have deadly consequences. A patient will be returned to the medically induced coma if the acute signs such as intracranial pressure or seizure activity resume during the weaning period. Schumacher was being kept artificially sedated and his body temperature . was lowered to between 34 and 35 degrees Celsius (93.2 and 95 degrees . Fahrenheit), to reduce swelling in the brain, reduce its energy . consumption and allow it to rest. Kehm . said she was only providing an update now on Schumacher's condition to . clarify media leaks, and that no further details would be provided. French newspaper l'Equipe first reported on Wednesday that doctors had started trying to wake up Schumacher. Experts . said it was a good sign that Schumacher's doctors were trying to bring . him out of the coma and that the first 24 hours would be critical. 'It . means they have probably seen the pressure in his skull reduced,' said . Dr. Clemens Pahl, a brain trauma expert at King's College Hospital in . London. Pahl warned that if Schumacher hasn't recovered enough to wake up on his own, doctors might need to put him back in the coma. 'It . could be that swelling in his brain hasn't come to an end yet so they . might need to increase the medications again,' he said. Pahl . said that wasn't uncommon in patients with brain injuries and that . sometimes it took several attempts to bring someone out of an induced . coma. Probe: Investigators at the site of Schumacher's crash earlier this month where he smashed his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in Meribel, France . Brain experts . said it will be fundamental to determine whether Schumacher was aware of . his surroundings and could respond to basic commands from doctors, like . raising his hand. 'This . is a test to see what his function is like,' said Dr. Anthony Strong, . an emeritus chair in neurosurgery at King's College London. He said that once the sedatives wear off, Schumacher's doctors would . see if he can breathe on his own and if he responds to mild pain . stimulus, like gentle pressing on his eyebrows. 'Doctors . will want to see if he can say `hello,' if he probe his recollection of . events and to see if he can recognize family members and remember his . own identity,' Strong said. Get well soon! Cologne and Schalke stars hold out a banner wishing Michael Schumacher good health . If . Schumacher doesn't respond to their voice, they will also look to see . if he tries to pull out any of the tubes in him or rip the dressing off . his wounds - which would be a sign that he is aware of where he is. Still, . experts said it would likely be months before Schumacher's prognosis . becomes clear - and that lasting brain damage was a possibility. 'If he pulls through, he may not be the man he was,' said Dr. Tipu Aziz, head of neurosurgery at Oxford University. 'Given the length of time he's been in (intensive care), he has clearly had a very severe head injury,' he said. 'It's too early to know how intact he will be, but I would guess there is going to be some kind of lasting damage.' Schumacher earned universal acclaim for his uncommon and sometimes ruthless driving talent, which led to a record 91 race wins. He retired from Formula One in 2012 after garnering an unmatched seven world titles. His accident happened on a family vacation in the Alps as Schumacher was skiing with his 14-year-old son.","Michael Schumacher is being taken out of artificial coma gradually .

It is a dark, rum-soaked story of maritime villainy that has become part of the rich folklore of Cornwall. But when the BBC wanted to make a new version of Daphne du Maurier’s Jamaica Inn, they chose to film not at the real-life hostelry of the title – which still stands in the heart of Bodmin Moor – but at a dilapidated barn just outside Barnsley. The decision to shift key scenes in the sinister tale of shipwreckers, contraband and forbidden love about 350 miles north has both angered and baffled locals in Dame Daphne’s beloved Cornwall. Inn: Jessica Brown Findlay outside the Yorkshire barn which is standing in for the genuine article in the BBC adaptation of Jamaica Inn, Daphne du Maurier's sinister tale of shipwreckers, contraband and forbidden love . As well as the abandoned West Yorkshire farm buildings standing in for the inn itself, other scenes were filmed in nearby Keighley, while Launceston, the ancient capital of Cornwall, was transposed to Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria. Launceston councillor Jane Nancarrow said: ‘I feel very hurt. We’re very proud down here of Daphne  du Maurier and the Cornwall she immortalised. ‘There is absolutely no doubt in my mind she would have wanted  the TV adaptation to be filmed here. She wouldn’t be resting easy if she knew what was happening.’ The councillor has personal links to the story as she played heroine Mary Yellan in the first stage adaptation of the novel in 1978. She disputed producers’ claims that Cornwall had become too overdeveloped to recreate Dame Daphne’s landscapes. ‘Launceston is an ancient Saxon . hilltop town with a Norman castle  so I don’t understand how that is too . modern,’ she said. ‘We have narrow, cobbled streets and squares. ‘Filming Jamaica Inn in Yorkshire would be like us trying to stage Wuthering Heights. It just wouldn’t be right.’ And out: The historic real-life hostelry of the title, which still stands in the heart of Conrwall's vast Bodmin Moor . The three-part BBC adaptation will air over Easter and stars Jessica Brown Findlay – best known  for playing Lady Sybil in Downton Abbey – as Mary. Dame Daphne’s son Kits Browning, who fiercely guards his mother’s literary legacy, concedes that the author might well have been ‘a little disappointed’ with the decision to film in Yorkshire. ‘The county meant everything to my mother. It was her sanctuary and also her inspiration,’ he said. But he added that he was relieved the production otherwise ‘stayed loyal to the book’, saying: ‘I honestly believe the worldwide audience will be carried away with the story, rather than where it was shot.’ Mr Browning said the decision to base the production in the North had been taken because of a grant – said to be £500,000 – from Screen Yorkshire. ‘Perhaps we ought to ask where Cornwall was when the money was needed,’ he asked. Dame Daphne: Her son son Kits Browning, who fiercely guards his mother¿s literary legacy, concedes that the author might well have been 'a little disappointed' with the decision to film the new mini-series in Yorkshire . Screen Yorkshire’s Sally Joynson said she was ‘incredibly proud’ to have secured production in the county, while producer David Thompson said: ‘We are delighted to be filming in Yorkshire where we are finding wonderful locations.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘Most of the major exterior landscape scenes were filmed in Cornwall. 'Further filming took place in Yorkshire  and Cumbria, which provided excellent crews and a rich variety of locations.’ Dame Daphne died at her home in Fowey, Cornwall, in 1989 at the age of 81.","Abandoned barn outside Barnsley stands in for the titular hostelry .

A firebrand bishop who denied the 'historical truth' of the Bible and defended the rights of Zulus to have two wives will have his controversial views commemorated 200 years after his birth. The private letters of John Colenso, who was the first bishop of Natal in South Africa, will be opened to the public for the first time today at the University of Cambridge. The Rt Revd Mr Colenso, caused a scandal in Victorian England by denying the literal truth of the opening books of the Bible, including Genesis and Exodus. He said that the books, then thought to have been written by Moses, could not possibly be the work of the Biblical figure himself, of anyone with experience of the events it describes. The bishop added that the segment of the Bible - also known as the Pentateuch - 'cannot possibly be regarded as historically true'. His position - a controversial one at the time - led to him being branded a heretic and excommunicated from the Church of England, though he managed to remain a bishop after a series of court rulings. In a published explanation of his theory about the Bible, he wrote: 'I have arrived at the . conclusion that the Pentateuch cannot have been written by Moses, or by . anyone acquainted personally with the facts which it professes to . describe, and, further, that the whole (so-called) Mosaic narrative, by . whomsoever written, cannot possibly be regarded as historically true.' Denier: The Rt Revd Mr Colenso argued that books of the Bible thought to be by Moses, pictured here before the burning bush, could not possibly be by him . He also drew the wrath of the South African colonial authorities for his sympathies with the native Zulu people. The bishop, who wrote the first textbooks on the Zulu language, supported the Africans in some of their struggles against British rule. The Rt Revd Mr Colenso publicly criticised the British for declaring war on the tribe over land in 1879, and also wrote the the Archbishop of Canterbury to complain about their treatment of Zulu converts with multiple wives. The official Church stance was that such . men, many of whom married twice before changing religion, should disown . one wife and any children. It was thought that for Zulus, marriage was . little more than business transaction. Pro-Zulu: Colenso was an outspoken supporter of the Zulu people in South Africa, who wrote the first textbooks for their language, left, and supported their king at the time, pictured right in one of Colenso's books, by saying the British were wrong to declare war on them in 1879 . But Colenso disagreed, insisting that these were stable and loving relationships, comparable with those in the West, and should be allowed to remain. Kathryn McKee, a librarian at St John's College, where the bishop was a student, said: 'Colenso occupied a position of . influence and was deeply controversial, partly because many of his views . were slightly ahead of their time.' The exhibition, called The Missionary College, will run from February 3 until April 17.","John Colenso was the first bishop of Natal in South Africa .

England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has opened a luxury hair salon which focuses solely on haircuts for children. The salon, called Bella and Beau, opened yesterday in Notting Hill in West London. The batsman and his wife, pop star Jessica Pietersen, have spent thousands on their unique vision, with furnishing based around the preferences of their three-year-old son Dylan. Furnishings include a New York-style . taxi, a Harley Davidson, an aeroplane and a giant toy firetruck, all of . which are there for the entertainment of children frequenting the store. A trim for a toddler will cost £25, while an eight year old will be charged £40 for the same service. Children . can have their hair cut sitting in the various toys throughout the . store, like a toy car, as well as being provided an iPad to distract . them while they get the cut. In addition, there is a large fish tank full up with 30 sea horses to calm the young children. The . owners and collaborators in the venture have been very vocal about the . project on Twitter, keen to create a presence in the competitive high . class hair salon market. Jessica Pietersen told the Sun: 'It's an expensive venture, so I hope it works. 'I won't be cutting hair, and definitely not Kevin.' Mitchell Johnson of Australia bowls out Kevin Pietersen of England during day two of the Fourth Ashes Test Match between Australia and England . Kevin Pietersen's cricketing career has hit a snag in recent weeks, with the 5-0 ashes defeat causing the relationship between him and the ex-England coach, Andy Flower, to break down. England officials have stressed that Flower's decision to leave as coach of the Test team was not connected to the breakdown of the relationship with the batting star, but nevertheless, he will have a major say in what happens next in Pietersen's career. For various reasons, Pietersen has played little limited overs cricket for England in the past two years. Kevin Pietersen of England dives to avoid a run out during day one of the Fourth Ashes Test Match between Australia and England at Melbourne Cricket Ground last year . Since playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in February 2012, Pietersen has featured in just nine of a possible 37 ODIs and none of their last 20 T20s, though he was selected against New Zealand at The Oval last summer that was subsequently abandoned. Pietersen's absences have occurred through a mixture of injury, rest and temporary retirement, and though he retains appeal as one of the most destructive batsmen in world cricket, England may feel his troublesome knee may reduce his all-round effectiveness. In addition, insiders maintain the surprise news of Flower's departure means no immediate change to the thinking that Pietersen's days in Test cricket are numbered, no matter who replaces the ex-England coach.","The salon has features picked out by batsman Kevin Pietersen's son .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . and Martin Keown . PUBLISHED: . 19:11 EST, 2 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:27 EST, 3 February 2014 . Monday evening's mouthwatering top-of-the-table clash between Manchester City and Chelsea could go some way to deciding who will win the Premier League. Here Jamie Redknapp and Martin Keown provide analysis on the game and discuss where they think it will be won and lost. How do Chelsea stop the City Juggernaut? Manchester City have been scoring goals for fun so Chelsea will need to be organised and resolute. City will look to attack constantly so the Chelsea defence must keep up their concentration. Prolific: Alvaro Negredo has already scored 24 goals for Manchester City this season . Double trouble . City are one of the few teams to play with two strikers this season — though they did play just one when they last faced Chelsea. Defenders have become used to playing against a lone striker recently, so an old-fashioned double act provides a different challenge. John Terry and Gary Cahill will relish it. Sergio Aguero is missing, so his pace won’t hurt them but they will have a real battle with Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko. City attack from every angle and love to whip crosses in so Terry and Cahill will need to keep their shape, but their duel with Andy Carroll last week will have whet their appetite for a physical encounter. They can be sure of another titanic tussle. Up for the challenge: Gary Cahill and John Terry (left) will relish facing Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko . The last time Jose Mourinho took Chelsea to Manchester City was March 2007. The visitors won 1-0 with a Frank Lampard penalty. City’s team featured Michael Ball, Emile Mpenza and Sun Jihai. City finished 14th, 41 points behind Chelsea. Elano finished the season as City’s top scorer with eight. Defensive screen . City move the ball so quickly and try to get men between the opposition midfield and defensive lines as often as they can. David Silva is a master in that position, so it’s up to Chelsea to make sure they don’t leave gaping holes and that the distance between defence and midfield is not too great. They need to protect their centre backs from the waves of City attacks and it will be up to the deeper midfielders to offer that buffer. Silva service: David Silva is one man Chelsea must close down and not give any space to create chances . Verdict . This has the makings of a classic game but Jose Mourinho has a tactical dilemma on his hands. He was conservative playing away at United and Arsenal but that might not be enough here. If Mourinho gives his side the freedom to go for it, he has the players to cause City all sorts of problems, or he may choose to try and contain them.  But the demolition job City are doing on other teams means the head-to-head encounters are now even more crucial. Chelsea have the players to win it and they can’t rely on other teams to stop City. They have to do the job themselves. Cech is so consistent and I’ve chosen a solid back four — Kompany and Terry pick themselves. The midfield is full of pace and power, though Yaya Toure would play further forward. Silva and Hazard offer more creativity and in the absence of the injured Aguero, I’d have Negredo leading the line. Solid foundations: Vincent Kompany and Petr Cech would be the heart of Martin Keown's mixed team . Who will win the midfield battle? Chelsea and Manchester City . have two of the best midfields in the Premier League, so expect . fireworks. It’s a crucial area of the pitch and whoever dominates the . middle could win the game. Win it on the wing . For Chelsea to have success at the Etihad, they will have to win the battle on the left flank. Duke of Hazard: City's in-form man may be Negredo, but Chelsea's is certainly Eden Hazard . Eden . Hazard is Jose Mourinho’s match-winner and it will be a fascinating . contest between him and Pablo Zabaleta. The Argentine will want . to get forward as often as possible and run Hazard into areas where he . doesn’t want to be. The risk with that is leaving space behind for the . Belgian to race into. Chelsea will likely play on the counter attack and . if they can get the best out of Hazard, then they have a real chance to . win it. Men in the middle . The way City play, Chelsea should have . an extra man in midfield. For 4-4-2 to work, you need two fit and . powerful midfielders and, in Fernandinho and Yaya Toure, City certainly . have that. But if Chelsea get an extra man in there, don’t be surprised . if they try to take the sting out of the game with a deep-lying . midfielder. Mourinho could use Nemanja Matic or David Luiz, as . he did against Manchester United last month, but, whoever he picks, the . tactics of that protective role won’t change. Muscle and finesse: Yaya Toure is the best example of a midfield powerhouse in the Premier League . Tough job: Nemanja Matic may be tasked with trying to stop Toure, Fernandinho and Silva . Verdict . Mourinho . was very critical of West Ham’s defensive tactics last week but I’ve no . problem with sides defending like that away from home. It’s only what . Jose has done at United and Arsenal this season, and he could go the . same way. I’ve played in the middle and if you take command of . that area of the pitch you can frustrate the opposition and the home . fans. Mourinho has his favoured front players who he will want to . win him the game but it will be in the middle of the park where the . platform for victory is built for either side. Hart has come through a difficult period and is back in form, while Zabaleta is a warrior and an easy pick. City’s midfield two are a real force but with Silva further forward there’s plenty of guile, too. Hazard has to play, though I’d have Samir Nasri and Sergio Aguero, too, if they were fit. Important players: Joe Hart and Willian would both feature in Jamie Redknapp's mixed team .","If Man City win they go back to the top of the Premier League .

Rabbi Mendel Tevel, 30, faces extradition from California after he was arrested Tuesday charged with criminal sexual acts. Tevel was a youth worker in Brooklyn, New York City at the time of the four alleged incidences . Tevel is accused of carrying out two of the acts in Brooklyn and two at Machane Menachem, a since-closed Chabad-Lubavitch sleepaway camp in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, where Tevel worked in 2001. He also worked as a mentor at the now-closed Shterns Yeshiva in upstate New York, according to the Jewish Journal. All of the boys are now adults, including one who says Tevel performed oral sex on him several times in his car when Tevel was 22 and the alleged victim was 14, according to the New York Post. The rabbi moved to Los Angeles and had recently been working at the JEM Center, a Jewish youth community center in Beverly Hills. The JEM Center’s director, Rabbi Hertzel Illulian, is Tevel’s father-in-law. Illulian’s daughter, Bracha, married Tevel in 2012, according to the Journal. Handcuffed: Tevel was arrested on Tuesday at the JEM Community Center in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, California, where he was working as a youth worker . ‘No child, no parent, no one has alleged anything against the JEM Center,’ Dana Cole, an attorney for the JEM Center, told reporters in Los Angeles. ‘This involves activities that occurred several years ago in New York City.’ Jewish Community Watch, an organization that focuses on child abuse prevention, said it alerted local rabbis about the allegations against Tevel in August. The Journal had reported that four men said they had been victims of Tevel when they were minors, ranging from ages 6 to 14 at the time of the alleged abuse. They claimed Tevel performed acts that included spanking on bare skin, to sexually suggestive rubbing. One alleged victim, now 25, told the Journal that Tevel’s abuse might have begun at a very early age. The 25-year-old, who did not wish to be named, said when he was 6 or 7 years old, his family lived near Tevel’s family in Brooklyn. Wife: Tevel is married to Bracha, pictured, the daughter of his boss at JEM, Rabbi Hertzel Illulian, director of the centre . In family: Prince Frederic von Anhalt, left, with  Rabbi Hertzel Illulian, who is Tevel's father-in-law and director of the JEM Centre in Beverly Hills. Tevel is accused of sexually abusing four boys . He said Tevel, then 11 or 12 years old, would go to the basement of his home multiple times per week with him, lock the door, tie him down, remove some or all of his clothing, and whip him. ‘I had just a T-shirt on and socks,’ he told the Journal. ‘Of course, pants and any sort of underwear, that was gone.’ The alleged victim, who was raised an observant Jew, said he has since attended therapy for years after that. Another man, 21, said he was about 9 years old and Tevel was about 18, when he was a first-time camper at Machane Menachem. One day, he alleged, Tevel brought him into a sports equipment room. As another person watched the door, the 21-year-old man claimed, Tevel bent him over his lap and smacked him on the rear with a pingpong paddle. He then pulled down his bathing suit and continued smacking him. Tevel will be extradited to New York, according to police.","Menachem Tewel, 30, also known as Mendel .
