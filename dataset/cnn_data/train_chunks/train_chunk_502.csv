It is hard to decide who comes top in the beauty stakes out of these two vibrant winged creatures. Together, they make the perfect tableau - the colourful butterly perching delicately on the head of the pretty ruby-throated hummingbird in Florida, U.S. The larger animal is clearly not too happy with the competition, however. Ahead of the game: Talented photographer Jamie Felton managed to capture the perfect picture when the butterfly landed on the bird's head - before it was shaken off . It repeatedly shakes off the persistent butterfly, and talented photographer Jamie Felton had to be quick to snatch his photos in the moments the smaller creature found its footing. Mr Felton had been watching the territorial hummingbird flying back and forth from its branch all morning, but just as he got the perfect picture, the bothersome insect squeezed into the shot. The 53-year-old nature photographer was visiting a local butterfly aviary with his sister for her birthday. He said the confrontation between bird and insect lasted just seconds but the brave butterfly came back twice to have another try. Quiet time: The hummingbird had been sitting calmly on a branch in Florida, not expecting any interruption . 'We take our cameras everywhere with us, and decided on the butterfly aviary because it offers loads of opportunities for really colourful pictures,' he said. 'I had adjusted my light and shutter speed to try and get the perfect shot of a hummingbird taking off. 'We were there for about 20 minutes, when all of a sudden a small patch of light broke through the foliage and illuminated the bird. 'Just as I was poised to take a picture, a butterfly came flying in and landed on his head. The hummingbird almost instantly shook the butterfly off, but the butterfly immediately came back and tried to land a second time. Pretty little things: The bird is interrupted by an equally beautiful butterfly swooping into his personal space . 'This time the hummingbird lurched backwards to rid himself of the butterfly and then it was over. The whole thing only lasted a few seconds.' 'Even though the action I got was not the action I anticipated. It was better than I could have imagined. I was pretty happy.' Ruby-throated hummingbirds weigh just 3.5 grams (0.1 ounces) and measure just nine centimetres (3.5 inches) long, with a wingspan that could fit in the palm of an adult human hand.","Gorgeous pictures taken by 53-year-old photographer in Florida .

Aspel, 79, who presented the hit BBC1 programme for eight years until being replaced by Bruce in 2008, said he had lost the slot because the corporation wanted a glamorous figure instead of an ‘elderly English bloke plodding around’. Speaking out after Bruce said she dyed her grey hairs because she was worried about the impact ageing would have on her career, Aspel said he felt like the ‘invisible man’ of British television because of a lack of offers of work. He said: ‘Fiona does a great job and looks very beautiful. That’s what they wanted, so it was entirely successful. I just wish I’d been a little more beautiful then I could still be doing it.’ He added: ‘They simply felt that they wanted to get away from the middle-aged to elderly English bloke plodding around and get some glamour in.’ The father of seven, who was once one of the biggest names on British television thanks to hit shows such as Ask Aspel, Come Dancing and Crackerjack, said he struggled to find work. Aspel said: ‘That’s the worst thing about stopping work; you begin to feel invisible whereas you were highly visible before.’ He said he had turned down a request to appear in an early series of Strictly Come Dancing, adding: ‘The prospect of being chucked out on the first show was an ignominy I couldn’t bear.’",Presenter claims he lost his slot on the Antique's Roadshow because the BBC wanted a glamorous figure to front the show .

Relieved: Former Ryanair worker Gemma Phillips cried as she left court where she was spared jail for smuggling cigarettes . An air hostess whose career crash landed after being unmasked as a cigarette smuggler wept as she walked free from court today. Former Ryanair stewardess Gemma Phillips, 26, started the  racket with cabin crew colleague Adam McEvatt so they could sell the cut-price cigarettes on to family and friends for extra cash. But Phillips was intercepted at Liverpool John Lennon Airport from a Canary Islands flight while trying to sneak 7,800 Canary Kingsize cigarettes into the UK hidden in her luggage. McEvatt, 28, was stopped five minutes later and was found to have 6,000 duty free cigarettes. Between them they avoided paying more than £3,500 in tax. The pair were not on duty at the time they were arrested and were only ordered before the court because they worked within the aviation industry. As a result, both have decided to quit their jobs following disciplinary proceedings. Today at Manchester Magistrates' Court, Phillips and McEvatt, both from Liverpool, admitted evading tax duty. They were caught on August 20 after Phillips arrived back in the UK after visiting McEvatt in Gran Canaria where he lives four days a week. At 11.30pm she was stopped whilst in the green channel and was found to have 2,000 Canary Kingsize filter cigarettes in her bag. Another of her bags was recovered from the luggage pick up point and was found to have many more cigarettes inside. Prosecutor Miss Michelle Rhodes said: 'Gemma, due to an accident had been prevented from working at Ryanair for four months and it was a last-minute decision to purchase the cigarettes after she overheard people talking about buying cigarettes. 'She thought it was a good idea to top up her money and withdrew the cash. It was her intention to sell the cigarettes to friends, she knew she had brought in more than she was allowed. 'She had brought in cigarettes on a previous trip to Benidorm five years ago. 'Five minutes later Adam was also intercepted. Adam knew he was carrying far in excess of what he was allowed. 'They had hired a car to transport the cigarettes and packed them in their suitcases with each other present with the intention to sell to their friends and family. Conspirators: Phillips (left) and co-worker Adam McEvatt (right) admitted smuggling 13,800 cigarettes through customs at Liverpool John Lennon Airport . 'Clearly this was a joint enterprise, Gemma bought the cigarettes with her own money and they were both going to supply cigarettes together with the intention to sell to family and friends. 'They both have no previous convictions, both are cabin crew workers and worked for Ryan Air and would have had full knowledge of allowance. It was a breach of their position of trust.' The court heard the approximate duty avoided in total by the pair was £3,500.26. Phillips and McEvatt were each given a two year conditional discharge and were each ordered to pay £85 costs. Brian Jackson, defending McEvatt, said: 'This was not a situation of breach of trust. At no stage did Adam report at the airport to be a member of Ryanair and he came through the normal channels. 'He was not trying to get around any security measures. Had they been civilians when they went through the airport they would have been dealt with by way of warning. 'As a result of the prosecution, they have had significant punishment which is the loss of their employment. Adam has made a stupid mistake and is now paying for it having been punished already with the loss of his job.' Punishment: Both quit their jobs with Ryanair because they breached trust that comes with their air stewarding roles . For Phillips, Mr Hayward said: 'She has suffered with the loss of employment and she was summoned to Ireland for disciplinary action and has suffered from that. 'She is deeply ashamed of what she has done. All that she has known was the airline industry and from the age of 18 she worked hard to progress and all this has gone. 'She will not be able to work in the airline industry again and it is a source of deep regret. 'She is full of remorse of what happened and if she could would turn the clock back. Had they not been employed by the airline they would not have been prosecuted.' District Judge Jonathan Taaffe told them: 'You have both lost a lot as a result of these actions - but are people who should be valued by any future employers. 'I am prepared to accept this was an isolated act. On your part it was an attempt to nearly raise funds on your own behalf. 'Nevertheless it is a serious matter, it is not a victimless crime, people who avoid revenue payment make the rest of us suffer.' Duty laws introduced last year restrict European holidaymakers to 800 cigarettes and one kilogram of rolling tobacco per person. A spokesman for Border Force, the enforcement arm of the UK Border Agency said: 'Tobacco smuggling is serious and increases the tax burden on everyone else. Revenue from cigarettes and tobacco helps fund public services. 'Tobacco smugglers are tracked by Border Force and HMRC, and repeat offenders will be prosecuted.'","Gemma Phillips stopped at John Lennon Airport .

A diabetic businessman had to have part of his leg amputated after being told a serious infection was athlete's foot. Bob Wareham, 54, had to wait for more than a week to see specialists after the initial consultation mistook the diabetic foot infection for athlete's foot - a mistake which cost him part of his right leg. Mr Wareham, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, has now won a pay out of £750,000 following a three-year legal battle which ended in an out-of-court settlement. Misdiagnosis: Diabetic businessman Bob Wareham was told he had athlete's foot when he visited medics with a serious infection . His ordeal began when he suffered a foot infection in August 2008. He was prescribed antibiotics for athlete's foot by an out-of-hours GP service based next to Weston General Hospital, but was forced to return to the A&E department two days later. It was during this visit when he discovered he in fact had the diabetic foot infection. But he was still not immediately admitted or referred - an absolute necessity, according to National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines. The problem continued to worsen and Mr Wareham went back to the hospital three days later, when he was admitted but had to wait three more days before being seen by a multi-disciplinary specialist team. But by then it was too late and devastated Mr Wareham had to have part of his right leg amputated at Bristol Royal Infirmary, leaving him with about six inches of leg below the right knee. He said: 'I am faced for the rest of my life with the situation where I have to cope with an amputation through no fault of my own. 'The payout is at the top end of £750,000. Emergency: Mr Wareham had to visit the A&E department at Weston General Hospital two days after the original misdiagnosis . 'But I am a businessman and my time in hospital cost me all my businesses, so there is an element of compensation for that. 'It also has to pay for my future care.' Mr Wareham launched a three-and-a-half year legal battle through his solicitors before the case was settled out-of-court in June. He said: 'With a diabetic person's infection, time is the ultimate factor. 'It has happened now and at least they have been brought to account. 'But, having said that, that's not going to bring my leg back.' Solicitor Justin Goodman said: 'Mr Wareham was awarded a substantial payout as a result of clinical negligence by the out-of-hours general practitioner and the accident and emergency department of Weston General Hospital. 'On every occasion Mr Wareham attended . the out-of-hours GP and the accident and emergency department of Weston . General Hospital, he should have been referred for surgical opinion by . an appropriately experienced surgeon who deals with diabetic foot . infections. 'Had he been referred, he would not have undergone an amputation.' Mr Wareham added: 'It's been a very long and stressful three-and-a-half years to get justice for my mistreatment. 'I can only hope that lessons will be learned from the failures and new or revised procedures will be introduced to avoid a repeat of the mistakes and errors, which led to my unnecessary amputation.'

The BBC’s controversial creative director Alan Yentob has been removed from the corporation’s management board. Mr Yentob, who also works as a presenter for the broadcaster, is among a host of executives who have been taken off the group which is charged with directly managing the BBC. It is part of new director general George Entwistle’s attempts to streamline the BBC and make it more efficient. Changes at the top: Imagine presenter and senior BBC executive Alan Yentob, who has been dropped from the corporation's management board . He has replaced the former BBC Direction Group, which had 22 executives on it to just a dozen top bosses on its new ‘management board’, which will ensure the ‘effective running of the whole organisation’. This means Mr Yentob will lose his seat the at inner-circle of decision making at the BBC. While he will still report directly to the director general he will be told to focus on his main job of maintaining creativity in the broadcaster’s output. Other executives, who have been taken off the board include the head of its in-house production arm Pat Younge, as well as its strategy chief and its chief technology officer. Alan Yentob, whose total pay last year was £183,000, is described as ‘the focal point for talent management across the whole of the BBC’.  He also has responsibility for its film division and chairs the board of BBC Films. Mr Yentob, who joined the BBC in 1968 and is one of its most high profile executives, is also paid separately for his work as a presenter on BBC1’s arts series Imagine. In his first speech to staff last week Mr Entwistle explained the change. He said: ‘This morning I held the first meeting of the BBC’s new Management Board. ‘This smaller team, replacing BBC Direction Group and reduced in number from around 25 to just 12 people, will be responsible for the effective running of the whole organisation. ‘I’ve asked everyone on the board to ensure they work in the interests of the broader BBC in all the decisions they take.’ The newly created management board is responsible for ‘managing pan-BBC issues’ which are delegated to it from the corporation’s executive board. It meets three times a month. Mr Entwistle is determined to tackle inefficiency and waste at the broadcaster and make sure as much money as possible is spent on programming. As part of this he is expected to push even harder to cut the number of senior managers at the organisation. In 2010 Mr Yentob came close to leaving his executive role at the BBC as bosses looked at axing his post of creative director as part of a cull on executive pay, which also saw the deputy director general role removed - but he stayed. Cost cutter: New director general George Entwistle is attempting to streamline the broadcaster and make it more efficient as it tries to deal with a freeze in funding . In the past the BBC’s creative director has attracted criticism for his expenses claims. On one occasion he sparked controversy when he claimed he would not be able to work properly without flying business class at licence fee payers’ expense. He had justified a £3,381 return trip to New York in business class by saying that without it, he ‘wouldn’t have been capable of doing the job’. Mr Yentob has over the years been seen as a poster boy for the highly paid executive culture at the corporation. A BBC spokesman said: ‘George Entwistle has created a radically simplified management team specifically designed to ensure it can take decisions quickly and efficiently. Its focus is threefold, the creative output of the BBC, its staff and its finances.’ ‘The individuals on the management board are divisional leaders with direct managerial and fiscal responsibilities. ‘As Creative Director of the BBC, Alan’s role does not encompass these duties which is why he is not on the new board. He will, however, continue to report directly to the Director-General and will play a key role in exploring new ways of developing high quality creative content across the BBC.’",BBC's creative director falls victim to efforts to streamline the broadcaster's top management .

A judge has condemned a former soldier for his 'frenzied revenge attack' after he stabbed the mother of his four-year-old son to death in front of him after he found out she had secretly aborted their unborn baby. Lance Corporal Ian Lowe, 25, was jailed for life today after he knifed 24-year old Leanne McNuff in front of their four year old son after he unexpectedly learned of the termination when he hacked into her page on Facebook. Relatives of Leanne wept in the public . gallery as the judge Mr Justice Alistair MacDuff told Lowe: 'Yours was a frenzied revenge attack . and cold blooded murder. You robbed her of her young life and your son . of his mother. The anguish you have caused is beyond words.' Jailed: Lance Corporal Ian Lowe, 25, left, was jailed . for life today after he knifed 24-year old Leanne McNuff, right, in front of . their four year old son after he unexpectedly learned of the termination . The soldier, who had just been . dumped by Leanne, posted messages on his own Facebook page saying: 'My . life is in absolute s*** state and I got no f***** to help me. 'Not even the army will help me out . after all I have done for Queen and country. Need a weapon out of . armoury to shoot the b****'. He then kicked in the door at the home . of call centre worker Leanne and repeatedly stabbed her in the upper . body and stamped on her face as their son Jaden looked on in horror. When family who lived next door raced . to the scene, they found Lowe had already fled, leaving Leanne dying on . the landing floor. Jaden was found on the landing holding his teddy bear . screaming: 'Daddy's killed mummy and she is all red.' Devastated: Leanne's mother Margaret McNuff told police Jaden is very confused and sometimes thinks his mother is in hospital . The judge added: 'She was in . the sanctuary of her own home when you committed this wicked act in the . presence of your four year old son. 'The fear and pain she must have felt . in her dying minutes is unimaginable. You are evil and dangerous. You . went round there to get even with her - blaming her as you had done on . so many previous occasions for the mess you had got yourself into.' Leanne suffered 22 separate wounds to her body and she died in hospital. Her mother Margaret McNuff later told police: 'Jaden is very confused - he will say his mum is in hospital getting better one day and then the next will say that she's in the sky with the angels.' Today at Manchester Crown Court Lowe, who served in Afghanistan, showed no emotion as he was found guilty of murder and was ordered to serve a minimum 28 years. The jury was told the couple had originally began dating in 2006 and Jaden was born the following year but they split up last February after a series of rows. Lowe, nicknamed 'Boom Boom', warned Leanne he would 'make her life hell,' and in text messages Leanne replied: ' I clearly mean nothing to you. There's only do much hurt I can take.' In 2010 Miss McNuff made a complaint to the army that Lowe had threatened to 'get a hitman to kill her over Child Support Agency payments'. On Valentine's Day Leanne then . discovered she was pregnant with Lowe's baby and rang him at his . barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire where he was serving in the 1st . Battalion, the Duke of Lancaster Regiment and due to go on a tour of . Afghanistan. 'She made it . clear that although she didn't want to resume a relationship with him . she would not prevent him from seeing either Jaden or the baby when it . was born,' said Neil Flewitt QC prosecuting. 'The . defendant responded saying if they could not live together as a family . his life wouldn't be worth living and he would commit suicide.' Lowe . was allowed home from base on compassionate grounds and once back in . Manchester begged Leanne to take him back. She agreed but said she . 'wouldn't kiss or cuddle him' because she 'no longer had feelings for . him.' During a meeting about . Jaden and the pregnancy at Leanne's house on February 18, a violent row . broke out when Lowe started telling Jaden that Leanne was a . 'prostitute' and accused her of 'sleeping around.' As . she tried to push him out of the house in Droylsden, Greater . Manchester, Lowe grabbed Leanne by the throat and began 'shaking her . from side to side.' Sentence: Lowe, Leanne and their baby son. Lowe, who . served in Afghanistan, showed no emotion as he was found guilty of . murder and was ordered to serve a minimum 28 years in court today . In a statement given to police at the time, Leanne recalled: 'He's shaking me from side to side and I'm almost on the floor. 'I've . lost my footing but being held up by Ian gripping my clothing and he's . shaking me about. Somehow, whilst he's still ragging me about, I've . twisted and he's got hold of my hair. 'Now he's got a grip of my clothing and a grip of my hair and he's still shaking me about. 'At . some point he's let go of my jumper and his left arm has come around my . throat choking me and making it hard to breath for a few seconds. I was . frightened to death. 'I . didn't know what was going to happen. I was scared wither he'd really . hurt me or I'd lose the baby. I was scared for Jaden's safety. 'Then . Ian's released me and pushed me to the floor. He's gone to kick me. At . first I think he was going to kick me hard but he held back and it . wasn't a very hard kick in my back. Then he's picked up his bag and ran . out of the gate'. Crime scene: Floral tributes and police officers outside the house in Droylsden, Manchester after the attack. Lowe found out about Leanne's termination after hacking into her Facebook account . Lowe was later arrested and charged with assault and was ordered not to contact Leanne as part of his bail conditions. But literally an hour after he was charged, a frightened Leanne ran police again claiming Lowe had telephoned her. The following day on February 20, Leanne secretly went to an abortion clinic for a consultation with a nurse said her relationship with Lowe was definitely over and she secretly had a termination on March 1. In the week before the killing on March 11, Lowe confided to his army superiors and the chaplain about his unhappiness at Leanne having a baby and his fears of being thrown out of the army over the assault allegation. He eventually found out about the termination on March 10 when he hacked into Leanne's Facebook account and then wrote: 'Yet again she does it again, we split and she stops me and my family seeing Jaden. She tries to ruin my career, not only are you a benefit thief you are an oxygen thief as well'. At 4.30pm. on the day of Leanne's death Ian wrote, 'Just to let everyone know Leanne had aborted the baby. She did not tell me or even given me a say in the matter'. He then hacked her Facebook account falsely claiming she had slept with members of her own family and that is how he found out she had had the abortion because she had messaged it to one of her friends. As he prepared to go back to camp Lowe went for a drink with his father and a family friend who said he 'looked as if he had the weight of the world on his shoulders.' That night Leanne's mother Margaret McNuff and Margaret's son Ryan who lived next door, heard 'banging noises' coming from the victim's house. Ryan ran next door to see the front door had been kicked off its hinges and saw Lowe walking quietly away. Margaret told the hearing: 'Jaden was stood there with a brown teddy bear and said: 'Nana can you help mummy.' Leanne was on her back. 'Her eyes were piercing wide open. I took Jaden down to get him away because I wasn't sure whether she was alive. Then I ran back up and just started CPR on her.' She added: 'Leanne said she really wanted the child but she was scared for her own life and he'd never stay away from her if she had another baby. I am angry that Ian has taken her life. She was tiny - she could not have fought back. It was very brutal.' The court heard Lowe had previously been convicted of assaulting his own mother Lorraine by throwing her against a car during an argument over Leanne. He denied murder but admitted manslaughter claiming he had 'lost self control' and saying of Leanne and Jaden: 'They were my life'.","Judge jailed Ian Lowe for 28 years for stabbing the mother of his son to death in front of him .

A father-of-12 has been branded . ‘Britain’s most badly-behaved dad’ after he was arrested on suspicion of . assault - just 20 minutes before he was due to appear in court over an . Asbo. Stuart Murgatroyd was led away in . handcuffs from Burnley Magistrates Court before he had a chance to . challenge the order laid against him. The 41-year-old had become the fifth . member of his clan to get an anti social behaviour order after . terrorising neighbours in two council boroughs. Arrested: Stuart Murgatroyd outside the court, left. He is the fifth member of his family to get an Asbo . However when he went to the court to . ‘vehemently deny’ any wrongdoing he was arrested after allegedly having a . bust-up with the mother of his children before the case had even begun. Police were called to the court, in . Burnley, Lancashire, after 40-year old Dawn Hughes - the mother of Murgatroyd's 12 children and one other from a previous relationship . - was left in tears. The case was later adjourned after prosecution lawyers informed JPs unemployed Murgatroyd was in police cells. Lancashire Police confirmed . Murgatroyd had been held on suspicion of common assault. His Asbo . hearing will now be held on October 16. Murgatroyd has a criminal record for robbing elderly people and once had to be sprayed with CS gas by police in a row over his son’s football. Despite only being 13 years old, . Murgatroyd’s twin boys - Reece and Dillon - already have two-year Asbos . ordering them not to cause ‘harassment, alarm or distress’. The pair are now banned from . ‘maliciously throwing’ things at people, vehicles or buildings and from . swearing or using offensive hand gestures. Council officials had earlier kicked . the family out of one of their previous homes, in Padiham after 125 . complaints from neighbours who had endured three years of loud parties, . fighting and drunken behaviour. Murgatroyd has been claiming sickness benefit for depression since he was 17. 'Bust-up': Murgatroyd with his long-term partner Dawn Hughes, shortly before the Asbo court hearing . In April 1999 he was jailed for two-and-a-half years for mugging three pensioners and stealing a handbag from a woman of 78 in a cemetery. In August 2004 he suffered head injuries when he was attacked by a neighbour armed with a 2ft-long machete amid claims a text message had been sent threatening to firebomb the home of the attacker’s mother. Then in 2007 Murgatroyd sparked a police siege after a row over a neighbour confiscating his children’s football. He was said to have lost his temper and hurled cutlery and a vacuum cleaner towards officers before being overpowered with CS gas. Murgatroyd had previously been issued . with an Asbo but after it expired last November the couple and eight of . their children moved into a £150-a-week rented three-bed terrace house . in Nelson hoping to make a ‘fresh start’. However, he was given an interim Asbo . and warned he must not be in possession of any open container of . alcohol or be drunk in a public place with the Burnley Borough and . Pendle Council areas. Speaking about the Asbo, Inspector . Andy Cartwright, of Pendle Police, said: ‘This action has been taken as a . result of repeated complaints from members of the public. ‘Asbos are designed to put . restrictions on a person so that they can assess the way they behave and . hopefully make a few changes for the better. ‘We are not Britain's worst family. . . We’re the victims' Dawn Hughes, Stuart Murgatroyd's partner . ‘We hope these orders will provide a . more long term solution by putting certain boundaries in place whilst . agencies continue to support them in the family home.’ In an interview before the court . appearance Murgatroyd and Hughes claimed police and council officials . should do more to help them. Hughes said: ‘I think we are being . targeted by the police and everybody is just lying about everything. They are dredging up past history. ‘It is only the twins who have got Asbos anyway and they now want Stuart to have one to set an example to the kids. ‘The boys had been throwing stones but they’re identical so how do they know which one it was. They were just being lads. 'They were hanging around with older . boys at the time and there was a big group of them. There was about 20 . of them so who knows who was doing what. It’s just typical boyish . behaviour. ‘We did have the police coming to the house four times a day and they haven’t been once seen we’ve been here. ‘Moving here was meant to be a clean break, a fresh start for us and the kids and someone has just nipped that in the bud. ‘We are not Britain’s worst family, far from it - this house is immaculate. We’re the victims.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Stuart Murgatroyd led away from court in handcuffs before he has a chance to 'vehemently deny' any wrongdoing .

A burly gym teacher is claiming a puny six-year-old student beat him up and caused him debilitating personal injury. John Webster, a physical education teacher at P.S. 330 in Elmhurst, Queens, plans to sue New York City's Department of Education for failing to protect the 27-year-old against the pint-sized youngster - his lawyer dubbed 'a tiny terror.' The teacher says a scuffle with Rodrigo Carpio, then 50 lbs, on April 26 has left him with an injured meniscus in his right knee and ligament damage to his right ankle. Tough guy: Rodrigo Carpio, aged six, allegedly beat up his PE teacher John Webster (right), leaving the 27-year-old with debilitating injuries and unable to return to work . Webster has been unable to work since the incident and is out on medical leave. His lawyer, Andrew Siben of Bay Shore, Long Island, told the MailOnline that the teacher is seeking compensation for his medical expenses in addition to damages, which Siben would not specify. The teacher, who had taught at the Queens public school for two years, claims the school was aware of the 'student's propensity to be explosive ... when he acted like a tiny terror' but they failed to adequately intercede. Siben said his client has indicated the boy had an 'extensive history of being combative and had assaulted other students and teachers before him.' The lawsuit, which is expected to be filed soon in Queens, revolved around an incident on April 26 - when Webster, a former football player at Morrisville State College, says cops had to be called to quell an outburst that broke out. It started when he was chaperoning Carpio and a group of students to the school cafeteria and the boy began horsing around. When the student wouldn't calm down, the teacher tried to restrain him but the boy fought back, biting and kicking his teacher, Webster claims. According to a school incident report, the child also kicked and punched the principal and the school safety officer. Officers from the New York Police Department were called but they did not take action, according to  the New York Post. Damages: John Webster is suing NYC's Department of Education for injuries he endured when a six-year-old student allegedly beat him up at P.S. 330 in Elmhurst, Queens (pictured) '[Rodrigo] looks like an angel, but then, . all of a sudden, that halo turns into horns. It’s been a nightmare. It’s embarrassing. It’s humiliating,' Webster told the Post. The school urged the boy's parents, Jorge Carpio and Josefa Marcia da Silva, to seek medical care but they reportedly would not allow the child to be hospitalized. The teacher's attorney said it appears the boy suffers from some sort of behavioral disorder and according to his parents, he is now taking medication to calm his behavior. 'The lawsuit is totally absurd. How could my little boy do so much damage? My poor son,' Carpio's protective father, Jorge, told the Post.","John Webster says the six-year-old student had a history of violence, which the school overlooked .

A father has spoken of the moment he saw his two-year-old son have two fingers chopped off in a horrific accident on a store escalator. He was holding his son's hand while standing on the travelator in Ikea in Milton Keynes, Bucks, when the toddler lost his balance on the down slope. As he fell, the boy put his hand down and it became trapped between the skirting and pallets treads, which acted as a guillotine. Tragic: Both fingers were amputated about halfway down after the accident in the store in Milton Keynes, Bucks . The gap was bigger than the legal limit of four millimetres. As the child cried out in pain his father saw that the index and middle fingers of his son’s left hand had been sliced off. The boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was rushed to hospital and underwent emergency surgery. Both fingers were amputated about halfway down after the accident on March 31, 2007. Injured: As he fell on the travelator (pictured) his hand became trapped between the skirting and pallets treads, which acted as a guillotine . In a statement read out to the court, . the boy’s father said: 'He held my two fingers and stood on the left . side of me. He had his left hand on the rail and we stood on the . travelator together. 'I felt a tug on my fingers and he had twisted and fallen and put his left hand on the travelator. 'I . bent down to pick him up but stumbled forward. I picked him up straight . away but noticed his index and middle fingers were missing. 'I ran down to the bottom with him and called for help.' Judge Joanna Cutts fined the company £75,000 pounds and ordered it to pay £90,000 pounds in prosecution costs. It . had accepted liability at previous civil proceedings brought on behalf . of the boy, now aged seven years, and is paying compensation. A final figure has yet to be agreed, depending on the boy’s future prognosis. Prosecutor Barry Berlin told Judge Cutts: 'The boy was nearly three when he visited the store with his family. 'He was holding onto his father’s fingers when he fell and trapped his fingers in the travelator. Medical treatment: The boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was rushed to hospital and underwent emergency surgery . 'It was at the point of transition when the travelator goes from horizontal to downward angle when he fell and caught his fingers underneath the skirting. 'He sliced off two fingers on his left hand - the index and middle fingers. 'At the point of transition the gap was above four millimetres.The child was able to put his fingers in the gap. 'Four millimetres is the limit for this kind of travelator. The onus is on the employer, IKEA, to ensure it does not exceed four millimetres.' The flat pack specialists admitted a . charge of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 after earlier . pleading not guilty. IKEA . had disputed full liability for the accident after maintenance . specialists Lift Serve conducted tests on the travelators two days . before the incident, stating the gap between the skirting and tread had . been safe. Carol Reddish, Chief Executive Officer for IKEA in the UK, attended Aylesbury Crown Court on Friday for the sentencing hearing. Mr Berlin said the store had failed to compile a risk assessment of the travelators and checked that maintenance had been carried out properly by the external firm. Mr Berlin said: 'We accept that this was a localised problem in this store. 'Nonetheless this is IKEA and there was not a risk assessment of the travelators and that is a mandatory requirement. 'The skirting itself was very sharp, hence the severing. That could and should have been engineered out to reduce the risk to people. 'This accident resulted in serious and permanent disability to the boy, a vulnerable victim.' Defending counsel Simon Antrobus said the company regretted the incident but added that the civil proceedings had found Lift Serve to be 75 per cent liable and IKEA 25 per cent. 'IKEA has put in place everything it can to ensure the highest degree of safety for customers and staff. 'This particular incident was extremely regrettable, made worse by the fact that it involves a very young child.' In sentencing the multi-national business, Judge Cutts said: 'There is no doubt in my mind that IKEA, in this store and on this particular travelator, exposed children to severe and permanent disability. 'IKEA had an indelible duty to ensure the safety of all customers in the store and failed in its duty here.'","The toddler was holding his father’s hand on the travelator when he lost his balance on the down slope .

A six-year-old boy with a fear of . loud noises 'died' for more than half an hour after a 'petrifying' thunderstorm triggered a heart attack. Callum Bryan had just been picked up . from school when his heart suddenly stopped as he was sitting his . mother's car, leaving him 'dead' for 33 minutes. His lips and face even started turning purple as his body was deprived of oxygen. Doctors believe the attack was caused by a sudden adrenaline rush brought on by fear of the noise of the thunder and hail. Callum Bryan, 6, was 'dead' for 33 minutes after suffering a heart attack, but is now making a good recovery . His mother performed life-saving CPR before he was taken to hospital. He was put into a medically induced coma to help his body recover, and for a while doctors feared he may have been permanently brain-damaged. He is now home, but needs round-the-clock supervision in case he suffers a similar episode. Medics have compared his near-death experience to that of Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba, who collapsed on the pitch during an FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham in March. Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest and his heart stopped beating naturally for 78 minutes. Callum's mother Jayne, 41, from Great Barr, Birmingham, said the youngster had been in good health but had always been afraid of loud noises and was 'petrified' on May 15, when she picked him up from Greenholm Primary School in Great Barr, during a thunderstorm. The mother-of-three said: 'He's always been quite scared of anything loud. At family weddings we have to give him ear plugs and he hates anything like drilling or even rain coming down on the conservatory roof. 'That day I picked him up, he was absolutely petrified. There was hail, lightning and thunder, so I ran across the playground to get him into the car as quick as I could. 'But when we got there, he was absolutely . panicked. He kept saying, ""where's my seat?"", because I had moved it to . the front of the car. 'I dashed to get it and when I . got to the back of the car again, he was slumped over. 'In my mind, I . thought he was just messing about and I was getting quite annoyed with . him. I just picked him up to put him in the seat, but my . daughter Nicole screamed, ""No mum, he's ill"". 'I looked at him and could see he wasn't . breathing and was turning blue.' Slow recovery: Callum was in an induced coma, before slowly getting back to normal following his heart attack . Thanks sis: Callum pictured with his older sister Nicole, 18, who helped perform CPR on the youngster . Mrs Bryan, who is a trained lifeguard, began cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from the back of her Citroen C4 car, while her 18-year-old daughter called 999. 'It . had been years since I had done any CPR training but it all came . flooding back to me,' said Mrs Bryan, who is married to maintenance engineer . Andy, 40. 'The staff in the ambulance control room were amazing, . talking me through every step. But Callum’s lips and face started to . turn purple and I became hysterical.' Mrs Bryan recalled how the 15 minutes passing between calling the ambulance and Callum arriving at hospital ""felt like hours"". She said at one point, daughter Nicole, who had no first aid training, had to take over the CPR with control room staff directing her what to do. She added: 'Alot of people have said to me they wouldn't have been able to do what I did, but I just went into auto-pilot. I knew he needed me.' Callum was whisked to Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where staff continued to battle to save his life. 'I . was in a side room with a nurse who was trying to calm me down, but I . was in bits, I kept asking if he was going to die,' added Mrs Bryan. 'I was . convinced I was going to lose him, but then they managed to start his . heart beating again. I was told his heart had stopped beating for 33 minutes, I couldn’t believe it.' Cardiac arrhythmias, or disruptions to the heart working properly, are a common cause of this syndrome. Sometimes there are no warning signs, but in other cases people can experience dizziness, fainting or fainting spells. Sudden loss of consciousness or death often occurs during physical exercise or emotional upset. Research has indicated that about 500 deaths a . year in the UK are because of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, but it is very rare in children. Inheritance may be a factor. The . family was told the devastating news that Callum would have to be . induced into a coma as his body had suffered such a horrific ordeal. 'They . said he may never come out of the coma, or even if he did there was a . good chance he could have suffered serious brain damage,' said Mrs Bryan. 'I was absolutely distraught, but when . they told me he could be brain damaged I thought, I'll accept that - as . long as he pulls through that's all that matters.' A . day later doctors stopped the medication to bring Callum out of the . coma - leaving his parents in an agonising waiting game to see if he . would wake up. 'I sat next to him holding his hand and talking to him . softly, telling him it was time to wake up now as he had been asleep . for too long,' added Mrs Bryan . 'I said ""come on sleepy head... if you wake up we can all go to Disneyland"".' The mention of Mickey Mouse seemed to do the trick and Callum slowly opened his eyes. 'When . he squeezed my hand I broke down in tears,' she added. 'We were asking . him questions and he would blink responses. Everyone was amazed that he . was alert and seemed to understand what was going on.' However, . after becoming violently sick and struggling to breathe on his own due . to fluid on his lungs, staff put the youngster back into a coma in a bid . to give his body a rest from the trauma. 'It was the longest five . days of my life,' said Mrs Bryan. 'But even though he was so ill, had an . overwhelming feeling he would be alright.' Mrs Bryan said her husband Andy, 'went to pieces' during their son's hospital stay, while older brother Kurtis, 15, could not bare to return to the family home where he shared a bedroom with Callum and instead stayed with his grandparents. Six days after the . heart attack, Callum was once again brought out of his drug-induced coma . - and the family were at last 'overjoyed' to hear him speak his first words. Mrs Bryan said: 'He whispered that he wanted to go home,' she said. 'Those were the best words I have ever heard.' Medics have compared Callum's experience to that of Bolton footballer Fabrice Muamba, who collapsed on the pitch during a game against Tottenham in March . Back home at last: Callum was all smiles when he finally left hospital and returned home with his mother Jayne . Callum . spent a total 17 days in hospital. Each of his classmates sent him a get well card and picture, and his teachers visited him on the ward. Mrs Bryan said his recovery has been a 'miracle', but tests have so far failed to show why . Callum, who regularly plays football and swims, would have suffered a . heart attack. His consultant, Dr Vinay Bhole, at Birmingham Children's Hospital, believes he may have cheated the condition, . Sudden Death Syndrome. He also believes that Callum became so distressed by the loud thunderstorm, that his body was overwhelmed by a huge rush of adrenaline, and this may have triggered the attack. Callum is now due to return to hospital on Friday, after doctors ""spotted something of interest"" on his MRI scan. Mrs Bryan added that no-one else in the family had suffered a similar event, but after Callum's heart attack, she discovered that her uncle had also suffered heart attacks as a child. Brian Gibbs, who also lives in Great Barr, is now well and aged 71. Now back at home, Mrs Bryan has been  forced to quit her . part-time job as a receptionist to home school Callum as medics have . told her he must be with someone with CPR training around-the-clock. The family have now set up a charity, Callum’s . Cardiac Fund, urging people to donate unwanted mobile phones in a bid to raise £2,000 to fund a potentially life-saving defibrillator at his school. They also want to raise funds to fund equipment at Birmingham Children’s Hospital.","Callum Bryan's heart stopped due to adrenaline rush caused by fear .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 05:54 EST, 19 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:02 EST, 19 July 2012 . Michelle Fernando, just five days before she died from pneumonia and septicaemia . A two-year-old girl died just 22 hours after doctors sent her home from hospital with ibuprofen, an inquest heard. Michelle Fernando began displaying flu-like symptoms one week after her mother Uthpala, 27, fell ill swine flu. Her concerned father Rashid, 30, took her to Bristol Children’s Hospital but doctors sent her home with the painkiller and advised her parents to give her plenty of water. Michelle suddenly stopped breathing the following day and she was rushed back to hospital by ambulance but pronounced dead on arrival. Traces of the deadly swine flu virus were found in her nose and throat but a pathologist ruled that she died of pneumonia and septicaemia. The inquest at Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court, near Bristol, heard how doctors examined the toddler but sent her home after diagnosing a viral infection on November 17, 2009. But the next night she started having difficulty breathing. When her parents dialled 999, they were told the problems did not sound life-threatening, and an ambulance would arrive in up to 20 minutes. But moments later Michelle stopped breathing and they called 999 again - and the ambulance arrived minutes later. Michelle was rushed to hospital but pronounced dead on arrival. Avon coroner Maria Voisin heard a post-mortem examination found the medical cause of death was pneumonia and septicaemia. Traces of swine flu, otherwise known as the H1N1virus, were found in Michelle’s nose and throat. An investigation was launched straight after the toddler’s unexpected death, with the hospital trust carrying out a child death review. Dr Thomas Allport, who practices at Bristol Children’s Hospital and specialises in paediatrics, chaired the review. He told the coroner that it was possible the pneumonia was already established in Michelle’s body when she was first examined at the hospital. However, he said she had had a 'very reassuring respiratory examination that pointed away from pneumonia' before she was sent home. Grieving: Uthpala Fernando with her son Marlon. Daughter Michelle died in 2009 . Dr Allport also said it was 'very unlikely' septicaemia was established in her body when doctors saw her. Dr Jon Kim, the doctor who first examined Michelle at the children’s hospital, also gave evidence at the inquest. Ms Voisin heard that the toddler’s respiratory rate and pulse rate had been high when she was admitted - which could have been a sign of pneumonia. But while she was waiting and was given water for her dehydration the rates lowered back to normal. Dr Kim said when he examined the toddler her rates were normal and her parents were more concerned about her diarrhoea and vomiting - not common signs of pneumonia. He was asked by the coroner whether he should have re-taken the toddler’s respiratory rate and pulse rates before she had been discharged. Dr Kim replied that the toddler was correctly managed but re-taking these observations was something that had been implemented at the hospital following the review. Michelle pictured at 18months. Her parents rang for an ambulance when she developed breathing problems a day after being sent home from hospital . Paul Eland, of Great Western Ambulance Service, explained why an ambulance had not been dispatched urgently after Mr and Mrs Fernando’s initial call. He said that this was due to the way operators had been told to handle calls during the swine flu pandemic. Because Michelle was not displaying certain 'priority symptoms' her case was not classed as an emergency. However, he explained that when her parents made a second call, an ambulance was on the scene in four minutes. Michaelle was treated at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children . Mr Eland said since Michelle’s death, and independently of it, the handling of such calls had been reviewed and she would now have been classed as a priority due to her age. Recording a verdict of natural . causes, Ms Voisin said: 'Michelle Fernando attended hospital on November . 17, 2009, presenting as an unwell two-year-old. 'The medical review at the time did not identify her as having a serious illness and so she was discharged. 'On November 18 she died from natural causes.' Mr and Mrs Fernando. originally from Sri Lanka, were unavailable for comment after the inquest. But speaking after their daughter’s death in 2009, the couple said if Michelle hadn’t been sent home she would 'still be alive'. Uthpala, who also has son Marlon, four said: 'Even when my husband explained I had swine flu they didn’t take it seriously. 'She . died within 24 hours of them sending her home from hospital and if they . hadn’t done that she would still be alive. She was a very beautiful, . very active girl. 'I don’t know why they didn’t take it seriously. Maybe it’s because we are from another country, because we are foreigners.'",Michelle's respiratory rate and pulse rate was not taken again before she had been discharged - a procedure now implemented by the hospital .
"By . Graham Smith . PUBLISHED: . 07:17 EST, 11 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:34 EST, 11 September 2012 . A four-year-old boy with cerebral palsy has enjoyed a ride on his bicycle for the first time after his parents raised £45,000 for him to undergo a life-changing operation available only in the U.S. Just weeks ago, Ross Kerr could never have dreamed of playing so energetically as his movement was restricted after a stroke in the womb. In 2010, he was diagnosed with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, which caused motor neuron damage to the left side of his brain affecting his movement. In the saddle: Ross Kerr, pictured with his mother Naomi Miller, was diagnosed with hemiplegic cerebral palsy two years ago. His parents raised £45,000 for him to undergo a life-changing operation available only in the U.S. While temporary treatments to help his walking were available in Britain, his parents Naomi Miller and Ross Kerr hoped an operation only available in the U.S. would change his life. They launched a fund-raising drive in February so Ross Jr could undergo selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to improve his walking and perhaps even enable him to kick a football. After two operations Ross, from Baillieston, Glasgow, is now back home and beginning to enjoy playing like any other child. His mother is still amazed by how far the youngster has come in such a short time. Miss Miller, 22, said: 'Ross pedaled towards me on a bike for the first time - and I knew it had all been worthwhile. 'To see him do what other children take for granted was a special moment. 'There were times when I thought we were never going to make it, but to see Ross today thank goodness we did. 'It has already changed our lives. Ross is now out playing and running about. He is beginning to do new things every day. 'For months we ran car boot sales and bag-packed at supermarkets - it became our whole life.' It took the family five months to reach its target of £45,000. They then headed to St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri. Road to recovery: After two operations Ross, from Baillieston, Glasgow, is now back home and beginning to enjoy playing like any other child . A three-hour operation to help flatten Ross’s right foot was carried out on July 12. Miss Miller said: 'It was an anxious time when Ross was going through the operation. But after more than three hours, Ross was in recovery. 'We were given hourly updates by phone from theatre to tell us how things were going. 'More than three hours later doctors told us everything went OK and Ross was being taken to recovery. 'Then came the hard part of keeping him lying flat for five days. He wasn’t allowed out of bed or to sit up.' On day five, Ross was allowed to sit in a chair and was taken round the hospital garden in a wheelchair. Miss Miller said: 'We were waiting to see when Ross would be allowed to walk. Physios decided it was time for him to stand on the sixth day. 'He got out of his chair and with no support stood up straight and from that day on has gone from strength to strength. 'Doctors decided Ross had to have a second operation to lengthen his heel chord, which cost more than £7,000. It gave him a lot better movement and has helped his progress. 'We were frantically getting relatives to fundraise all over again back home and we made it. 'We were contacted by the Arygle Tavern in Baillieston, whose customers raised £3,000. We could never have done any of this without people’s amazing generosity.' Ross now requires two weeks of intensive physio and has to wear a foot support for several weeks, but after that he shouldn’t need more than regular physio sessions. His mother said: 'If he hadn’t had the operation he would have had a lifetime of splints and botox therapy for his muscles. Now he has a real chance at the future he deserves.'","Ross Kerr was diagnosed with hemiplegic cerebral palsy two years ago .

Not happy: A couple who named their fish and chip shop after their pet dog have been ordered to change the title - or face a million-pound law suit from a major Hollywood studio. John McNeill is pictured outside Scooby Snax . Shock: Mr McNeill and partner Andrea Smith, right, were stunned when lawyers told them they had to stop calling their busy chippie Scooby Snax because it breached copyright rules . Fearing a legal battle that could bankrupt them, the pair will now have to scrap the popular chippie's sign-written name board, uniforms, advertising and even menus and order pads. The award-winning take-away and restaurant in the small riverside town of Brightlingsea, Essex, has been trading for more than eight years as 'Scooby Snax'. It was the fourth shop they had run and they decided to call it Scooby Snax in memory of the family's Lhaso Apso Scooby, which died at the age of two. But the David and Goliath confrontation started when Mr McNeill  began the process of trade-marking the name to protect his business. Heavyweight lawyers acting for Hanna Barbera in the film capital Burbank, Los Angeles swooped ordering the shocked couple to stop trading immediately. 'I was stunned when I opened their letter - I just couldn't believe that a multi-million pound international film company should bullying us like this.' said Mr McNeill, 51. Powerful: The film company Hanna Barbera - who made the children's cartoon Scooby Doo - claim they own all rights to the name. Characters from the cartoon are pictured . 'They said we couldn't use the name or anything that looked like, sounded like or in any way resembled the name. 'I have had to spend £20,000 on changing everything that has the name Scooby on it - we can't even use our menus.' The undertaking Mr McNeill says he was forced to sign included the promise to 'destroy and obliterate any signage, marketing material, leaflets and headed notepaper or any other materials carrying the name Scooby Snax. Mr McNeill, who went into the trade 17 years ago after leaving the RAF, said: 'My advice was that if the Americans sued me in the High Court for copyright infringement, I could face a legal bill of more than £100,000. 'I can't afford to fight them and I can't risk losing the roof over our heads. 'I have worked hard to build up this business - we have been area winners of the Fish and Chip Shop of the Year competition for three years in a row. 'We employ 13 staff here and sponsor local soccer, darts and cricket teams and back the Scouts. 'My customers are dismayed and they can't understand why we are being pursued like this - their company probably employs more people than live in Brightlingsea.' The entertainment giants Hanna Barbera, which became part of Warner Brothers, owns all rights to a host of cartoon characters including Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, the Flintstones - and Scooby Doo. Established: The award-winning take-away and restaurant in the small riverside town of Brightlingsea, Essex, has been trading for more than eight years as 'Scooby Snax' Mr McNeill's legal advisers have told him he had a good case and accused the studio of bullying. But then the Americans sent them five large boxes of paperwork to support their claim and Mr McNeill's legal bill began to mount. 'We knew we could prove we had been trading before they registered the trademark in Europe - we had bills, contracts and photographs to prove it,' he said. 'But the evidence they sent ran to 16,000 sheets of paper and it would have cost us £2,000 just to photocopy all the documents. 'We just couldn't believe that a massive company in the USA was trying to crush a chip shop in a tiny Essex village. 'Our specialist copyright advisors said big companies acted aggressively because they know that small independent businesses like us just can't afford to fight them.' Mr McNeill and Ms Smith, 41, were warned that fighting the case could cost them at least £25,000 so reluctantly they have decided it was better to give in. 'We have had to order new signs, new menus and paperwork and have new branded uniforms,' said Mr McNeill, whose shop is now going to be re-named 'Johnny Mac's Plaice.. 'And we're going to trademark our new name - just to be safe,' he added. A spokesman for Warner Bros said: 'We initially made contact with Mr McNeill through standard traded, mark procedures. 'We subsequently entered into an agreement which protects the valuable intellectual property right of Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc as well as the creativity of those who created the much-loved and famous Scooby-Doo character and Scooby Snacks mark'.","John McNeill and partner Andrea Smith were stunned when lawyers told them they had to stop calling their busy chippie Scooby Snax .

Facebook co-founder and former Mark Zuckerberg roommate, Dustin Moskovitz, is by many accounts the world's youngest self-made billionaire. But as Facebook's long-awaited May 18 share floatation approaches, the 27-year-old isn't sipping champagne in the Caribbean. Instead he is in the mist of throwing himself back into San Francisco's start-up mix, even as the looming IPO seems likely to send his wealth spiraling even higher. Moskovitz and his friend Justin Rosenstein, a former Facebooker himself worth $150 million, head a company called Asana which employees 24 staff and is run out of inconspicuous Mission District offices, where it just launched the first paid version of its online project management service. Scroll down for video . Set apart: Dustin Moskovitz (left) enjoys a modest lifestyle, while Eduardo Saverin (right) prefers a more lavish way of life . And the pair have no plans to retire. 'When we think of work, we think of work as an act of service, as an act of love for humanity,' said Rosenstein, 28, in a recent interview. Added Moskovitz: 'If we were just retired, we wouldn't be serving anyone.' Like Zuckerberg, reportedly worth $17.5 billion and rarely seen out of a . hoodie, they seem uninterested in the flash and status-hoarding that great wealth makes possible.They don’t have an entourage, sit among their staff in the office, and prefer to dress down. Casual: Moskovitz prefers to dress-down and sits among his employees in the office . On the streets of their neighborhood, which brims with twenty-something hipster geeks, they'd blend right in. What sets them apart, they acknowledge, is their absolute freedom to pursue their particular vision of how to change the world. And they seem to have no doubt that their software will do just that. After all, as some of Facebook's earliest engineers, they've seen their code change the world once already. Moskovitz spent two years at Harvard where he helped Zuckerberg start the site before they dropped out and moved to Palo Alto. He left Facebook in 2008 and started Asana with Rosenstein. Like other similar products, their software lets users set up Web-based to-do lists that any group focused on a common goal can use to assign jobs and keep track of what gets done. The pair believe Asana will win out on its speed, versatility and ability to maintain the flow alluded to in its name, which in yoga refers to the poses meant to aid the flow of spiritual energy in the body. Regular yoga sessions are among the . perks of office life at Asana. Other benefits include an in-house chef . and $10,000 for new hires to set up their desks with whatever computing . gear they want. Several marquee tech companies have embraced Asana, the company reports, such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Foursquare. Individual backers betting on Asana include venture capital celebrities like Peter Thiel and Mark Andreessen, as well as several of Facebook's earliest employees. Moskovitz holds nearly 134 million shares of Facebook stock, giving him a 7.6 per cent stake in the company. His net worth stands at more than $4 billion but like many of the richest Americans, Moskovitz has signed a pledge initiated by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett to give away most of his money. His wife runs his philanthropic foundation, which is still getting off the ground. Contrary to Moskovitz’s modest lifestyle, fellow Facebook investor Eduardo Saverin and his estimated $2billion fortune have been living it up in Singapore, where he has . become notorious for his playboy lifestyle. He regularly buys bottles of . Moet champagne and Belvedere vodka at the most exclusive clubs in the company of the super-rich, drives a Bentley and lives in a penthouse in one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods.

Conrad Hotel. Investment: Saverin has invested in a start-up cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Singapore 2009, to whom he also offers his business expertise . The whirlwind . of parties, adoring friends and fast cars seems to have left little time . for business apart from Saverin's investment in Rachel K - a start-up . cosmetics company run by Rachel Kum, former Miss Universe 2009 whom . Saverin also mentors. During a launch for the brand at a rooftop party, Saverin said: 'With a company like Facebook, it's not just three people deciding how the world communicates, it's really about providing a tool so your customers can be themselves.' He added: 'I think it really inspired me to see that she [Rachel Kum] went from Miss Singapore to pushing her line, that she's going with her passion.' He has also ploughed money into information site Qwiki and online payment service Jumio. The Facebook share flotation is expected to happen on Friday, May 18, with Mark Zuckerberg planning to start the 'roadshow' preceding the initial public offering (IPO) on Monday. The social . network, now eight years old, has 900million members and was valued at up to $79.3 billion. It . is one of the most anticipated - and potentially the world's biggest - . stock market entry of an Internet company since Google floated in 2004. Zuckerberg, Saverin and the original start-up Facebook team including Dustin Moskovitz, Sean Parker and Chris Hughes were immortalised in the 2010 film The Social Network. Saverin was played by Andrew Garfield and is portrayed as a slightly naive player in the game. Moskovitz was played by Joseph Mazzello. One thing Saverin does prize highly . is his privacy and closely guards details of his life. He attends few . of the many public events he is invited to speak at and endorse and . rarely gives interviews. It . is presumably why he chose to set up home in Singapore which has . relatively few tabloids and paparazzi who follow the rich and famous . compared to the U.S. and Europe.

John Fearon, CEO of Singapore-based start-ups dropmysite.com and dropmyemail.com told the Wall Street Journal: 'Eduardo doesn't invest in much. He doesn't invest in Singapore companies.' Last August, Saverin was spotted partying with dozens of models in St Tropez and spending $50,000 on champagne. He flew a number of his friends over from Singapore and checked into the $8,000-a-night Hotel Byblos before going clubbing until the early hours. The entrepreneur was also seen at the trendy Bagatelle Brunch in Nikki Beach with three friends and ten beautiful women drinking Cristal champagne from the bottle and spraying it over each other. The bar tab reportedly came to a cool $50,000.

The head of the watchdog monitoring MPs’ expenses is being paid up to £169,000 a year in an ‘off-payroll’ deal allowing her to reap huge tax benefits, it can be revealed. Paula Higson, acting chief executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), earns the equivalent of up to £169,000 a year not through a normal salary, but through her private limited company. Ipsa, set up in 2009 in the wake of the MPs’ parliamentary expenses scandal, states that its main duty is ‘to serve the interests of the public’. However, it pays Mrs Higson in a deal allowing her to save thousands of pounds in national insurance and income tax – while Ipsa cuts its own national insurance payouts. Earlier this year Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander condemned similar ‘off-payroll’ arrangements saying they aided ‘tax avoidance’. Mrs Higson, who runs a private consultancy business, declined an opportunity to outline her tax payments. Ipsa also refused to give more details – even though its own website details staff expenses as small as a a ‘fruit basket’ worth £20. Mrs Higson is already familiar with ‘off-payroll’ deals. After leaving her last salaried job, earning £110,000 a year as chief operating officer at NHS Direct, she switched to working on contract at the same employer for £132,000 a year. The arrangement would have slashed her own national insurance and income tax liability. Miss Higson, who lives in a £1million house in Twickenham, west London, also appears to be continuing to be available for other work  while being paid to monitor MPs’ expenses, with her website fully operational. 'Contractor': Mrs Higson joined Ipsa in July this year as acting Chief Executive . Condemning: Earlier this year Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander spoke out about similar 'off-payroll' arrangements saying they aided 'tax avoidance' Last night angry MPs spoke out over the arrangement. Tory MP Rob Wilson, who campaigns against off-payroll deals in the public sector, said: ‘It is scandalous if an organisation charged with upholding the integrity of the MPs’ expenses system is itself paying people involved in tax avoidance.’ Former Labour minister Tom Harris said: ‘It is shocking if Ipsa is paying anyone a penny towards any form of tax avoidance.’ Mrs Higson joined Ipsa in July this year after Andrew McDonald, its chief executive – who is paid  £110,000 a year through a normal salary arrangement – required cancer treatment. She is paid £650 a day through her private limited company for 50 days’ work over four months – the equivalent of up to £169,000 a year. Mrs Higson said in a statement: ‘In the two years I’ve been running a small business, I have paid the taxes I should. 'I have not carried out any proactive marketing while I’ve been doing work for Ipsa. For a 50-day contract, I am not going to close my website.’ An Ipsa spokesman said: ‘Mrs Higson is being paid as a contractor, not an employee, to provide 50 days of cover. 'The appointment complies with the Treasury’s guidelines for interim staff.’","Ipsa was set up in 2009 in the wake of the .

A killer who stopped to take the pulse of his victim before kicking him to death, has been jailed for life. Gavin Mills, 26, stopped to check if unconscious Jerzy Dubiniec, 60, was still alive then continued his frenzied attack. Hard-working grandfather Mr Dubiniec was kicked so hard he had shoe marks all over his clothes and chest. A court heard Mills was high on cocaine and alcohol when he carried out the random attack on baker Mr Dubiniec who was on his way home from work. Prosecutor Greg Taylor QC said: 'A witness heard a noise at 3.30am and looked out of their window to see a man lying in the road being kicked many times. 'He saw the attacker take the pulse of the man on the floor and then started kicking him again before leaving him lying in the road.' Newport Crown Court heard Mr Dubiniec’s horrific injuries were so bad paramedics couldn’t treat him. Mr Taylor said: 'When paramedics arrived they were unable to grip Mr Dubiniec’s jaw to check his airways because of his injuries.' A post mortem examination found master baker Mr Dubiniec died from blunt injuries to his face, jaw and chest. The court heard the much-loved grandfather had come out of retirement to help at a friend’s new bakery in Newport. Mills, of Newport, was jailed for life after admitting murder. Mr Justice John Griffith Williams said Mills must serve a minimum of 12-and-a-half years in jail.

As far as Hallowe'en surprises go, finding a gang of men hiding in coffins bound for a funeral directors would be pretty spooky. Especially when it's a trio of stowaway immigrants trying to enter Britain illegally. Border Force officers made the frightening discovery while searching a lorry from Bulgaria - across the border from Dracula's Transylvania home. Coffins inside a lorry where three would-be illegal immigrants were found hiding . The trio had hidden themselves among the dozens of boxed coffins which were loaded into the van. While search officers sometimes use heartbeat detectors to investigate suspicious vehicles, it was a sniffer dog, Mitzy, that located the three, who were Eritrean nationals. The discovery was made on Monday when Border Force officers searched the Bulgarian-registered lorry at the port of Dunkerque in northern France. Mitzy the UK Border Agency sniffer dog who found the trio in hiding . The truck, which was waiting to board a ferry to the UK, was carrying coffins bound for a funeral director in Hounslow, west London. The stowaways were handed over to the French border police and the vehicle was allowed to continue on to its destination. Paul Morgan, Border Force director for South East and Europe, said: 'This was an unusual type of discovery, but in the past we have found people hiding in an array of freight, ranging from dog biscuits, bathtubs and now coffins. 'The incident shows exactly why we base Border Force staff in France - to stop would-be illegal immigrants before they can reach the UK. 'Our strong presence in French ports and close collaboration with the French authorities helps protect the whole of the UK from people attempting to enter the country illegally. 'As well as using sniffer dogs, officers also use heartbeat detectors, carbon dioxide probes and physical searches to find people hiding in vehicles.'","Trio of stowaway immigrants were traveling from Bulgaria to London .

Barclays was last night hit with a fine of $435million (£270million) by a US authority for rigging energy prices in America. The scandal-hit bank also revealed that a separate investigation has been launched by US regulators into fees paid to Middle East investors. Critics said the two probes exposed the ‘toxic trail’ left by former boss Bob Diamond. Profits tumble: Barclays posted a loss this morning of £47 million, after having to set aside more for PPI claims and pay debts . Just months ago Barclays was fined £290million for manipulating crucial interest rates used to set mortgages for millions of households. The massive fine for rigging the electricity market between 2006 and 2008 was imposed by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. New broom: New boss Antony Jenkins acknowledged that the bank needed to rebuild its reputation as it faces two new investigations in America . It has given the bank 30 days to appeal against the fine, which includes a compensation payment of £21.6million. Four New York-based traders at the centre of the scandal – Daniel Brin, Scott Connelly, Karen Levine, and Ryan Smith – have also been slapped with civil penalties totalling £11million. Connelly, the managing director of the North American Power trading team, was served with a £9.3million penalty. The regulator said damning messages sent between the four show they deliberately sold positions in electricity at a loss to drive prices down. This enabled other traders in the bank betting on falling prices to make huge profits. But others outside Barclays suffered losses that were estimated to total £86.3million. ‘Barclays traders knew their loss-generating physical trading was likely unlawful,’ the regulator said. Barclays has refused to confirm or deny whether the traders are still with the bank. The huge bets were made on future electricity prices in California, Arizona and the District of Columbia via complicated financial instruments. The boss of Barclays’ investment bank at the time was  Mr Diamond, who quit as chief executive in July in the wake of the Libor rate-rigging scandal. Barclays said it would ‘vigorously defend this matter’ and would appeal against the fine. But critics said the case has echoes of the Enron scandal when traders in the defunct US firm were found guilty of pushing up energy prices to rig their own bets during the California power crisis in 2000 and 2001. Barclays also faces an inquiry from the US Department of Justice and the Securities & Exchange Commission, relating to ‘whether the group’s relationships with third parties who assist Barclays to win or retain business are compliant with the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act’. It is thought the probe will focus on allegations Barclays failed to disclose ‘advisory fees’ paid to Middle East investors during the financial crisis. The bank went cap-in-hand to Qatar Holding in June 2008, raising £4.5billion in emergency funds to keep it afloat. A further fund-raising of £7billion was made with Qatar and Abu Dhabi investors later that year. But payments made to Abu Dhabi are not thought to be part of the probe. The Serious Fraud Office and City watchdog the Financial Services Authority in the UK have already launched a probe into the affair. Four former or current Barclays executives are under investigation. These are thought to include Roger Jenkins, who dates supermodel Elle Macpherson; finance director Chris Lucas; and former chief executive John Varley. Barclays said yesterday that it is co-operating with both US regulators. The revelations mark a major setback for new chief executive Antony Jenkins. Yesterday, he announced that Barclays had slumped to a £47million loss in the three months to the end of September, compared with a £2.4billion profit in the same period last year.","In three months to September Barclays lost £47m, compared to a profit of £2.4bn in the same quarter last year .

The largest lunar dark spot, a massive 1,800 mile wide (3,000 kilometres) crater known as the 'Ocean of Storms', may be a scar from a giant cosmic impact, researchers believe. A Japanese team say the giant cosmic impact created a magma sea more than a thousand miles wide and several hundred miles deep. These findings could help explain why the moon's near and far sides are so very different from one another, the team say. The two sides of the moon: Researchers now believe Procellarum, the largest of the three massive impact basins shown here, was formed by a massive cosmic collision . 'Our discovery provides the first . compositional evidence of this idea, which could be confirmed by future . lunar sample return missions, such as Moonrise, a proposed NASA mission . that would send an unmanned probe to collect lunar dirt and return it . to Earth,' lead study author Ryosuke Nakamura, a . planetary scientist at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial . Science and Technology in Tsukuba, Japan, told SPACE.com. 'The neighboring Earth likely experienced similar-sized impacts around the same period,' Nakamura added. 'It would have had a great effect on the onset of Earth's continental crust formation and the beginning of life.' Scientists analyzed Oceanus Procellarum, or the Ocean of Storms, a dark spot on the near side of the moon more than 1,800 miles (3,000 kilometers) wide. Researcher already know the near side of the moon, the side that always faces Earth, is quite different from the far side (which is often called the dark side, even though it does get sunlight). Previous studies have found widespread plains of volcanic rock called 'maria' cover nearly a third of the near side, but only a few maria are seen on the far one. Now scientists in Japan say that a giant collision may also explain the moon's two-faced nature, one that gave rise to the Ocean of Storms. The size of the asteroid involved is estimated at 180 miles in diameter, and it is believed it hit the moon's surface 3.9billion years ago. Researchers analyzed the composition of the moon's surface using data from the Japanese lunar orbiter Kaguya/Selene. These data revealed that a low-calcium variety of the mineral pyroxene is concentrated around Oceanus Procellarum, the Ocean of Storms, and large impact craters such as the South Pole-Aitkenand Imbriumbasins. This type of pyroxene is linked with the melting and excavation of material from the lunar mantle, and suggests the Ocean of Storms is a leftover from a cataclysmic impact. This collision would have generated 'a 3,000-kilometer (1,800-mile) wide magma sea several hundred kilometers in depth,' The red points show high low-calcium pyroxene concentrations, discovered through data mining of Kaguya's spectral data archive, and are signs of a cosmic impact. The researchers believe collisions large enough to create Oceanus Procellarum and the moon's other giant impact basins would have completely stripped the original crust on the near side of the moon. The crust that later formed there from the molten rock left after these impacts would differ dramatically from that on the far side, explaining why these halves are so distinct. The scientists detailed their findings online Oct. 28 in the journal Nature Geoscience.","Japanese team say the giant cosmic impact created a magma sea more than a thousand miles wide and several hundred miles deep .

Daxing Airport will be Beijing's third and could have as many as nine runways, under plans that have already antagonised environmental campaigners. It is expected to handle between 120 and 200 million passengers every year - at least twice the number dealt with at Heathrow. Busy: Beijing already has two airports, including its Capital International Airport (pictured), but a third is being constructed due to huge demand . The city already has Beijing Capital International Airport and Nanyuan Airport but they are not big enough to handle growing demand. Air traffic in the country rose in 2010 to 268 million trips - a 16.1 per cent increase on 2009, according to CNN. Cao Unchun, a profession at China Civil Aviation University, told The Telegraph: 'The existing airport in Beijing has an annual capacity of 75million passengers. 'Last year, it handled 73 million. In two years, it will be totally packed and it cannot be expanded infinitely.' Minister Li Jiaxing, who is in charge of the Civil Aviation Administration in China, says a single flight cannot be added to the already tight schedule in Beijing. Details of the construction in Daxing have yet to be announced but according to The Guardian, it will be built 50km out of the city in the village of Nangezhuan. Labourers are already said to have put up huge signs declaring: 'Construction of a New Airport City for the Capital' near the plot and migrants apparently started work in August. It is thought it will not only serve Beijing but also Tianjin and Hebei Province. A new expressway and high-speed rail link is also set for construction to link Daxing and Beijing, according to CNN. The latest development comes just three years after the unveiling of Beijing Capital International Airport, which was designed by British architect Norman Foster. Heathrow Airport Terminal Five - Daxing Airport will be bigger and busier . At the time, it was the world's biggest airport building with the same amount of floor space as all the terminals at Heathrow put together. China's aviation industry is positively booming, making profits of 43billion yuan (£3.9billion) last year - three times the figure for 2009. It intends to increase the number of airports from 175 to 230 in the next five yeas and is expecting to buy more than 20 jet planes over the next two decades.",New airport could have nine runways and will be twice as big as Heathrow .

Limited subway and commuter rail services will return to storm-ravaged New York City by Thursday, three days after the system was battered by briny floodwaters, but not below 34th Street. Although New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that limited subway service will be restored throughout the city, stations like the inundated South Ferry remains waterlogged and closed indefinitely. New York officials are only just beginning to deal with the monstrous after-affects of Sandy, pumping out briny water from saturated subway stations and repairing structural damage. Scroll down for video . Waterlogged: A flooded escalator in the South Ferry station which could be closed indefinitely. Floodwaters that poured into the deepest subway tunnels may pose the biggest obstacle to the city's recovery . South Ferry subway station in New York is flooded and littered with copious amounts of rubble as officials work to pump out briny water from subway stations across the city . Sandbags were used to prevent the full impact of the flood water and the station was closed off to the public today while workers attempt to make it fit for purpose . Destruction: The aftermath of the storm in the subway station that was used by thousands of commuters only a few days ago . Those downtown will be forced to rely only on buses and taxis, which have been causing massive gridlock throughout New York. Gov. Cuomo added that limited commuter rail service – including the Long Island Railroad and Metro North – will be restored later today, and that buses will provide transportation. MTA chairman Joe Llota told the New York Post: ‘We’re going switch by switch, signal by signal, power substation by power substation and making sure everything is up and running.’ The Post notes that many train yards, stations, and tunnels were damaged by the storm and experienced some form of flooding. Despite a near halt on mass transit, New Yorkers are starting to resume their day-to-day lives, re-opening businesses and assessing damage. Below 40th Street, where New Yorkers are on day two without power, some businesses, including restaurants, are open, offering limited food options. Limited service was also to resume at 2 p.m. Wednesday on two of the city's vital commuter rail systems, Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road. Subway submerged: A man takes a photograph of the flooded Whitehall Street station as dozens were damaged by the storm surge that rose water levels by 13 feet . No entry: A subway is closed in midtown Manhattan today . Both of those rail systems, which extend many miles into the Connecticut and Long Island suburbs, had been knocked out by power failures, downed trees, and, in the case of the LIRR, flooding in tunnels beneath the East River. Cuomo said three of the seven flooded train tunnels beneath the East River had been pumped out, but restoring them to service could take time, as equipment that was submerged in the storm is inspected and repaired. Vehicle tunnels, including the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and the Queens Midtown Tunnel, also took on huge amounts of water. The Brooklyn tunnel alone had an estimated 70 million gallons of water in it Wednesday morning, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said. Historic shut down: As flood waters inundated many stations including 86th Street, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that subway service would be shut down until Saturday or Sunday, only the second time it has ever closed . Worst disaster: After several stations were damaged, including 86th Street station, the MTA said the Sandy Superstorm was the worst disaster in the subway's 108-year history . Preemptive effort: Trains stopped running on Sunday night in an effort to secure the subway system, including a emergency dam erected at IRT Subway Lenox terminal . Pump flood waters: Each tunnel is expected to take at leave five days to pump dry, keeping stations closed until Saturday or Sunday . A surveillance camera captures the PATH station in Hoboken, New Jersey as it is flooded shortly before 9:30 p.m. EDT on Monday . Cuomo's announcement came as New York struggles to recover from Monday night's storm. Bus service resumed. Flights slowly got back in the air at two major airports and the New York Stock Exchange rang back to life after two days without trading. But large swathes of the city and its northern suburbs - about 1.6 million customers - remain without power. The subways carry 5.2 million riders daily; about 2.5 million people use city buses. The LIRR and Metro-North each has 300,000 daily riders.","Limited service has been restored above 34th street .

Lock up your bird feeders and guard your bird tables: Squirrels are raiding Britain’s gardens - and they’re ravenous. Faced with a shortage of nuts and seeds in the wild, grey squirrels are piling into gardens and pinching food left out for birds. With numbers up a third on recent years and expected to grow as the winter bites, the British Trust for Ornithology has produced a list of tips for bird lovers concerned that there will be enough food to go around. Helping hand: Animal lovers fear competition for food will be fierce this winter . Advice ranges from coating food with chilli powder, which is disliked by squirrels but palatable to birds, to greasing poles that bird feeders are hung on. The influx of squirrels has been blamed on the topsy-turvy weather reducing yields of nuts and seeds in the wild. Plus, in some trees, such as the beech, nut production follows a cycle and this year marks a natural low point. Short of nuts and seeds to eat now and to squirrel away for the winter, the animals are trying their luck on already-busy bird tables and nut-filled feeders. Tim Harrison, of the BTO, said: ‘Expect some fireworks at garden feeders this autumn and winter. Bird lovers recommend covering bird food in chilli powder, because squirrels do not like the taste of it . ‘Large numbers of birds are already gathering, with species such as the chaffinch and starling being joined by their continental cousins. ‘With more grey squirrels than normal also on the scene, competition may be intense. ‘Unlike many other small mammals, grey squirrels do not hibernate and so they will be looking for food throughout the winter.’ Dr Harrison has a range of tips for bird lovers who want to keep squirrels at bay. For instance, feeders can be covered with guards which only allow small birds access. It may also be possible to keep squirrels away from bird tables by creating a separate feeding area for them, complete with tempting treats. More unusual solutions including using something like Vaseline to grease the poles that squirrels shimmy up to reach nut and seed-filled feeders. For this to work, the feeders must of course, also be out of jumping distance. Another option is to coat bird food in chilli powder. While it is distasteful to squirrels, birds find it perfectly palatable. Dr Harrison said: ‘It is thought that squirrel’s taste receptors are like our own and so they feel the heat of the chilli and are put off by that. ‘But birds just behave perfectly normally.’ He added that like cats, public opinion is divided on the benefits of having squirrels visit gardens. ‘People have quite strong feelings. They are one of these creatures that some people love having come into the garden and other people don’t like quite so much. ‘Where people want to attract them, they can do that and hopefully still provide for the birds.","The animals are raiding bird tables and feeders as they struggle to find nuts of their own .

The naked woman shot dead by two off-duty police officers in Florida 10 days ago has been remembered by friends and family as modest, caring and very religious. Inda Marie Swanson was generous and kind, according to those who knew her, taking candy to her Bible study group every Wednesday and on Sundays donating little plastic bags of pocket change. She was shy to the point of leaving a room if a stranger walked in and always dressed conservatively, her boyfriend told Tampa Bay Times. Swanson would spend hours alone in her room, reading the bible and listening to Christian radio.

One or both of the officers then opened fire, killing her, according to police. She died at the scene around 1.15pm. Details of events leading up to her death remain murky, with two men claiming to have seen her naked in the woods a short time earlier, Bay News 9 reported. Al Eylward and Robert Collins described pulling over to ask if she was OK before taking pictures of her. Mr Collins said: 'She was literally walking down the road straight at us. 'So, we pulled up alongside of her, and at that point I looked out the window and I asked her, I said, ""Are you all right?"" And she said, ""Yeah, but I'm a little bit confused"".' The men said they only took pictures because they did not think anyone would believe them without any evidence. A short time later she walked inside a house holding a cross in her hands, they said. 'She held the cross up and made a circle like this and said, ""Antichrist, Antichrist, this meeting is over"",' Mr Eylward explained. 'And as she did that she stopped, turned around and walked back. 'At no time did any of us ever feel threatened and the only thing we ever saw in her hand was the cross,' he said. Fifteen minutes later the 42-year-old was dead. Mr Eylward said: 'This is a tragedy. It is, it really is. I had a friend that I was explaining this to and she asked me why I didn't call the cops right then and there, and as she said that it occurred to me that I should have.

But Jane and George Hunter from North Lanarkshire, Scotland, realised things had got out of hand when six-year-old Billy became so fat he couldn't jump onto the sofa, and walking for just five minutes left him gasping for breath. Supersize spaniel: Billy the cocker spaniel when he weighed over 23kg before his crash diet and new fitness regime gave him a new lease of life . At 23.5kg (52lbs) - and with the average weight of a healthy cocker spaniel being between six and 17kg (15 and 37lbs)  - Billy had been pampered into obesity. When Jane, 68, noticed her beloved pet could no longer climb onto the sofa . because of his growing bulge she enrolled him in a special pet fit club. And six months later Billy has shed 6.9kg (15lbs), now weighing in at a trim . 16.6kg (36.5lbs) and regularly breezes through four-mile walks. Jane, from North Lanarkshire, Scotland, said: 'Billy is a . different dog. He runs all over the place, we walk him four times a day . and he loves it. 'Before, he couldn’t do anything, he couldn't jump on the bed, or the . sofa and after five minutes out walking he would be out of breath. He . was like an old man of about 90. 'We just didn't realise that giving in to his puppy dog eyes was so bad for his waistline.'

Billy was found wondering the streets in Salsburgh, North Lanarkshire, as an 11-week-old puppy by a member of the public and handed into the police. He was taken in by Jane and George who spent five years feeding him an excessive diet of tinned dog food, supplemented with sweet snacks and treats from the dinner table. But last November Jane, a retired nursery worker, noticed a decline in Billy’s health and enrolled him at a special fit club run by the Peoples Dispensary for Sick Animals at Glasgow East PDSA Pet Aid hospital.

Jane, a grandmother of six, said: 'Billy would get everything - left-overs, treats or a piece of cake on someone's birthday. He could eat all day. 'We loved him to bits but we didn't realise what damage we were doing.' Billy was put on a special diet of dried . dog food and after just four mouths weighed 18kg (39.6lbs). He went on . to lose more weight and is now fitter than ever. Puppy love: Billy the super-slimming dog as a rescue puppy, when he was taken in by Jane and George Harris . Jane added: 'The PDSA have done wonders with him. Getting Billy to stick to the diet was something of a challenge at the start as human food had become a much loved part of his life. 'But now he's a new dog. He really is marvellous and great with the grandkids. We walk him four times a day and then on a weekend we do about four miles around the park. 'Billy runs around without getting out of breath and is generally happier in everything he does.' Siobhan Casey, senior vet at Glasgow East PDSA Pet Aid hospital, said: 'This is a great success story for all concerned, and Jane has clearly done a wonderful job in managing Billy’s food intake and safely increasing his activity levels.'

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 09:15 EST, 7 February 2012 . An ocean mapping expedition has found four sea floor 'bridges' across the deepest place on Earth, the 1,500-mile long, 6.8 mile deep Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean near Guam. Some of the 'sea mounts' are 2,500 metres tall, and form bridges across the trench as one tectonic plate is pulled under another. Using a multibeam echo sounder, scientists also measured Earth's deepest point, Challenger Deep more precisely than ever before. The researchers used a ship armed with state-of-the-art echo sounders to create a 3D 'map' of the world's deepest point . The 'bridges' across the trench are created when one tectonic plate is pulled underneath another, 'scraping' mountains into the form of bridges across the trench . Mapping the entire Mariana Trench with shipboard scanners from August until October 2010, the researchers discovered four bridges spanning the trench. The bridges rise as high as 2,500 meters above its floor. While satellite images had suggested the trench might be spanned by one such ridge, Gardner says the mapping mission confirmed the existence of four such features. 'That got me excited,' he says. The ridges are being formed as the 180-million-year-old Pacific and far younger Philippine tectonic plates collide. Because the ocean's crust cools as it ages, 'The Pacific crust is much, much older, so it's diving underneath the Philippine plate,' Gardner says. As seamounts on the Pacific plate are pulled beneath the Philippine plate - 'subduction' - they are compacted against the wall of the trench, forming these ridges. Gardner suspects that the bridges are . related to earthquake subduction zones, such as the one that caused the . March 2011 earthquake in Japan. The researchers scanned 400,000 square kilometres of the trench. The arrow shows the area where the bridges were found . 'It's incredibly complex geology. These seamounts are getting jammed up against the plate,' Gardner says. The expedition also yielded the most precise measurement yet of Challenger Deep, the trench's (and the Earth's) deepest point, finding it to be 10,994 meters deep, plus or minus 40 meters. Calculated from thousands of depth soundings as well as detailed analysis of how the how the water can alter the echo sounding signals, the new measurement is similar to other claims of the Challenger Deep's depth, some of which are deeper. 'When you're dealing with something that's 11 kilometers deep, you have to deal with inherent uncertainties in the system,' says Gardner, noting that Challenger Deep is deeper than Mount Everest is high.Multibeam echo sounders measure depth by sending sound energy to the ocean floor then analyzing the returning signal. Mounted beneath a ship, the instruments produce a fan-shaped swath of coverage of the seafloor. The resolution of the resulting images, at one pixel to every 100 meters, is far more precise than other earlier measurement systems. Hydrographers and ocean mappers such as Armstrong and Gardner describe the process of mapping an area as like 'mowing the lawn,' making overlapping tracks over the area in question.","Bridges formed by tectonic plates being pulled under one another .

ENGLAND and Harlequins rugby star Ugo Monye has told Sam Allardyce to shut up and stick to topics he knows about after the West Ham manager attacked the conduct of rugby players. Allardyce believes footballers are only so heavily criticised for their behaviour because people are jealous – and he singled out rugby players in particular for escaping scrutiny. The Hammers boss said: ‘I think that football is a volatile contest so people will lose their temper, but nobody seems to highlight the fact that rugby players stamp on each other's heads, gouge each other's eyes, and that seems to be acceptable. Pointing the finger: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has questioned the behaviour of rugby players . On the defensive: Ugo Monye was unhappy with Allardyce's comments and told his twitter followers . ‘There’s a lot of jealousy around the way football is in this country, and as it’s known as the peoples’ game, then I think more and more people complain about the price, whereas all the other sports it’s not quite the same.' Monye was offended by those comments and the former British and Irish Lion – a lifelong Arsenal fan – tweeted: ‘Sam Allardyce should probably only talk on topics that he knows about and stick to coaching west ham and keep his mouth shut about rugby...’ Former England hooker Brian Moore also added his weight to the argument, tweeting: ‘I'm not jealous Mr Allardyce. I can sit where I want, with a beer & without fear; the day I can't I'll walk away from rugby not make excuses.’ Blowing bubbles: Allardyce is not afraid to say what he's thinking and has been in trouble in the past . Northampton’s Christian Day added: ‘Sam Allardyce horribly missing the point. Respect for officials, fans or just each other sadly lacking in your sport.’ The comments from the Hammers boss come only days after Gloucester back row Andy Hazell was cited for a brutal assault on prop from French club Mont-de-Marsan who he claims tried to gouge him. Speaking ahead of West Ham's Barclays Premier League clash against Southampton on Saturday, Allardyce continued: 'Fans go to watch ice hockey players beat themselves up with the sticks and that also seems acceptable, but a footballer kicks somebody, or does something that’s slightly untoward to the rules and it’s ""lock them away, ban them for life"".' ‘So, it’s something we have to live with. In comparing it to the Olympics, it’s not as fierce a competition, because there’s not that day-to-day, week-to-week, competitive edge. 'It’s a build-up of four years – a very dedicated four years of course – and the delight of winning and the end of it must be one of the biggest highs anybody’s ever experienced.’","Allardyce claims fans focus on violence in football because they are jealous .

The fight started yesterday morning with a dispute between two inmates and other prisoners joined in, creating a melee that lasted until authorities retook control of the facility. Officials are now notifying families of those killed and injured, according to a statement from the state public security department in Tamaulipas, where Matamoros is located. Alleged members of a Mexican drug cartel are lined up alongside seized guns and drugs in Matamoros last week. An hours-long fight in the border city's prison left 20 inmates dead yesterday . An investigation into the incident has been launched. The violence lasted from about 8am to 10.30am on Saturday morning before soldiers and marines took control, according to a state official who was not authorised to comment. The violence comes as Mexican prison conditions have been under increased scrutiny because of violence and escapes. On Thursday, a fight between gang . members at a prison outside Monterrey left seven inmates dead. In July, a . riot in a prison in the border city of Juarez killed 17 inmates. Gangs and drug cartels often dispute for control of prisons in Mexico, which also suffer a high level of corruption. Matamoros sits across the border from Brownsville, Texas. Border town: Matamoros sits next to Brownsville, Texas, in north-east Mexico . Last year, the drug-related death toll in Mexico stood at 15,273 after skyrocketing a massive 60 per cent on the previous year. In the four years since Mexican president Felipe Calderon’s first wave of 6,500 troops went into battle with the cartels, more than 35,000 people have died. The violence was so intense in the country in 2008 that the Pentagon warned Mexico was on the verge of becoming a failed state. A bolster of more troops – some 50,000 are now fighting the war on drugs – has done little to reduce the death toll.

An historic steam railway line, which was closed for three years following a landslide, has reopened after engine enthusiasts raised a staggering £1million to pay for repairs. A 12-mile stretch of the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway (GWR) has been out of action since March 2010 after a two centuries-old embankment at Gotherington, Gloucestershire, collapsed and a second part of the track was damaged by further landslips in January 2011. But the generosity of an anonymous donor and readers of an enthusiasts magazine have helped raise enough money to get the popular heritage railway, which carries some 70,000 every year, back on track. Supporters cheer the first journey of the Cheltenham Spa Express after volunteers raised a staggering £1million to re-open the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway following a landslide . A steam train driver prepares to depart on the GWR for the first time since £1million repairs were carried out following a campaign to raise funds . From this weekend, steam engines will once again be using the line which runs from Cheltenham Racecourse to Laverton, in Gloucestershire. President of the GWR and pop music mogul Pete Waterman initially launched an appeal to raise enough funds to repair the railway back in 2010 after the initial landslide. The former Popstars judge said at the time that repairing the line, which generates income of £1million each year, would be crucial for its volunteer workforce and the local tourist economy. But campaigners' efforts took a hit in January 2011 after a further landslide at a place known as the 'Chicken Curve' damaged more of the track. The Cheltenham Spa Express, pictured, made its first journey along the restored GWR heritage railway this week after a landslide left it out of action since 2010 . Hundreds of rail enthusiasts have since rallied round with many signing up for a GWR '300 Club' by donating £1,000 or more to the cause. Readers of Steam Railway Magazine clubbed together to raise a staggering £70,000 for repairs and the £1million target was reached last month when an anonymous donor wrote a cheque for the remaining £7,000 after visiting the railway. Chairman of the railway Malcolm Temple said: 'Other railways have really rallied round to help. 'We’ll never forget the very significant contribution that so many heritage railways have made.' Repair work started in January and was expected to last four months and involved digging out the collapsed earthworks and rebuilding with new material. Parts of the embankment were stabilised with 'soil nails' which extend into the earth and hold the embankment in place. As well as steam engines, diesel trains will also run between the Cotswold towns of Winchcombe and Toddington - with the entire line linking Cheltenham and Laverton for the first time since 1979. The line was originally built between 1900 and 1906 but closed by British Rail in 1976. It was mostly taken apart and its amenities demolished by the end of the 1970s, but the route was bought in 1981 by the Great Western Steam Railway, known now as the GWR, in 1981. The eventual plan is to further extend the line. The campaign to repair the GWR had been launched by music producer and train enthusiast Pete Waterman, pictured, but the campaign suffered a setback following a second landslide in January 2011 .

The soaring cost of childcare means millions of families face two decades of stagnant living standards, a landmark report warns today. The Commission on Living Standards says that even if the economy recovers, around a third of the working age population – some 11million people – will be no better off in 2020 than they were in 2000. Among the worst hit are mothers because the cost of childcare is so high they cannot afford to go back to work. No improvement: Older workers are one of the groups who are likely to suffer a decline or stagnation in living standards until 2020 . Older workers and youngsters without qualifications also face an uncertain future as they struggle to make ends meet. The report says: ‘Millions of households are heading for a long period of stagnant living standards. 'The outlook for the bottom half of the working population is bleak even once growth returns.’ The Commission, set up by the Resolution Foundation in early 2010, warns that many women with children cannot afford to go back to work. No benefit: Work does not pay for many women in Britain, says Commission on Living Standards . It shows that a full-time second earner with two young children in a typical middle income household on a salary of £19,550 keeps just £1,060 a year after childcare costs, taxes and lost benefits. That is only £20 a week. In a worst-case example, a family with one parent on the minimum wage and a second earner returning to work full-time on the same salary would be left with only £211 a year – £4 a week – from the second parent’s wage after childcare costs and loss of tax credits were taken into account. ‘Work simply does not pay for many women in modern Britain,’ says the report. Vidhya Alakeson, deputy chief executive of the foundation, said: ‘We need major change in our childcare system to ensure that work is always worthwhile – and that working more hours or a pay rise results in higher take home pay.’",Work does not pay for many British women says Commission of Living Standards .

The Budweiser tycoon whose model girlfriend died at his mansion in 2010 from a drug overdose has settled a wrongful death suit with her family for $1.75million. Aspiring model Adrienne Martin, 27, was found dead just before Christmas in the bed of August Busch IV, the former chief of the Anheuser-Busch beer empire. Miss Martin, who had been dating 46-year-old Mr Busch for two years, died on December 19 after taking a lethal mixture of cocaine and the painkiller oxycodone. Today a judge approved the settlement before the parties - who have been locked in a longstanding legal wrangling - went to a contentious hearing next month. Unlawful death: An undated photograph of former Anheuser-Busch CEO August Busch IV, right, and his girlfriend Adrienne Martin who died of an overdose in his bed in December 2010 . According to STL Today, Martin's ex-husband Dr Kevin Martin sued Busch on behalf of their young son, Blake, in March of 2011.  Adrienne Martin's divorced parents, Larry Eby and Christine Trampler, then successfully appealed to join the lawsuit. Busch's attorney, St Louis lawyer Maurice Graham, released a statement this morning saying: 'Mr Busch cares deeply for Adrienne's son, Blake Martin, and is happy this long and at times bitter legal dispute is finally over. 'The only remaining issue was the division of the total settlement of $1.75 million. August's concern was that Blake receive as much of the total settlement as possible. Importantly, the dispute was resolved amicably today allowing everyone to avoid the contested hearing scheduled for November 14. August hopes to remain an important part of Blake's life.' According to the agreement, Blake Martin will be paid $1.35 million, Christine Trampler agreed to accept $200,000 and Larry Eby agreed to a $200,000 out-of-court settlement, which was put into an annuity for his grandson. Dreams: Miss Martin was an aspiring model . No charges were made in Miss Martin's death, despite the levels of cocaine and oxycodone being high enough to kill her, an autopsy found. A Medical Examiner concluded the former Hooters waitress had voluntarily taken the drugs so no one was held accountable. Last year, the beer tycoon offered the family $1.5million to settle the wrongful death claim. An attorney for Busch said at the time the offer had been made to provide for Blake's future and insisted the decision was not an admission of wrongdoing. Miss Martin, who suffered from an electrical heart condition known as Long QT syndrome, was due to start work at an energy firm before she died. Busch, 46, was the last member of his family to run Anheuser-Busch brewing, between 2006 to 2008, before it was sold to Belgian brewer InBev. The 2008 sale earned the heir about $100 million. He has since said he will step down from the company's board of directors, marking the end of the family's involvement in the brewery, the largest in the world. The tycoon has a troubled past. In 1983, Busch, then a 20-year-old University of Arizona student, left a bar with a 22-year-old woman. His black Corvette crashed and the woman, Michele Frederick, was killed. Busch was found hours later at his home. He suffered a fractured skull and claimed he had amnesia. After a seven-month investigation, authorities declined to press criminal charges, citing a lack of evidence. Two years later Mr Busch was acquitted of assault charges by a jury in St Louis after he was involved in a police chase. The great-great-grandson of Anheuser-Busch founder Adolphus Busch has spoken in the past of the deep devastation he felt following the sudden death of his girlfriend. 'I went to serve her breakfast in bed, and I couldn't wake her up,' he said after Miss Martin's death. ‘It's the saddest thing I've ever dealt with.'","Adrienne Martin, 27, died of a lethal mix of cocaine and oxycodone in 2010 .

A learner driver left his friend dying at the scene of an accident he caused before fleeing the scene and callously telling the teenager’s parents that their son was safe. Uninsured Jay Gilbert, who was 17 at the time, fled after ploughing his Suzuki Swift into a van as he pulled out of a junction, leaving witnesses to call an ambulance for his seriously injured friend. Joshua Reed, 18, was pronounced dead at the scene minutes later, but his family didn’t find out for two hours because of Gilbert’s lies. Jay Gilbert, now 18, left, admitted killing his friend Joshua Reed, right, 18, in the crash last October. The pair had been friends for around a year but Gilbert left Mr Reed in the passenger seat to die at the scene . As Mr Reed lay dying, Gilbert had taken a lift to his friend’s home where he tried to cover up what he had done by telling Joshua's worried parents their son was alive and talking to firefighters. His relieved dad Michael Reed rushed to the scene of the crash with Gilbert, who told him he believed Joshua's teenage girlfriend had died. Mr Reed learned the truth from a police officer two hours later as he waited behind cordon near the Tally Ho pub, on the A15 near Sleaford, Lincolnshire, on October 6 last year. Gilbert admitted causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to 27 months in a young offenders institute and banned from driving for three months at Lincoln Crown Court last Friday. The court heard how Gilbert had bragged to friends that he had passed his test – but in fact was still a learner who was only allowed to drive with adult supervision at the time of the crash in October last year. Mr Reed, from Spalding, Lincolnshire, yesterday recalled the moment Gilbert tried to cover up the truth about Joshua's death by saying it was his girlfriend who had been the victim. The 38-year-old said: ‘(Gilbert and his friend) told me they felt sorry for her family, so I assumed she was dead and I was standing there thinking how I was going to console Josh. Joshua Reed, pictured, believed his friend Jay Gilbert had passed his driving test - in fact he was still a learner . The family of Joshua Reed, pictured, only found out the devastating news of his death two hours after the crash . 'They said Josh was fine, was walking around and talking to the firemen. 'When we arrived at the crash scene . they said they thought Josh's girlfriend was lying in the middle of the . road and we shouldn't hold out too much hope. 'Everything fell into place when a police officer told me Josh was dead and Jay had been arrested nearby. Michael Reed, 38, Joshua's father, said he was heartbroken to find out his son died with a stranger . 'I'm glad Jay admitted what he had done and that he's got sentenced.' He . said Gilbert, who had known his son for around a year, announced in the . pub around six weeks prior to the accident that he had passed his test - . and he had no idea it was a lie. Mr Reed, who has seven children, added: ‘It is hard enough to deal with the fact your son has been killed in an accident, but I think you could come to terms with that, but not this. ‘This accident should never have happened. ‘But putting all that aside, when they crashed he should have stayed there and held Josh's hand until he died.’ Mr Reed later found out it had been left to witnesses to call 999 after the crash because Jay Gilbert ‘did a runner’. Mr Reed added: 'What hurts the most is the fact that Jay left my son to die on his own in that car. 'A chef from the pub called the ambulance and held his hand telling him he was going to be OK. 'Joshua was on his own and probably knew he was dying. It's heartbreaking.' Recorder Gareth Evans QC told him: ‘It has to be immediate custody. ‘You pulled out in front of a van coming towards you. An experienced driver would not have done what you did. ‘A collision was inevitable and as a result of that you killed someone.' The court heard Gilbert, from Boston, Lincolnshire, lied to his friends six weeks before the fatal crash when he told them he had passed his driving test. Stuart Lody, prosecuting, said: ‘He was the holder of a provisional driving licence. ‘Astonishingly he said he did not know about the requirement to have L plates fitted on a car he was driving. The accident happened close to the Tally Ho pub on the A15, near Sleaford in Lincolnshire in October last year . ‘He also said he did not realise he had to have a qualified driver sitting with him. ‘It is accepted he must have looked, possibly to the right first and then left and then looked right again and pulled out into the path of the van, the driver of which had no time whatsoever to react and a collision occurred.' Michael Cranmer-Brown, defending, said: ‘It was a momentary lack of attention through his inexperience that caused the collision. ‘He was reasonably badly injured himself. He had a severe break to his arm and that had to be operated on.’ Another friend also suffered serious injuries after he was thrown from the car in the crash. Mr Cranmer-Brown said that Gilbert had also suffered retribution within the community having his injured arm broken again when he was attacked. Joshua, an apprentice carpenter, was just three days off his 19th birthday when he was killed in the crash.","Jay Gilbert jailed for 27 months in a young offenders institute after admitting causing death by dangerous driving .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 02:46 EST, 2 August 2011 . As the last remaining venue from London's 1948 Olympics, it was hardly the legacy that organisers  would have hoped to leave behind. With its near-derelict pavilion, sealed off storage sheds and deteriorating track, the velodrome at Herne Hill had become more of a hindrance than an heirloom. But after decades of gradual decay the south-east London track, where triple Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins began his cycling career, is finally going to be renovated in a bid to restore it to its former glory. Glory days: The velodrome at Herne Hill used to be packed on race days . Key track repairs, expected to last six weeks, are the first major work on the site since a 15-year lease between the Dulwich Estate landowners and British Cycling, as secure tenant, was signed earlier this year. The pavilion will then be rebuilt with state-of-the-art changing rooms, a gym and a cafe. It is a remarkable turn around for the venue, built in  1891, which during its heyday attracted 10,000 people to its 450 metre banked track, but has slowly dilapidated due to a lack of investment. A Save the Velodrome campaign was launched late last year after the state of the venue meant there was a very real danger of closure. Among the first of the 'extensive structural repairs' is the strengthening and resurfacing of the track, according to BC's facilities officer Patrick Flanagan. Podium positions: Herne Hill velodrome hosted the cycling events at the 1948 Olympic Games - pictured here are the medalists in the 1,000 metres race - 1. Ghalla, Italy 2. Reg Harris, Great Britain 3. Schandorff, Denmark . He said: 'It currently has a concrete base with an epoxy resin finish. This finish has failed and cracked, allowing water to enter the structure and, in conjunction with frost, cause extensive damage, alongside some settling of the concrete base. 'The repairs will start with this concrete base, which will be mended with fibreglass reinforcement at each joint. 'It was originally made in 10-metre lengths and where these join, unevenness is now a problem. 'The repairs will provide a strong and very smooth base upon which the new track surface can be laid.' A special fine granite stone covering called MasterTrack, which is smooth, hard and dense, will then be laid. Mr Flanagan added: 'It is also impervious to water, so damage from the elements will be eliminated. 'The new surface will be seven metres wide and laying it presents some challenges. 'Its width, combined with the camber, which changes in the bends, and the need for an extremely smooth finish, make it remarkably difficult to lay. 'Tarmac has developed a unique rig which runs on a track inside the cycling track. This allows them to lay the surface in three wide strips. Futuristic: The Herne Hill velodrome is a far cry from the venue which will host the London 2012 Olympics cycling events . Winner: Triple Olympic champion Bradley Wiggins began his cycling career at the Herne Hill velodrome . 'So, all in all, it's a pretty special project with some unique problems and equally unique solutions.' Funding has come from BC's Whole Sport Plan and a bequest from London resident and De Laune Cycling Club member Leonard Lyes, who died in July 2009. He asked that his money be used 'in the pursuit of track cycling'. Getting the track repaired is 'a huge step forward' for the Save the Velodrome campaign, according to British Cycling chief executive Ian Drake. He said: 'It will provide riders of all ages with a fantastic surface on which to enjoy their cycling. 'Herne Hill is such an iconic venue and British Cycling is both delighted and proud of the role it is playing in helping getting it back to its former glory.' Hillary Peachey, chairwoman of the Save the Velodrome campaign, added: 'These works are a turning point for the Herne Hill Velodrome. 'Barely a year ago the future of this incredible site was uncertain. 'The lack of a long-term lease combined with a series of harsh winters was threatening to overcome all the hard work which has been put into the track over the decades and there was a very real threat of closure.'",Restoration begins at iconic venue where Bradley Wiggins began his career .
"By . Neil Sears . UPDATED: . 17:50 EST, 18 October 2011 . Old money: Lady Jacqueline Killearn's bid to sell her stately home has been blocked after opposition from her son . When her husband was Britain’s wartime ambassador to Cairo, she rose to the pinnacle of society, entertaining Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, and King Farouk of Egypt. And at the age of 102, despite dwindling funds, Lord Killearn’s widow Jacqueline still wishes to be maintained in the style to which she long ago became accustomed. But when the centenarian baroness tried to quickly raise £1.65million by selling her Jacobean mansion – ‘significantly’ below its market value – she started a row with her son and grandson which had to be resolved in the High Court. The judge barred her from selling the 17th century Haremere Hall and its  surrounding 100 acres of grounds near Etchingham, East Sussex. It is a humiliating dispute for Lady  Killearn, who also owns a £10million mansion in Harley Street, London, to become embroiled in – but not the first. Three years ago the Mail revealed that her butler Paolo Sclarandis was taking her to an employment tribunal, claiming unfair dismissal. Mr Sclarandis, 67, who worked for Lady Killearn at Harley Street, said she lived amid squalor and behaved like a despot, calling him a ‘selfish prat’, a ‘toad’ and a ‘monster’ and hurling walking sticks at him during 67-hour working weeks. The butler, of Hammersmith, West London, won £2,000 in compensation. Pile: Lady Killearn had lodged an application for . authorisation to sell 17th century Haremere Hall, in Etchingham, East Sussex, . which is held in a family trust . He said at the time: ‘Lady Killearn still thinks she’s living in the glory days of the British Empire. ‘But she lives in squalor, with . dangerous wiring, piles of clothes in her cramped bedroom and her . bathroom falling to pieces. And she treated me like a slave.’ The latest case against her was fought by her son Lord Victor Killearn, 68, and grandson Miles Lampson, 33. Haremere Hall – bought by the late . first baron Killearn after he returned to Britain from his key Second . World War ambassadorship in Cairo – is currently held in a family trust. Seven years ago it failed to sell when put on the market for £4million. Lady Killearn recently lodged an . ‘urgent’ application with the High Court seeking a judge’s authorisation . to sell the mansion, built in 1612 and which boasts 13 bedrooms, to a . purchaser who had offered her £1.65million and the right to remain in an . apartment there for the rest of her life. Former glories: Lady Killearn, pictured with her husband, the first Lord, Killearn, former ambassador to Egypt, was accustomed to living the 'high life' Her application was blocked by the . current Lord Killearn, of Lower Swell, near Stow-on-the-Wold, . Gloucestershire, and his son and heir Mr Lampson. They claim the . property had been ‘significantly undervalued’. Lady Killearn’s barrister, Peter John, . told the court a speedy sale of Haremere Hall with leave to remain . living there would give her peace of mind and security, and accused her . son of acting unfairly by obstructing the sale. He told Judge Jeremy Cousins QC the . family trust was ‘to all intents and purposes insolvent – with no assets . beyond Haremere Hall’. Lady Killearn had ploughed much of her . limited funds into maintaining the ancient house – where bills reach . £80,000 a year, and full repairs would cost almost £2million – and the . trust now owed ‘substantial sums’ to her, he told the court. Age of empire: Lord and Lady Killearn pictured at the opening of Parliament in Cairo, when he was British Ambassador to Egypt . The unhappy butler: Paolo Sclarandis . Mr John said she was entitled to . ‘enjoy the final period of her life – however long that may be – in a . bit more luxury than she has at the moment’. Lady Killearn was ‘eking out her life . from a small amount of money paid out from another family trust, and her . widow’s pension’, he added. The £1.65million offer represented a . realistic price, argued Mr John, given the slump in the country house . market, the scale of repairs needed, and the mansion’s status as a Grade . I listed building which  will demand attention from specialised . craftsmen. He added: ‘It is simply quite unfair for Lord Killearn to stand in the way of his mother in this last period of her life.’ The judge was also told Lady Killearn . is reluctant to spend much of her time at her Harley Street residence . because her limited funds mean she has to let rooms to doctors. Judge . Cousins, however, rejected Lady Killearn’s bid to sell the house, which . he described as a ‘truly splendid’ building. He accepted arguments from Lord . Killearn, who went to Eton, and was a captain in the Scots Guards before . working in the City, that even if the historic house needed to be sold, . it should be  marketed properly and put up for sale at a much higher . price.","Lady Jacqueline Killearn wanted to sell for £1.65m if she could stay in an apartment in the house .

Tragic loss: Lieutenant Edward Drummond-Baxter, left, and Lance Corporal Siddhanta Kunwar, right, of 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles were shot dead by a man wearing an Afghan police uniform in Helmand . The pair, of 1st Battalion The Royal . Gurkha Rifles, were praised by their commanding officer for their . bravery and commitment to the force. The . incident occurred yesterday when L/Cpl Kunwar from Pokhara, Nepal, and . Lt Drummond-Baxter, of County Durham, were attending a meeting with Afghan police at a check point in Nahr-e Saraj. It is believed that one of the men wearing police uniform opened fire, the . Ministry of Defence said. Edward Drummond-Baxter was on his first deployment to Afghanistan and had only arrived on September 30. Inside attacks: The deaths of Lt Drummond-Baxter and L/Cpl Kunawar brings the total number of fatal 'green-on-blue' attacks within NATO's International Security Assistance Force to 56 . His family paid tribute to the ‘fiercely loyal and totally sincere’  the 29-year-old Psychology graduate today. His . mother Helen, father David and sister Emily said in a statement: ‘He loved the Gurkhas . and died among friends doing the job that he wanted to do.’ Lt Drummond-Baxter was born in Peterborough and was an active member of his local . Territorial Army regiment during his studies at University College . London. He subsequently spent two years working for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, before joining the British Army. After attending Sandhurst military college, he was commissioned into the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles in December 2010. Partnership: British soldiers helping to re-establish government control in an area of Helmand province . Lieutenant . Colonel David Robinson, commanding officer 1st Battalion The Royal . Gurkha Rifles, said: ‘Our battalion has lost a character, a true . gentleman and an inspirational leader in Lieutenant Edward . Drummond-Baxter. 'His . Gurkha soldiers noticeably responded to his dedication to them but also . to his great wit and humour. They would follow him anywhere. ‘His . natural empathy and rapport for his soldiers was evident to everyone. It was never a surprise to find him spending additional time with them, . whether seeking to further their professional development or just . enjoying their company. The tragedy of his loss is beyond words. ‘He . was also utterly courageous and had already proved himself such a calm . and steady leader under fire that his men knew they were in the best of . hands. ‘Edward . Drummond-Baxter was a Gurkha officer in the finest tradition and his . loss will be deeply felt by all those who had the privilege and honour . of knowing him.’ Corporal Hirabahadur Phagami said: ‘Throughout my career Lieutenant Drummond-Baxter was one of the best platoon commanders. ‘He was always calm and caring to all of us. Always a smile on his face no matter how difficult the task was. ‘May his soul rest in peace. I will forever remember him. May God bless his family.' Lance . Corporal Kunawar was on his third tour of Afghanistan with the Gurkhas . and was a role model for younger soldiers, Lt Col Robinson said. ‘Strong . and highly experienced, he stood out from the crowd, not only as a . highly capable sniper but also for his smile and sense of fun, whatever . the situation he found himself in. ‘The younger soldiers responded greatly to his guidance and experience but also to his caring nature. ‘Siddhanta was a proud soldier and was immensely proud to be a Gurkha. ‘He . was one of the cornerstones of the Sniper Platoon, where he was part of . a close-knit team who were justifiably confident in their ability. ‘He would have done anything to support his comrades and friends around him. I know they will miss him deeply.' The family of L/Cpl Kunwar spoke of their shock and disbelief of their loss. ‘He enjoyed immensely his profession and was fully committed towards it,’ they said in a statement. ’He has made us proud and the whole family misses him dearly.’ The . shooting of the troops by an Afghan they believed to be on their side takes the number of . British servicemen and women killed in 'green on blue' insider . attacks to 11, and the total number within NATO’s International . Security Assistance Force to 56. An Afghan police official in the southern province of Helmand said efforts were underway to apprehend the policeman involved. Former attack: Corporal Channing Day (left), 25, and Corporal .

"By . Mary Mcconnell . UPDATED: . 14:18 EST, 3 January 2012 . Britain's wealthiest landowner, the Duke of Westminster, is to donate a country pile to the nation that will become a treatment centre for wounded soldiers and civilians. Grade II-listed Stanford Hall, in Leicestershire, is to get a £300million conversion that will see it become Britain's largest rehabilitation complex, according to the Sunday Times. The 35-bedroom estate, which changed hands for £6.25m in 2007, has 354 acres, making it four times the size of the army's main centre for war wounded, Headley Court, in Surrey. Country pile: Stanford Hall, in Leicestershire, is set to undergo a £300m conversion into a ehabilitation centre for wounded soldiers and civilians . The new centre is due to open in six years' time. Although British forces have left Iraq and are due to depart from Afghanistan by the end of 2014, the numbers of war wounded will remain high and their long-term car needs will need to be catered for. Advances in medicine mean that many soldiers, who in previous generations would have died, survive despite suffering severe injuries. Around 800 troops were admitted to Headly Court during 2011, up from 640 in 2010 and just 163 the year before. The 60-year-old Duke, who owns large parts of central London, is Britain's most senior Territorial Army officer with the rank of major-general. He joined in 1970 and has taken a huge interest in the military. Last month he proposed renaming the TA the British Army Reserves. Donation: The Duke of Westminster is the most senior officer in the Territorial Army and has a taken a huge interest in the military over the past 40 years . As well as buying the hall, the Duke, whose personal fortune is estimated to be £7bn, will make a 'substantial donation' to the renovation costs. The Help for Heroes charity and the Royal British Legion are also expected to donate large sums towards the new centre. Philip Raffaelli, the MoD's surgeon general, told the Sunday Times the centre would also be used by civilians, preparing them for a return to work. 'It is a very exciting opportunity,' he added. Stanford Hall would be following in the footsteps of other grand residences used as military hospitals during times of conflict. In World War I Brighton's Royal Pavilion served as an infirmary for wounded Indian troops. And recently, this secret history of many stately homes was played out on national television when Downton Abbey, in the ITV drama of the same name, was turned into a hospital for soldiers wounded in the First World War. Stanford Hall was built in the late 18th century for Charles Vere Dashwood, the high sheriff of Nottingham. In 1928 Julien Cahn, the head of the Nottingham Furnishing Company, bought the hall for £70,000. He made it one of the great country houses of the era, attracting guests with lavish social occasions. When he died in 1944 his widow was forced to the property to pay for high death duties. Vital role: Headley Court is currently Britain's main centre for the treatment of injured soldiers but there is little room for expansion, unlike at Stanford Hall, which is four times the size . Property tycoon Chek Whyte bought Stanford Hall in 2007 but two years ago Whyte, who had appeared in the ITV show Secret Millionaire, was declared bankrupt. 'Stanford Hall would be an ideal location for such a prestigious project,' Jim Rowland, chairman of the local British Legion, told the Sunday Times. 'The duke should be commended for his actions.' While Frances McKim, from the Stanford-on-Soar parish council, said locals were delighted and added that the plans were so much better than other proposals put forward for the hall. Local residents are set to meet the duke later this month to discuss the project.","£300m renovation due to be complete in 2018 .

Controversial: Honywood Community Science School in Coggeshall, Essex is offering counselling and advice on quitting smoking to pupils aged just 11. This picture is posed by models . A school is offering counselling and advice on quitting smoking to pupils aged just 11. Honywood Community Science School in Coggeshall, Essex has introduced the classes aimed at helping the youngsters quit the habit. The children, who are in just their first year of secondary school, are also offered time with the school’s nurses and health professionals. This is despite the legal smoking age in the UK being 16 and people needing to be 18 before they can buy cigarettes. The move by the school comes after Cancer Research UK revealed recently that almost 160,000 children start smoking every year in the UK - enough to fill around 5,200 classrooms. The charity said . eight out of 10 people start smoking before they are 19 and more must be . done to prevent youngsters starting. It follows revelations last November that Grenoside Community Primary in Sheffield was facing a parents’ revolt over the content of sex education classes for children as young as four. Headteacher of Honywood Community Science School Simon Mason claims that the 'quit smoking' classes will make youngsters realise that the habit will create its own challenges when they leave school. He said: 'We need to make sure we understand the pressures that young children are under. 'We take smoking very seriously here. 'In the real world of work there are now very few places where smokers can go to smoke and the children need to understand that this is the world that they will be going into.' Time to act: Honywood Community Science School's quitting classes are available to all pupils, with parents also invited to come into the school to discuss the issues . The quitting classes are available to all pupils, with parents also invited to come into the school to discuss the issues. Mr Mason added: 'We held a night where we invited parents in and it was so successful with people coming back for more information that we held another one. 'The idea now is to offer one evening every year to try to help as much as we possibly can.' Last month, Cancer Research UK said 157,000 children aged 11 to 15 take up the habit every year. The data refers to the proportion of children in an age group who were smoking a year after first saying they were smokers. Almost a million under-15s - more than a quarter (27 per cent) of all children - have tried smoking at least once. Among 12-year-olds alone, 1 per cent were smoking regularly in 2009, another 2 per cent smoked occasionally and 2 per cent said they used to smoke. Concern: Grenoside Primary in Sheffield, where . families were said to be prepared to withdraw youngsters because of concerns about sex education classes . A year later in 2010, as 13-year-olds, 3 per cent of children smoked regularly, 2 per cent smoked occasionally and 4 per cent used to smoke. Amanda Sandford, of ASH - action on smoking and health - welcomed the move by the school, but said it was also important to have preventative classes to stop children from smoking in the first place. She said: 'I think that if they have identified a need then that seems to be a perfectly reasonable line to take. 'At the age of 11 there will be few regular smokers, nationally the figure is about 1 per cent for that age, but there may be one or two and if they can be helped to stop at that age then there is a good chance they will not become regular smokers and become addicted.' However, she added: 'It is also important that children receive quality education about the dangers of smoking.' In November last year, up to 20 families were said to be prepared to withdraw youngsters from sex education lessons at Grenoside Community Primary in Sheffield. It was because of concerns they are being sexualised too soon with discussions about homosexuality, masturbation and orgasms. Under the plans, children as young as four would be given sex education classes and those aged six could be taught about same-sex relationships and the difference between ‘good and bad touching’.","This is despite the legal smoking age in the UK being 16 .

A new city could be built in the Midlands alongside the controversial High Speed 2 rail line as part of a drive to tackle the country’s housing shortage. The transport project’s chief engineer said up to 100,000 homes could be built on green belt land. Details emerged as ministers prepare to launch a radical National Planning Policy Framework to simplify planning laws and boost economic growth. Picturesque: Andrew McNaughton,chief engineer of the proposed High Speed 2 rail link between Birmingham and London, says land around the area of Meriden in the West Midlands has been earmarked for a massive housing development . If the plan, backed by HS2’s chief engineer Andrew McNaughton, goes ahead, it would concrete over the open countryside between Birmingham and Coventry. This would create the country’s largest conurbation, stretching from Coventry in the east to Wolverhampton in the west. The city would be part of a growth spurt expected over the coming years, which could see as many as two million new homes by 2020. Most of the growth is predicted by the Office for National Statistics to take place outside the major cities and would see England’s population go up by 4.4million. Some 59,000 new homes would be needed in Essex; 55,000 in Kent; 49,000 in Hertfordshire; 37,000 in Lincolnshire and 26,000 in Cambridgeshire. Rural towns in the east of England and the Midlands will see the most rapid population growth. Boston, Corby and  Northampton are all set to grow  by between 17 and 19 per cent  by 2020. Last week David Cameron said he wanted to see a series of new ‘garden cities’, together with increased airport capacity. He warned: ‘We urgently need to find places where we’re prepared to allow significant new growth to happen.’ Building boom: Two million homes need to be built by 2020 to cope with the increase in the population . Hi-tech: Artist's impression of the proposed new high speed train which would link Birmingham to London . A senior Downing Street source described the new planning framework as an ‘unashamedly pro-growth document. It is still the most radical business deregulation there has ever been’. But the source added: ‘These reforms were never intended to allow the concreting over of the countryside.’ Professor McNaughton outlined his vision for a new Midlands city in a speech in Derby. He said there could also be a ‘second Docklands’ to the west of London, and called for an expansion of Birmingham Airport. Joe Rukin, the co-ordinator of the Stop HS2 campaign, said: ‘We have always suspected that HS2 is really a developers’ charter. Take off: Birmingham International airport could be renamed Birmingham . London to draw attention to the speed with which it will be able to reach the . capital using the new rail link . No go: An anti-HS2 high speed train poster sits on farm land in Stoneleigh near the proposed route in Warwickshire . ‘We have been saying for almost two years that if HS2 goes ahead, that would mean the destruction of the green belt which separates Birmingham and Coventry.’ In an article for the Countryside Alliance magazine, Mr Cameron attempted to dampen down the planning row by declaring: ‘The countryside is in my blood. For me, our countryside is what makes Britain great.’ Baby boom: The population of England is expected to rise by 4.4 million over the course of the next eight years .

John Goodman was also fined $10,000 for his role in the death of 23-year-old Scott Wilson, who drowned when Goodman, 48, rammed into his car and sent it into a canal in February 2010. Judge Jeffrey Colbath condemned Goodman's actions, saying: 'He left to try and save himself.' Polo tycoon: John Goodman has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for his role in a 2010 hit-and-run . The killer became notorious when he . tried to adopt his 42-year-old girlfriend in an apparent attempt to . protect his fortune from his victim's family in the event of a possible . civil suit over Mr Wilson's death. Last month he reached a settlement with the Wilson family and will pay out $46million in compensation to them. Victim: Student Scott Wilson was only 23 years old when he was killed in the car crash . Goodman faced up to 30 years in prison after being found guilty of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide. Prosecutors sought a sentence of 20 . years, and on Friday Mr Colbath ruled that the culprit should be . imprisoned for 16 years during a hearing in West Palm Beach, Florida. According to the Sun-Sentinel, the . judge said: 'These are horrible, horrible cases from a criminal justice . standpoint. Scott Wilson's death was senseless. He was on the eve of . fullness of life.' He added that the tragic case should serve as a warning to others as he said: 'Find a cab, find a friend. Don't drink and drive. 'This was a senseless, senseless accident because Mr Goodman chose to drive when he was too drunk.' According to Mr Colbath, the severity . of the sentence reflected the fact that Goodman knew what he was doing . when the fled the scene of the accident without calling 911. 'To avoid the liability, the criminal . responsibility, that he knew was going to visit him from the time of . the crash, he wilfully left the scene of the crash,' the judge said. 'It was because he wanted to figure out a way to save himself.' Justice: Lili Wilson leaving the courtroom after the guilty verdict was read out in March . Mr Wilson's mother Lili addressed the court, giving emotional testimony about her son. 'Sunday is going to be Mother's Day and Scott will not be coming home,' she said. 'By dying at such a young age, he . will never get the opportunity to work as a professional after . graduating from engineering school. 'He will never have the opportunity to marry and have a family of his own.' Goodman also took the stand, saying: . 'I just wanted to say that from the day after the accident, all I've . wanted to do is reach out to the Wilsons and be with them and cry with . them. 'And I can't imagine or even pretend to imagine what it would be like to lose a son.' Impact: The crumpled car driven by Wilson, left, and the Bentley driven by Goodman, right. Goodman said he drank from a bottle of liquor he found after the crash - the reason he was over the limit . Deadly: Wilson family members look at the Bentley Goodman was driving when he ran a stop sign in 2010 . Earlier the judge dismissed a final . plea from the defence to overturn the sentence on the basis of an . admission by one of the jurors that he had deliberately got drunk to . test the effects of drinking as much as Goodman had on the night of the . crash. Mr Colbath agreed that the juror's . actions did constitute misconduct, but ruled that they had not . influenced the other jurors or affected the eventual verdict. The case sprang to national fame after Goodman, . the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Florida, . adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins . last October, entitling her to up to a third of his biological . children's trust fund, worth $300million. At the time the Wilsons' lawyers slammed the move as an attempt by Goodman to shield his assets. Grieving: Lili Wilson, the victim's mother, wept when Goodman's 911 call was played in court . Bill: The court was shown Goodman's receipt for drinks, bought for himself and others before the crash . Prosecutors successfully claimed that . Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into . Mr Wilson's car two years ago, causing it to roll into a canal. The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes. Goodman left the scene and waited an . hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery . as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene. After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit. At trial Goodman said he was sure of . one thing: he had two shots of tequila and two shots of vodka before the . crash, yet he was not drunk and that he drunk after the crash to . alleviate his pain. Newest family member: Goodman, right, adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend Heather Hutchins last fall. The move means she is entitled to up to a third of his biological children's $300 million trust fund . Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club, which Goodman founded, attracts A-list celebrities . Home sweet home: Goodman sold his mansion in Wellington, Florida to his children's trust for $3.8million and now pays $2,000 in rent each month . After leaving a bar, he said his car . suddenly lurched forward into an intersection 'and I began to apply my . brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used . to,' he said. Unable to control the vehicle, it . slammed into the side of Scott's - even though Goodman said he was not . aware he had hit another driver so left the scene. If he had known someone had plunged into the canal, 'I would have done whatever I could have done to help', he claimed. Goodman then went to a nearby barn where he found a bottle of liquor, the Miami Herald reported. 'I ... drank it to alleviate, . thinking it would help with my pain,' he said, claiming it was the . reason his blood alcohol content was more than double the legal driving . level when his blood was taken three hours after the crash. Mr Wilson was a University of Central . Florida graduate and was working as a civil engineer at the time of the . crash. He had been driving home to Wellington to visit his family when .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:40 EST, 19 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:28 EST, 21 May 2012 . The father of a young Georgia woman fighting a flesh-eating bacteria revealed last night his daughter is now breathing on her own. Aimee Copeland was taken off the ventilator for several hours yesterday, the latest milestone in her recovery, said Andy Copeland. Aimee 'is breathing completely on her own! How cool is that?,' her father wrote late on Sunday on his blog, where he's been providing regular updates on the 24-year-old's condition. Stoic: Aimee Copeland has now been removed from a ventilator at the Georgia hospital after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria . 'Aimee is being Aimee,' Mr Copeland added in the latest update. 'She's cracking jokes, speaking frankly, displaying her usual early morning grumpiness and she has been off of the ventilator for over 10 hours.' The University of West Georgia student developed a rare condition called necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a May 1 fall from a homemade zip line over a river. She's since had most of her left leg amputated at Augusta Hospital. Her father said she was told late last week that her hands and remaining foot would also need to be amputated. Her recovery has brought support from all over the world. Her father said in his latest update that he was grateful for the outpouring of concern. 'The level of prayer and support has been phenomenal and we intend to read every card and send thank you cards for every gift,' he wrote. Traumatic: The 24-year-old student from an Atlanta suburb remains in a critical condition as she battles an infection called necrotizing fasciitis . Distraught: Paige Copeland, center, cries as her parents Donna and Andy Copeland speak about their daughter Aimee after she had her leg amputated . When Ms Copeland learned she would lose her hands and remaining foot on Saturday, she responded by saying: 'Let's do this.' Mr Copeland wrote about the difficult talk he had a day earlier with his daughter after the 24-year-old woman contracted the condition. He said she 'shed no tears, she never batted an eyelash. I was crying because I am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady', Andy Copeland wrote. Ms Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from a homemade zip line earlier this month over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound. He said he was finally able to tell his daughter on Thursday what had happened since that outing, and how she's been the focus of an outpouring of love from around the world. Andy Copeland, father . 'We told her that the world loved and admired her,' he wrote in Friday's update. 'We explained that she had become a symbol of hope, love and faith.' He recalled how Aimee's eyes widened, her jaw dropped. Then, Copeland took his daughter's hands and held them up to her face. 'She didn't draw back in horror. She knew the condition she was in,' he wrote. He explained that doctors believed her hands were hampering her progress, and they must be removed. Aimee nodded, her father said. 'She smiled and raised her hands up, carefully examining them,' her father wrote. 'She then looked at us. We all understood her next three words - ""Let's do this"".' The 24-year-old student from an Atlanta suburb remains in a critical condition as she battles the infection. Doctors hoped they would be able to save her remaining foot after two days of treatment using a hyperbaric chamber, in which patients breathe pure oxygen to boost white blood cells and accelerate healing. Cherished: Miss Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate from Georgia, has fun with friends . But they later learned that they would have to amputate it and her fingers. The flesh-eating bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, emit toxins that cut off blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat and skin tissue. Only a week ago, doctors gave her little chance of survival. But in recent days she has been alert and bored enough to have asked for a book to read. Doctors had to amputate most of Miss Copeland's left leg to save her life. She has been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in he throat, but her parents said they've learned to read lips and are now able to communicate with their daughter, who was also asking for ice-cream. 'This doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Mr Copeland said earlier this week. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely amazed. Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father has said the progress she has made after contracting the aggressive virus was a 'miracle' Much-loved: Aimee's friends and family are praying for her survival and eventual recovery (from left - Aimee, mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige) He said the family also wanted to make sure a hospital counselor was available to help Miss Copeland once she is informed of her condition. Losing a limb is extremely difficult emotionally, and can be particularly difficult for young people, said Dr. Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. 'There is a process that they go through, a grief process,' said Kaslow, who is not involved in Miss Copeland's care. 'There is shock, disbelief, anger, sadness and then a period of reconciling one to the situation and healing and figuring out how they are going to move forward in their life.' Doctors at the local emergency room in Carrollton closed the wound she suffered in the zip line accident with nearly two dozen staples, but it became infected within days. On May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital. Copeland's father said she faces a long recovery not just from her amputation but also from kidney failure and other organ damage caused by the infection. 'She's going to be here for months,' he said. 'She's going to need to regrow skin that was removed. She's going to need to learn to use prosthetics. She's going to still be on dialysis for a while.' Fun loving: Aimee's father, Andy, says describes her as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people' Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Aimee Copeland, 24, breathing on her own for first time since contracting infection .

Adrian Beecroft admitted a controversial report demanding companies are given the right to fire employees without giving a reason was 'based on conversations' A controversial report demanding companies are given the right to fire employees without giving a reason was 'based on conversations', its author Adrian Beecroft admitted today. The venture capitalist said he did not have time to conduct detailed research as he had only two months to complete the study for Downing Street's policy unit. Mr Beecroft rejected a claim by Labour MPs that the report was based on opinions and created an 'open door for bullying and intimidation'. Even if small businesses grew by 2 per cent as a result of his proposals, that would see the creation of 100,000 new jobs, he said. Speaking to a committee of MPs . examining the details of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill, Mr . Beecroft denied his research was based 'entirely on anecdotal evidence'. He said the case for making it easier . for small firms to hire and fire employees was 'self-evident', telling . MPs the UK's employment laws were a disincentive for firms to expand. The businessman, who has backed more . than 200 successful start-ups, said current rules had not been based on . statistical research, adding he had spoken to both employees and . employers as they battled through the tribunal process. Mr Beecroft said: 'If people are doing a job that is required but they are not doing it very well, they will be replaced. If people are doing a job that is not necessary, they will be made redundant. 'I should say that the work I was asked to do was a two-month piece of work covering all employment law so I was not able to generate new statistics. 'I will accept the accusation that my views on whether or not this would improve the efficiency of people working in businesses is based on conversations, not a statistically valid sample of people.' Mr Beecroft controversially told MPs the case for making it easier for small firms to hire and fire employees was 'self-evident' Labour MP Geraint Davies (Swansea West) said Mr Beecroft's report 'did not translate into the real world'. He said: 'It just seems to me that you've failed to look at robust, empirical evidence and relied on unreliable, out-of-date, anecdotal evidence to come to these prejudicial conclusions. 'I just want to know why you didn't look at reliable, quantitative studies and instead relied on unreliable, out-of-date opinion data which didn't translate into the real world? 'We therefore come up with a load of proposals which are an open door for intimidation and bullying.' Speaking outside the committee, Mr Beecroft said the attention his report had drawn had made him feel 'rather uncomfortable' but he would do it again as the Government planned to introduce 17 of his proposals. He said: 'There have been days when I probably thought I wouldn't (write a report again for Government). But there were more than 20 recommendations, most of which have been implemented and that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't written it so I am glad that I did.' Mr Beecroft's report to Downing Street exposed deep tensions in the coalition. Business Secretary Vince Cable dismissed the idea as 'complete nonsense' but many Conservatives backed the plans. He said the British economy will grow by 5 per cent less than expected, around £50 billion, if the Government fails make radical reforms to employment laws.","Adrian Beecroft said he did not have time to conduct detailed research .

After more than three decades of bitter controversy, a coroner ruled yesterday that a dingo was responsible for the death of a baby in the Australian Outback. The decision finally confirmed that a wild desert dog had entered the tent in which Azaria Chamberlain and her  family were staying, near Ayers Rock, and carried her away to her death. There were emotional scenes yesterday when the verdict was delivered. Azaria’s mother Lindy, now 64, tearfully embraced her former husband Michael and other  family members in the courtroom. Scroll down for video . Ruling: Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton was sentenced to life for murdering her baby Azaria 32 years ago. Today a coroner in Australia ruled that the youngster was taken by a dingo . Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton, as she is . known following her remarriage, served nearly four years of a life . sentence for murder before being released after new evidence was . discovered. In the 32 years since she cried out . in the night ‘A dingo’s got my baby!’, there have been four inquests and . a government inquiry into nine-week-old Azaria’s death. But it was the verdict delivered in . Darwin yesterday that has put the seal on whether or not a dingo was . responsible. Lindy Chamberlain and baby Azaria pictured shortly before her disappearance in 1980 . Elizabeth Morris, the Northern Territory coroner, said she . was ‘satisfied that the evidence is sufficiently adequate, clear, cogent . and exact and that the evidence excludes all other reasonable . possibilities’ than that the baby was taken by one or more dingoes. The case, which divided Australians, . inspired six books and a 1988 Hollywood movie A Cry in the Dark, . starring Meryl Streep as Lindy Chamberlain. Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton . was jailed in 1982 after being found guilty of slashing her daughter’s . throat and making it look like a dingo attack. She was released in 1986 after . Englishman David Brett fell to his death while climbing Ayers Rock – . known today by its Aboriginal name of Uluru – and landed beside a . matinee jacket that was vital to her defence. Mrs Chamberlain-Creighton . had told police that no dingo saliva had been found on Azaria’s jumpsuit . because the baby was wearing a matinee jacket over the jumpsuit, but no . jacket was found at the time the child disappeared. A third inquest in 1995 could not . determine the cause of death. Mr Chamberlain, who was convicted of being . an accessory after the fact of murder but later exonerated, then fought . a long legal battle for a fourth inquest. That inquest heard new evidence of dingo attacks, including three fatal attacks on children since the third inquest. Beauty spot: Azaria was snatched from her tent at campsite near Ayers Rock. Her clothing was later found beside a dingo's lair . Trial: Lindy and Michael Chamberlain leave a courthouse in Alice . Springs, Australia in February 1982.

After more than a decade hanging in  a corridor, a never-before-seen picture of Prince William has emerged on to the art market. The portrait by distinguished painter John Wonnacott is one of only three canvases of the Prince thought to be in existence. But what makes the picture so unique is that it is a study of William as a schoolboy and was painted when he was just 17. Rare: The never-before-seen picture of the Duke of Cambridge - pictured here with his wife Kate - has made its way on to the art market . It is for that reason that his old school Eton are keen to obtain the painting. If they are successful, they will need deep pockets — or a generous benefactor. This week, the picture was quietly put up for sale by Agnew’s, the Mayfair art dealers, with a price tag of £120,000. Intriguingly, they are also selling another of Wonnacott’s portraits — this time of the Queen — for £20,000 less. The story of the 12in-by-9in oil is fascinating. In 1999, Wonnacott began work on a vast canvas of four generations of the Royal Family to mark the Queen Mother’s 100th birthday. It featured the Queen Mother, the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry. It was so large it had to be completed in five sections and fitted together, but it also involved a huge logistical operation.

Potential buyer: William's old school Eton (pictured) is keen to obtain the painting - but they will need deep pockets . Each of the royals sat seven times for the artist but separately. William, who was in his final year at Eton, was painted in his housemaster’s study. To complete the commission, Wonnacott worked on drawings he had made in his studio at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. It was from the drawings of William that the artist decided to make a separate painting. ‘I had no plans for it — it just hung in my “royal corridor” at my home,’ Wonnacott tells me. ‘No one knew I had done it.’ It might have remained there had not curators at Agnew’s come to look at some other work. ‘I think I was making them something to eat and they sneaked around to see what else I had got and saw the William picture and said they had to have it,’ Wonnacott says.

MPs have been given free corporate tickets to the most sought-after event at the Olympics – the men’s 100m final. Four members of the culture media and sport select committee have accepted the prized seats from BT, one of London 2012’s leading sponsors. Ministers have been banned from freebie trips to the Games. But the culture committee chairman, John Whittingdale, gave BT permission to offer the hottest tickets in town – worth £420 each – to his members because they have been scrutinising the Games for five years. Gold dust: Culture committee chairman John Whittingdale (left) gave BT permission to give away the coveted tickets while Tory MP Philip Davies (right) admitted to accepting one . BT confirmed last night that four of the 11 MPs on the committee have so far accepted seats. The news came as it was revealed the military is to provide up to 3,500 extra personnel for the Games after a private firm admitted it could not supply enough guards to protect the public. Last night critics said the MPs’ decision to take up BT’s offer represented a conflict of interest, since the committee is a watchdog over telecoms issues. BT has also made a multi-million pound move into the sports rights market winning the right to screen Premier League football for the first time. The MPs’ decision to accept free tickets will enrage the millions of people who have found it impossible to get any Olympic seats at all. Fury: Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, condemned the decision . BT are keen to stress that they are not laying on a lavish hospitality package around the 100m final on August 5, like those costing around £7,000 which have been offered on the open market. But the MPs will be taken to the BT Tower in London where they will attend a briefing on the company’s role in the Games before being ferried to the Olympic Stadium where they will watch the race. Yesterday Tory MP Mr Whittingdale defended his right to a free seat at the 100m final. He said: ‘BT are having a briefing on their involvement in the Olympics. My committee has spent five years having regular sessions on the preparations for the Olympics. It’s not terribly surprising that we might have wanted to go and have a look. ‘This is not the first time I’ve been to events with BT or companies that operate in the area that we scrutinise. But they are a major sponsor of the Olympics and have put a huge amount of money into the Games. ‘It would be utterly extraordinary if we didn’t take a look at the Games. I don’t see that this compromises the committee at all.’ He admitted he is also attending Olympic events with the organising committee Locog and other events on behalf of the Government. But he admitted the tickets to the star event of the entire games was ‘a great invitation’ and added: ‘Of course I want to go to the 100m men’s final. It’s one of the most exciting events.’ He also conceded the tickets ‘might encourage people to attend the BT briefing’. Tory MP Philip Davies also admitted that he has accepted a ticket to the 100m and said: ‘Somebody invited us to go along. We’ve been scrutinising the Olympics for ages. I don’t see why we shouldn’t go along and have a look at the Games.’ Olympic stadium: Thousands of fans were not able to get tickets to the Games . Main event: Jamaica's Usain Bolt (R) wins the men's 100m final at the National stadium as part of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games . But a Cabinet Office note circulated to ministers told them: ‘The presumption for all invitations should be that they are declined. Should you feel there is an exceptional case to justify attendance it will need to be supported by a business case and to come to the Cabinet Office for approval.’ Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, condemned the decision of the MPs to accept, pointing out that the MPs will not have to declare the tickets on the Register of Members Interests until three months after the Games. Four members of the culture media and sport select committee have accepted the prized seats from BT, one of London 2012¿s leading sponsors . He said: ‘I am sure most people would be appalled that MPs are being given special treatment when the rest of the population have had to go through all sorts of hoops to get a volleyball ticket. ‘It is appalling that they can accept these tickets and they don’t have to declare them until after the Olympics are over. If people are accepting offers of this sort they should declare them immediately and let their constituents make a judgment about whether they are appropriate or not.’ Tamasin Cave, of the pressure group SpinWatch, said: ‘You can understand why MPs would jump at these tickets, but to accept them shows very poor judgment. These tickets are like gold dust – thousands applied for them. ‘Corporate hospitality as a lobbying tactic runs through our politics. This raises the question of what BT hopes to get in return. It looks very much like they are trying to curry favour with a group of MPs whose job it is to monitor its industry.’ Former MP and anti-sleaze campaigner Martin Bell said: ‘If I were an honourable member and the public are paying hundreds of pounds for tickets I would wonder why MPs get to go for free and what was expected in return. ‘MPs have to be very careful about conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest.’ Several members of the culture committee, which has shot to prominence as a result of its role investigating the News of the World phone hacking scandal, have turned down the tickets on the grounds that they don’t think the offer is appropriate. Doing the right thing: Labour MP Tom Watson decided not to take a ticket while Tory Louise Mensch said she had considered taking the ticket before declining . Labour’s Tom Watson, the most . high-profile member of the committee, told the Mail: ‘I’ve taken a . personal decision not to accept freebies. This is the sports committee . and if any section of Parliament is going, it should be them. But on a . personal level I applied for tickets and couldn’t get any and I’d feel a . bit uncomfortable doing it this way.’ At least two other members of the committee, former Labour sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe and Lib Dem Adrian Sanders, will not attend the 100m final, but are likely to see some of the events since they are Olympic ambassadors charged with accompanying foreign dignitaries to events. Fellow Tory Louise Mensch said she had considered taking the ticket before declining. She said: ‘I have turned it down but I’m glad John Whittingdale is going to see how they handle the flagship event as he has been supervising our inquiry for years. I don’t need to see it myself but I am happy to delegate.’ Labour MPs Paul Farrelly and Jim Sheridan said they had also not taken tickets from BT. The remaining committee members – Tories Therese Coffey, Damian Collins and Labour MP Steve Rotherham – all failed to return calls, though it is thought that two of them have accepted tickets. A spokesman for BT said: ‘The cross party committee have a remit that covers the Olympics and so as a major sponsor we feel it is appropriate to brief them on BT’s role in helping to deliver the Games as well as the impact for the legacy programme and local regeneration. The briefing concludes with our hosting them at the stadium. ‘Four members of the committee have accepted to date and the cost to BT is under £500 per guest. ‘The vast majority of the tickets we have bought are going to our retail customers through our Record Breakers promotion or our employees for reward and recognition.’ An amendment has been made to this article since publication after Jim Sheridan MP contacted us.  He wished to confirm that whilst he was offered Olympic tickets, he did not accept the offer.","Four members of the culture media and sport select committee have accepted seats to the men's 100 metre final .

Bus lane cameras have raked in £1m in less than three months after they were installed to catch out motorists. As part of the bus lane crackdown, CCTV cameras were installed at 11 locations on busy main roads leading into Glasgow city centre. More than 39,000 penalties have been issued – equivalent to more than 500 a day. Hefty fine: With CCTV cameras in 11 locations it's no wonder they've drawn in £1 million in just 11 weeks from spots like this where drivers drive through the bus gate at Hope Street and Waterloo Street Junction . The law-breaking drivers must pay a £60 fine which is cut to £30 if paid within two weeks. A similar scheme in Edinburgh was suspended just weeks after its launch when the council was bombarded with complaints from angry motorists. Jim Coleman, Glasgow City Council’s transport spokesman, said: ‘The minority of drivers who abuse bus lanes inconvenience others and their behaviour can lead to danger to pedestrians, cyclists and other road users and also reduces the effectiveness of the city’s public transport service. The plans: The cameras in bus lanes are to encourage commuters to use public transport . ‘Having measures in place to ensure bus services can run in dedicated lanes without being snared up in traffic is one of many ways to make drivers aware of the benefits of switching to public transport.’ Stephen Flynn, vice chairman of Glasgow Taxis, said: ‘These dedicated bus and taxi lanes can help to ease public transport flow in, out and through Glasgow, in particular in and around the city centre. ‘What this crackdown has highlighted is the sheer number of people who were flouting the rules and contributing to unnecessary congestion. ‘It is a staggering number and it seems very unfair that the majority of drivers should obey the rules while a minority continues to ignore them.’","Part of a bus lane crackdown, CCTV cameras at 11 locations have been installed in Glasgow .

An Asbo pensioner who terrorised his neighbours living in a quiet village for 14 years has been jailed after he threw mud at their windows. Richard Dawe, 78, breached a restraining order banning him from walking on a path next to his neighbours’ properties.

'But you have . not,' Judge Juckes told him, adding: 'You have found it necessary to . intimidate, frustrate, harass and annoy those about you.

'Horrific': Peter Lizon allegedly tortured his wife and made her kneel in front of him, claims he denies . The attorney of the husband accused of enslaving his wife for ten years, chaining her up and beating her in a brutal catalogue of abuse has claimed that someone made up the allegations. Employees at a rental store said that 43-year-old . Stephanie Lizon, from West Virginia, hid from her husband, Peter Lizon, 37, while he . returned a rototiller attachment. She then went to a shelter for domestic violence . victims, limping, gaunt, filthy and covered in scars, including a burn . scar shaped like a clothing iron, according to police documents. But Shawn Bayliss, Peter Lizon's . attorney, said the allegations are 'the fabrication of a fertile . imagination or a feeble mind, one of the two'. 'The alleged victim didn't make these accusations. It was a third party,' Mr Bayliss said. 'Stephanie would say this story is absolutely untrue, and the charges levied against her husband are blatantly false.' He said today that he was in contact with Stephanie Lizon but did not immediately make her available for an interview. The details of the alleged abuse came out after Stephanie fled from the couple's Leroy home on July 2 in Parkersburg, which is about 50 miles north, along Interstate 77. She entered another part of the building while her husband was inside Bosley Rental & Supply and told the staff: 'I'm trying to get away from my husband. I just need to hide for a few minutes.' The employee declined to give her name, citing concern for her safety and that of her co-workers at the rental shop. In an office, the wife 'seemed pretty calm but kept looking out the window to see if he was looking for her,' the employee said. Mrs Lizon told the staff she didn't want to involve police, but she accepted the number for the domestic violence shelter and called it, the store employee said. She also called family to ask for money, and the employees gave her cash and called a cab to take her to a Western Union office and the shelter. The woman was limping and had appeared to have some sort of injury, the store employee said. And while her clothing was clean, she smelled bad. The employee also told investigators that . the victim's fingers looked crooked, and that Lizon's wife had told her . her husband had broken her fingers. The husband did not come inside looking for his wife and police didn't come until several days later, the employee said. Scroll down for video . Lizon's wife escaped the house of horrors on July 2 and hid in a Zumba dance facility while her husband was running an errand . At the shelter, however, Mrs Lizon told another woman about the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her husband, a native of the Czech Republic, according to the criminal complaint. The wife said her family was from Alexandria, Virginia. Stephanie Lizon's father declined to discuss the case when contacted by the AP. Relatives of her husband didn't immediately return messages. Investigators said they have 45 photographs showing burns on her back and breasts from irons and frying pans, and scars on her wrists and ankles. Now her husband is in jail and authorities are investigating what Jackson County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Tony Boggs called one of the most terrible cases he's seen. 'This appears to go beyond abuse to what I would consider torture,' he said Wednesday. Shocked: Deputy sheriff Tony Boggs said the case appeared to amount to torture and that such things 'should never be allowed to happen' The criminal complaint said a witness at the Parkersburg shelter provided the following account: . She described Mrs Lizon as 'gaunt and filthy' and covered in scars, bruises and burns. She had 'mutilated and swollen' feet, a scar in the shape of a clothes iron on one breast, and burns on her back that the victim said came from a hot frying pan. She said her husband had smashed her foot with a piece of farm equipment, among other things. The wife said she was called a 'slave' and ordered to kneel before her husband every time she entered a room. The wife also said she had delivered a fully developed, stillborn child while in shackles, and her husband buried the corpse on their farm. Another child survived a similar delivery, but Mrs Lizon said the child had never received medical attention. She had scar tissue on her hands and ankles, which police believe is from chains tearing into her flesh. Boggs of the sheriff's office said state child-welfare authorities have been notified, but Peter Lizon's attorney said the child — a one-year-old boy — remains with his mother. The complaint says investigators confirmed that the wife was treated in the emergency room of St Joseph's Hospital in June and that photographs were taken at the shelter to document her injuries. A Sunbeam iron was among the items seized during a July 5 search of the couple's home. Lizon was arrested that day. But Mr Bayliss compared the charges to the childhood game of 'telephone', where something whispered from one person to another ultimately bears no resemblance to reality. 'This is a situation where a person has taken a nugget of information, taken an acorn and tried to turn it into a tree,' he said. 'And the tree won't support this story.' Back in Leroy, only a handful of houses dot the side of the approximately two-mile road where the couple lives. In the front yard, signs read 'No Trespassing' and 'Guard Dog on Duty', although no dog could be seen. 'Mutilated': The Czechoslovakian allegedly ran over his wife's feet with a tractor and delivered the couple's baby himself while she remained chained up . One of two brightly colored barrels . was filled with dozens of empty bottles of imported beer near a black . van with no license plate. Nobody answered the door at a neighbor's home. Nearby, screen doors were open and music could be heard coming from inside. Cliff Boggess, 62, has lived in the . area since 2005 and rode his all-terrain vehicle past the home Wednesday . evening. He said he was shocked by the news and said he's never noticed . any human activity at the house. 'Nothing. And I guarantee, that's the . same answer you'll get from everybody around here,' Boggess said. 'This . guy, whoever he (is), I've never seen him.' Both Peter and Stephanie Lizon were . arrested in Maryland in 2004 and later performed community service for . cutting up Bush-Cheney campaign signs with a bayonet. Court records also show that Mrs . Lizon was arrested on drug charges a few months later in Baltimore . County. She pleaded guilty and got probation. The West Virginia Division of . Corrections said it had no history of criminal actions by either spouse, . and Boggs said the sheriff's department had no previous contact with . them, either. Lizon is being held in the South Central Regional Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail. Jackson County Deputy Sheriff Tony Boggs said: 'This is a case that is . tenfold of what our average domestic is and maybe more than that. It . comes down to what appears to be slavery and torture.

She broke her back and now walks with a stick . A woman who claims it was her landlord's fault she broke her back after falling down stairs is suing for a six-figure compensation payout. Gillian Drysdale was carrying a 30 inch box and stepping backwards up the steps when she lost her footing during heavy rain in October 2008. Ms Drysdale, who broke her back in the fall and now walks with a stick, claims her landlord Joanne Hedges should bear responsibility for her fall. The 44-year-old mother attended the High Court today to sue Mrs Hedges, who owned the house in Harwich, Essex. Ms Drysdale, who spent only one night in the house before the accident, says paint used on the steps made them slippery and there was no suitable handrail to stop her falling. Lawyers representing Mrs Hedges, whose husband Steve Hedges had painted the steps leading up to the door of the Victorian property, are contesting liability on her behalf. Michael Pooles QC for Mrs Hedges asked Ms Drysdale: ‘The real problem was that it was very, very wet and you were going up backwards? ‘You presumably weren’t looking where you were going?’ Giving evidence in court, Ms Drysdale, now of Diss, Norfolk, said she had moved to Harwich from Scotland the night before she fell. With the removal driver desperate to get to Essex and back in one day, Ms Drysdale and her family were in a hurry to unload her belongings into the home. She said she was watching her feet and . moving up step-by-step but did not think the flight was dangerous until . she slipped and fell over the side. Proceedings: At the High Court (pictured) Ms Drysdale's barrister Niazi Fetto called an unguarded drop of eight ft on one side of the steps was 'unreasonable' Her barrister, Niazi Fetto, said: ‘We say that, by putting smooth paint on steps that were naturally rough in texture and were exposed to the elements, the defendant was responsible for creating a risk and unreasonably and negligently so. ‘It was a risk that was manifestly foreseeable. ‘What is more, it must be considered in relation to the potential severity of the consequences of that risk, that is, the virtually unguarded drop of eight feet to one side of the steps. ‘We say there was an obvious risk associated with steps anyway, these steps in particular, whether the paint made them smoother or more slippery or not. ‘It is unreasonable in the circumstances where there is a drop of over eight feet to one side not to erect some sort of guard or handrail against that risk. ‘The steps were outside. They’re liable to become dirty, as well as wet or frosty, and that adds to the level of risk that ought to be foreseen when, firstly, painting them so they become smoother and, in any event, when considering what might happen to someone using the steps.’ Deputy High Court Judge, John Leighton Williams QC, has now reserved his judgment on the case and will give his ruling at a later date.","Gillian Drysdale fell down outdoor steps while moving into the Harwich, Essex house, breaking her back .

Motorists experienced an early taste of Olympic chaos to come today as preparation work on new VIP ‘Games Lanes’ caused severe delays and tail-backs of up to two hours on several key routes into the capital. The gridlock came as Transport for London imposed restrictions while work was carried out on the reserved lanes, which are designed to speed up the journeys of Olympic VIPs and athletes from Wednesday. But drivers in and around the capital suffered today as work preparing the lanes got underway ahead of their official introduction. Worse to come: Traffic jams formed on the A40 and other major routes into London today with days to go until the Games . This preparatory work includes closing off some side-roads, banning some existing turns, and phasing traffic lights to red to give priority to official Games vehicles. Queues built up at major routes as transport chiefs phased lights to red to deter drivers from entering the capital. Traffic information company INRIX, . which supplies data to Sat-Nav firms, said a lane restriction on the A13 . Newham Way in east London led to two-hour delays for traffic heading . into London. It also reported delays of up to 90 . minutes for drivers coming into London on the M40 due to a lane . restriction on the A40 at Hanger Lane in west London. It noted: ‘Congestion double on the . A12, A13 and A40 from 36 minutes of congestion on an average Monday to . 80 minutes this morning. ‘Motorists struggled with 2-hour . journeys from the M40 at Denham in to the Westway, with a similar time . to travel between Dagenham and Aldgate on the A13. Journeys on the A12 . between Redbridge and Blackwall were taking an hour as well.’ Other worst affected routes were the A234 at Crystal Palace and the M20 into the city centre. There was further chaos as a man dived head-first off Tower Bridge into the Thames during a protest by taxi drivers over their ban from using the Olympics Games Lanes network. Police pulled him from the water under the landmark bridge, from which Olympic rings are suspended to celebrate the 2012 London Games, and arrested him on a public order offence. Stunt: A cabbie jumps headfirst into the Thames as others stage a slow protest across Tower Bridge .

He was arrested for a public order offence . Protest: Black Taxis block Tower Bridge earlier today . Cab drivers are angry that they are banned from using the Olympic Games Lanes network . A Metropolitan Police spokesman told the BBC: 'Around 4pm a man who was taking part in a planned demonstration jumped into the River Thames from Tower Bridge. 'Officers from the marine policing unit rescued the man. He has been arrested for a public order offence.' The man, who has not been named, had been taking part in the protest by London taxi drivers over a decision to keep them off part of a road network reserved for Olympic athletes. The drivers are worried that they will be stuck in congestion and will lose money during the Games. Yellow route: . Roads on this route have a dedicated 'Olympic-only' lane for athletes, . officials, VIPs, sponsors and media. The lanes will be in force from 6am . until midnight.Red route: . Roads on this route, the busiest 'core section' of the VIP network, . will be affected by major restrictions to speed up traffic but will be . fully open to the public. Measures could include bans on parking and . right-turns, suspension of pedestrian crossings, phasing of traffic . lights and no public entry from side roads.Blue route: Roads . on this route will only be affected on competition days. They will run . from the athletes' accommodation to venues such as Wembley Arena, Earls . Court and Wimbledon. Drivers in central London were also hit, with tailbacks in Holborn, Whitehall and Parliament Square. A two-car crash on the M4 motorway . brought traffic to a near standstill on the eastbound Heathrow link - a . key route for thousands of Olympic officials and athletes arriving at . Heathrow which has its own ‘Games lane’ which opened last Monday. It highlights how unplanned incidents can quickly escalate gridlock. The jams are a taste of things to . come  as motorists brace themselves for further misery when the 30 miles . of Olympic-only ‘Zil’ lanes are activated for Wednesday’s rush hour. There were severe delays today on one of the key Tube lines that will ferry people to the Olympics. The problem was at North Greenwich close to the Olympic site at Stratford. It meant long hold ups on the Jubilee line in the early part of the morning rush hour. The delays also affected passengers on the London Overground - another key Olympic route. The full 107-mile Olympic Road . Network, including the controversial reserved 30 miles of ‘Games Lanes’, . go live from 6am on Wednesday ahead of the opening ceremony on Friday, . with drivers straying into them facing £130 fixed penalty fines. Meanwhile, more than 1,300 sets of traffic lights are being altered to give priority to Olympic vehicles. AA president Edmund King said: . ‘Re-phasing of lights is probably having more effect than Games lanes, . most of which are not in force until Wednesday. School holidays normally . sees a drop in traffic but that certainly wasn’t felt this morning. The . west side of M25 was incredibly slow from 7am.’ There was widespread confusion among . motorists and cyclists in central London struggling with hundreds of . banned turns, including on the Victoria Embankment - a key route between . the Olympic Park and VIP hotels in Park Lane -  following a right turn . into Northumberland Avenue being blocked off over the weekend. By contrast, roads where traffic was . not artificially constrained by re-phased traffic lights were . exceptionally quiet at the start of the school holidays, against a . background of repeated warnings from transport bosses to avoid central .

U.S. Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is due to visit Britain this week . Senior Tory, Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs are urging U.S Presidential contender Mitt Romney to support changes to the hugely controversial UK/U.S Extradition Act during his visit to Britain. In an open letter to Mr Romney, they urge him to back calls for UK and US citizens to be afforded the same legal protection. Currently, Americans enjoy legal rights which are not available to Britons such as Gary McKinnon, who the U.S is seeking to extradite for hacking into military computers while searching for evidence of little green men. The letter, signed by Tory backbencher Dominic Raab, ex-Lib Dem leader sir Ming Campbell and the Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, Keith Vaz, says changing the extradition rules would help to strengthen relations between the two countries. It says: ‘One issue which is controversial is the question of our extradition relations, which have generated widespread public and Parliamentary concern. ‘In December, the House of Commons unanimously voted for reform of UK extradition laws, including the arrangements under the US-UK treaty.  As a result, in March at the White House, President Obama agreed to Prime Minister David Cameron's request for a review of those arrangements. ‘If you are President, would you be willing to do the same? ‘All we ask is that the same evidential procedure is applied in UK courts as US courts for deciding whether our citizens should be extradited, and that a forum test is introduced so that, in cross-border cases, our respective courts can decide where the case should be tried bearing in mind all the relevant interests of justice. ‘Would you be willing to look sympathetically at such changes? They would be enormously appreciated by those in my country who want to see the special relationship go from strength to strength.’ Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama has already agreed to Prime Minister David Cameron's request for a review of the extradition arrangements. He is pictured, right, with Cameron during a visit to Downing Street . Last month it emerged how seven times . more British citizens have been sent to the US under the lopsided Act . than there have been Americans sent in the opposite direction. Home Office figures revealed how the . hugely controversial treaty is being used by the US authorities far more . often than their British counterparts. Since 2004, 99 people have been extradited from the UK  to the US. Yet only 44 people have been extradited from the US to the UK – fewer than half as many. Tory backbencher Dominic Raab, pictured left, and the Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee MP Keith Vaz, pictured right, both signed the letter addressed to Mr Romney . When the figures are broken down by nationality, the picture is even more stark. Gary McKinnon, pictured, faces being hauled to the US for crimes committed from the bedroom of his north London home . Some 35 British nationals have been . extradited from the UK to the US. But as few as 5 US citizens have been . extradited from the US to the UK. Britain has extradited more of its . nationals to the United States in the last six months – seven - than the . United States has sent its nationals to the UK in the last five years, . according to data unearthed by Mr Raab. The figures will heighten demands for . changes to the Act, which was passed by Labour in 2003, and is . currently under review by the Home Secretary. Critics say it is biased against UK . nationals. Britain must provide the US authorities with ‘such . information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the . person sought committed the offence for which extradition is requested. This is known as the ‘probable cause’ test – and means that U.S citizens have the right to a court hearing to . examine the evidence against them. However, if the US want to extradite a . UK citizen, they need only to outline the alleged offence, the . punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of . the suspect sought. The most high-profile victim of the . Act is Mr McKinnon, 46, who faces being hauled to the US for crimes . committed from the bedroom of his north London home.

A desperate WWII veteran killed himself with a shotgun because he feared he would have to go into a care home and loose his independence, an inquest heard. George Duckmanton, 88, whose eyesight was failing, was terrified by his deteriorating health and did not want to lose his freedom. Mr Duckmanton, a retired sergeant who served with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, was ‘fiercely independent’ and desperately did not want to move out of his own home despite the fact he was going blind. George Duckmanton, left age 22, in India during the Second World War, and right age 65 with his late wife Jean at home in Heighington, Lincoln.  He shot himself because he 'didn't want to go into a home' Lincoln Coroner’s Court heard Mr Duckmanton climbed through a fence onto a railway embankment behind his home and shot himself. The court heard the shotgun was an heirloom given to him by his father. Nephew David Easton, 73, said today that George ‘hated institutions’ and was trying to cling on to his independence. Grandfather-of-four Mr Easton, from Osbournby, Linconshire, said: ‘He was not on his own. He had a lovely community around him - some of his neighbours had lived next door to him for 40 years. ‘He was independent and enjoyed the company of his neighbours and going to church. ‘His road was like a caricature of what England used to be like. It had a real sense of community - he was extremely fortunate. ‘I think he worried what it would be like if he was taken out of the community. He hated institutions.

I am too - it must be in the genes. Like many of us he wanted to be in control of his own life. ‘We were not planning to put him in a home in near future, it must have just been his anxieties.

"By . Thomas Durante, Meghan Keneally and Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 01:43 EST, 28 July 2012 . A Houston attorney's crazed ex-mistress has been sentenced to 20 years prison after the 'monster' hired three separate hitmen to murder her lover's wife. Michelle Gaiser, 39, was handed the sentence today as part of a plea deal, just a week after claiming Jeffrey Stern - the man in the centre of the love triangle - made her orchestrate his wife Yvonne Stern's killing with a web of transsexual prostitutes, money and deviant sex. At the sentencing, Ms Stern, who was shot in the stomach in a parking lot by the third assassin after two earlier attempts to kill her failed, accused the Harris County District Attorney's Office of being 'corrupt' by offering the agreement. Scroll down for video . Affair: Michelle Gaiser, left, and Jeffrey Stern, right, were said to have had an 'intense' multi-year affair . 'It is clear that this monster is . very unstable and she should spend the rest of her existence behind bars . where she cannot attempt to kill anyone else,' Ms Stern said. She had requested the plea deal be rejected. Mr Stern had faced two counts of soliciting capital murder but earlier . this week prosecutors dropped the charges against him due to . insufficient evidence. The 55-year-old has admitted the affair with Ms . Gaiser but insisted he was not involved in the multiple attempts to kill . his wife. Ms Stern has stuck by her husband through the affair and murder-for-hire plot against her. She said she forgave her husband for his infidelity, claiming the pair had become victims of a 'fatal attraction' situation. After the hearing, Yvonne Stern . declined to speak to reporters but her attorney, Chip Lewis, called the . plea agreement 'laughable'. He accused District Attorney Pat Lykos of . agreeing to the deal to appease Ms Gaiser's defense attorney, James . Stafford, who he said was a long-time political ally and friend of Mr Lykos. Mr Lewis said prosecutors had promised Ms . Stern that Ms Gaiser would not be . offered anything less than 40 years in any plea agreement. Yvonne Stern told ABC's 20/20: 'The biggest joke of all. Jeff Stern's the mastermind. Is this the plot of a mastermind? My husband is brilliant. He would never be capable of doing such a terrible job' Still together: Mrs Stern has stuck by her husband despite the charges against him, which have been dropped . The former mistress paid three . different hitmen to kill Ms Stern. After the first attempt - a drive-by . shooting - failed, a second gunman missed her when he shot from behind . glass at the couple's front door. The woman was wounded in the third attempt, in May 2010, which saw her shot in the stomach. In a brief written statement, . prosecutor Kari Allen defended the agreement, saying Ms Gaiser's . cooperation led investigators to the man who shot Ms Stern. 'With today's plea agreement, the Harris County District Attorney's . Office has put a fourth person involved in attempts to murder Yvonne . Stern behind bars,' Ms Allen said. 'Combined, members of these . conspiracies have been sentenced to a total of ninety-five years in . prison.' Later Friday, in a separate written statement, Mr Lykos denied Lewis' claim that the plea agreement was done to benefit Ms Gaiser. 'Today's plea was (Allen's) decision, made after a careful review and . thoughtful deliberation of the facts surrounding the Stern affair,' Mr . Lykos said. 'I trust her judgment, and she has my full support.' Sentenced: Michelle Gaiser, 39, pictured centre at the hearing, was sentenced to 20 years prison as part of a plea deal after plotting to kill her lover's wife . Attempt: A hitman shot Mrs Stern in the stomach as she was sitting in her car in May 2010 . Mr Stafford denied claims his client was given special treatment. He said Ms Gaiser should have received less than 20 years . in prison because of the help she gave authorities. 'She is totally remorseful for what happened,' he said. A lawsuit Yvonne Stern filed in March against Ms Gaiser, seeking damages for the attempts on her life, is still pending. Papers filed last week by Ms Gaiser's . lawyers claim that she hired the men to kill her romantic competitor . because Jeffrey Stern was 'emotionally manipulative' and subliminally . convinced her that it was what he wanted. The Houston Chronicle reports that . the 14-page document is in response to Yvonne Stern's lawsuit in which . she holds Gaiser financially responsible for the three hit men. Gaiser's lawyers responded by saying . that Yvonne's husband should be held jointly-responsible, but that . solution will undoubtedly be rejected by Yvonne as she has stood by his . side and dismissed any accusations that he was involved in the . assassination attempts. Standing by her man: Yvonne Stern walks hand in hand with her husband Jeffrey as she insists he had nothing to do with her three attempted murders . Charges dropped: Houston attorney Jeffrey Stern, pictured on his wedding day with wife Yvonne, had all charged against him dropped on Tuesday . Happier times: Yvonne Stern, pictured with Jeffrey and their two kids, has forgiven her cheating husband . Crazy: Mr Stern admitted to the affair with Michelle Gaiser, pictured, but denied being involved in the murder plot . 'Through sexual grooming, emotional . manipulation, installation of fear creating dependence on him, . restricting her options, Jeffrey Stern pulled the strings that led to . the assault on his wife's life,' the report reads. The lawyers allege that during their sexual dalliances, Jeffrey would ask Ms Gaiser to describe how she would kill his wife. He would go on to say that she should get 'someone' to make those descriptions happen. 'The master plan was that Jeffrey Stern wanted his wife dead, dead, dead,' the report states. Hit man: Damian Flores is alleged to have approached Mrs Stern as she sat in her car and shot her in the stomach in April 2010 . It goes on to say that in addition to . these conversations, Ms Gaiser and Stern's deviant sex life allegedly . helped him assert control over her, which she argues prompted her . decision to have his wife killed. The couple met with transvestites and . transsexual male prostitutes. He flew her to Las Vegas for luxury . getaways. And he made her dress up in his wife's underwear and bra while . they had sex in the Stern's million-dollar Houston mansion. While the lawyers representing the . three main characters- as well as many of the characters themselves- in . this seemingly fictional court case have spoken freely with the press up . until this point, the judge has issued a gag order to keep them all . quiet leading up to the beginning of the trial later this month. Speaking to ABC's 20/20 in April, Yvonne . Stern said of the charges: 'It's preposterous, I've known this man for 30 years, I know . who I'm lying next to. 'The biggest joke of all. Jeff Stern's the mastermind. Is this the . plot of a mastermind? 'My husband is brilliant. He's smart. He's . talented. He would never be capable of doing such a terrible job.' Convinced her husband was not involved in the . plot against her, she says: 'I love my husband. I believe in him . wholeheartedly, in his innocence. He had nothing to do with this. We are . victims of a fatal attraction.' The previous accusation that emerged . amid the continued media interest in the case ever since Gaiser was . arrested was the assertion that Gaiser is now trying to take a hit on . her ex-lover. Stern's lawyer, Paul Nugent, claimed . Gaiser, 39, is trying to recruit an inmate to kill Stern, 54, who is . currently out on $1million bail. Nugent told ABC News: . 'Michelle Gaiser - from her jail cell - has plotted yet another murder. She has solicited an inmate to murder Jeffrey Stern for $20,000.' He added that it was her intention to make the killing look like a 'robbery gone bad.' The first murder attempt was in February 2010, when a hitman blasted Mrs Stern's $800,000 Bellaire home in a drive-by shooting. The mother-of-two and her children were not at home and escaped uninjured. Two months later, gunman Nhut Nguyen rang the . doorbell of her home and opened fire as she approached the door. Target: Twice a hitman came to their million dollar home in Houston and tried to kill Yvonne - but luckily they missed both times . But Ms Stern was able to . jump for cover as he shot through the glass. She told ABC's 20/20 in an April interview: 'Approaching the door, I still saw no one, and then I see this . man jump out of the wall with a gun in his hand and a smirk on his . face. 'The bullet hit the floor and ricocheted on the opposite wall...He barely missed.' After the second attempt Yvonne and the children moved to a nearby apartment while Jeffrey Stern worked to secure his home. It was there that the third attempt on her life took place in May, but this time the gunman didn't miss, shooting Ms Stern in the abdomen. The third gunman - which the prosecution claim is Damian Flores -  approached . Ms Stern as she sat in her car at their apartment's garage and pointed the gun at her head. She begged and . pleaded for her life and he walked away, only to turn around and point the gun to her . abdomen, shooting her in the stomach. Bleeding, she only survived by playing dead and driving to a nearby gas station for help. Wearing . an orange jail jumpsuit, Ms Gaiser said she hired Flores for $40,000 in . May 2010 after two previous attempts to kill Ms Stern failed. She . claimed that she had given him $15,000 in cash upfront and instructed . him to go to an apartment where Ms Stern had moved after the first two . shootings.

Spain’s unemployment rates have hit 25 per cent – the highest since records began after Generalissimo Franco's dictatorship. Spanish officials have confirmed today that a quarter of its population – and a shocking 53 per cent of young people – is currently without a job. This is the latest blow to the country’s economy as the government had hope the tourist season would help the country on its way out of recession. It is now looking towards a bleaker future, despite a vow of support from the European Central Bank, as 5.7 million Spaniards eligible for work stand unemployed. Although the number of people who lost their jobs was significantly less in the second quarter -  53,500 compared with 365,900 in the first quarter - the country’s unemployment rate is still the highest in the industrial world, the national statistics office said. A third of all unemployed in the Eurozone now live in Spain with more than half of those eligible to work under the age of 26 unemployed according to EU statistics agency Eurostat. The Bank of Spain last week estimated a contraction of 0.4 per cent, after a 0.3 per cent decrease in January to March, with the official economic growth figures expected next week. Spain's economy is reeling in the aftermath of a decade long real estate boom that crashed with the debt crisis, bringing the Spanish financial sector to the brink of insolvency. Under pressure from European authorities who have accepted to bailout Spanish banks, Spain's conservative government has approved tens of billions of euros' worth of spending cuts, tax hikes and other measures. The latest set of measures announced by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on July 11 aimed to save 65 billion euros (nearly £51 billion) over three years. Bleak future: People queue up at a job center in Madrid, Spain. It was announced today that 25 per cent of the Spanish workforce stand without employment . Rajoy says the steps will help cut the public deficit in line with targets agreed with the European Union and strengthen the economy in the long term. Critics say the measures will make the poor suffer unfairly from moves such as a public sector bonus cut and a rise in sales tax that together will hit consumption. Alberto Roldan, an analyst at Spanish brokerage Inverseguros, said: ‘All the spending cut policies they are taking are restrictive and run counter to growth. ‘Raising the fiscal pressure in a country with 25 per cent unemployment is absolutely regressive.’ No to cuts: Demonstrators during a protest in downtown Madrid, Spain earlier this year. Further cuts to public spending of £51 billion were announced two weeks ago with similar consequences . Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest at the measures. The . Spanish region hardest hit by rising unemployment was Catalonia in the . northeast with a rate of 33.92 percent, Friday's figures showed. The . lowest rate was 14.56 percent in the affluent Basque Country. Look of concern: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy attends a plenary session in Madrid . to debate the country's spiralling borrowing costs . The Spanish government's latest . unemployment forecast is for a rate of 24.6 percent at the end of 2012. This is a separate figure from that of the statistics office, an . autonomous state body. The government forecast unemployment will ease to 24.3 percent in 2013 and 23.3 percent in 2014. Spain's sovereign interest rates had risen to dangerous levels but eased . back Thursday after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi vowed ‘to . do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.’ The Madrid stock market was up fractionally by 0.15 per cent in early . afternoon trading Friday, after surging six percent Thursday on Draghi's . comments.

But organsiers were forced to make a grovelling apology to the North Korean team who refused to start theIR match against Colombia when the South Korean flag was displayed by mistake.

Officially, an estimated . 40,000 tickets had been sold - which would be a record for a women's . football international in Britain - but there were huge swathes of empty . seats when the match began as fans drifted into the stadium. There were plenty of seats to choose from as Great Britain and New Zealand emerged into the Millennium Stadium to get the 2012 Olympics underway . Fans get ready for the start of the Olympics at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, but there were plenty of empty seats at the Great Britain versus New Zealand women's football match . Those that did arrive early wouldn't have been too inspired by a goalless first-half, but Great Britain gained the upper hand after half-time. As . of yesterday, 36,200 tickets had been sold in advance - barely enough . to fill two tiers of the 74,000-capacity stadium - with a few thousand . expected to pick up £20 seats on the gate to watch Hope Powell's team. The unfilled seats would have come as a disappointment for Games organiser Lord Coe, who . was in Cardiff to officially declare the Olympics open. He said: 'We are ready, the nation is ready - let the Games begin. Lord Sebastian Coe was in Cardiff to officially declare the Olympics open before the first women's football match of the Games between Great Britain and New Zealand . 'It has been a long journey but I’m convinced these games will lift the nation and bring the country together. 'We’ve . proved the doubters wrong by getting everything ready on time and we’re . looking forward to making these Olympics a huge success. 'When I arrived in Cardiff I felt I had arrived in an Olympic city - this is the start of the Games in a fantastic setting. 'We haven’t left any stone unturned in giving the athletes the platform on which to perform.' Millennium Stadium general manager Gerry Toms stressed the historic nature of the occasion as a Team GB women's football team played in the Olympics for the first time. He said: 'There was some criticism that ticket sales were slow. 'But a normal women’s football game would attract about 6,000-8,000 and we are close to 40,000. 'Clearly there is an interest in the football and the Olympics. People who are not normally football fans want to be able to say that they were there.' The Great Britain team play New Zealand this afternoon in the first event of the 2012 Olympic Games . Meanwhile, 41,000 will be at Hampden Park in Glasgow this evening for a women's football double-header of the United States v France and North Korea v Columbia. While this will fill most of the 52,000-seater Scottish national stadium, only 6,500 of the tickets have actually been sold. The remainder have been given away to charities, youth groups and sports clubs. Organisers said overall 80,000 free tickets had been distributed for Hampden's eight Olympic matches. Two other games will be played today at the City of Coventry Stadium, which holds 32,500. The Millennium stadium had been cleaned and freshly painted for the occasion, the familiar red of the Welsh national rugby and football teams replaced by purple Olympic paraphernalia. The finishing touches are applied to Olympic branding at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff ahead of Team GB's women's football opener with New Zealand . Cardiff likes to shout about its sporting pedigree, and rightly so. Team GB boast a record number of Welsh athletes — 30 (which beats the 27 who appeared in 1908) — including two captains: Manchester United midfielder Ryan Giggs and 400 metres hurdles world champion Dai Greene. A giant set of Olympic rings, measuring 18m x 8m (59ft x 26ft), has been outside the City Hall since late April. Huge crowds cheered the Olympic torch when it visited Cardiff in May. Team GB striker Kelly Smith on the ball in a training session in Cardiff ahead of the Olympics opener against New Zealand . About £160,000 of taxpayers’ money has been spent on ‘cleansing and animating’ the city centre, which is prettily dressed in bunting to mark the 11 football matches it will hold over the next 16 days. But this hasn't translated into ticket sales. Tickets will be available on the gate today, starting at £20 with Under 16s paying their age. The ease of catching a train from London also means the city has seen only a modest rise in hotel bookings. A recent poll by Cardiff-based . newspaper The  Western Mail saw 52 per cent of 1,006 respondents agree . with the statement: ‘I don’t think Wales will see any benefits from the . London 2012 Olympics.’ It . was God Save The Queen that was rehearsed at the stadium yesterday, in . preparation for the arrival of a British team that does not include a . single Welsh player. But . the British team are looking forward to their chance to take . centre-stage in a home Olympic Games. Their match will be broadcast live . on BBC One from 3.30pm this afternoon. Those . in attendance at the Millennium Stadium will witness history, because . this is the first time a British women's football team has participated . in the Olympics. 'It is fantastic to be opening the Games and that we aren't competing with any other sport,' said Team GB captain Casey Stoney. 'This is as big as the World Cup.

Dispute: Edward Hall, 53, left, sent the poison notes . to former wife Bernie Hall’s, right, colleagues and the local press last . year after their relationship ended . That, however, was the situation Bernie . Hall, mayor of Marazion in West Cornwall, found herself in following the . end of her relationship with Edward Hall, after he sent a string of . malicious letters to smear her name. The letters, sent to Mrs Hall’s colleagues and the local press in May last year, included accusations that she had offered cocaine to others and had committed fraud by running up debts on credit accounts after the couple’s recent break-up. Truro Magistrates’ Court in Cornwall heard that Hall, 53, delivered six letters to Marazion Town Council, councillors and the local paper The Cornishman. Focusing on her job: Bernie Hall, Mayor of Marazion, was accused of being a drug-taking adulterer in a string of malicious letters sent by her ex-husband . He also sent letters to the Penwith . Community Development Trust (PCDT), where Mrs Hall worked in her main . job as head of community development on top of her role as mayor. In one letter to the PCDT, Hall,  of Marazion, wrote: ‘I’m going to expose your community youth manager for the damage she has done to my health.’ When questioned on the witness stand, Mrs Hall said the accusations were ‘a lot of lies’ and said she was ‘just trying to do a good job’. Hall insisted that he did not realise the letters would cause distress to his former wife. But he was found guilty of harassment without violence towards his former wife at Truro Magistrates’ Court on Monday and given a two-year conditional discharge. Hall was also placed under a restraining order for the same period, meaning that he should  not contact Mrs Hall during  that time, and ordered to pay £100 in costs.

The 16-year-old boy who admitted to Wisconsin police that he was the one to shoot his young neighbor with an arrow is now due to be tried as an adult. The local circuit court ruled Wednesday that the boy, who has not been named because he is a minor, will face the pending criminal charges as if he were two years older. The unidentified boy and a 17-year-old who was a witness to the scene, confessed during a second interview with police. Victim: Aryanna Schneeberg, 8, was shot in the back with an arrow when she was playing in her backyard . Life-saving: The young girl had to undergo a two-and-a-half-hour surgery to treat her injuries . 'They basically said that they shot an arrow at a squirrel and the arrow impacted the child and at that point they heard the child scream and obviously at that point they were afraid,' Sheriff Mylan Fink said at a press conference. 'You hear a scream and normally, your normal human reaction is to go towards that to see if you can help, not turn on your heels and run away,' Aryanna's grandmother told Fox6. The teen is currently in juvenile custody as the news about the adult sentencing coming today via the New York Daily News. The victim in the unusual crime was Aryanna Schneeberg, an eight-year-old girl who had to undergoe life-saving surgery after the arrow penetrated her lung, spleen, stomach and liver. Aryanna's mother said she was too angry to speak with reporters but the girl's grandmother said she hopes for an apology. Damage: The arrow went through her left lung, spleen and stomach with the tip coming to a stop in the liver . 'For me I'd like him to come face-to-face to Arie and say sorry,' she said. Recalling the horrific event at a news conference on May 22, before the two teens had come forward, Aryanna's mother Laura Schneeberg said, 'I screamed.' 'I [saw] it, she was on the sidewalk right in front of our house,' she said. During the police investigation, a bow and several arrows were confiscated from a nearby residence. Those items were sent to a crime lab for analysis. ‘We're leaving all of the evidence open on what could have happened,’ Fink said at the time of their investigation. ‘The working theory is a stray arrow, but that could change in a minute.' Her mother and her mother’s boyfriend both concurred that it was surely an accident but still wanted the person responsible to come forward so that police can talk with them. Arrest: A 16-year-old boy has been arrested after admitting to have mistakenly shot 8-year-old Aryanna Schneeberg one week ago with an arrow, nearly killing her . Lucky: Arynanna, seen this week after 2-1/2 hours of surgery, is lucky to be alive doctors said . 'Obviously it was an accident.  Somebody wasn’t pin-pointing her, but in town, it’s wrong to be shooting a bow,' Ms Schneeberg told Fox6. Ms Schneeberg's boyfriend echoed the sentiment, saying that they wanted to make sure it doesn’t threaten their daughter’s outdoor playtime. 'There’s kids out in the yard all the time. It’s kinda scary. There were four girls together and the arrow hit one of them. It could have hit any of them,' Andy Raasch said. The girl was transported to a local hospital and then taken to Milwaukee Children's Hospital in a Flight For Life helicopter. 'It's very, very rare to have an arrow injury. I've never seen it before,’ said her doctor John Densmore, during a news conference shortly after the incident. Angry: The girl's mother, Laura Schneeberg, seen at a press conference last week, was too angry to comment following the teen's arrest . Scene: Aryanna and three of her friends were playing in this yard when she was struck in the back by the arrow . The girl is ‘very lucky to be alive,’ he said. ‘Had we changed the trajectory by as little as two centimeters, this could have been a very bad outcome.’ Aryanna is also lucky that she had wise parents at the scene, as her mother chose not to remove the arrow before seeing a doctor because she was unsure how deep it went into her daughter’s body. Doctors say that was the smart choice, because she could have done more damage by removing the arrow and accidentally tearing some of the girl’s internal organs on the way out. Aryanna is was walking and talking shortly after the incident, but doctors initially was expected to be in the hospital for one to two weeks because she still has an NG tube draining her stomach and a drain running from her lung.","16-year-old boy admitted he was the one who shot an arrow that hit his 8-year-old neighbor Aryanna Schneeberg in the back .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 07:59 EST, 25 July 2011 . House Speaker John Boehner says he's working to get out a two-part plan to raise the nation's $14.3trillion debt limit, but he can't say whether it will include Democratic support. Boehner said that he hopes to have a bipartisan approach to solve the problem, but he's ready to move forward with a Republican plan if a deal couldn't be reached with President Obama today. The speaker flatly rejects the White House insistence that the plan get the country through the next election instead of offering a short-term fix while a longer-term solution can be worked out. Final stretch: U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner arrives at the U.S. Capitol on Sunday on Washington, D.C. for another day of debt talks with President Obama and top lawmakers . He told Fox News Sunday it's . 'not physically possible to do all of this in one step,' and said he . was focused on a package that was 'doable at the 11th hour.' 'It may be pretty hard to put Humpty Dumpty together again,' he said. Boehner's two-part deal includes a savings package first, followed by reforms to entitlement programs and the tax code. He hopes for bipartisan support, but . said 'if that's not possible, I and my Republican colleagues in the . House are prepared to move forward on our own... today.' Boehner said he would develop a package 'within the principles of Cut, Cap and Balance.' Meanwhile, as top lawmakers struggle today to . hammer out a deficit deal, debt ceiling negotiators have unveiled a new . solution to address how America can avert a catastrophic default and . hold onto its prized credit rating - by creating a new Congress. Tense negotiations: Boehner remains locked in debt limit negotiations with fellow congressional leaders and President Barack Obama . A . new 'Super Congress' or 'super-committee', comprised of members of both . chambers and both parties, is part of a new plan proposed by Senate . Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. The . proposal includes an unprecedented formation of a 12-member panel of lawmakers, in addition to legislation to lift the $14.3trillion debt ceiling. Legislation approved by the . proposed committee is intended to move quickly through both chambers and . could not be amended by lawmakers by casting an up or down vote, . reports the Huffington Post. The panel would thus be 'less . accountable than the system that exists today, and would find it easier . to strip the public of popular benefits,' the report suggests. Lawmakers are scrambling to . assure investors before Asian markets open on Monday that America can . avert a catastrophic default which would have devastating effects on the . global economy. Congressional staff planned to . work through the night after President Barack Obama told lawmakers in an . emergency White House meeting to find a way to lift the $14.3 trillion . limit on U.S. borrowing that would allow the world's largest economy to . pay its bills past next year's November election. Debt talks: President Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (R), House Speaker John Boehner (L) and across the table VP Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell meet at the White House . House Speaker John Boehner has . made a Super Congress a central part of his last-minute proposal, . multiple news reports and people familiar with his plan say. But new acrimony flared late . Saturday on Capitol Hill over that timetable, adding to the difficulties . facing negotiators who have been at impasse for weeks over the role of . taxes in any deficit reduction plan. An aide to Republican leaders said . lawmakers were working on a plan for $3trillion to $4trillion in savings . over ten years, but another high-ranking Republican official said no . numbers had been set. It was not clear if this package contained additional tax revenue alongside cuts in government spending, as Obama has demanded. Republican . leaders want 'to show progress' by 4pm ET on Sunday, before financial . market trading gets under way in Asia, and have legislation to unveil . Monday. 'Congressional . leaders are working in good faith with the goal of having something to . present to their members on Monday,' a second Republican aide said. Deadlock: President Barack Obama meets with U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner (L), U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (R) at a meeting with top lawmakers on Saturday . The . U.S. will run out of funds to service its debt on August 2 if Congress . does not approve additional borrowing. Republicans have insisted the . White House agree to deep spending cuts for long-term deficit reduction . before they approve any increase in America's debt burden. Negotiations . toward that agreement have whipsawed for weeks, finally hitting a brick . wall over taxes, one of the most ideologically divisive issues in U.S. politics. A Democratic aide said Republicans were pushing a package that raised the debt limit and cut spending in two steps, while Democrats want a single deal to cover borrowing through 2012. Michael Steel, a spokesman for House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, said that 'a two-step process is inevitable.' Disagreement on that issue prompted . Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid to express new disappointment with . the process, saying Republican 'intransigence' was 'pushing us to the . brink of a default.' Treasury . Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House chief of staff Bill Daley . were scheduled to speak on several Sunday television news shows to . hammer home Obama's argument that a deal must include more revenue from . taxes. Head to head: President Obama and U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner meet again with top lawmakers on Saturday to revive debt talks in a bid to avert an August 2 default . The frantic drive toward a deal over the weekend began after closed-door talks between Obama and Boehner collapsed on Friday. Those talks broke down as Republican leaders balked at a White House plan to raise revenues by $3.5trillion to $4trillion over ten years, complaining it contained $400billion more in additional tax revenue than they could stomach. Obama, angry at the collapse of negotiations, chided Republicans and warned time had run out to lift the debt limit. The White House kept up the pressure on Saturday, urging Congress not to play 'reckless political games' and warning against stop-gap measures that fail to tackle the deficit. Boehner must overcome stout resistance from Tea Party movement conservatives in his own party, who adamantly oppose any steps to raise tax revenue. Rating agencies say they will cut America's Triple-A credit rating if the U.S. fails to meet debt payments, likely triggering global market turmoil. Even if the U.S. does not default, its rating will be under pressure if Congress fails to tackle long-term deficit reduction. Financial markets are growing more edgy and U.S. banks and businesses are making contingency plans for the possibility of a debt default that would drive up interest rates, sink the dollar and ripple through economies around the world. Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co, said: 'We continue this weekend to monitor very closely the negotiations in Washington, with frequent updates and assessments. We are also evaluating reactions outside the United States.' A breakdown in Washington, he feared, 'will be highly detrimental to the already fragile health of both the U.S. and global economies.' Lawmakers have scrambled despite the new wrinkle to show progress just before Asian markets kick off their trading week. Lawmakers also were mindful of what could happen in financial markets if a deal is not quickly reached. Republican Representative Charles Dent said: 'I am concerned that there might be an adverse reaction in the markets.' Dent also said Boehner told members a default was not an option and lawmakers have to come to agreement. A Republican congressional aide said: 'We need to have something posted online by Monday.' In the White House meeting, Obama warned lawmakers not to pursue a short-term extension of the debt limit. White House spokesman Jay Carney said after the talks: 'Congress should refrain from playing reckless political games with our economy. Instead, it should be responsible and do its job, avoiding default and cutting the deficit.' A short-term extension of mere months could cause Wall Street credit agencies to strip America of its gold-plated triple-A rating and increase interest rates for American consumers, Obama told them. Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty has fired off at Obama, accusing him of showing no courage in the debt showdown. The former Minnesota governor told CNN: 'If you're the leader of the free world, would you please come to microphone and quit hiding in the basement about your proposals, and come on up and address the American people? Is he chicken?' He said Obama needs to talk specifically and publicly about where he would cut entitlement programs to reduce the nation's debt. 'Where's the president of the United States on the most pressing financial challenges of our country on entitlement reform? Where is his specific Medicaid reform proposal? Where is his specific Medicare reform proposal? Where is his Social Security reform proposal?' Pawlenty asked. 'The answer is he doesn't have one. You can't find him publicly talking about that. He's ducking, he's bobbing, he's weaving. He's not leading, and that's not the kind of president we need, and that's why he needs to be removed from office.' Pawlenty himself has been criticised for not being aggressive enough in his 2012 campaign.","Two-step plan would raise $14.3trillion debt ceiling .

The Bank of England will keep the base rate at 0.5 per cent for another three years in a move that cripples cash-strapped savers, say leading analysts. The prediction by Capital Economics came as the Bank yesterday revealed it was yet again freezing the base rate at the lowest level in its 318-year history. It coincides with the third anniversary of the cut to 0.5 per cent in March 2009 – and raises the prospect of the base rate staying at this level until 2015. The economic consultancy’s forecast is a devastating blow for savers, who have seen their nest eggs badly hit by rock-bottom rates. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘We think that they could stay at this level [0.5 per cent] for another three years.’ She also raised the possibility that the Bank could cut rates to 0.25 per cent, saying: ‘Official interest rates could fall even further.’ Simon Rose of campaign group Save our Savers said the Bank’s slashing of the base rate had placed ‘a grossly unfair and disproportionate burden’ on savers and pensioners. Future interest rates? This graph, published by the Bank of England, shows how interest rates have been held at their historic low of 0.5% since March 2009. It may be 2015 before they begin to rise. On the right are Bank of England predictions, from Feb 2012 and Nov 2011, about when rates will increase . ‘This is an extraordinary and monstrously unjust transfer of wealth from savers and pensioners,’ he added. Louise Cooper, a markets analyst at BGC Partners, said savers were being ‘crushed’. The record low interest rates have . robbed savers of £76billion over the past three years, compared with the . higher rates they were paid in the previous three. Rates held: Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King has repeatedly expressed his sympathy for savers as rates have been kept at 0.5% . The rates have benefited around eight . million homeowners with variable or tracker-rate mortgages, whose . repayments have fallen sharply. The Bank also today held its . quantitative easing programme - otherwise known as money-printing - at . £325billion after injecting £50billion into the economy last month. The combination of low rates and high levels of QE has been particularly painful for savers and those approaching retirement. It is thought that more than . £100billion is sitting in accounts which pay no interest, according to . Bank figures, compared with around £15bn to £20bn in the years before . the financial crisis. The . Bank’s Governor, Sir Mervyn King, has repeatedly expressed his sympathy . for savers but has said the stimulus measures are needed to help the . economy. With the base rate at a historic low, . mortgage repayments for new borrowers have reached their most . affordable levels for 14 years. However, there are signs that this trend is on the turn. The Bank of Ireland's move to hike ratesn yesterday will cost their 100,000 customers around £1,500 a year. At . present, the Bank of Ireland, which is one of Britain’s top ten . lenders, charges 2.99 per cent on its standard variable rate mortgages. This will be raised in stages to 4.49 per cent by September. The . repayments of a typical homeowner with a £150,000 mortgage, currently . £711 a month, will rise to £833, an increase of £122 a month or £1,464 a . year. Last week, . Halifax revealed plans to increase its standard variable rate from 3.5 . per cent to 3.99 per cent in May, affecting 850,000 customers. Like . the Halifax, the Bank of Ireland blamed the decision on higher funding . costs, which it insists means it must raise its mortgage rates. The move by the Bank of Ireland comes days after Halifax shocked customers with a sudden rise in one of its most popular mortgages . A spokesman said: ‘The cost of . funding mortgages has increased significantly for UK lenders in recent . years, including Bank of Ireland. For this reason, it is necessary for . Bank of Ireland to increase its standard variable rate.’ The decision does not affect . home-buyers who have a mortgage with the Post Office, even though the . Bank of Ireland is the network’s financial services partner. The bank’s current rate is much lower than most of its rivals’ standard variable rate deal. Santander, the Co-op and Northern Rock charge more than four per cent, while other lenders charge more than five per cent. A Council of Mortgage Lenders . spokesman said: ‘Bank and building societies continue to face . challenging conditions in the markets that typically provide their . funding – savings and wholesale markets. ‘Problems in the eurozone have been . causing significant difficulties in recent months, and funding costs are . higher than they were a year ago.’","Rates may be held at 0.5% for another THREE YEARS .

A cruel couple were facing jail today after admitted the 'appalling' neglect of a sheepdog which became trapped in a two-stone tangled ball of its own hair because they were too embarrassed to go to a vet. David and Marjorie Massey admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to five-year-old sheepdog Woody after animal cruelty officers said the treatment he suffered was 'incomprehensible'. The owners, from Beeston, Bedfordshire, felt too ashamed to take their pet for treatment despite his mangy coat, painful two-inch toenails, chronic eye and ear infections and an untreated tumour in his mouth. Facing jail: David and Marjorie Massey admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to their five-year-old sheep dog Woody . In bad shape: Emma Midgley helps Woody - who was renamed Floyd - after he arrived at an animal charity following severe neglect . Woody, as he was then known, was dumped at an animal shelter . where carers cut his mound of filthy hair, which made it almost . impossible for him to see, hear or go to the toilet. They also gave him the name of Floyd. Bedford . Magistrate’s Court heard it had taken four workers more than an hour to . free Floyd from his mangy cocoon and underneath his body was covered in . cysts and sores. Despite their efforts the animal was so distressed vets were forced put him down. Magistrates today warned David Massey, 62, and Marjorie Massey, 60, they face jail sentences for their cruelty. Chair . of the bench, Dr Disney-Durrant said: 'Because of the length of abuse . in this case I have to warn you we will be considering a custodial . sentence.' The Masseys were . investigated by the RSPCA after Woody was left . tied to a gate at Wood Green animal shelter in Cambridgeshire in August . last year. Mr and Mrs . Massey had owned the dog since he was a puppy and said that up until a . year ago he had always been groomed and well cared for. During . interviews with an RSPCA inspector, Mr Massey claimed that he did not . know that Woody had any problems in his mouth and ears, the court heard. He . also said that he recognised that he should have taken the animal to a . vet but that he had become too embarrassed by his condition to get him . treated. 'Incomprehensible': Floyd undergoes emergency treatment at the animal charity . Floyd after he was trimmed of two stone of fur and his two-inch long nails had been clipped. But he was still too ill and had to be put down . Mrs Massey told the inspector that they had used a professional groomer in the past but that they reached a point where they could no longer afford it and that any neglect was due to a lack of money. Mark Bellis, defending, admitted that the couple had previously owned two other old English sheep dogs and were 'aware of what was required in keeping the breed'. He claimed that the problems began when the groomer they had been using moved away and the Masseys were forced to find another. They claim that as Woody got older his temperament became more aggressive and it became impossible to find a groomer who could get near him. Mr Bellis said: 'They got to a stage where the condition of Woody embarrassed them so much they couldn't face taking him to see anyone.' Degrading: Woody's mound of filthy hair (left) made it almost . impossible for him to see, hear or go to the toilet. A sheepdog as it should look (right) It was only when the couple’s adult daughter decided to move back into the family home, bringing her young daughter with her, that the Masseys decided they had to get rid of Woody. Mr Massey told the court it was his decision to take Woody to the animal shelter in the middle of the night and that he called both the police and the RSPCA to tell them where Woody was. Janita Patel, prosecuting, asked the magistrates to consider a disqualification order which would ban the couple from keeping any animals for life. RSPCA chief inspector Mark Thompson echoed her disgust. He said: 'This poor dog was left in such a terrible condition. It is just incomprehensible that people could allow his condition to deteriorate in such a way.' The case was adjourned for sentencing until February 8.","David and Marjorie Massey guilty of causing unnecessary suffering .

"By . Kirsty Walker . PUBLISHED: . 09:43 EST, 21 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:39 EST, 21 March 2012 . Five million of the country's pensioners will be hit by an 'outrageous' £3billion 'Granny Tax' hidden in today's Budget. The Chancellor announced that he will phase out the higher income tax allowance enjoyed by around half the country's pensioners, already struggling with record-low interest rates on their savings. From next year, people turning 65 will no longer qualify for the higher rate of £10,500-a-year. Instead, they will qualify for just a standard income tax allowance which was raised today to £9,205. The raid on Britain’s pensioners, worth £3.3bn over the next five years represents the biggest money spinner for the Treasury from the Budget - and removes an old age tax relief that has been built into our system since 1925 - when the then Chancellor Winston Churchill introduced it. Burden: Half the country's pensioners will lose hundreds of pounds annually when their tax allowance is reduced (file picture) Individuals affected will pay an extra £260-a-year extra in tax more than they would have done. The backlash against Mr Osborne’s plans to penalise millions of pensioners was gaining force this afternoon with ‘Granny Tax’ currently the most trending subject in the world on Twitter. Age charities united in opposition to the measure. Dr Ros Altmann, Director-General, Saga said: 'This is an outrageous assault on decent middle-class pensioners. 'This . Budget contains an enormous stealth tax for older people. Over the next . five years, pensioners with an income of between £10,000 and £24,000 . will be paying an extra £3 billion in tax while richer pensioners are . left unaffected. 'There is nothing in this Budget for savers, . there is nothing to improve the annuity market, nothing to appease the . damage of quantitative easing and nothing to support ISA changes and . shelter older people’s money in cash. This Budget is terrible news for . pensioners. 'It is good to hear that we will be able to harness . the power of pension funds to improve UK Infrastructure but in short, . this Budget is another shocking example of the Government’s attack on . poorer and older people. It is dramatically unfair.' The Treasury have calculated the measures will raise £1billion a year by 2015 rising to £1.25 billion by 2016. In total, the so-called ‘simplification’ measures will cost pensioners £3.3billion over the next five years. Mr Osborne insisted that no pensioners will lose out in cash terms and that the move would help simplify the system. Congratulations: Prime Minister David Cameron congratulates the Chancellor on his Budget in which he revealed the controversial tax raid on the elderly . However, Labour leader Ed Miliband said it amounted to a ‘hidden tax’ rise on millions of pensioners. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander claimed the move would result in a ‘fairer’ and ‘simpler’ tax system. He insisted: ‘There will be no cash losers.’ But Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners’ Convention, said: ‘The decision to freeze the age related personal tax allowances effectively means around five million pensioner tax payers will no longer get additional reductions in their tax over the coming years – whilst those on the top rate of tax will see their bills reduced. ‘Many older people will feel they are being asked to forego their reduction in tax to help out the super rich. There’s no fairness in that.’ Mike Warburton of accountants Grant Thornton said: ‘The Chancellor is allowing age allowances to wither on the vine. He is effectively phasing them out but there is always a price to pay for simplicity.’ Mr Osborne said the move to scrap age-related personal allowances was the result of a recommendation from the Office for Tax Simplification which said 150,000 pensioners every year must fill out self-assessment tax returns due to the separate allowances. Mr Osborne also confirmed that the government will introduce a single-tier state pension above the level of means-tests at an estimated £140. The new system will be introduced 'early in the next Parliament' with final decisions to be made by the next spending review. The new system will provide a flat level of support, which is greater than the amount people currently receive through the basic state pension and means-tested pension credit. It will still be based on contributions and will not cost more than the current system. The reforms will not apply to today's pensioners and are likely to take years to come into effect. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: 'The Chancellor's decision to raise more than £1 billion extra in tax from pensioners by freezing age allowances will come back to haunt him. It's already being dubbed ""the granny tax"". 'Pretending that pensioners will be grateful because it will simplify their tax is a vain hope. Instead they will see that they are being asked to pay more while the super-rich have kept all the pensions tax relief - a heavy burden for ordinary taxpayers. 'And with ever more increases in the state pension age threatened in a new White Paper - a burden that falls more heavily on the poor, the regions and those with manual jobs - older workers and pensioners are paying a heavy price for a pro-rich Budget.'","Higher income tax allowance of five million elderly people to be phased out .

A one-year-old who suffers from a rare genetic illness that means he barely ever sleeps still manages a big grin every day for his parents. Curly-haired Rio Vicary suffers from Angleman's Syndrome, a rare condition which means he is unlikely to walk or talk and needs round the clock care. The brave tot was diagnosed when he was . just two weeks old and has spent most of his life in hospital where he . is monitored by a dozen consultants. Rio is also albino which has left him blind but despite that he loves the light and enjoys music. Rio Vicary suffers from Angelman Syndrome which means he is unlikely to ever walk or talk and needs very little sleep. His brothers don't have the genetic condition . Now his parents Gemma and Wayne are creating a sensory room for him at their home in Halfway, Sheffield, so he can spend more time with the couple and their other sons Cody, seven and Jayden, aged four. Rio is getting specialist care at Sheffield Children's Hospital where he has spent most of his short life since the illness was diagnosed. Support from health services has been crucial for the family. Gemma said: 'Because Rio doesn't sleep and wants to . play round the clock we get three nights respite a week. Without that I . don't think I would be able to cope.' Rio is now fitted with a tracheostomy - a tube inserted into his neck - for feeding time. It followed a terrifying incident when Gemma, 27, had to take quick action to save her son's life after he started choking. She said: 'He was drowning in his milk and I was on my own feeding him.He turned blue and I dialled 999 for help. 'I pumped hard on his ribs but he didn't make a sound, then I did it again and a noise came from his chest.He was breathing again by the time the ambulance arrived.' Despite being blind little Rio loves the light and has a special sensory room at home . Rio pictured with his mother Gemma and brothers Cody (left) and Jaydyn. They all make sure his feeding tube remains clear . Gemma, who is the primary carer, has to make sure Rio's tube is clear of fluids at all times. Her other two boys, who don't have the condition, also help. She . said: 'The tube is a life-saving thing. He is coughing all the time and . he needs suction from me with the tube but he should be having it out . soon and then we'll hear him for the first time. 'Rio . will be able to make sounds but he will never talk, that's just one of . the symptoms of AS which also affect his intellectual development and . causes massive sleep disturbances.' A chromosome disorder that is inherited from the mother and affects one in 25,000 children. The child appears typical at birth with no major defects, however developmental delay becomes apparent by six months. Sitting occurs by 12 months; walking by three to four years. They have major speech impairment with no or minimal use of words. People with Angelman's laugh and smile often, especially in response to stimuli. Hand flapping and hyperactivity is common. There is a tendency to pinch, grab and bite in older children. They have very disrupted sleep patterns but this diminishes in later childhood. Someone with Angelman's has good general health and a normal lifespan. She added: 'After . they did the genetic testing and diagnosed Angleman Syndrome I was . relieved because at least I knew what was wrong with him. 'Because . of the combination of illnesses he has we have found only one other . person in the world to match the same conditions, a year old girl in . America. 'We just pray that one day there will be a cure for AS.' Children with AS are often known as Angels because of the syndrome's name and their youthful happy appearance. Gemma and Wayne, 41 are getting married in November and taking the entire family, including Rio, on a honeymoon holiday to Lanzarote. Wayne said: 'Last year we virtually lived apart while Rio was in hospital so we decided to get married and make it a real family affair.' Consultant Gastroenterologist David Campbell said : 'Rio has a lot of problems but he is a lovely little boy. His condition is very rare, it makes Rio unique. 'But despite all his problems he is a happy little boy who can enjoy very basic pleasures like light and music which is wonderful to see.'

The parents of a seven-year-old boy who has already beaten cancer once, are trying to raise £250,000 for further life-saving treatment because the disease has returned. Jamie Inglis has such an aggressive form of cancer that treatment available in the UK will only keep him alive for a matter of months. But a specialist has offered his parents John and Vicky a lifeline – a place on a clinical trial in Germany which would improve Jamie’s chance of survival by 75 per cent. 'Incredibly brave': Jamie has already battled neuroblastoma once . Jamie plays around in hospital. He has been battling ill health for three years . The couple has just 33 days to find the cash to take their son abroad or he will lose his place.Mr Inglis, 40, said: 'As a parent, you will jump through every hoop and do absolutely anything for your child. 'Jamie is an incredibly brave boy and he keeps us all strong. He is a happy, bright, energetic kid who is loving, caring and incredible in every way. He deserves a shot at life.' Mr Inglis, who was an environmental health technician with the Royal Medical Corps for 22 years, quit the Army last year to spend more time with his children - Jamie and sister Poppy, three. He said: 'I want to spend every moment I have with them. I can’t contemplate life without them.' A fundraising drive has now been launched to help Jamie get to Germany by August 20. It is being supported by his namesake chef Jamie Oliver who has asked his two million Twitter followers to dig deep. He said: 'You just look at his parents in admiration and wish them all the very best. Little Jamie is gorgeous beyond belief.' Jamie has the support of Jamie Oliver who called on his two million Twitter followers to help . Jamie with his parents and sister Poppy in 2010 after first treatment was successful . Mr Inglis said he was hopeful that they would get the money in time but added: 'The demoralising thing about the mission is that this is the second time we have been down this road. It is the second time we have had to ask for money because we can’t get the medical care we need from the NHS.' Jamie was first diagnosed with neuroblastoma when he was four. A hospital ultrasound revealed he had a large tumour in his abdomen and his devastated parents were told he had just a 30 per cent chance of surviving. But the couple refused to give up and after researching the condition, discovered they could get pioneering treatment in the US which would dramatically improve the odds. But again, it came at a price. They spent a year fundraising and managed to scrape together the £400,000 they needed to begin the antibody procedure in Philadelphia. 'We never thought it was going to be possible to get that sort of money together,' said Mrs Inglis, 37, at the family home in York. 'What happened was that we received donations from people worldwide and it was truly humbling.' The treatment in 2010 started with eight courses of chemotherapy, an operation to remove the tumour and a kidney and a ninth high-dose course of chemotherapy designed to kill any remaining cancer cells and wipe out his white blood cells, which fight disease. Stem cells that had been harvested from his body months earlier were then transplanted back into his body to rejuvenate his immune system before he could begin the actual antibody treatment in the US. Incredibly the treatment was successful. Having fun: Jamie with his mother Vicky . Jamie's parents hope to get him onto a clinical trial running in Germany in August . Jamie’s hair started to grow back, his smile returned and he even enrolled as a pupil at The Lord Deramore’s Primary School, in Kelfield at the start of 2011. Mr Inglis, said: 'We were optimistic and with every month that he stayed cancer-free we felt more confident that we had beaten it.' But four months ago Jamie started to complain about back pain and collapsed at the family home, unable to walk. He was rushed back to hospital and a scan revealed the cancer had returned. He had emergency surgery to remove a tumour from his spine but after discussions with North Yorkshire and York NHS, the family were told that there was no treatment available in this country to tackle this type of relapse effectively and that they were not eligible for funds to get the treatment abroad. Jamie (left) before he fell ill and during treatment (right). He has remained cheery throughout his ordeal . Mr Inglis said: 'We begged them to help us get the £250,000 we needed to take Jamie to Germany and had the full support of our doctor. It was heartbreaking when we were turned down. 'Unfortunately it means we are having to beg and borrow again. We took a year to get the money we needed when Jamie got sick the first time but this time round we have just four weeks. It is particularly difficult to ask for help a second time round after people have already been so generous but we honestly believe this is our son’s last hope.' Dr David Geddes, Medical Director for NHS North Yorkshire and York said: 'Our Individual Funding Panel makes decisions about whether to fund treatments that we do not routinely commission. 'The panel, which consists of a range of professionals including doctors, takes into account the clinical and cost effectiveness of such treatments. The panel may decide to fund treatments under exceptional circumstances, depending on the evidence provided in support of the case. 'We have a responsibility to ensure that we provide the best possible healthcare for the largest number of patients within the limited resources available. Unfortunately, this means that we are not able to fund some specialist treatments for which there is limited clinical evidence to support their clinical effectiveness.' Around 120 children a year in the UK are diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a cancer that forms in nerve tissue. Jo Dempster-Fowle for Neuroblastoma Alliance UK said: 'We know high-risk neuroblastoma is an incredibly difficult cancer to treat successfully, and no amount of money can secure a successful outcome. 'At present, however, parents see a system that gives up on their children too soon, whilst there should still be hope. Elsewhere such hope is supported by a system that continues to treat children long after the UK has nothing to offer but palliative care.'

'Oversight': Conservative Party co-chairman Baroness Warsi (pictured) has admitted failing to declare rental income on her London home in breach of House of Lords rules . Conservative co-chairman Baroness Warsi is facing calls for an investigation into her expenses over allegations that she claimed for overnight accommodation when staying at a friend's house rent-free. Lady Warsi, a cabinet minister championed by David Cameron, insists that she made an 'appropriate payment' for the 'occasional nights' she stayed at a property occupied, but not owned by Tory official Naweed Khan. Labour MP John Mann said he would be asking the Lords commissioner for standards to investigate. Mr Khan, who later became Lady Warsi's special adviser, today backed her claim, releasing a statement saying she made a payment each time she stayed at the property. However - according to reports in The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph - the owner of the property in Acton, West London, denies that he received any income from either Lady Warsi or Mr Khan. The 41-year-old Tory peer was at the time claiming Lords subsistence of £165.50 a night from the taxpayer. Mr Mann said: 'If you are paying no rent where you are staying, you can't possibly be claiming subsistence for staying there. 'It all seems very murky. We need a full investigation into the matter.' In a separate embarrassment for Lady Warsi, the most senior Muslim politician in Britain, has also admitted failing to declare rental income on a London flat in the Lords register of interests. The two revelations are another blow for the Prime Minister who is already facing the possibility of temporarily losing Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the BSkyB debacle. Mr Cameron and Lady Warsi have both spoken of the importance of a 'transparent government' and Mr Cameron's ambition to be 'one of the most transparent governments in the world.' The smart Acton property at the centre of the claims is owned by Egyptian-born GP Dr Wafik Moustafa, a Conservative donor and former electoral candidate who is now engaged in a dispute with the party and Lady Warsi. Lady Warsi, a cabinet minister championed by David Cameron, insists that she made an 'appropriate payment' for the 'occasional nights' she stayed at a property occupied by Tory official Naweed Khan . Mr Khan said that he stayed at the house belonging to Dr Moustafa between July 2007 and November 2008 while working in central London. He was living there rent free. 'In the early part of 2008, for a short period, Baroness Warsi stayed with me,' he said in the statement. 'I confirm she made a financial payment on each occasion, which compensated for the inconvenience caused and additional costs incurred by me as a result of her being there.' Dr Wafik Moustafa, chairman of the Conservative Arab Network, said Lady Warsi had her own front door key and never offered to pay rent or bills and he didn't ask her for money . Dr Moustafa, chairman of the Conservative Arab Network, told the Sunday Times Lady Warsi had her own front door key and never offered to pay rent or bills and he didn't ask her for money. He also said he used to give her occasional lifts into central London. He admitted to the paper he didn't ask for any money as he was hoping to further his political career. Meanwhile, Lady Warsi said her failure to declare rental income on her £220,000 flat in Wembley, West London, was due to an 'oversight', adding that she had reported the letting of it in the Register of Ministers' Interests. The arrangement had also been declared to the Cabinet Office and HM Revenue and Customs, she said. The peer bought the property in 2007, when she was just 36 and the youngest peer in the upper chamber, but moved closer to Parliament when she became a minister in 2010, after which she began letting the Wembley flat. Peers are required to declare sources of income of more than £500, although the annual rent on a London flat is likely to be many times greater than that. In a statement last night, Lady Warsi said that she contracted to buy the flat in September 2007, but it was not due to be ready until the following year. In the interim she stayed predominantly at two hotels but also, for 'occasional nights', at Dr Moustafa's Acton property occupied by Tory party adviser Mr Khan. 'The completion date for the property was slightly delayed, and not having made advanced bookings for these hotels, there was a period of around six weeks when I spent occasional nights at a flat in Acton, which was occupied by Naweed Khan, at the time a member of Conservative Campaign HQ staff,' she said. Taking responsibility: The Cabinet Office minister did not disclose her income in the register of interests for members of the House of Lords (above), but did add it to the Register of Ministers' Interests . 'For the nights that I stayed as a guest of Naweed Khan, I made an appropriate financial payment equivalent to what I was paying at the time in hotel costs. 'In March 2008, I moved into the flat in Wembley. As I was living in the property, it was therefore not registrable on the Register of Lords' Interests. Upon becoming a minister, however, my ownership of this property was fully disclosed to the Cabinet Office. Labour MP John Mann said he would be asking the Lords commissioner for standards to investigate . 'In June 2010, upon security advice, I moved to another address closer to the House of Lords and some months later began, with the prior approval of the Cabinet Office and the Leader of the House of Lords, to let out the Wembley property. 'Due to an oversight, for which I take full responsibility, the flat was not included on the Register of Lords' Interests when its value and the rent received came to exceed the thresholds for disclosure,' she said. 'When the discrepancy became apparent this week, I immediately informed the Registrar of Lords' Interests of its omission. 'I repeat, at all times my ownership of the flat and the fact that it was being let out was fully disclosed to Cabinet Office officials and HM Revenue and Customs, and was appropriately reported on the register of ministers' interests held by the Government.' Shadow business minister Chuka Umunna has called for an inquiry. He told BBC1's Sunday Politics: 'To rebuild trust and demonstrate this is being dealt with in a proper way there has to be a proper, independent investigation. 'So long as these stories endure, we are going to struggle to rebuild the trust and confidence we need there to be between Westminster and the people it exists there to serve. That is incredibly important.' Lady Warsi is the daughter of immigrants from Pakistan. She failed to be elected in her home town of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in 2005. Despite that she was made a shadow minister two years later and her career took off. Baroness Warsi's admission comes as it emerged Mr Hunt could temporarily step down from frontline politics after the Olympics after pressure over his handling of the bid by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation to take full control of BSkyB, it was reported in the Sunday Telegraph. Yesterday, it was revealed how Mr Cameron ignored legal advice that allowing Mr Hunt to rule on the bid risked ‘prejudging the affair’ in the tycoon’s favour.

On the run: Police believe Rocco Luka Magnotta might have fled the country after hacking up his alleged victim . A low-budget porn actor suspected of dismembering a man and mailing his body parts to Canadian government headquarters may have fled the country, police believe. Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, is the subject . of a massive manhunt after a man's maggot-ridden torso was found in a . locked suitcase by his Montreal apartment block. The city's police commander, Ian Lafreniere, said investigators believe he has left North America based on evidence they found at his apartment, and based on a blog post Magnotta once wrote about how to disappear. The suspected killer has also been added to Interpol's wanted person's list. 'We believe he may be in a foreign country,' Lafreniere told The Associated Press. 'He left a letter on a website mentioning how to disappear for good, and secondly, our investigation brought us some details that might let us think that he could be away from the country.' The police commander added that investigators have an idea where he might have fled but he would not say where. It comes after claims Magnotta allegedly filmed himself hacking up his victim's body with an ice-pick before posting the sickening video online. The sickening 'snuff video' footage, called '1 Lunatic 1 Ice Pick' which was uploaded last week shows a naked male tied to a bed frame being attacked with both an ice pick and a kitchen knife. The Best Gore website says the film, which is unclear where or when it was filmed, then shows the victim being stabbed and having his throat slashed to the soundtrack of True Faith by New Order. Scroll down for video . Search: Local news reports have identified Magnotta, 29, as a low-budget adult film star . Wanted: Luka Magnotta is believed to be behind a gruesome video showing the murder of a man . He is later decapitated, dismembered and sexually assaulted. It is believed he was already dead when the camera started rolling. The man in the video, whose face is never revealed, then goes on to play with the corpse's body parts in a 'sexual manner'. Doubt was initially cast on the veracity of the film but police have now confirmed 'it depicts the actual crime', the National Post reports. Lafreniere said police have been . trying to take down the video that they believe shows Magnotta . committing the murder. Despite repeatedly removing it, people continue . to upload it, he said. Scene: A mattress and sofa taken out of Magnotta's apartment lie near to where the suitcase was found . Search: Mike Nadeau (right), janitor of the apartment building where Magnotta reportedly lived inspects the premises. The suspect has not been seen there since the packages were sent . Inside look: Police believe he may have fled the country after a blog post he wrote about disappearing . Police . believe a festering foot from the body was then mailed to Canadian . Conservative Party's HQ, and a hand was found at a postal warehouse, . both in Ottawa, Ontario. Officers believe he could also be behind a sickening video posted online where kittens are tortured and killed. The . animal-cruelty video, filmed two years ago, shows a man looking like . Magnotta placing two kittens inside an airtight bag and using a vacuum . cleaner to suck out the air. In . distressing scenes, too graphic to be posted on MailOnline, the cleaner . is then switched on and the air is slowly sucked out of the bag. The . mewing kittens can be seen wriggling around and clawing to escape as the . polythene tightens around them. After switching off the cleaner, the . sick teen opens the bag and proudly holds up the body of one of the . kittens for his camera, before displaying them on his bed. Killing: A video of the killing, perhaps taken in this apartment block, shows the beheading of a victim . Home: The victim, believed to already be dead in the video, was then sexually assaulted and dimembered . Investigation: An internal shot of Magnotta's apartment before the furniture was removed . Earlier this week, police in masks combed . through the blood-soaked Montreal studio apartment where the torso was . discovered. A blood stained mattress remained there after they left. Police . Commander Ian Lafreniere said: 'For most of the officers that were . there all night long this is the kind of crime scene they've never seen . in their career.' He said . they are investigating the possibility that other body parts might have . been mailed, and believed the suspect and the victim knew each other. The packages with the foot and the hand, he added, had been mailed to Ottawa from Montreal. But it was not clear why. Lafreniere added: 'As a father, I would have trouble sleeping at night knowing that the suspect was in my neighborhood.' Police said Magnotta is also known by . the names Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov. They described him . as white, 5ft 8in tall, with blue eyes and black hair. Hazardous material: A police officer carries a yellow bag with the bloody package that contains the festering foot mailed to Conservative Party headquarters on Tuesday . Scene: Sick idea: The Tories have said they believe that, even though the package was addressed to Conservative Party headquarters, the foot was not a political message . His internet presence indicates he is a bisexual porn actor and model. Police . discovered the severed foot after Jenni Bryne, a top political adviser . to Prime Minister Stephen Harper, opened a bloodstained box at . Conservative party headquarters on Tuesday. When . Bryne opened the box, a foul odor overcame the office. 'It was such a . horrible odour. I'm sure many of us will not forget it,' Conservative . Party spokesman Fred DeLorey said. Police . said the package was addressed to the Conservative Party of Canada and . not to a specific person. Canada Post would not comment on the . discoveries. Eric Schorer, the manager of the . building where the suspect lived, said Magnotta had been living there . for about four months but had not been seen around in a while. He . said there were never any complaints about noise in the unit, and that . Magnotta passed a credit test to rent there. 'He seemed like a nice . guy,' Schorer said. Manhunt: Magnotta is also known by the names Eric Clinton Newman and Vladimir Romanov . Friendly: This video, posted online two years ago, shows a man who looks like Magnotta appearing to be caring for the cats (he disguised his face) Sickening: But the man then seals the bag, attaches the vacuum cleaner hose and sucks the air out of it . Richard Payette, who lived across the hall from Magnotta, said the door of Apartment 208 was left open for part of the day yesterday, with an overwhelming smell drifting out into the hallway, like bad meat. For nearly two years, Magnotta's name has been notorious among animal-rights activists looking for a man who tortured and killed cats and posted videos of it online. In 2009, he posted an article online entitled How to Completely Disappear and Never Be Found; it shares a six-step process for escaping and changing an identity. It is not the first time he has been in the news. Magnotta previously complained his life had been ruined by rumours he was dating Karla Homolka, who raped and killed teenage girls. Reports add he may have spread the rumours himself, The Canadian Press reported. Magnotta has no criminal record.","Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, subject of massive manhunt .

Before and after: Photographer Larry Racioppo took photographs of . dilapidated buildings like this one on East 126th Street (left) before . it was renovated (right) His work was part of an ambitious project to renovate and rejuvenate the city by Mayor Edward Irving Koch. The 64-year-old photographer’s work has since been exhibited in many museums as a reminder of what used to be. Since his retirement he has launched his own website to showcase his work. He told The New York Times:  ‘We had to be able to photograph what was really there, and not to sugarcoat anything. ‘The commissioners never told me to hide anything. A reminder of what used to be: An empty building and abandoned block was one of the many spots Mr Racioppo captured on film as a spot that needed renovating . Now: The spot is now unrecognisable after it was rebuilt as part of the ambitious plan to rejuvenate the city . If there were bad conditions, they wanted to be able to change that. If conditions were horrible, they could get resources allocated so my photographs were a wonderful tool.’ What was once considered outdated and ugly is now trendy he said of how the city had changed. Mr Racioppo said: ‘A lot of young people ask “What was so bad? Why was it such a problem?” ‘They came here in 2005 when brownstones in Harlem were easily going for more than a million dollars. People don’t remember when you couldn’t give those places away 20 years ago.’ No sugar coating: As a staff photographer for the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development, Mr Racioppo was told not to hide anything like this unattractive street corner in Lenox Gardens . Useful: Mr Racioppo said his photographs were 'a wonderful tool' for city officials to identify places that needed refurbishment resulting in much more appealing buildings such as the improved block in Lenox Gardens . Growing up in Brooklyn and working as a volunteer with impoverished teenagers in Santa Clara Valley in California, Mr Racioppo saw the darker side of poverty. He said: ‘I never held being poor against anybody. ‘In any building, all it takes is one or two bad families with serious problems to make it bad for everybody.’ Changing times: This lot had been left vacant for years and was widely viewed as being unusable .

A motorist who was caught speeding at 152mph while his father was sitting in the passenger seat has been banned from driving. Brendan Matthews, a professional yacht skipper, was caught on camera doing more than twice the 70mph speed limit in his BMW M5. He was recorded by two police officers who ‘looked at each other in disbelief’ as they tried to keep up with the 28-year-old’s car on the A35 at Puddletown, Dorset. Matthews admitted he had driven ‘grossly in excess’ of the speed limit but insisted it had only been for a ‘short burst’. His solicitor explained that as the captain of luxury charter yachts around the Mediterranean, he is used to acting responsible with expensive machinery. Magistrates heard that Matthews, from Weymouth, Dorset, was spotted by police doing 152mph at 11.32am on February 17 last year on the eastbound A35. Elizabeth Valera, prosecuting, said a traffic officer’s hand-held speed detection device clocked Matthews’ BMW. She said: 'A reading of 152mph is taken from that device. 'The crown in this case say that Mr Matthews’ driving fell far below that expected of a competent and careful driver and, indeed, that it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that his driving was dangerous. 'Any other driver on the road would be making manoeuvres expecting vehicles to be travelling at around 70mph. 'Of course 152mph is over double what the speed limit is and that is why the crown says it is dangerous.' Powerful: The kind of BMW M5 similar to the one Matthews was driving when he was caught speeding on the 70mph A-road in Puddletown, Dorset (file picture) Miss Valera said Matthews’ father had been the front-seat passenger in the car. Simeon Evans, defending, said: 'Mr Matthews will accept that he was driving grossly in excess of the speed limit - probably very nearly double, or at double the speed limit. 'The irony you have is of a man in an extremely responsible job, he is responsible for machinery worth millions of pounds and the people on them, and he has acted irresponsibly.' He said: 'There is a real dichotomy there.' He told the court Matthews was on call to go out to yacht charters at short notice and was a hard-working young man with a very successful career. Matthews pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and was given an 18 week suspended prison sentence by magistrates in Weymouth. He was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work, pay prosecution costs of £200 and given a two year driving ban. The record for the fastest driver ever caught in a speed trap was Tim Brady, who was jailed for ten weeks in 2007 after admitting driving a £98,000 Porsche at 172mph.","Yacht skipper Brendan Matthews broke 70mph limit with father in passenger seat .

In the letters, believed to have been written last month and released by his lawyer Max Altez, van der Sloot says that he hopes the Flores family can forgive him for his crimes. 'I ask God every day that Stephany's parents can find it in their heart to forgive me,' van der Sloot wrote. But van der Sloot also made an attempt to paint himself as the victim. He . said that he believes he was misled by his attorney when he pleaded . guilty to Flores’ murder and suffers from ‘psychological’ problems that . he believes should have been weighed in the murder case. Van . der Sloot wrote: 'My rights have been constantly abused. My lawyer promised me I would receive 15 years if I plead guilty, I did.'

He . also referred to himself as a psychological 'mess' in the letters, . which were written in English and contain numerous misspellings and . grammatical errors. 'I have a history of psychological problems which were never taken into consideration,' he said.Van . der Sloot also took the opportunity to address Natalee Holloway, . claiming once again that he had nothing to do with the teen’s 2005 . disappearance in Aruba. He . also faces charges of trying to extort $25,000 from Natalee Holloway’s . mother Beth, promising to reveal the location of the 17-year-old’s body . in exchange for the money. His extradition to the U.S. has been approved in that case, but he must first serve his sentence in Peru for the Flores murder. Taken away: Van der Sloot, centre, is seen escorted by police officers in Lima in this photo from June 2010, after his arrest for the murder of Stephany Flores . Last . month, a Peruvian court ruled that van der Sloot will be extradited to . the U.S. to face trial in an alleged extortion plot against Holloway's . mother Beth. That trial, however, won't happen until he has served his 28-year jail sentence in Peru for the murder of Stephany Flores. The . decision by the Peruvian Supreme Court means that the family of . Holloway, who disappeared in 2005 and has since been declared dead, will . have to wait many more agonising years before they will see van der . Sloot on trial. Natalee Holloway was 17 when she disappeared in Aruba, a Dutch island in the southern Caribbean Sea, during a school trip. Prosecutors said $25,000 was paid to van der Sloot, but nothing was disclosed about Natalee's whereabouts. Altez had recently speculated he thought his client would be extradited within three months, and had believed the U.S. trial would go ahead before the Peruvian murder sentence. Parents: David Holloway, left, is seen . during a hearing in Alabama, while Beth . Holloway, right, is pursued by reporters after a hearing after which . her daughter was officially declared dead . Authorities in the U.S. believe that . the money extorted from Beth Holloway was used by van der Sloot to . travel to Peru on May 14, 2010, . a trip that ended with the murder of Flores, whom he met in . a Lima casino, on May 25. The date is a chilling one to the Holloway family, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen. He . took cash and credit cards from Miss Flores before fleeing to Chile, . where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:26 EST, 25 July 2012 . A wealthy businessman arrested for murder after he stabbed a burglar to death during a knifepoint raid was spared the ordeal of reliving the tragedy in a courtroom today. Homeowner Vincent Cooke, 39, had been detained after career criminal Raymond Jacob, 37, suffered multiple knife wounds as he broke in his luxury four bedroomed home in Bramhall, near Stockport, Greater Manchester. During the raid, Jacob held a carving knife to the throat of a terrified Mr Cooke and frogmarched him upstairs in a search for jewellery. Vincent Cooke, left, who was told by . the Crown Prosecution Service that he will face no further action after . Raymond Jacob was stabbed to death at his home, was due to give evidence against Jacob's accomplice . Mr Cooke's home: Mr Cooke was watching TV at his £350,000 home when he caught Raymond Jacob breaking in . But he was then overpowered by the victim and died following a struggle. Tests showed he suffered up to eight knife wounds. Mr Cooke - who said he acted in lawful self defence - was questioned for 12 hours and later released without charge. But he was then kept on bail for almost a month until he was told he would not be charged. Today Mr Cooke and his wife Karen were due to start giving a days of evidence against Jacob’s accomplice Michael Thorpe who was charged with aggravated burglary. But Thorpe, 33 changed his plea to guilty meaning Mr Cooke will not need to give any evidence. Thorpe claimed Jacob was the prime mover in the attack. The incident occurred when Mr Cooke, who had been at his £350,000 home watching TV, disturbed Jacob as he smashed his way into his house. He and Thorpe stole a ruck sack, three mobile phones, a sat nav and two computers. Mr Cooke, who runs a same-day courier service, was taken upstairs at knifepoint to open the safe but a struggle broke out and Jacob was stabbed. Mr Cooke dialled 999 himself but officers and paramedics were unable to revive Jacob and he was declared dead at the scene. Thorpe escaped in a white Citroen van which was parked in a nearby street but was arrested later. Mr Cooke’s wife Karen, 34, and 12-year-old son Anthony returned home during the incident but were unharmed. Mourning: A friend of Jacob is comforted by another as she lays flowers at the scene of the stabbing last year . Mr Cooke later told police that at the time of the raid he was in fear for his own safety and the safety of his wife and son. He later advised to leave the property after fears of reprisals from friends and associates of the dead man. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Thorpe of Outwood Road, Heald Green, Manchester was remanded in custody and told he would be sentenced at a later date. Prosecutor Mark Kellet said: 'We accept the defendant was encouraged by Raymond Jacob. The defendant knew Ray Jacob had a knife but the knife was taken on the understanding to threaten not to injure. 'Michael Thorpe accepts his part in a joint enterprise to take a knife in to a home and threaten him in his own home and that Mr Cooke was targeted for a large amount of cash that he was told to be in Vincent Cooke’s possession. 'The defendant says that his role was secondary and the Crown says Jacob’s role was primary. 'The defendant was left upstairs and . while there he heard a commotion between Jacob and Cooke and when he . realised violence was involved, he didn’t want any part of it so ran . from the premises. 'He was . not part of the planning process. He was there to bolster the threats . with a knife and stayed upstairs. He was the muscle not the planner or . the instigator.' Jacob had dozens of convictions for burglary, robbery and theft. He once served an 18-month prison sentence for beating a man unconscious and leaving him looking 'like a piece of meat'. Police have since now installed CCTV cameras outside the Cooke house to watch out for thugs. Prosecutors said he did what he 'honestly and instinctively believed was necessary on that day to protect himself, his home and his family from intruders'. In a statement issued at the time he was vindicated Mr Cooke said: 'I hope to now be able to get on with my life but will never forget the day that I had to fight for my life. 'I just want to get my life back on track. I’m still very traumatised by what happened. I’m still having nightmares every night about this incident.' Mr Cooke was the third man in Greater Manchester in as many months to be vindicated after stabbing an intruder to death in self defence. Peter Flanagan, 59, who stabbed to death an intruder armed with a machete at his Salford home, was told the following month that he would not be charged with any offence. Then Cecil Coley, 72, was told he would not face any charges after he stabbed an armed robber to death during a raid at his florists shop in Old Trafford, Manchester.

Darrell Teal, 22, died after jumping 30 feet off a bridge named 'Devil’s Bridge' into a river below. It is thought he landed awkwardly as he hit the water and the alarm was raised when he did not resurface. As police investigated the circumstances of the tragedy today, Mr Teal's relatives were being comforted at their home in Urmston, Greater Manchester. His grandmother Sheila, 67, wept as . she said: 'The whole family is devastated.

Father Shaun Teal, 45, said: 'My head’s just not with it at the moment after what happened. I’m struggling to deal with it now.' Darrell . had travelled to the Lake District for the day with family and friends . and some of the party had been jumping from Devil’s Bridge in Kirby . Lonsdale into the river 30ft below.

South Lakeland District Council passed a bylaw against jumping from the bridge over safety fears. Cumbria . Police said the alarm was raised at 5pm and Darrell’s body was . discovered further downstream from the bridge in Lune Lake at 1.30am on . Sunday. He is not believed to have hit any rocks in the river. A spokesman said: 'There are no . suspicious circumstances surrounding the death at this time and the case . has been passed to the coroner.' Steve . Sharrock, station manager at Kendal Fire Station said: 'We understand . he had not hit any rocks but it is quite a height and witnesses said he . may have hit the water at the wrong angle, in which case he could have . knocked himself out.' 'We . understand the man had travelled to the Lake District for the day with . family and friends and was among a group of lads in their 20s who had . been in the water.

Two other young men wrapped in towels were seen being comforted at the scene after the alert was raised at 5pm last night.

Allan Muirhead, . head of Kirkby Lonsdale Town Council, described the English Heritage site as having  a 'lethal cocktail of sunshine and water.'Mr Muirhead said that young men see . jumping off the bridge as a 'rite of passage' and that those from . outside the area did not appreciate the dangers.

One hundred and thirteen dead kittens and 51 ailing adult cats have been found in an apartment belonging to a cat hoarder and in a nearby house. None of the dead kittens appeared to be more than two months old, animal care workers in Seaside, California, said. Police and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) for Monterey County discovered the animals on Tuesday. Cruel: 113 dead kittens have been found in an apartment belonging to a cat hoarder in Seaside, California. Dozens of ailing adult cats (pictured) were then discovered in a nearby house .

Controversial Games Lanes reserved for Olympic athletes and VIPs have been turned off in some parts of London because officials have chosen to use public transport instead, Boris Johnson said today. The Mayor of London made the announcement on the day the city's transport network faced its biggest test of the Olympics so far as Games spectators and rush-hour commuters travelled together for the first time. He said he was pleased with the way transport systems such as the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and the Olympic Route Network (ONR), were operating as commuters' worst fears of disruption and congestion failed to materialise. Scroll down for video . Change of plan: Officials have turned off some Games Lanes after Olympic VIPs opted to use public transport . 'Obviously the transport, we’re pleased with the way it’s working so far,' he said. 'Everybody at London Bridge was working well, the Tube is working well, the ORN. 'Actually, we’ve been able to turn off a lot of the Games lanes because so many people are going by public transport. 'It turns out a lot of the Olympic bureaucrat types who could go in the Games lanes - the ""T3 people"" as they’re called - are using public transport. 'Jacques Rogge himself (the president of the International Olympic Committee) today took the DLR, I’m proud to say, and was conveyed in stately style and comfort he’d expect on the DLR, and a lot of them are doing that and that is good news.' Traffic was heavy on many of London's roads today, but experts said there were fewer problems than had been feared before the Games got under way. Business leaders suggested that many employees may have decided to work from home to avoid the crowds of Olympic spectators. Content: The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said he was pleased with the way the capital's transport network was operating . Guy Bailey, head of employment and employee relations at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said: 'It is a little early to draw defintive conclusions after one commuting session and one wouldn't want to say categorically that this is the way it will be for the next few weeks. 'Flexible working will have played a significant role. It is now an accepted part of working culture and both employees and employers are very used to the concept. 'People have been taking that into account in their planning on how to manage through the Olympics.' Mr Bailey dismissed suggestions that a company's productivity could be hampered by having more staff working from home. He said: 'The question is, are people able to get the work done? 'If a business and its staff are more likely to get work done by staying . at home rather than battling on through on what could have been a very . hot and sticky transport system, there is no reason why working from . home has any impact on productivity whatsoever.' Mr Bailey added that more workers may have decided to take holiday during the Olympic Games, reducing the number of commuters on the roads. 'People may be taking holiday to attend the Games or watch them on television,' he said. 'Of course, there are people who could think of nothing worse and they may have decided to leave London during the Games. 'And there may be people who have gone overseas because they are yet to see a British summer and they are looking for some sunshine.' A spokesman for London Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the number of employees working from home had probably helped traffic move more smoothly than expected. She also suggested that publicity campaigns, arranged by Transport for London (TfL) and London 2012 organisers Locog, encouraging workers to leave their cars at home also had an effect. Motorists on the M4 - a major route into the capital - had their journeys disrupted this morning when a serious accident forced the closure of a section of the motorway. Highways workers closed the London-bound carriageway between junction 5 at Langley in Berkshire and junction 4b near Heathrow airport. Long queues built up on the motorway, which has a Games lane reserved for Olympic athletes and VIPs on the approach to west London. Some roads with Games lanes in the capital itself also saw heavy traffic, such as the A40 and A4 in west London and the Canning Town Flyover in east London. Previous restrictions: Some of the lanes, which were reserved for members of the 'Olympic family', have been opened to all traffic . Data collected at the Trafficmaster control centre, which monitors traffic levels, showed vehicles were moving slowly on many routes into London. Roads into east London, where the Olympic Park is located at Stratford, were among the busiest. Half of employers have indicated that they will let their staff work from home during the Olympics, a survey for the CBI has found. Fifty-seven per cent of firms said they would adapt their employees' hours during the Games and 46 per cent said they would let their workforce time off to attend events. The survey found that 76 per cent of companies believe the Olympics will boost tourism and 64 per cent expect to see trading either improve or remain the same. But, when asked a month ago, only 43 per cent of businesses said they had been given sufficient information about the Olympic Route Network. A spokesman at the control centre said: 'There have been some problems on Waterloo Bridge with congestion and there is very heavy traffic around the Hangar Lane area. 'There are also some delays on the A13 in the West Ham area, but we cannot be sure that this is much different to how traffic levels normally are in that area on a Monday morning. 'Traffic is quite heavy on the A12 at Wanstead, going towards Stratford, and also on the A10.' The closed section of the M4 was reopened later in the morning, but there were delays of up to an hour for London-bound drivers. There were also hold-ups westbound on the M4 between Slough Central and Slough West - a stretch of motorway close to Eton Dorney in Berkshire where the Olympic rowing events are taking place. Also in this area of Berkshire, a lineside equipment problem at Maidenhead led to mid-morning delays to First Great Western rail services between Reading and Maidenhead. A spokesman for the Highways Agency said: 'There were multiple vehicles involved in the collision on the M4, which happened at about 8.25am. 'The road was fully closed at first, but two lanes were open just after 9am. 'With the exception of the M4, there have been no reported incidents on any scale and traffic has actually flowed quite well.' Busy: Traffic builds on the Embankment in central London on the first day that rush-hour commuters travelled into London with Olympic spectators . Tube and main line rail services operated well on the whole during the morning peak period, although passengers faced delays of up to 20 minutes at Liverpool Street station because of a broken-down train. A Transport for London (TfL) spokesman said: 'So far this morning the public transport system and London’s roads are working well as commuters travel to work and spectators travel to the Olympic venues. 'We are closely monitoring the transport network, which will be exceptionally busy this week. 'Today London Bridge, the DLR, Canary Wharf and Bank will exceptionally busy. London Bridge should be avoided. 'Our advice to passengers will be different every day so plan ahead at GetAheadoftheGames.com to avoid disruption and delay to your journey and to make the most of all the Games have to offer.' London Bridge station was expected to be very busy this evening with spectators travelling to the equestrian cross country event at Greenwich Park in south east London. A part of London Bridge is being closed to departing passengers from 6pm to 10pm to minimise congestion. Those affected are passengers travelling on services bound for Kent, Sussex and Bedfordshire run by the First Capital Connect and Southeastern train companies. TfL said Olympic events meant the Docklands Light Railway would be particularly busy today as would Canary Wharf and Bank Tube stations. The Association of Train Operating Companies and Network Rail said main line train companies had provided 565,276 extra seats today, operating nearly 4.16million seats in total. Hundreds of staff from transport companies were working at London Bridge station, they said. As of noon today, 93 per cent of services were running to schedule across the network, with services operating normally in and out of Liverpool Street station again after the earlier disruption.

Brave Alice, 24, is now recovering at home with her boyfriend after a second op to fix her fused joints after years of agony as a result of the crippling condition. She's also buzzing at the prospect of going out and buying a wedding dress as she prepares to tie the knot with sweetheart Ryan Harrison, 24, next year. Excited: Alice Swallow, 24, cannot wait to hold her fiance Ryan Harrison's hand for the first time after she had two major elbow replacement operations .

'But I am most looking forward to holding his hand properly for the first time since I met him.' Life-changing: Alice was unable to hold hands with Ryan before the surgery after her elbows fused at a 90 degree angle . Miss Swallow was just 10 when she was diagnosed 14 years ago with rheumatoid arthritis - a devastating condition which left her unable to bend her arms. Since meeting Ryan three years ago, the customer services adviser at Haven Power has never held his hand after both her elbows fused at a 90 degree angle. Following her first operation at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in London last month, Alice had her second operation on her left arm a week last Tuesday. 'I am sore,' she said. 'A lot of people, including my surgeon wanted me to wait longer between operations. 'But I had got it in my head that I would have them both done quickly. Happy Alice said she can now bend her right arm properly for the first time. 'It feels brilliant,' she said, 'it's overwhelming. 'I will never ever take for granted the use of my arms.' While it will be a couple of months before she's fully recovered, Alice is desperate to go shopping for her wedding dress - something she has put off until after the operation. Elbow replacement is a relatively rare operation which is only carried out between 500 and 1,000 times a year in the UK. Medics believe Alice is one of the youngest people in Britain to have undergone the tough procedure.

Struggles: Since becoming an overnight Olympic celebrity, Douglas has had trouble performing due to emotion and exhaustion . Clinging: Douglas gripped onto the balance beam after suffering the fall . As the days went on, the rigors of competition appeared to be taking her toll on Douglas. She admitted after Monday's lackluster showing on bars - where she finished last - that the emotion and exhaustion had caught up with her. But it wasn't a lack of energy that cost her today Tuesday - it was a misplaced foot. Her right foot could only brush the beam as she landed on a leap, and she had no chance to save herself. As the crowd gasped, she fell onto the beam in a straddle, hanging on tight as she swung partly underneath. Still, she'll leave the London Olympics with two gold medals, including the all-around title, gymnastics' biggest prize. About an hour after the balance beam final, Raisman - who won the bronze in a tiebreaker - became the first American female to win gold in the floor exercise. It was her third medal overall. Gold standard: Raisman's performance in the floor exercise won her a second gold medal, and her third overall . Emotion: Aly Raisman hugs coach Mihai Brestyan after winning the gold medal in the floor exercise . After the balance beam final, Douglas said: 'I'm definitely not going to lie. It was definitely hard to regain your focus. You're like, ""Yes, I'm the Olympic champion. I'm a world champion."" 'It's definitely kind of hard to turn the chapter for event finals.' Raisman - who missed out on a medal in the all-around after a tiebreaker last week - won the bronze medal, thanks to a tiebreaker. Raisman questioned her score after initially finishing fourth, and judges added an extra tenth to her routine's difficulty after reviewing it. Sadness: Douglas reacted in disappointment after final results were declared for the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's apparatus finals . Flying squirrel: Gabby Douglas won two gold medals in London, including one in the individual all-around event . Heartbreak: The balance beam fall cost Douglas a gold medal in her final Olympic appearance . That gave her and Catalina Ponor identical scores of 15.066, but Raisman got the bronze and Ponor got bumped because the American's execution score was higher. Big grins spread across Raisman's face . and that of her coach, Mihai Brestyan, when the revision was announced, . and she couldn't stop smiling as she climbed onto the medals podium. The captain of the Fierce Five now has two medals, and a chance to add a third later Tuesday on floor exercise. Douglas said she was proud of her achievement and the achievements of her team as a whole. She said: 'I'm so happy, going home with two Olympic gold medals and a couple of titles under my belt,' Douglas added: 'I'm so happy for Aly, she deserves to be up on that podium. She had a great beam routine and I'm so proud of her.' Deng Linlin won the gold on balance beam, while compatriot Sui Lu took home the silver. Pride: Raisman, centre, displays her gold medal with silver medallist Catalina Ponor, left, of Romania and bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina, right, of Russia . Ta-da!

Volunteer Julia Simonson pictured with an injured swans which was recaptured after the robbery at the Leicestershire Wildlife Centre . Ruthless metal thieves left animals for dead after raiding an animal hospital and stealing their cages to sell for scrap. The heartless thieves took 26 stainless steel and aluminum cages, worth up to £30,000, after turfing the sick animals out of them. Two blackbirds and six hedgehogs died after the raiders broke into the Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital in Kibworth. And some of the injured birds being treated, including wood pigeons, collared doves and blackbirds, escaped through the front door which was left wedged open by thieves. Others, including an injured swan, were left wandering around the building. Staff at the animal hospital said they were confronted with a scene of devastation and destruction after turning up for work last Friday. Volunteer Julia Simonson said the thieves had ransacked all six rooms at the hospital and left the site in disarray. Julia said: 'I saw sick animals either dead or dying on the floor. The people who did this ripped the cages off the walls and threw the animals out. 'It was heartbreaking to see all the animals I and other volunteers care for and nurture just lying there cowering or wandering about distressed. 'What kind of people can do this to a collection of sick animals? They must be sick themselves. 'Usually, when I arrive at the hospital the animals recognise my car and my voice and all clamour to be fed. When I arrived last Friday it was eerily quiet.' Thieves stole 26 stainless steel and aluminum cages, worth about £30,000, from the animal rescue centre . Julia Simonson, pictured with a kestrel which thieves set free at the Leicestershire Wildlife Centre after stealing cages . Hospital founder Angela Downham said it looked like the thieves had used a van to rip the front gate off its posts to gain access to the site. Angela, 46, said: 'The alarm system tells us that they got in through a window and attacked the main system at 10.02pm on Thursday. 'They forced the front door and wedged it open, which is how lots of our sick animals have wandered out or flown off.' The 46-year-old founded the charity 24 years ago and opened the hospital 18 months ago after raising £500,000. Two blackbirds and six hedgehogs died after the raiders broke into the wildlife hospital for injured animals . She said: 'We had only half-built the hospital as we had run out of money. It is shame as the full site would include a flat, which would provide a 24-hour security presence. 'This is very distressing and a real setback for us, but it will not stop us. We will have to close the place to new admissions and just look after the animals we have.' A police spokesman said: 'We are aware of the incident and appeal to anyone who has information to give us a call.'","Two blackbirds and six hedgehogs died after the raiders broke into the Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital and stole 26 cages .

But Ben Forrer would soon rue the moment he pitched up at the depot with an old cooker in the back of his van. The 33-year-old fireman unloaded the unwanted oven before going to talk to the manager in his office. Mistakenly crushed: Ben Forrer's van was crushed by mechanical scrapyard equipment accidentally while he dumped an old oven at the scrapyard . He had been there for just three minutes when he came out to find his £5,000 Citroen Relay van was not where he had parked it. ‘I checked my pockets in case I’d left . the keys in and someone had moved it,’ he said. ‘I carried on walking . around the yard and became more and more panicky.’ Unlucky owner: 33-year-old fireman Ben Forrer watched in horror as his vehicle was crushed . And then, puzzlement turned to horror. He looked up and saw his 12-year-old vehicle dangling from a crane above a huge crushing machine. Mr Forrer, from Swinford, Leicestershire, said: ‘I could see my van just swinging from side to side. ‘Obviously I was more than a little bit taken aback so I just started shouting “stop!” and running through the yard.’ Staff – who had mistaken the van for scrap – immediately lowered it to the ground, but it was already a write-off. ‘The roof was crushed in and the windows smashed from the mechanical grabber’, Mr Forrer said. ‘I was furious because even though it was a bit old it still had loads of life in it. ‘They said they thought it was a bit odd that the tax was in date, and the tyres were OK.’ Tools Mr Forrer had been keeping in . the back and using for work on a farm conversion for himself and his . wife Mandy, 32, were also damaged. The accident happened at a site run by waste management company Sita, in Coventry, on Saturday. The cooker’s owner, a friend of Mr .

Up to a million people are expected to line the route of the men’s cycle road race today, hoping to roar Mark Cavendish to Team GB’s first gold medal. Just six days after Bradley Wiggins’s astonishing victory in the Tour de France, Cavendish is hot favourite to win the 156-mile Olympic race. It goes from central London to Surrey, where riders will do nine laps of hilly terrain, and back to the capital again. Scroll down for video .

Route: The road race starts on The Mall and wends its way through south west London and into Surrey before looping back into the capital . Supporting role: Cavendish's partner, former Page 3 model Peta Todd . The crowd will rival the hordes that turn out to watch the London Marathon and the race could be the best-attended outdoor sports event in Britain of all time. World champion Cavendish, known as the Manx Missile, is expected to be cheered on by his girlfriend, former Page 3 model Peta Todd, 25 – mother of his four-month-old daughter – and a TV audience of millions. Last weekend in France Cavendish, 27, was one of the Team Sky cyclists who helped Wiggins emerge victorious. Today roles will be reversed as Wiggins and other Team GB cyclists try to ensure Cavendish takes gold. Should he triumph near Buckingham Palace at around 3.40pm, it will be the perfect start for Team GB’s hopes for a record haul of medals. There is also a growing expectation that Britain’s Lizzie Armitstead, 23, will gain a medal in tomorrow’s 87-mile women’s cycling race, which has the same route but involves two – as opposed to nine – circuits of Box Hill. Olympic organisers believe a Cavendish victory will fuel the feelgood factor in the country and inspire other British competitors. The men’s and women’s road races are two of the most eagerly awaited events of the Games. Viewing is largely free and the races come at a time of unprecedented interest in top-level cycling. Today’s race, which starts at 10am, takes riders from the heart of London, through Richmond Park and into the Surrey countryside where they will make nine ascents of Box Hill, and back to the Mall. Thousands of police and security officers will be on duty amid fears that a publicity-seeking protest group might try to pull off a stunt that could damage Cavendish’s chances.

A bag containing a bomb was left inside a U.S. government building for weeks after it was found by a security guard who failed to check it and stashed it under a desk. The bomb was in a canvas bag which contained a small locked safe and was found outside the 27-storey Patrick V.McNamara Federal Building which houses the FBI. But the guard misidentified the bag as found property and did not treat it as suspicious, despite not being aware of what it contained. The bag was then placed underneath the security desk in the building and it was not considered suspicious because the space was used to store property which had been found as well as personal belongings. Whilst underneath the desk, it was shaken by a guard and at least two employees X-rayed it to try and determine its contents. Eventually, 21 days after it was discovered, two security guards became suspicious of the bag and screened it. They could not identify the contents and so notified a Federal Protective Services  (FPS) inspector who concluded the bag could contain an explosive. The bomb went on to be detonated harmlessly by Detroit Police. Details of the discovery of the bomb were released in a report by the Homeland Security Department's office of inspector general yesterday. It concluded that the security guard had shown poor judgement as well as saying the guard's employer, a contractor, and the FDS shared some responsibility for the bomb going undetected. Worrying: The bag was then placed underneath the security desk, pictured and was not considered suspicious because the space was used to store found property . According to CNN, it said: 'Although the IED (improvised explosive device) did not explode, it represented a risk to the safety and security of the building and its occupants,' the report said. It added: 'The guard's actions were serious breaches that cannot be compared easily to other breaches by this company or other guard service companies because there is little precedent,'. The guard was a sergeant with the Detroit Police Department and according to one official was one of the best in the building. But following the incident, the guard was fired. Another guard and a supervisor were also fired and a second supervisor resigned before being fired. A number of others were suspended, given written warnings and retrained.

This is the forlorn face of a puppy rescued from a back-street breeder’s house where two newborn animals were found buried alive in a shallow grave. Gasping for breath, the two puppies were discovered in the garden by RSPCA officers, having been covered in a layer of soil hours after they were born. The puppies were in such a bad state they had to be put down at the scene. Horrific: A Staffordshire bull terrier puppy rescued from the home of James Perks, his wife Lorraine an Stephen Jenkins . Twenty-four other dogs, some confined to rabbit hutches, were rescued, some ‘barking  uncontrollably as if pleading for help’. Disturbing footage of the discovery was released yesterday after the three people who lived in the house were jailed for a catalogue of animal cruelty charges. James Perks, 74, his wife Lorraine, 49, and their lodger Stephen Jenkins, 35, ran a dog breeding business from their shabby home in Tamworth, Staffordshire, in which the animals ‘lived amongst squalor’. Horrific: Shocked police and RSPCA officers discovered the tiny animals fighting for life after being freshly buried in the back garden of the home of James and Lorraine Perks in Tamworth, Staffs, last year . Terrifying: The helpless Jack Russell puppies were alive when they were pulled from the dirt, but their condition was so bad they had to be put down soon after . Traumatic: Vet Steve Odell who put the puppies to sleep later described the scene as 'one of the most horrific ever witnessed' The four-and-a-half-minute film shows . the officers scouring the back garden, on August 25 last year after a . tip-off from a woman who bought a puppy from the breeders, which died . days later. Officers discovered 15 puppies and . nine adult Staffordshire bull terriers crammed into tiny rabbit hutches . outside, which they were kept in for 23 hours a day. One cramped hutch – measuring just 6ft . wide and 3ft high – contained four adult terriers while other dogs . lived in squalor in the house which was covered in faeces and urine. In the footage, in which 20 RSPCA . officers and police catalogue the shocking abuse of the animals, one . officer discovers a tiny puppy whimpering after being buried alive. An RSPCA inspector is heard saying: . ‘The police officer has just uncovered a puppy that’s been buried in the . garden. Buried alive. ‘Oh my goodness me. She’s found it buried alive.’ Sentenced: Today at Burton Magistrates' Court James Perks, 74, (green coat), his wife Lorraine, 49, (right) and Stephen Jenkins, 35, (far left) were all sentenced to 25 weeks in prison . Upsetting: The RSPCA was alerted to the address by a routine call from a member of the public who bought a puppy from the Perks after seeing a card on a noticeboard . The squirming, dirt-encrusted animal . can be heard crying out as a male vet inspects it and says: ‘It’s so . poorly, euthanasia is going to be required straight away. We’ll have to . put him to sleep.’ The officer then finds a second live . puppy lying near the first. The video finishes with the RSPCA officer . filming the two pups lying almost lifeless on the lawn and concludes: . ‘We’re sorting out immediate euthanasia for these poor puppies.’ The other dogs were confiscated and handed over to the RSPCA for rehoming. Steve Odell, the vet who destroyed the puppies, said it was one of the most horrific scenes he had witnessed. Cruel: Animals were kept in rabbit hutch-like cages and were locked away for 23 hours at a time .

The price of bacon is set to soar next year with new welfare laws threatening to push many European producers out of business. A Europe-wide partial ban on sow stalls - crates in which pregnant female pigs are confined - is due to take effect from January 1 2013 and is expected to have a major impact on Europe's pig market. The use of the intensive farming method slashes the cost of pig production, but has come in for intensive criticism from animal rights campaigners and is already banned in the UK. Cruel: A piglet feeds from its mother, held in a . sow stall. The practice, already banned in the UK, is to be outlawed . across the EU . It comes British pig farmers have warned they could be forced out of business as the rising costs of pig feed and supermarket competition on prices squeezes their margins to nearly nothing. The ending of the use of sow stalls across the EU is likely to impose significant costs on pig farmers on the continent which, experts say, could see pig production fall by between 5 and 10 per cent. Pig farmers' group BPEX said the impact was likely to be similar to that caused by similar rules for hens brought in at the start of this year which have led to the price of eggs soaring 75 per cent. Only three EU member states say they are already compliant with the new rules, with several others indicating that they expect a 'significant number' of their producers to stop breeding pigs, the Observer reported. BPEX spokesman Stephen Howarth told MailOnline: 'There's quite a significant investment in converting from one system to another. 'In the current economic climate, it's not going to be easy for people to get the financing to put in those changes. 'Probably some of those who were leaving the investment to the last minute might say now it's not worth making that investment.' Sow stalls are used in pig factory farms, known as intensive piggeries, which are usually housed in large warehouse-like buildings or barns. Breeding sows are confined to the crates throughout their three-month pregnancies, making it easier for farmers to feed them and control growth. The new rules will not bring European intensive piggeries quite up to UK standards of animal welfare but European farmers will be forced to stop keeping sows alone in crates. Instead they will be kept in slightly larger pens with other pigs which will allow them more freedom to move. Sow stalls have been banned in the UK since 1999. Mr Howarth said it was difficult to estimate how much much prices might increase at the butcher's counter, but he said the changes could see a 10 per cent increase in the price of pigs 'at the farmer's gate'. Animal welfare: Instead of being kept in the restrictive stalls, the rules will force farmers to keep their animals in pens which allow them more freedom to move . The changes to EU animal welfare rules come as British pig farmers have warned that they are being forced out of business because of the skyrocketing costs of pig feed. One hundred pig producers say they could be forced to shut down their pig units by Christmas because they can't afford to feed their animals. Price hikes: The change in welfare rules price a rise in the cost of pig feed threaten to send prices of bacon up . The problem is poor crop growing weather around the world which is pushing up the cost of pig feed. In a double whammy many small and medium sized producers are also being crippled as supermarkets continue to source cheaper pork from abroad. British pig farmers, who are recognised as world leaders in high welfare pig farming, are now urging shoppers to 'Buy British' in a bid to shore up the nation's pig production industry. Shoppers can look for the 'Red Tractor' logo found on British-produced products to make sure they are supporting the nation's farmers. Although imported sausages and bacon will still be available these are not produced to the same welfare standards as in Britain. National Pig Association general manager Dr Zoe Davies said: 'If supermarkets see a surge in demand for British product, they may be persuaded to pay our farmers the few extra pennies a kilo more they need to cover their soaring feed bills. 'So we are asking shoppers, who have always been incredibly loyal in the past, to please be extra careful to look for the British Red Tractor logo on bacon, sausages, and pork.'","EU to impose ban on sow stalls from January 1 2013 .

"PUBLISHED: . 01:05 EST, 10 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:15 EST, 10 August 2012 . A former Philadelphia policewoman has accused a supervisor with the city’s Police Internal Affairs Bureau of forcing her into a sexual relationship that lasted more than three years after threatening to fire her, according to an explosive new report. Keisha Johnson, a former city cop and aide in the Internal Affairs Bureau, told the Philadelphia Daily News that Staff Inspector Jerrold Bates made his first sexual advance in 2008 after inviting her into his office and plying her with flattery. Johnson said Bates complemented her on her work before slipping his hands into her shirt and fondling her breasts. Speaking out: Keisha Johnson, a former Philadelphia cop and aide in the Internal Affairs Bureau, went public with allegations of sexual harassment against her former boss . ‘I jumped up. I about fell out of my chair,’ Johnson told the Daily News. ‘I told him to stop. I told him I didn't feel comfortable. 'He said, ‘OK.' But he had a weird smirk on his face like he was thinking, ‘So what are you going to do about it?’’ According to the woman, Bates, a 21-year veteran on the force who is married, would use every chance he got to brush up against her in a sexual manner. He told her that he thought of her when he masturbated and asked her if she was wearing a thong, Johnson said. At one point, Johnson recalled the inspector telling her that if she wants to keep her cushy 8 to 4 job with weekends off, she should keep quiet. Otherwise, Johnson could be easily replaced. From then on, until December of 2011, Bates forced Johnson into a sexual relationship to keep her job at Internal Affairs, Johnson alleged. She and her attorney, Brian Puricelli, have filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. On July 3, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey has transferred Bates to the Special Operations Bureau, which oversees the Aviation, Canine and Marine units, among others, while Internal Affairs investigates Johnson's allegations. Johnson, 39, has since resigned from . the department and moved to Georgia. For years, she had kept silent . about her ordeal, feeling like no one would believe her accusations . against the well-connected Internal Affairs boss. Ousted: The 39-year-old woman said she was forced out of her job after complaining to police brass about two co-workers who had allegedly made racial remarks . Living in silence: Johnson said she kept mum about the alleged sexual harassment because she felt no one would believe or act on her accusations against Jarrold Bates . While the police department has vowed to conduct the investigation into the alleged sex scandal in good faith, some critics have dismissed it as a farce, calling for an outside agency to take over the probe. ‘How do you investigate your own person?’ she said. ‘It's a joke.’ Ramsey said he doesn't anticipate a conflict of interest from Internal Affairs detectives investigating their former supervisor. Johnson, a Penn State graduate, had been a police officer since 1997. She had known Bates, now 42, for a few years before he joined the Internal Affairs Bureau in September of 2007. A couple of months later, Bates asked her if she wanted to be his aide. Johnson took the job because it offered regular hours. Months later, she said her boss started making advances and threatening to find someone to take her place. ‘“This is who will replace you,' he . told me.’ “She wants to work with me so bad. She told me she'd give me a . blowjob every day.”’ Boys' club: Some female officers have described the city's police department as rife with sexual promiscuity . Bates implored Johnson to embrace the . culture of the police department, saying that this is how things are . done in the agency, which has been described by another female officer . as a  boys’ club where women either had to behave like ‘bitches’ or . sleep with their male colleagues. Johnson said she tried to avoid Bates, but her position as his aide made it virtually impossible. She started driving him around to meetings, and on one of these occasions, the 39-year-old said Bates brought her to his apartment, touched her breasts and masturbated in front of her. The woman said she was traumatized by the experience, and things had only gotten worse after that. She described her supervisor as mean and demeaning, never missing an opportunity to talk down to her. As a victim of childhood sexual abuse . at the hands of a family member, Johnson said she was quick to blame . herself and felt powerless to do anything. Johnson was engaged at a time and got . pregnant, which had given her a temporary respite from Bates’ alleged . advances. But as soon she had given birth to a baby girl three month . premature, the inspector started up where they left off, Johnson said. He groped her in his office and took her elsewhere for sexual interludes during work hours, she said. On various occasions, he made her drive to a love nest, to his home, his mother's house, and even her own home, according to Johnson. To complicate matters, Bates not only oversaw police internal investigations, he also handled equal-employment-opportunity complaints within the department. ‘I had gotten used to being a victim. I believed my career and my reputation would be destroyed if I didn't comply,’ she said. Her tenure in Internal Affairs came to an abrupt end in June, less than a year after Johnson complained about two of her female colleagues who she said were making derogatory racial remarks about her and a supervisor. In December, Johnson ended the sexual relationship with Bates for good. Around the same time, she told two Internal Affairs co-workers about her predicament. Six months later, Johnson was unexpectedly transferred to a district office, where on the first day of work she heard someone call her a rat. She quit the next day and moved to Georgia, where she lives with her daughter.","Keisha Johnson, 39, accused Staff Inspector Jarrold Bates, 42, of forcing her into sexual relationship .

Tortured: Grandmother Francoise Jansen was subjected to hours of torture by two masked intruders . A 31-year-old man was being questioned by police today after he was arrested in connection with the 'waterboarding' torture of a grandmother in her £7million mansion. Francoise Jansen, 73, told how she feared for her life after being stripped and having boiling water poured down her back when raiders burst into her home. The two masked men had used a ladder to break into the widow’s house through a bedroom window. They crept downstairs and surprised her as she watched the Olympics on television. After grabbing more than £150,000 worth of jewellery from one safe they demanded she open a second, larger one under the stairs. But the safe, which was empty, had not been used in 12 years and Mrs Jansen could not open it despite remembering the combination. That led to a terrifying three-hour ordeal in which the attackers used waterboarding – a form of torture in which the victim is made to feel they are about to be drowned. The men took underwear from Mrs Jansen’s bedroom and forced it into her mouth before dragging her into the en-suite bathroom. They pulled her head back over the bath and covered her face with a towel they kept flooded with water from the shower head. ‘They did this to me three times but I just couldn’t open the safe,’ she said. ‘I kept telling them it was empty but they didn’t believe me.’ Mrs Jansen, who lives on a private estate in Weybridge, Surrey, told the Mail: ‘I was absolutely terrified, I thought they were going to kill me. ‘They asked me if I had any grandchildren, I told them I had ten and they said “We are going to kill you, do you think your grandchildren will miss you?” ‘I was consumed by fear. It was sheer hell and all I can remember is praying.’ A spokesman for Surrey police said: 'Surrey Police officers have arrested a 31-year-old man from Brookwood . in connection with an aggravated burglary in St George’s Hill in . Weybridge. 'The man was arrested on Tuesday, August 7 and remains in police custody and inquiries are ongoing.' Mrs Jansen's six-bedroomed house had been broken into several weeks before the attack last Friday and Surrey Police believe the raiders had located the two safes at that point. Mrs Jansen, who had spent the early part of the day of her ordeal with friends at the Olympics fencing, said the men first attacked her in the bedroom. ‘One of them was forcing my head down on to the bed as the other one went down to the safe,’ she said. He kept saying have you got any money and I kept telling him I didn’t. ‘As I was on the bed I tried to press a panic button, I was an inch away but they saw what I was trying to do and from then they started to get really angry.’ The two men broke into Mrs Jansen's six-bedroom Surrey home as she was watching the Olympics on Friday night . The raiders got a kettle from the . kitchen and poured boiling water over her back and arm but Mrs Jansen . was still unable to help them open the safe. After the waterboarding, one raider threatened to cut off one of her fingers with a pair of secateurs but the other shouted back: ‘No, the f***ing bitch will bleed to death.’ Mrs Jansen said: ‘Then they tied me to the towel rail with cable they had ripped from a nearby radio, they cut off my trousers and T-shirt with scissors. ‘I was trembling because I thought they were going to rape me and I just kept praying. ‘I was semi-conscious but eventually I realised they were gone and I had to bite myself out of the wires to get free. ‘I cannot describe the relief when the police eventually arrived I felt like I had been through sheer hell and I was terrified that I was going to die.’ Mrs Jansen had been living alone in her detached mansion since her husband Peter, a businessman, died suddenly in 1998 aged 58. But she is now too petrified to return to her home and plans to live with her youngest son, Chris. The 42-year-old senior executive for British Gas, said: ‘We are very keen that the people who did this are caught so we can get closure for my mum. ‘And also because these people will strike again and then it could be even more violent. My mother is very lucky to be alive, someone has to make a stand.’ Detective Inspector Jake Nuttall of Surrey Police said: ‘This was an appalling unprovoked attack on a defenceless elderly woman in her own home. ‘Surrey Police is carrying out a thorough and extensive investigation to bring these cowardly offenders to justice.’ Anyone with any information should call Surrey Police on 101 or Crime stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.","Francoise Jansen subjected to three-hour ordeal by two intruders who demanded she open her safe .

"By . David Gardner and Associated Press . UPDATED: . 16:34 EST, 10 August 2012 . A one-time NFL star has been sentenced to life in . prison without the possibility of parole for murdering his lover's wealthy fiance nearly two decades ago. Eric Andrew Naposki was sentenced on Friday by an Orange County Superior Court judge, a year after he was convicted of first-degree murder. Prosecutors say 47-year-old Naposki shot 55-year-old William Francis McLaughlin . at the suggestion of his lover, Nanette Ann Packard, who was engaged to McLaughlin, 17 years ago. Resigned: Wearing the same shirt as at his conviction, Naposki shuts his eyes as his sentence is read out . Last ditch: Naposki makes a final attempt to clear himself before his sentence is read out . The pair allegedly conspired to carry out the murder-for-money slaying, so as to collect a $1 million life insurance payout. Naposki was working as a nightclub bouncer at the time of the 1994 . murder. He was a former linebacker for the New England Patriots and . Indianapolis Colts. The love triangle case went cold with detectives unable to find enough evidence to back up their suspicions about the couple. But police re-opened the investigation in 2007 and arrested Naposki and the former girlfriend, 46-year-old Nanette Johnson, three years ago. Led away: Last year Eric Naposki was found guilty of gunning down William McLaughlin, his lover's millionaire boyfriend in December 1994 . Prosecutors said the motive was money. Johnson, a mother-of-two, stood to gain $1 million in life insurance from McLaughlin's death. She was also charged with murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. The ex-football star was working as a bouncer at the Thunderbird Nightclub in Newport Beach at the time of the murder. He was found guilty of entering Mr McLaughlin's house using a key allegedly provided by Johnson and shooting the 55-year-old businessman six times in the chest. Killed: This photo from the trial shows slain millionaire William McLaughlin with his family . Plot: The jury found Naposki guilty of conspiring with the millionaire's fiancée Nanette McNeal to kill him to get life insurance money . The victim's 24-year-old son ran downstairs to find his father's body, but the intruder had vanished. Naposki claimed he was on his way to work after watching a soccer game involving one of Johnson's sons and didn't have time to carry out the shooting. But investigators drove the route countless times and proved there was sufficient time for Naposki to have been the killer. Naposki shook his head as the verdict was read out at Santa Ana Superior Court in July of last year but for McLaughlin's family the ruling signaled relief. 'We're very happy that justice has been served on our father's behalf,' said Jenny McLaughlin, the victim's daughter, following the conviction. Relief: Kimberly Bayless, back to camera, and her sister Jenny McLaughlin embrace as Naposki is found guilty of the murder of their father . Tears: Kim Bayless, daughter of murder victim William McLaughlin, reacts after a guilty verdict is delivered . Finally caught: Eric Naposki sits in court after he was found guilty . 'My dad is honoured today,' added her sister, Kim, as she fought back tears. Prosecutors said Johnson, now 46, had seduced the victim and convinced him to name her as a beneficiary in a $1 million life insurance policy taken out before the killing. He also changed his will allowing her to live in his beach house in the event of his death. She was allegedly stealing thousands of dollars from his bank accounts in the months and weeks before his death. The verdict came after more than three weeks of testimony that included 28 witnesses and more than 240 exhibits.","Allegedly conspired with his lover before shooting William McLaughlin, a wealthy businessman .

'So if you happen to see congressman Ryan, tell him how important this farm bill is to Iowa and our rural communities,' Obama said in remarks to be delivered in Council Bluffs, on the Missouri River on the western edge of Iowa. 'It's time to put politics aside and pass it right away.' As the House Budget Committee chairman, Ryan has demanded large cuts in Farm Bill spending, including food stamps for the poor. He was also campaigning in Iowa on Monday, two days after being chosen to be Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's running mate for the election. Ryan voted for a $383 million livestock disaster aid bill that the House passed on August 2 before a five-week recess. A Romney campaign spokesman said 'no one will work harder to defend farmers and ranchers than the Romney-Ryan ticket.' Under the plan announced by Obama, . the Agriculture Department will buy pork, lamb, chicken and catfish with . money from an emergency fund for responses to natural disasters.

A Texas man has lost his leg after becoming the latest victim of a flesh-eating bacteria that has ravaged at least six other victims across the South East in recent months. Just days after returning from an annual fishing tournament in Port O'Connor, Keith Korth, 44, found himself in a life-saving surgery that amputated his left leg from just two-inches above the knee. 'It's very fast. This bacteria can go about an inch an . hour,' Dr Luis Ostrosky of UT health and Memorial Hermann told KPRC. Victim: Keith Korth, 44, is the latest victim of a flesh-eating bacteria that led to the amputation of his left leg . Called necrotizing fasciitis, the bacteria that thrives in . both salt and fresh water can consume its victim’s body from even the smallest of . wounds. According to Dr Ostrosky, that opening can be as minimal as . a paper cut. 'The wading boots rubbed a blister on his foot.

'I've seen patients where they go on a fishing trip, they go . to sleep and they wake up in the morning and all of their leg is red,' Dr . Ostrosky who is not treating Mr Korth himself said. 'Ninety-nine per cent of the people are not going to get the . fresh eating bacteria ... but when it's happening, you need to be fast,' he . said while advising people to carry an antiseptic with them for such occasions. Mr Korth's contraction was not the first in the Port . O'Connor area, with a similar incident occurring in 2004. Nor was it the first in the U.S. Recently a string of contractions have popped up across . the South East, with at least six others requiring amputation after contracting the bacteria - some while in hospital . for child birth or minor surgery. Growing concern: Aimee Copeland, 24, (left) lost her leg, foot . and both hands while Lana Kuykendall, 36, (right) had just . given birth to twins before afflicted by the bacteria . Life saving surgery: Paul Bales, (left) had his leg amputated in Georgia after cutting himself in some water while Bobby Vaughn, (right),  also in Georgia had two-pounds of infected flesh removed after cutting himself cutting weeds . The aggressive disease made . headlines in May when it struck Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate student . from Little Tallapoosa River, who cut her leg when she fell from a . homemade zip-wire. Lana Kuykendall, 36, noticed the infection on the back of her . leg just hours after being released from Emory University Hospital in . Atlanta, where she gave birth to twins. Bobby Vaughn, 33, was a third Georgia . victim. He has been upgraded to good condition after doctors removed two . pounds of flesh from his groin. He became infected after he cut his thigh while cutting weeds in Cartersville. Paul Bales of Lake Sinclair, Georgia became infected after he cut his leg while installing a new dock at the lake on May 1.

In Tampa, Florida Lisa-Maria Carter contracted the bacteria in surgery when her small bowel was mistakenly sliced, releasing what she said was the naturally occurring bacteria in the body's intestine that can be detrimental when pierced. She lost her hands and feet and has filed a lawsuit against the hospital. According to the Centers . for Disease Control and Prevention, Mr Korth and the others like him, are extremely rare cases with just less than 1,000 cases reported every year. 'It's just one of those crazy things that happens,' Mr . Keith's neighbour Maxine Schwarze told KPRC. After speaking with Mr Keith's daughter, Ms Schwarze told . KPRC: 'It sounds like he’s doing better and hopefully they’ve stopped the . bacteria.' Symptom include redness, heat and intense pain. Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.","Keith Korth, 44, infected with necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating bacteria contracted through open wounds .

Accused: Kehren Sajid, pictured after a previous court appearance earlier this year, has denied four counts of child cruelty and five of common assault . A nursery nurse dragged a toddler across a mat 'like a ragdoll' while mistreating infants in her care, a court heard today. Kehyren Sajid was allegedly captured on CCTV mistreating youngsters at the Small Talk Nursery in Handsworth, Birmingham, in October last year. The 31-year-old is said to have assaulted one child by dangling them in the air while carrying them from a room, while another 'was thrown on to a bed'. Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court were told the children in question were aged between 13 and 17 months. The alleged offences were said to have come to light when the female nursery manager viewed CCTV footage in relation to an unrelated matter. Prosecutor Nigel Wilkins said she became concerned as to how some of the children were being treated by the defendant and contacted the police. He claimed that Sajid could be seen throwing a 17-month-old girl onto a mattress, causing her to almost strike her head on a radiator. Another young girl, aged 14 months, was allegedly carried by one arm on to a mat while a third was held in the air by her left arm as she was carried out of a room. A fourth child, said Mr Wilkins, was taken off a bed by her arm and put on to the floor. He said when interviewed by police and shown the CCTV footage, Sajid denied doing anything untoward. Rachel Barr, the nursery manager at the time, was asked to comment when shown clips of the alleged cruelty in the Winnie the Pooh room. She said: 'It is unacceptable handling a child in that manner. The way the child was thrown on the bed.' Shown the clip involving the 14-month-old she said: 'She is roughly handling the child, the way she is cleaning her face purposely to make her cry. 'There is no care or love or feeling towards the child. She is just treating her like a rag doll, the way she dragged her across the mat.' Claim: The children allegedly assaulted by Sajid at Small Talk Nursery in Handsworth, Birmingham (above) were said to be between 13 and 17 months . And commenting on another clip, she said: 'The children are exploring. They are just being children. Grabbing them by one arm and throwing them on the floor is unacceptable.' Sajid, from Handsworth, Birmingham, denies four charges of child cruelty and five of common assault. The trial continues.

Accused: Leon Lawrence, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court last year, denies charges of handling stolen goods and attempting to convert criminal property . Artwork by renowned graffiti artist Banksy was ripped from a hotel wall and put up for sale on eBay for £17,000, a court was told. The work, known as Sperm Alarm and attributed to the famous guerrilla graffiti artist, was allegedly put on the online auction site by Leon Lawrence, 32, after it had been stolen from a wall outside the four-star Hesperia Hotel in central London. Lawrence is said to have framed the piece, which shows 15 sperm swarming around a red sprinkler alarm, before putting it up for sale on eBay. He is alleged to have used his eBay account to try and sell the artwork under the name LeonLeon, between February 9 and April 4 2011, Southwark Crown Court heard on Monday. Staff at the hotel in Victoria contacted police when they saw the original work listed for sale online. Edward Franklin, prosecuting, told the court how staff had noticed the artwork as soon as it appeared on a wall outside the Hesperia. 'You may have heard of the artist Banksy. He is a graffiti artist and he appears to have graffitied a panel of wall belonging to the Hesperia Hotel, by Victoria station,' he said. 'Staff realised it was there, and they also realised when someone had come along and taken their panel. 'That piece of panel, with Banksy's design on it, dubbed the 'Sperm Alarm', was later put for sale on eBay and they contacted the police,' Mr Franklin said. 'The seller on eBay was registered as LeonLeon, and by working out who that person was Mr Lawrence entered into their investigation. 'He was trying to sell this stolen art.' Mr Franklin said it was the Crown's case that Mr Lawrence knew or believed the piece he was trying to sell was stolen. 'He did not manage to sell the item,' he added. The jury at Southwark Crown Court was told police officers found images of the artwork on Lawrence's laptop. Mr . Franklin said officers found a picture of the panel featuring the . artwork, as well as a picture of the space left when the panel was . removed from the hotel wall. Now you see it: The artwork, which has been attributed to famous guerilla graffiti artist Banksy, appeared on a wall outside London's Hesperia Hotel . Now you don't: Hesperia staff contacted police when the artwork disappeared and later appeared on eBay with a price tag of £17,000 . A picture showing the piece in the process of being framed was also found on the computer, he told the court. 'Also found were web pages of the auction site, where it would appear he (Lawrence) tried to sell the art work for £17,000,' Mr Franklin said. High-profile art collectors have forked out huge sums to own a Banksy original. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie spent £1 million on works by the elusive street artist in 2007. Lawrence, of Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, denies charges of handling stolen goods and attempting to convert criminal property.

A new biography of former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno sheds light on his fall from grace in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal. The long-serving coach, affectionately called 'JoePa' by students, sobbed uncontrollably and continually after the university board fired him for allegedly overlooking the child abuse scandal involving his former assistant coach, according to an upcoming book by sportswriter Joe Posnanski. 'Paterno met with his coaches at his house. He sobbed uncontrollably. This was his bad day,' Posanksi writes in his biography, Paterno. Fall from grace: Joe Paterno (pictured with the Penn State football team in 2004) was overcome with emotion after he was fired from his coaching job in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal . The football legend repeatedly broke down after his ouster, leaving his coaching staff uncertain how to comfort the man who had always appeared tough as nails on the field. 'Nobody knew how to handle such emotion. Joe had always seemed invulnerable,' he writes. Excerpts of the book, due out August 21, were printed in GQ. Guilty: Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted on June 22, 2012 of sexually assaulting 10 boys over 15 years . Posanksi was granted access to Paterno in the summer of 2011 and was entrenched in the coach's inner circle in State College, Pennsylvania, when the grand jury indictment of Sandusky was delivered in November. He describes how Paterno's son, . Scott, a lawyer and lobbyist, saw the writing on the wall early on and . was the first in the family to realize how damaging the scandal would be . on his father's reputation. 'When . Scott read the presentment, he called his father and said, 'Dad, you . have to face the possibility that you will never coach another game.' Posanski . also writes that despite Paterno's winning record on the field, he had . made enemies on the Penn State board of trustees, according to Dan . McGinn, the PR specialist who worked with the Paterno family when the . scandal broke. As . early as 2004, Paterno had clashed with Penn State University President . Graham Spanier and did not have allies who would support him, McGinn . said, citing Paterno family adviser Guido D'Elia. 'The board started to turn [in 2004], we don't have anybody on the board now,' D'Elia told McGinn. Fired: Joe Paterno (on November 9, 2011) the day he was fired from Penn State in the aftermath of the football team's child sex-abuse scandal . After . Sandusky was arrested on November 5, 2011 and charged with multiple . counts of sexual abuse, Paterno said on November 9 that he would resign . at the end of the season from his coaching post at Penn State after 46 . years. But the Penn State board rejected his resignation and instead voted to fire Paterno, delivering the news in a late night telephone. 'My name. I have spent my whole life trying to make that name mean something. And now it's gone,' he told his son Jay, who had served on the coaching staff of the Penn State Nittany Lions football team under his father. Goodbye to JoePa: Penn State students remember former head football coach Joe Paterno after his death on January 22, 2012 . On November 18, the family revealed that Paterno was suffering from a treatable form of lung cancer. On January 22, 2012, Paterno died at the age of 85. An independent report of the scandal, conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh, concluded that Paterno, president Graham Spanier, athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz 'failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade.' The report, released in July, called the school officials 'callous’ for their disregard of the child victims. After a highly publicized trial in June 2012, Sandusky, 68, was convicted on 45 criminal counts for sexually abusing 10 victims. He will be sentenced in September.","'I don't know what I'm going to do with myself,' Paterno said after his firing from the Penn State football team ."

NBC has come under fire yet again for its Olympics programming - this time for editing out highly-anticipated rock acts from its coverage of the extravagant closing ceremony on Sunday night. Hundreds of enraged viewers across the U.S. vented their frustration on Twitter after the network cut out performances by Ray Davies, The Who and Muse for an hour-long preview of Animal Practice. This selective editing meant NBC's coverage ended as it began, after the network chose to cut out a moving tribute to the victims of the 2005 London bombings from the Opening Ceremony. Interrupted: Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of The Who perform during the Closing Ceremony. Their performance was delayed until after NBC showed an hour-long preview of a new show . Cut: Matt Bellamy of Muse plays at the ceremony on Sunday. The band's performance was cut for U.S. viewers even though it made the official song for the Olympics . 'I still don't understand, it's a tape . delay, so can't you do the math in advance? Why do you need to cut off . the closing ceremony? #nbcfail,' Raj Sarkar complained on Twitter. Actor Nate Barlow added: 'Why #nbcfail ranks last: no better way to turn people off a . new show than to preempt @thewho & other rock legends for it.' Viewers . were astounded when the network instead showed a preview of its new comedy, Animal . Practice episode. Some acts were cut entirely, but The Who's performance was shown an hour later. Music fans were left disappointed by the absence of Muse, who . performed their official Olympics song, Survival, while backed by a massive . choir. Ousted: A performance by musician Ray Davies was also cut from the NBC broadcast . Dazzling: The Who plays for thousands of fans at the Closing Ceremony - but millions more in the U.S. had to wait to watch the performance. It is just the latest in a string of gaffes by NBC during the Olympics . Twitter user Alex Heberling pointed out: 'Do they not know that Muse did the OFFICIAL SONG OF THE LONDON 2012 GAMES? UGH. #NBCFail.' 'Their broadcast was horrible! No Muse . with the OFFICIAL song of the Olympics. Who made that call? @NBC . #NBCfail,' user LoriAndJava wrote. NBC, which streamed the ceremony live on its Olympics website, had urged viewers on its Twitter page to stay tuned for 'The Who after @Animal Practice :)'. It concluded with: 'And that's a wrap! Thanks for enjoying . the 2012 #Olympics with us!' The network came under repeated fire throughout the 16 days of the Games for a string of gaffes. Outrage: Viewers lambasted NBC on Twitter for cutting out the highly-anticipated musical acts . It started off on the wrong foot by editing out a tribute for the victims of the 2005 London . bombings from the Opening Ceremony coverage, deeming it 'not suited for . American audiences'. Twitter was also flooded with gripes . about NBC keeping marquee events off the air until prime-time, the broadcast that brings in the most viewers . and advertising revenue for the network. Sports fans were particularly enraged when the 100m men's sprint - won by Jamaican runner Usain Bolt - was delayed by nearly six hours for American audiences. And although NBC had defended its choice by telling viewers they could watch it streaming live on the internet, the page failed to load correctly, leaving thousands fuming. 'Usain Bolt outruns the NBC live stream's buffer!' one Twitter user joked. Poor choice: Instead, NBC chose to air an hour-long preview of its new show, Animal Practice . Offensive: NBC also came under fire for showing an advert of a monkey competing in gymnastics shortly, pictured, after African American Gabby Douglas won the gold medal . NBC was also forced to apologise after . airing an ad featuring a monkey performing gymnastics, right after . showing the performance of Gabby Douglas, the first African-American to . win Olympic gold.

And . it came under fire for filing a complaint over tweets by British . journalist Guy Adams, whose Twitter account was suspended after he . lambasted the network's coverage. Jim . Bell, the Olympics executive producer who is overseeing the coverage, . repeatedly stood by the delayed viewing, saying the prime time . viewers take priority - especially when the network, which paid $1.2 . billion to acquire the Olympics rights, was desperately trying to avoid a . loss. 'When a company invests the kind of . money that we have in the Olympics we have absolutely every right to . protect that investment,' he said in a previous interview with Media . Bistro. Frustrating: Sports fans were also annoyed when NBC delayed Usain Bolt's 100m win by nearly six hours . Bad start: NBC edited out a tribute to the victims of the 2005 bomb attacks in London in the Opening Ceremony . Shock: Viewers flocked to Twitter to vent their anger - but Bell said the cut was down to time constraints . 'There's still a huge audience out there of people who want to watch this stuff at a time when it is convenient for them, when there are mass audiences, when people can gather around and watch TV, and one of the last great family viewing events out there. 'This is one thing you watch together. And if you kind of end up giving it away on TV you're not protecting your investment and you're not serving the audience and you're not serving the affiliates and you're not serving the advertisers.' Despite audiences frustrations, the 2012 London Olympics were the second most watched event in American TV history, early Nielsen ratings have shown.

A grandfather caught a pair of mean-spirited traffic wardens removing snow from double yellow lines to make it appear as if drivers had purposely parked illegally. Once the lines had been revealed, the over-officious inspectors had no hesitation in dishing out tickets on the vehicles left abandoned in Boston Street, Nottingham when heavy snow fell. But pensioner Anthony Wilkinson spotted the wardens' underhand actions and embarked on an 18-month campaign to get the council to admit that the tickets should not have been issued. He says the incident has brought to light a possible . 'culture of deception and disdain for the public' among parking industry employees. Scroll down for video . Idea: CCTV footage showing the moment traffic wardens noticed cars parked on snow-covered double yellow lines on Boston Street in the centre of Nottingham on November 30, 2010 . Mr Wilkinson had been left stranded in the city because of the heavy snow on November 30, 2010. Quickly appreciating that the inspectors were up to no good, the 70-year-old grabbed his camera to snap the wardens' efforts to ensnare motorists at around 8.30pm. Through a window above the road the grandfather of two observed the two inspectors issuing tickets to two cars having removed snow to reveal double yellow lines. Mr Wilkinson then realised he had further evidence of the untoward behaviour in the form of CCTV shot from a camera positioned outside his office. Pensioner Anthony Wilkinson embarked on an 18-month campaign to get the council to admit . the tickets should not have been issued . Although the cars did not belong to . him, outraged Mr Wilkinson turned good Samaritan and decided to . investigate if the actions of the over-zealous officers were fair. Now after an 18 month battle in which 30 letters were sent Nottingham City Council has finally admitted to the semi-retired printer that the wardens were in the wrong. Mr Wilkinson said: 'When I first contacted the council they told me the wardens had not moved the snow, they didn’t know I had the footage so it was then I decided to take it further. 'I thought ‘no, they’re, wrong’, I think it has highlighted a possible culture of deception and disdain for the public among the employees of the parking industry. 'It was one of the worst nights of snow of the year and there were people abandoning their cars elsewhere in the city. 'It was a very insignificant road, it’s not like these cars were blocking access and they could have been left there because of the heavy snow. 'There are places on this road you can park freely and I think that would have been made harder to see with the snow. It’s about common sense. 'I have nothing against parking restrictions and they can do a good job but I didn’t like it when I was told they hadn’t done it and I had CCTV showing they had.' Untoward: One of the traffic wardens begins to clear the snow from the road using his feet . Despicable: Having revealed the double yellow lines, the CCTV footage shows the traffic wardens writing out a ticket for one of the cars parked on Boston Street . After the incident Nottingham City Council, which employed private firm NSL to enforce parking, continually denied the wardens had done anything wrong. Now Mr Wilkinson has finally received a letter from Nottingham City Council stating that the fines had been cancelled and the tickets should not have been issued. The letter reads: 'The conduct of the civil enforcement officers was not and would never be condoned by Nottingham City Council. 'In this instance the enforcement was certainly not fair or accurate and was not consistent with the high standards of enforcement expected.' The council no longer uses NSL and its own staff now enforce parking regulations. In a previous letter to Mr Wilkinson the council had stated that it did not have a 'specific protocol' for snow on yellow lines, but added that 'civil enforcement officers must be able to see the lines and the windscreen in order to be able to issue. 'This would normally cover snow, standing water, frost, leaves and similar.' A spokesman from NSL said traffic wardens are not given any incentives, nor are they set targets, which is against the law.","Inspectors put fines on cars abandoned in heavy snow in Nottingham .

Peterborough Crown Court heard how he terrified a shop worker by holding the weapon to his head - which later turned out the be an empty BB gun. Charles Kellett, prosecuting, said: 'He could feel it was cold. Tihanovs said ‘have you got some money?’ He thought the gun was real. 'He felt scared and pulled his head away. The man said ‘I’m only joking’ and he hugged him.'

He approached a number of workers in various parts of the store and pointed the gun at them and shoppers. Dimitrious Tihanovs has been jailed for 18 months . Tihanovs showed a security guard the firearm, saying the gun was not real and he was “only messing about.” He cocked and fired the gun two or three times, showing it was empty and left after kissing the guard’s hand. He returned to the store at 2.30pm to steal some peanuts and then assaulted a security guard as he was arrested. Charles Falk, defending, described Tihanovs’ actions as a “stupid, ill-thought-out joke with no element of hostility.” He told the court Tihanovs had thought of himself as 'some sort of Latvian James Bond or Starsky and Hutch' and his actions were intended to be a game. Mr Falk said: 'This was a drunken, oafish, short-lived piece of idiocy where a defendant in drink took temporary leave of all judgment and sanity.' Tihanovs was jailed for 17 months for possession of an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, one month consecutively for theft and one month concurrently for assault at Peterborough Crown Court.

Murderess: Dana Chandler was given the maximum penalty of two 50-year terms in prison for the 2002 murders of Karen Harkness and Mike Sisco . An Oklahoma woman was sentenced to two consecutive 50-year prison terms on Monday for shooting to death her ex-husband and his fiance in 2002. The sentencing comes five months after Dana Chandler, of Duncan, Oklahoma, was found guilty of gunning down 47-year-old Mike Sisco and 53-year-old Karen Harkness as they slept in their Topeka, Kansas, home. Chandler was convicted of two counts of premeditated murder. Prosecutors said the 52-year-old woman committed the crimes after Sisco told her he planned to marry Harkness. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Chandler decided to represent herself at her sentencing on Monday. Chief Judge Nancy Parrish denied her request for a new trial or acquittal. Prior to the sentencing, six of Sisco and Harness' family members who attended the hearing gave emotional victim impact statements, and two crime scene experts presented evidence. The judge could have sentenced Chandler to two concurrent life terms with parole eligibility after 25 years, two consecutive life terms with parole eligibility after 50 years, two concurrent 50-year terms, and two consecutive 50-year terms, which is the maximum sentence in Oklahoma. Harkness and Sisco were found shot to death on July 7, 2002, in the woman’s southwest Topeka apartment. Police spent years investigating the murders, but the trail had gone cold. Victims: Mike Sisco, right, and Karen Harkness, left, were shot 10-12 times as they slept in their bed . Lives cut short: Sisco and Harkness, who were both divorced, were planning to get married at the time of their deaths . The FBI became involved in the probe and the case was even featured on the CBS show '48 Hours' in 2009, which sparked a renewed interest in solving the mystery. On July 25, 2011, nearly a decade after the deadly double homicide, Sisco’s ex-wife was arrested in the parking lot of a fast food eatery in Oklahoma and charged with two counts of first-degree murder. The judge elected to subject Chandler to the harshest punishment because she said the murders were committed in ‘an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel manner.’ Crime scene: The couple's bullet-ridden bodies were discovered by their relatives in a downstairs bedroom of Harkness' duplex in Topeka . Sisco and Chandler married in 1982 and lived in Colorado, but their relationship began unraveling after the husband moved the family to his hometown of Topeka, Kansas. His wife was miserable there, which eventually led to a serious drinking problem. The couple’s son, Dustin, told '48 Hours' in 2010 that his mother would drink often and a lot, which caused her to behave irrationally, ‘like she had no mind.’ Eventually, the feuding couple decided to split, but the divorce process was slow-going and fraught with acrimony. Newlyweds: Sisco and Chandler got married in 1982 and had two children . The couple's marriage started coming apart when Sisco moved the family to Topeka against the wishes of his wife, who started drinking heavily . The court found that Mike Sisco was the more stable parent and awarded him full custody of Hailey and Dustin, and Chandler was ordered to pay child support. The divorce was finalized in 1998, but Chandler appeared reluctant to let her ex-husband go. Caretaker: Sisco got custody of his two teenage kids after having been declared by court the more stable parent . Sisco’s sister, Cathy Boots, told '48 Hours' that Chandler would frequently harass and stalk her ex and his new girlfriend, Harkness, lurking around their neighborhood and watching them from an alley behind their home. According to testimony presented during the trial, in early July of 2002, Chandler became upset after learning that her ex-husband was planning to marry Harkness. On July 7, she drove from Denver to Topeka, broke into her rival’s duplex where she ambushed the sleeping couple, shooting them 10-12 times as they slept. Chandler then got back in the car and drove back to Denver. Her cell phone use, which would have showed her location when she made calls, and her credit card use dropped to zero when the victims were killed and before and after the murders. In the morning, the couple’s bullet-riddled bodies were discovered in a downstairs bedroom by Harkness’ parents and Sisco’s mother, who arrived at the apartment for a Sunday fish fry. During Monday’s sentencing, Sisco’s and Chandler’s daughter, speaking for herself and on behalf of her brother, said their father was the parent who taught them to have strength while he suffered pain from his ex-wife. Final act: Chandler, right, chose to represent herself in court during her sentencing, which came several months after she was convicted of two first-degree murders . Portraits of grief: Six of the slain couple's family members, including Sisco's sister, Cathy Boots, left, and his daughter, Hailey, right, read victim impact statements . ‘We’ve been robbed of . security, love and support of the person who took care of us and raised . us for our whole lives,’ Hailey Sisco said. The . judge called Chandler ‘selfish’ and accused her of emotionally deserting . her two children, who were in their mid-teens at the time of the . murders, after their father’s death. ‘Your acts were extremely self-centered,’ Parrish said. ‘You weren't thinking of anyone but yourself.’ Resolution: Erin Sutton, right, hugs her brother Chad Harkness following the sentencing of Dana Chandler .

A wife with a 'fiery temper' who killed her husband by setting fire to him in bed has been found guilty of murder. Georgina Pontes Furtado Vilela, 47, was sentenced to 23 years in prison after being convicted of murder and arson with intent to endanger life at Wolverhampton Crown Court earlier today. During the two week trial the court heard how HIV-positive Vilela had suffered from depression and felt 'like an incomplete woman' as a result of not being able to bear Mr Vilela children. Georgina Pontes Furtado Vilela (left) was found guilty of murder after setting alight to her husband, Carlos Vilela (right) after she discovered he had fathered a lovechild . The serious house fire she started happened while four of her step-daughters were also in the home. It had been started in the first floor back bedroom by Georgina, from Walsall, who is believed to have deliberately poured petrol on her 45-year-old husband Carlos, as he lay on the bed. She then left the property and watched as neighbours and emergency services battled to rescue Carlos and four of his six daughters, aged 13 to 21, who were all trapped inside. The most seriously injured daughter, Josefina . then aged 14, suffered 60 per cent burns in the blaze and had to be . rescued from inside the house by the fire service. She . was resuscitated by emergency services at the scene and has only . recently been discharged from hospital, with life changing injuries. Carlos Vilela was killed in a house fire at his home in Pleck Road, Walsall in March, last year . One of the daughters, aged 17 at the time, suffered a broken pelvis and leg after she jumped from the first floor window. The . 21-year-old daughter suffered smoke inhalation as well as cuts and . bruises, while a 13-year-old girl was rescued by neighbours as she . climbed onto a porch roof. Judge . John Warner sentenced Vilela to life for the charge of murder with a . minimum sentence of 23 years and 10 years to run concurrently for the . charge of arson with intent to endanger life. He . said: 'You are 47 years of age, a lady of previous good character. The . jury have convicted you of murdering your husband and for arson with . intent to endanger life. 'You . killed your husband in the most horrific way by throwing petrol on him . from the container you bought in the week before the murder. 'You set fire to him on the bed you . and he shared. It was a very serious fire. Your four stepdaughters were . in the house at the time and you knew it. 'Helena fractured her leg and pelvis . escaping the fire. Josefina, now aged 15, had to be rescued by . firefighters and received catastrophic injuries. 'Both her legs had to be amputated at . the knee and her arm as well. She remains in hospital. Her life has . been totally ruined by what you have done. ' Georgina Vilela poured petrol on her husband after finding out he had fathered a love child and then set their Walsall home alight, killing him and seriously injuring his daughter . Your husband was in a vulnerable . position and at your mercy with that lethal source of petrol and . ignition that you used to such a devastating effect and you did intend . to kill him. 'The act of setting fire to him was . something you had contemplated for some time before you did it and at . the time we have heard you had conversations with your stepdaughters . about wanting to appear in the newspapers or TV.' Detective Sergeant Rob Bastin, from . the Major Investigation Review Team, said 'This tragic event has clearly . devastated the family and has had a significant effect on the community . around them. 'I would like . to thank all of the emergency workers who attended the scene on that . tragic morning, in particular the fire service, whose efforts saved the . life of the 14-year-old girl trapped inside. 'I also want to pay tribute to the community spirited neighbours who helped rescue the girls, who, without their help, may not have survived. 'This was a horrific case, in which Viella acted in a cold and calculating way. We have evidence of her buying petrol from a garage a couple of days before the murder. 'This was a premeditated act, which left six daughters without a father and at least one of those girls with life changing injuries.' Carlos Vilela’s had moved to England in 2006 from Portugal, settling in Walsall a year later. They said 'We are pleased that justice has been done for our much missed father Carlos and for all the people that Georgina put at risk by her actions. 'However, we do forgive Georgina for what she did and we are now looking forward to moving on with our lives to a positive future. 'We would like to thank our family, friends and all the different authorities who have helped and supported us through this difficult time.

Yvonne Briscoe from Brynford, North Wales, who is suffering from bowel cancer had had to take drastic steps to get the treatment she wanted . A seriously ill cancer patient has been forced to rent a second home so she can receive life-saving treatment because of a postcode lottery in the health service. Yvonne Briscoe, 57, wanted a drug to reduce her bowel tumour but was refused funding from doctors in her home town in North Wales. She has been forced to take out a six month lease on a flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester, 53 miles from her family home, so she can qualify for the treatment of Cetuximab at specialist cancer hospital, The Christie, in Manchester. The drug is not approved by NICE - the National Institute for Clinical Excellence - and is not routinely available in Wales. But Cetuximab, which is said to prolong life for cancer sufferers who have tried other . drugs that have failed, is more accessible through the Cancer Drugs . Fund in England. Mrs Briscoe, whose main home is in Brynford, North Wales, applied for Cetuximab in Wales but was turned down for the drug on the grounds that her case was not exceptional. Mrs Briscoe said: 'If my case is not an exception I don't know what it is. 'I . think it's terrible that i have to rent out a property in another . country simply so I can get the treatment I so desperately need. 'Although this treatment is available in England, it is unavailable in Wales. 'It is all down to cost but how can you put a price on somebody's life? 'I was absolutely fuming at the decision to refuse funding - especially because I had been misdiagnosed in the first place.' The retired council worker was misdiagnosed by her own doctor in 2008, who wrongly said the bowel cancer was irritable bowel syndrome. Tragically, the misdiagnosis resulted in the cancer spreading to her liver and lungs. Despite the huge blunder, Welsh doctors said Mrs Briscoe is not an 'exceptional case' for funding. Christie Hospital, Manchester, where Mrs Briscoe will be given access to the drug Cetuximab to try and prolong her life . Yvonne Briscoe's second home in Stockport is 53 miles from her family home in Brynford, Wales. She has rented the second home so she is closer to The Christie hospital . Mrs Briscoe had started chemotherapy at the Glan Clwyd Hospital, 25 minutes away from her home to target the cancer, but in October last year doctors told her that the treatment had stopped having an effect. She asked about other treatments, determined to find a drug that would help her. Mrs Briscoe, who lives with her husband Michael, 61, in their home in Wales, arranged to see a consultant at Christie Hospital. Consultants said she would benefit from Cetuximab and they could treat her there. But as she lived in Wales she wasn't able to get it. Mrs Briscoe said: 'I felt that I had to do something drastic in order to register for the treatment. 'Renting in Stockport is not ideal but I was left with no choice.' She has had to register with a doctor in Stockport and is paying £400 per month to rent the flat. Mrs Briscoe is currently being treated on a weekly basis with the drug mitomycin C which is keeping the cancer stabilised and so is unable to start the Cetuximab until the treatment is finished, which is likely to be in September. The Christie Hospital in Manchester, a specialist hospital which is the largest cancer centre in Europe . Mrs Briscoe is paying £400 a month to rent a flat in Stockport so she can receive treatment at the Christie Hospital in Manchester (pictured) Mrs Briscoe has set up an online petition that she intends to send to the Welsh Assembly Government outlining her case and pushing for a change. Bosses at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board say Cetuximab is still not recommended by NICE and is not routinely available in Wales as a result. Dr Matthew Makin, chief of staff of the Cancer Clinical Programme Group, said: 'We can confirm that in this case a request was considered and no clinical exceptionality was determined and thus in accordance with policy, the request was refused. 'Whilst we have every sympathy with Ms Briscoe, we have followed the process as it stands in Wales at this time.' The Cancer Drugs Fund was brought in by the Coalition in 2010, providing £200million for people unable to access drugs because of NICE decisions to get them funded. The news comes shortly after a cancer . sufferer launched a scathing attack on David Cameron for NHS failings to . fund the cancer treatment she desperately needed.","Yvonne Briscoe was refused life-prolonging drug from doctors in Wales .

The husband of the free diver whose body was pulled from the ocean on Saturday after she went missing has spoken out publicly for the first time to defend himself, insisting he has nothing to do with his wife's death. Alan Weiss told KTLA he was devastated over his wife Rebecca's death and though he was aware of the suspicion surrounding his involvement, he feels he does not have to prove himself to anyone. 'I've left the house a few times and every time I leave the house, I'm kind of afraid of who I might walk into,' he said. Divers found the 50-year-old's body in a cove about 200 yards from the shore of Terranea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, Los Angeles County, a week after she disappeared after allegedly going free diving on her own. Scroll down for video . Devastated? Alan Weiss said he feels he does not have to explain to anyone the reasons as to why he did not go looking for his missing wife . Identity:LA Country Coroner's office confirmed the identity of Rebecca Weiss whose family were huddled by the shore as her body was recovered . Mr Weiss thanked all the people who joined in the search to find his wife and revealed he has not slept since she disappeared. Police have questioned the 60-year-old and insist he is not a person of interest. Rebecca's belongings were found near the rocky coastline after she was reported missing on August 11  by her husband, Alan Weiss - who the victim's mother, Vilma Causey, claims was having an affair and did not help look for her. After her disappearance, Rebecca's . mother wanted to know why Mr Weiss was not out looking for his wife and . called his behavior 'very strange'. To this, Mr Weiss said: 'To detract . from people looking for Rebecca, to make it about something else was . really distasteful. I don't need to prove myself to anybody. 'Anyone who said I killed her, would only be people who didn't know us.' He thanked all the people who joined in the search to find his wife and revealed he has not slept since she disappeared. Police have questioned Mr Weiss and insist he is not a person of interest. Alan Weiss said of those who suspected him: 'Anyone who said I killed her, would only be people who didn't know us' No blame: Police have interviewed Alan Weiss, right, and insist he is not being considered a person of interest in his wife's death . Scene: Mrs Weiss was said by her husband to have gone diving solo at their favorite location, pictured, on the day he last saw her . Weiss' mother, with the support of family members excluding Weiss' husband, had been canvassing the area relentlessly with her 50-year-old daughter’s picture since she first disappeared. Police said they are investigating both Weiss' death and an apparent drowning in the same area. An autopsy is being conducted to try and discern the cause of death. Mr Weiss told sheriff's detectives he last saw his wife driving away from their Marina del Rey home wearing a wetsuit and that Mrs Weiss was an experienced free-diver. Mrs Weiss' mother and brother were near the resort passing out fliers when the body was found. By 2.15pm the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner launched an investigation at the scene, according to Lt. Larry Diet, accompanying homicide investigators who were present when the body was pulled from the water. Clues: Mrs Weiss's husband of 20 years, Alan Weiss, pictured beside her, has not been listed as a suspect and has been cooperating with authorities according to police . Devastated: Rebecca's mother Vilma Causey, left, was on the shore when the body was pulled from the water, having never stopped searching for her only daughter . Suspicious: Her brother Bob Causey believes something extraordinary must have happened to his sister if she was in the water as she was wearing a wet suit and a strong swimmer . Police had been searching for Mrs Weiss after she did not return home from a believed solo . diving expedition at a location her husband described as being the couple's favorite location. Homicide detectives had interviewed . her husband and said he has been cooperating so far with the investigation and is not named a suspect. But investigators say unusual circumstances related to her disappearance have led them to reclassify the case from a missing person investigation to a homicide. Life together: Rebecca Weiss co-owned two businesses with her husband but recently, according to her mother, said she believed her husband was having an affair . Her mother told KTLA 5 that her daughter confided in her shortly before she disappeared that she suspected her 60-year-old husband was engaged in an extramarital relationship. Vilma Causey said: 'My daughter told me that she found it on the computer... He has a girlfriend.' As well as this, she said that while they are doing everything they can to find her daughter - including passing out flyers in the area - Mr Weiss had done nothing to help, which the family think is strange. She said of Mr Weiss behavior: 'Very bad, very strange. That is . not the reaction of a person that has somebody missing that is close to . you. 'Was she the only one on the beach to swim? Especially at that resort? No one saw her? No one saw her?' Mrs Causey also revealed her daughter's cell phone and keys are missing, but her credit cards and driving license were found. Her brother Bob Causey also said it is hard to believe something could have gone wrong. 'My sister is a strong swimmer, and she was wearing a wetsuit, according to my brother-in-law.' Mr Causey said: 'So it would have to be something out of the extraordinary for something to happen to her out there.' The couple were married 20 years . and seemed happy, according to friends, who said they traveled the . world and enjoyed their diving hobby together. Mrs Weiss co-owned two grocery . businesses with her husband. Her mother said: 'There has to be somebody who must have seen. This is not an isolated place. This is a resort. There should have been people.' Her . clothes and other belongings were found near her BMW X5, which was . parked at the Terennea resort on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Stunning: An aerial view of the Point Vicente Lighthouse near where Mrs Weiss is said to have been diving .

Students with guns at the University of Colorado will be segregated in the dormitories on the school's Boulder and Colorado Springs campuses, the school announced this week. Guns will be banned from the residential areas on main campuses and gun-possessing residents will be corralled into off-campus zones. The announcement comes less than a month after James Holmes, a former CU graduate student, allegedly shot dead 12 people at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado. Gun owners out: The University of Colorado campus in Boulder (pictured) will move students with concealed-weapons carry permits to off-campus housing . At the University of Colorado campus in Colorado Springs, students cannot bring guns to athletic or cultural events . The school actually began crafting . the new housing policy this Spring, after the Colorado Supreme . Court ruled, on March 5, to allow individuals with state-issued concealed . carry permits to carry handguns on college campuses. All undergraduate students will be asked in their housing contracts if they hold a Colorado concealed carry permit, CCP. They will be free to posses their firearms in designated areas but will be asked to forgo . bringing a handgun to campus. While some see the policy as an implementation of the court's decision, others are calling it a response to the tragedy involving the school's former student. On July 20, . Holmes, 24, allegedly entered the Century 16 movie in Aurora and started a terrifying . shooting rampage that left 12 dead and 58 wounded. Police . say he fired a 12-gauge Remington 870 Express Tactical shotgun, a Smith . & Wesson M&P15 semi-automatic rifle and a Glock 22 handgun. Holmes had obtained his weapons and ammunition legally but he did not have a . concealed weapons permit. Former student: James Holmes allegedly entered a movie theater in Aurora and shot dead 12 people . In June 2011, Holmes had . enrolled as a Ph.D. student in neuroscience at the University of . Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora but he dropped out in June . 2012. The . CU housing policy will impact residential students at the university’s . campuses in Boulder and Colorado Springs and did not mention the . school’s other campuses. ‘The main dorms on the main campus will not allow any concealed-carry weapons,’ university spokesman Bronson Hilliard told the Denver Post. The Boulder campus will provide off-campus housing units, in a downtown area, that can accommodate up to 50 residents, though officials doubt they will ‘have anywhere near that number.’ Less than one per cent of the student-body of each campus is believed to have a concealed-carry permit. To obtain a concealed carry permit in Colorado, a person must be at least 21 years of age, complete an FBI background check, and have either previous military or police experience or proof of completion of a firearms training course. ‘I attended CU years ago and disagree with this decision,’ one alum, J.J. Smith, wrote on the school’s Facebook page that announced the new policy. Less than one per cent of the student-body is believed to have a concealed-carry permit . ‘Students now need to be able to carry . guns to protect themselves from armed intruders. Think Columbine and . Virginia Tech, as well as the Aurora movie theater and Milwaukee Mosque. Is there really any question?’ Another alum, Tom Graziano, sounded off, ‘Great...guns IN dorms...are they serious?!?! No writing on the wall here folks.’ Officials said students with a gun permit may live in the dorms but cannot bring their weapons to main campus, which should remain a gun-free zone. ‘They may store their gun with police,’ Deb Coffin, vice chancellor for student affairs for the university’s Boulder campus, said. Guns will also not be allowed at school athletic and cultural events. The Colorado Springs campus does not have as many available housing units and so those students wishing to keep their guns with them ‘must have permission from their roommate,’ Tom Hutton, a spokesman for the campus, said. The new policy is expected to meet resistance from gun advocates. Kurt Mueller, the director of strategy of Students for Concealed Carry, said his group would look closer at the new policy. ‘It's not surprising that the campuses are trying to circumvent the Colorado Supreme Court ruling,’ he said.","Policy impacts CU campuses in Boulder and Colorado Springs .

Cruel: Barber drags his victim 15 feet along the ground into a parked car, eventually forcing the handbag from her grasp and leaving her with two broken fingers . The woman, who has not been identified, was said to be 'extremely shaken' by the attack, which happened in Blackpool, Lancashire. Barber was today jailed for three years after he admitted robbery and possessing heroin. He carried out the attack after begging friends to loan him some money so he could buy drugs, Preston Crown Court was told. The woman was walking along Raikes Parade, Blackpool, at about 2.45pm on June 22 when Barber crept up behind her and pounced. He took hold of her handbag strap and pulled her to the floor before dragging her along the pavement, across the road and into a parked car. Behind bars: Ryan Barber was jailed for three years after admitting robbery and possessing heroin . After fleeing with the bag, Barber went to a flat in the town and showed friends a wad of notes, telling them he had robbed a man and woman. When police raided the property five days after the attack, they found Barber had locked himself in the bathroom. He was trying to inject himself with heroin as officers forced their way in. Barber's lawyer, Sarah Booth, told the court that he had written a letter of apology to his victim. She said: 'This offence is a new low for him. He says he finds it extremely difficult to accept what he has done to this lady, being dragged along the ground. 'He is extremely embarrassed and ashamed of it. He wishes he could change what he did. 'At the time he was using significant amounts of heroin, methadone, crack cocaine, cannabis and anything else. 'His life was literally dropping off the edge'. But Judge Andrew Woolman, passing sentence, told Barber: 'It was a determined robbery. 'I accept you are remorseful and you now realise how low you have sunk as a result of your long-standing addiction. 'But there has to be a prison sentence. I could not possibly justify anything else. 'The public have to know those who commit offences of robbery in the street will receive immediate sentences of imprisonment.' At the time of the mugging, Det Insp Becky Smith, of Lancashire Police, said: 'This was a particularly brutal robbery which has understandably left the victim both shocked and traumatised by her ordeal.'

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel: She agreed if Greece left the euro it wouldn't have a great impact on the remaining countries . Greece was warned last night it has one ‘last chance’ to avoid bankruptcy as allies of Angela Merkel made clear she does not care if the country drops out of the euro. The ultimatum was delivered by eurozone boss Jean-Claude Juncker as a week of crunch talks over the fate of the single currency started. The hard line from Germany came as Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras put out the begging bowl again. He is demanding two more years to bring in austerity measures which were agreed in exchange for two multi-billion pound bailouts from Brussels. But that will mean the cuts will not be in place until 2016, rather than the agreed deadline of 2014, leaving Greece needing more money. A clear warning that the Greeks cannot expect more cash from Europe’s richest nation came from Dr Michael Fuchs, deputy chairman of Mrs Merkel’s CDU party. He said a Greek exit from the single  currency would not have a ‘great impact’ because it is widely expected. Mr Samaras held talks with Mr Juncker in Athens, pledging to do what is necessary to tackle his country’s debts. Mr Juncker, leader of the eurozone finance ministers’ group, praised ‘tremendous efforts’ to cut the deficit but said ‘priority number one’ was to  get Greece’s public finances in order. ‘The ball is in the Greek court – in fact this is the last chance and Greek citizens have to know this,’ he said. Earlier Mr Samaras launched a charm offensive with the German press. In an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, he warned Greece will be on the verge of collapse unless it gets the next tranche of the agreed bailout in October. ‘If we don’t, Greece is broke,’ he said. Eurozone boss Jean-Claude Juncker warned Greece had one 'last chance' to get their finances in order . However, Mr Samaras also pledged: ‘The Germans will get their money back. I am guaranteeing that personally. We will fulfil our obligations fully.’ He told the tabloid Bild: ‘All we want is a bit of “air to breathe” to get the economy running and to increase state income.

He warned: ‘I don’t believe there is a chance for a third bailout because our voters are not really too happy with it. ‘We gave them already much more time than was originally planned.’ He argued the departure of Greece from the eurozone would not have a ‘great impact’ on the remaining nations, and suggested Mrs Merkel held similar views. ‘If Greece is going to leave, I don’t think it’s going to have a very great impact anymore, because the countries are prepared. Euros: A Greek exit from the single currency would not have a 'great impact' because it is widely expected, said Dr Michael Fuchs, CDU deputy chairman . ‘There is enough money available to ring-fence these countries and make sure there is no domino effect.’ Asked if that was also Mrs Merkel’s view, he said: ‘I believe so, yes.’ Last night David Cameron held phone conversations with French President Francois Hollande and US President Barack Obama, partly about the eurozone. The Prime Minister is keen to see the latest crisis resolved because of Treasury fears a Greek exit will hit Spain and Italy.

'Crippled with pain': Bank cashier Mary Deller says she injured herself lifting bags of £1 coins . A bank cashier has won £18,500 from her former employers after injuring her back lifting heavy bags of coins. Mary Deller said she was asked to carry two bags of cash - each containing 500 in £1 coins - without being given health and safety training at a branch of NatWest in Cheriton, Kent, . The 26-year-old said that as she lifted the bags - which weighed a total of just over 21lbs, or 1.5 stone - she felt a ‘click in her back’ and ‘intense pain’. Miss Deller, of Folkestone, Kent, said she has been ‘crippled with pain’ since the incident in September 2010 but took painkillers and continued to work for a week before phoning in sick. Her doctor sent her to a specialist spinal surgeon, who diagnosed two bulging discs - a painful condition caused by discs in the spine moving out of line. She said she had been unable to work since the injury, and last week received a payout of £18,500 in an out of court settlement with the bank to cover her lost earnings. Miss Deller, speaking today, said: 'Lots of customers had been in during their lunch break to bank bags of coins, which had started to mount up behind the till area. 'I bent down to pick up two lots of coin bags, which had 500 £1 coins in, to put on a nearby trolley. 'I felt a click in my lower back and then an intense pain. At the time I thought I’d just pulled a muscle and carried on as normal. 'I managed to carry on working for the next week, but my back was still painful and I was starting to rely on painkillers to get me through the day.' 'Eventually I couldn’t get out of bed because it hurt so much and my doctors signed me off work for eight weeks.' Miss Deller said she was prescribed seven different kinds of tablets, including anti-depressants, pain killers and anti-inflammatories. She said the medication left her feeling light-headed and depressed. Doctors also found that Miss Deller's injury had aggravated a previously undiagnosed genetic degenerative . spinal condition. Payout: Mary Deller received a £18,500 payment for lost earnings after claiming NatWest never trained her how to pick up heavy items safely . Miss Deller insisted she was never taught how to lift the two bags of money, each containing £500 worth of £1 coins (file photo) She went on: 'I just don’t feel like me anymore. I used to be really active and loved nights out dancing and exercising at the gym but now I’m hobbling around in constant pain.' Miss Deller insisted she was never taught how to lift heavy items properly by NatWest. She added: 'I wasn’t given any health and safety induction or manual handling training or even just any general hints and tips about how to lift things without hurting myself.' Sophie Davies, a workplace accident specialist at Irwin Mitchell - which helped Miss Deller in her case to recover lost earnings and costs for specialist medical treatment - said it was crucial that employers provide health and safety training to staff. She said: 'Unfortunately we see many cases like Mary’s where people have been injured because they haven’t received any proper health and safety training by their employer.' A spokesman for NatWest refused to comment on the payout, stating: 'We do not comment on . individual cases.'","NatWest cashier, 26, says she was asked to carry two bags each filled with 500 coins .

Athletes with spinal cord injuries competing at the Paralympics may harm themselves deliberately in their quest for medals, experts have warned. Some Paralympians competing at the Games in London are feared to have used 'boosting' - a banned practice which involves hurting their lower bodies to raise their blood pressure and improve performance. Competitors are known to have gone to extraordinary lengths in the past, including overfilling their bladder by fitting a catheter or even sticking pins into their testicles. The athletes do not feel the pain because they injure the paralysed areas of their bodies. Fears: Some Paralympians are thought to have deliberately harmed themselves in an attempt to raise their blood pressure and improve performance . The practice was banned by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) in 2004, but leading academic Andrei Krassioukov believes as many as 30 per cent of competitors with spinal injuries may have cheated by doing it. Dr Krassioukov, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia, 'I will tell you right now as a physician people want to feel better, first of all - they feel better with their blood pressure higher. 'But a second thing driving it is the desire to win, to have a fair playing field with other paralympic athletes who have higher blood pressure.' Studies have found that athletes who use boosting can improve their performance by as much as 10 per cent. 'As a physician I totally understand why these Olympians are doing this, but as a scientist I am horrified with these events,' Dr Krassioukov told the BBC. Checks: Paralympics organisers test the blood pressure of athletes with spinal cord injuries before they compete . Craig Spence, the IPC's director of communications, told Mail Online: 'This is a practice which has been used by athletes with spinal cord injuries. 'What a minority of these athletes tend to do is they try to induce pain below their spinal injury. Boosting has been shown to improve a quadriplegic athlete's performance by up to 10 per cent. But having raised blood pressure also puts the competitor at greater risk of a heart attack or stroke. By self-harming, cheating athletes are deliberately inducing a dangerous condition common to quadriplegics called autonomic dysreflexia. The condition can be set off naturally by many everyday activities that cause pain - even something seemingly minor, such as sunburn. It raises blood pressure to a level at which oxygen is transported to the muscles more quickly than before, giving athletes a significant edge over their competitors. However, symptoms also include intense headaches and it can lead to long-standing health problems. 'That can include clamping their bladder, it can involve sticking pins in their testicles and sitting on sharp objects. 'Creating pain effectively increases their heart rate and, because the heart rate increases, the amount of oxygen getting to their muscles increases. 'Our research has shown that it can increase performance by as much as 10 per cent.' Mr Spence said events where athletes who use boosting would have a clear advantage included athletics and handbiking. 'We test the blood pressure of these athletes before they compete,' he added. 'If their blood pressure is not within the allowable rates we have, they will be asked to rest for 10 minutes and we will test them again. 'If, when we test them again, their blood pressure is still high and they do not have a letter from a doctor explaining why it is high, we say to them ""You can't compete on health grounds."" 'Any person with high blood pressure who is competing can suffer a stroke or a heart attack.' Mr Spence said 37 such checks were conducted at the Beijing Paralympics in 2008 and no athlete tested positive. A survey carried out by the IPC at Beijing indicated that about 17 per cent of those who responded had used boosting. Of the 60 participants who responded, 10 said they had. They were all male participants, with the majority competing in wheelchair rugby. Problem: Seventeen per cent of Paralympics athletes who responded to a survey in 2008 admitted that they had used boosting .","Quadriplegic competitors have hurt themselves to raise their blood pressure and enhance their chances .

Pressure is mounting on the Government to reduce air passenger duty after 100,000 people contacted their MPs complaining the tax is unacceptable. The UK now has the highest air passenger tax in the world, prompting warnings it is damaging the economy by hitting industry and finances. Around 75 MPs have also signed an Early Day Motion calling for more Treasury research into the tax, which soared by 8 per cent this year and is an average of £92 per family for a trip to Europe. Complaining about tax: The UK now has the highest air passenger tax in the world and pressure is mounting on the government after 100,000 people complained . The Fair Tax on Flying campaign, run by an alliance of more than 30 airlines and tour operators, says the tax is deterring both UK holidaymakers heading abroad and foreign travellers hoping to visit Britain. The cost of APD for a family of four flying to the United States or Egypt is £260, while those heading to the Caribbean are charged £324. Australia is the most expensive, with taxes reaching £368. Listen: Former LibDem leader Charles Kennedy hopes the Government will listen to complaints and explore the true economic consequences . Virgin Atlantic has calculated this year’s rise in APD will cost passengers an estimated £600million this summer. Over the past seven years, the tax has risen by 360 per cent. Chancellor George Osborne expects to collect £2.2billion in 2011-12 from APD revenues, rising to £3.9billion by 2016-17. Brian Donohoe MP, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Aviation, said: ‘For 100,000 people to have written to MPs to make their voice heard is an astonishing show of opposition to the current levels of Air Passenger Duty and concern about the impact they are having on both ordinary families and on the economy. 'I trust the Chancellor takes notice of public opinion and commissions an independent study to look at how APD is damaging the UK economy.’ Former LibDem leader Charles Kennedy is one of the MPs to have signed the motion, which expresses concern about the ‘financial impact on families and their ability to fly’. He said: ‘I hope the Government will . listen to the thousands who have written to them and undertake a . comprehensive impact assessment to establish the true economic . consequences of the increase of APD.’ Other countries: The Netherlands and Spain have reduced or abolished flight tax after realising it affected visitor numbers . Countries, such as the Netherlands and Spain, have reduced or abolished flight tax after realising it was affecting visitor numbers, which in turn had a detrimental effect on the economy. APD was first introduced in 1994 with a £5 rate for the UK/EU and £10 elsewhere.

Or the cafes  that refused to heat up baby food? They might sound like bad jokes, but in fact they are just two of  the ten most unjustifiable bans in the often bizarre world of health and safety. Other examples include a council which stopped a nursery teacher taking children to an allotment, and a manager who banned a woman from wearing flip flops in the office because they did not have enclosed toes and a supported back. World gone mad! Cafes refusing to heat up baby food 'in case it burns the child's mouth' The list was published by the Health and Safety Executive, which says too many middle managers are banning low-risk activities. It also accuses companies of using elf ’n’ safety as a cover for unpopular, but profitable, policies. One example was an airline which said a traveller could not have a blanket on an aeroplane – unless she bought one for £5. Since April the Myth Busters Challenge Panel, established by the HSE, has invited those who believe they are victims of a ludicrous health and safety ruling to email in and get a professional view. The panel may then contest decisions made by insurance companies, local authorities and employers. All the examples on the list were deemed to be cases where an organisation was using health and safety wrongly, perhaps as a smokescreen for an unpopular decision or poor customer service, or because of a nonsensical interpretation of the law. In the golf example, buggies were prohibited because they were not ‘health and safety authorised’. The cafes that wouldn’t warm up baby . food apparently told the mother they couldn’t ‘in case it burns the . child’s mouth’. Yet they were selling hot drinks. Ridiculous! Campers told they would have to pay for two plots because they had a camper van and a tent . Ministers have promised reforms of health and safety laws. Employment minister Chris Grayling said: ‘It’s hugely frustrating when excuses are being made in the name of health and safety. The Myth Busters Challenge Panel is helping the man and woman on the street fight back against the jobsworths.’",Bizarre list published by Health and Safety Executive .

Investment firms are having to raise their starting salaries to entice the top graduates in the wake of the banking scandals. One partner said that 'banker bashing' was affecting decisions made by university leavers about whether to enter the City. As a result, the top banks have upped their graduate pay levels by around 5 per cent to between £45,000 and £50,000 a year. Graduates are being offered higher starting salaries by the top investment firms because many are having second thoughts about joining the industry amid the banking scandals .

Jon Terry, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who advises the top banks on pay levels, told the Daily Telegraph: 'There is no doubt that ""banker bashing"" and the scandals at the banks are impacting graduate decisions about going into the City.

Ms Bonas, the daughter of Sixties cover girl and banking heiress Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, enjoyed a holiday with Harry on Necker, the island owned by Sir Richard Branson, shortly before his jaunt to ‘Sin City’. Together with a group of friends, they were on Necker to celebrate the 27th birthday of Sir Richard’s son, Sam.

Plush situation: Hubert Joly of France has been named Best Buy's new CEO and will receive a $6.25million payment package if he can't get a visa . Struggling retailer Best Buy Co, which is engaged in a takeover battle with founder Richard Schulze, has chosen a new chief executive to lead the company. The company has tapped Hubert Joly, the former head of global hospitality company Carlson and turnaround expert, as the nation's largest consumer electronics chain's new CEO and president. Controversially, the 53-year-old French mogul will receive a payout of $6.25million, even if he cannot secure a visa to work within the states. John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School, told NBC News that Joly may be assuming a risk leaving Carlson. The corporate governance specialist added: ‘I can understand some payment but this does seem a windfall.’ However, a Best Buy spokesperson said that Joly's compensation is commensurate with his experience. They told NBC News: ‘This package was developed in consultation with leading search and compensation firms and is in-line with best practice for Fortune 50 companies.’ Joly's base salary, $1.175million, is modest for a CEO, but the news organization says that his pay check could be fattened by possible stock options, and is cushioned with a very generous $20million signing bonus. Struggling: Best Buy's stocks have been weak in past weeks after Former CEO Brian Dunn resigned amid an investigation into his relationship with a 29-year-old employee . News of Joly’s lavish deal comes amid Best Buy’s worst . quarter in recent memory. It suspended its profits forecast after reporting a . dramatic 90 per cent drop in net income in the quarter ending August 4. The electronics chain earned $12million in this period, . compared to $150million only a year earlier. The poor report comes after a turbulent period for the . retailer, which began with the resignation of CEO Brian Dunn in April amid a . company investigation into an 'improper' relationship with a 29-year-old female . employee. There was more bad news for Best Buy when the recent . announcement of Mr Dunn's replacement was met with a negative response on Wall . Street. The company's announcement, made Monday, comes . after the ailing retailer said Sunday that its offer to advance talks . with company co-founder Richard Schulze on his takeover bid was . rejected. Best Buy says Joly, who is French, is expected to take over as CEO in early September when his visa is secured. Carlson, which operates such businesses as Radisson and T.G.I Friday's, announced Sunday that Joly resigned from that company. Investors may have also been disappointed that Best Buy didn't pick a retail executive. ‘Joly is a rogue agent,’ said Brian Sozzi, analyst at research firm NBG Productions. ‘He comes in and fixes companies and then leaves.’ He added that investors won't learn of a new turnaround plan until after the holiday season. Joly succeeds Mike Mikan, a board member who has served as interim CEO since April when former CEO Brian Dunn left Best Buy because of what the company called an improper relationship with an employee. Learning the ropes: People walk past a Best Buy store in New York; Best Buy suspended giving a profit outlook for the rest of the year, as it looks to give its newly named chief executive a chance to understand the business . ‘Hubert was an outstanding candidate for this position and I am confident he will be a great fit for Best Buy,’ Hatim Tyabji, chairman of Best Buy's board, said in a statement. The contract gives Joly, a French citizen, $6.25million even if he can’t secure a work visa. But the deal also includes a $20million signing bonus, a base salary of $1.175million, and as much as $8.75million in salary for the upcoming fiscal year. He would also be able to acquire stock options. Altogether, this would make the CEO worth nearly $32million. According to the Wall Street Journal, this is two and a half times what Best Buy earned in the last quarter. ‘Hubert's range and depth of . experience in transforming companies is exactly what the company needs . at the moment, as is his energetic, imaginative and experienced . leadership in executing strategies.’ Over the past 15 years, Joly has . developed a track record of successful turnarounds and growth in the . media, technology and service sectors, Best Buy said. In the media sector, Joly led the . restructuring and growth of Vivendi's video game's business, now part of . Activision Blizzard, from 1999 to 2001. He later oversaw the . integration of Universal and Vivendi's media assets in the U.S. and was . then part of the team that led the restructuring of Vivendi in 2002 to . 2004. In the technology sector, Joly spearheaded the turnaround of EDS, now part of HP, in France from 1996 to 1999.

Best Buy is trying to avoid the fate of . its rival Circuit City, which went bankrupt in 2009, partly because of . changing shopper habits. Best Buy has been shrinking store size and focusing on its more-profitable products such as mobile phones. It's also trying to combat the so-called ‘showrooming’ of its stores — when people browse at Best Buy but purchase electronics goods elsewhere, especially online. In March, it announced a major restructuring that includes closing 50 stores, cutting 400 corporate jobs and trimming $800 million in costs. Dunn left in April amid an investigation that he had an improper relationship with a 29-year-old female employee. Since that departure, interim Mikan has made strong statements about how he plans to restructure the company, focusing on services and revamping stores.

Northamptonshire County Council paid out £200 for a 'large splinter in hand causing injury' and £5,500 for a 'spinal injury' caused by a 'poorly fitting uniform.' The council also forked out £500 to a worker who had a blind fall on them and another £11,125 to a member of staff who had a shutter door spring open on him which 'threw him into the air' and injured him. Price tag: The council paid £5,500 for a 'spinal injury' caused by a 'poorly fitting uniform.' On top of this they were forced to pay out a staggering £32,010.96 for a worker who slipped on some food in the dining hall while carrying a table causing a 'contusion or bruise'. Figures obtained through a Freedom of Information request also show that the biggest claim was £90,517.86 for a fireman who injured his lower back during a fire drill. The numbers relate to a period between July 2006 and July 2011. The council paid £7,500 to a claimant who 'went to sit down when someone moved the chair...jarring her back.' Another alleged 'pots and pans' fell out on her when she opened a cupboard at work causing her to receive a soft tissue injury - and £12,000 in compensation. The council also has some ongoing claims for sunburn while on a training course injuries caused to one woman 'due to a pupil jumping at her'. A large splinter meant an injury to an employee's hand - and a £500 bill for the council . Jonathan Isaby, Political Director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The bill to taxpayers for compensation claims has got unacceptably high. 'While some staff might have legitimate claims because of negligence, there has been a worrying rise in the compensation culture across local government. 'Taxpayers should not be footing the bill for cases where a bit of common sense would have avoided an accident and there has to be a degree of personal responsibility. 'Accidents do happen, and council staff should not see an accident as an excuse to fleece the rest of us out of our hard-earned cash. 'It is therefore important that councils should fight any questionable claims to protect taxpayers' money from being abused.' A spokesperson from Northamptonshire County Council said: 'The welfare of our staff is a top priority but with over 15,000 employees, unfortunately accidents can occasionally happen. 'We follow health and safety policies and ensure staff carry out their activities and maintain their premises in ways that minimise the risk of accidents occurring. 'We also have appropriate procedures in place if things do go wrong, to ensure any lessons are learned and that we can continue to maintain excellent standards of safety.' Lindy Butcher, pictured, is suing Newport Council for £25,000 compensation . Northamptonshire is not the only council to pay out thousands to injured workers. Rotherham Council, in South Yorkshire, paid £9,128 to a 61-year-old cleaner after he stumbled over a mop handle, falling and pulling a groin muscle. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act this year have revealed that since 2007 the same council has paid out a whopping £1million in compensation to other workers for minor slips, trips and falls. A teacher, carer, administrative assistant and a weed sprayer received £26,867 between them after falling off chairs. A 53-year-old town hall admin assistant tripped over a 'protruding' dining table leg in 2010 and was handed £14,452. The same year, a labourer was given £10,450 after he was working in the garden of a council house and fell into a hidden pond. Newport Council is currently being sued after a pub landlady injured herself at a rock concert. A heavy metal music fan is suing Newport Council for £25,000 compensation after a 'horrifying' slip in a puddle of vomit at a live gig. Pub landlady Lindy Butcher, 39, fell over in the sick as soon as she arrived at the Newport Leisure Centre in Wales and missed the opening of the Whitesnake concert while she was being disinfected. She suffered bruising and soreness to her knees as well as pain through her neck and shoulders and muscle spasms between her ribs.","Northamptonshire County Council paid out £200 to one worker who was 'injured by a splinter'

Right-to-die campaigner Tony Nicklinson urged his family not to mourn him when he passed away last week – saying he was ‘already dead’. The locked-in syndrome sufferer’s spirit severely deteriorated after the High Court rejected his request to ‘die with dignity’ with the help of medical professionals, according to his widow. Speaking for the first time since he died, Jane Nicklinson added that losing the case had left him ‘devastated’ and feeling he ‘couldn’t take it any more’. She said her husband started refusing food, fluids and medication and died of pneumonia six days later. 'Already dead': Tony Nicklinson told his wife Jane not to mourn his death last week after the High Court rejected his request to 'die with dignity' Mr Nicklinson, 58, had campaigned for the right for doctors to assist his suicide – since his condition meant he could not easily take his own life. His wife said: ‘It was the day after [the High Court decision] that he said to me that the fight had just gone. ‘He said he couldn’t take it any more. Within a couple of days he developed pneumonia – the last 48 hours were pretty unpleasant but thankfully it was quick. It’s just a shame that he couldn’t die the way he wanted to die.’ At his side: Mr Nicklinson's family including daughters Beth (right) and Lauren were at his side last Wednesday when he died after refusing to eat and drink . 'Living nightmare': Mr Nicklinson, a former rugby player, had been living with locked-in syndrome after a stroke in 2005 . Mrs Nicklinson, 56, said the family had known the court judgment a few days before it was officially announced. It was on Monday last week, after it had been made public, that her husband decided to stop eating and drinking. He also refused antibiotics and died at home in Melksham, Wiltshire, last Wednesday with his wife and daughters Beth, 22, and Lauren, 24, at his side. Mrs Nicklinson said: ‘I think the moment was the day he broke down in front of all the cameras. I think it really hit him then that everyone else out there was going to know as well. It completely knocked him for six.’ She told BBC Wiltshire how living with locked-in syndrome after a stroke in 2005 had been a ‘living nightmare’ for her husband. Really hit him: Mr Nicklinson broke down in front of the cameras after the High Court decision which 'completely knock him for six', his wife said . She said the 6ft 4in former rugby player had physically declined in recent months, taking painkillers for the first time and struggling to use the computer through which he communicated with the outside world. The former nurse added she did not believe her husband would have wanted to live much longer if the court had ruled in his favour. She said: ‘One of the last things he said to me was: “I’m already dead – don’t mourn for me.”’ Judges ruled on August 16 that they did not have the power to grant Mr Nicklinson’s request for a doctor to be given immunity from prosecution for giving him a lethal dose of painkillers. His lawyers had argued that life after his stroke was intolerable. But Lord Justice Toulson said it was not the place of the courts to ‘usurp the function of Parliament’ by effectively changing the law. Mr Nicklinson broke down in tears on live TV and responded that MPs were ‘cowards’ and would never change the law. His widow yesterday said she hoped someone else would now take up his campaign. No lethal dose: Mr Nicklinson's rejected request was for a doctor to be given immunity from prosecution to give him a lethal dose of painkillers .","Locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson was devastated after High Court rejected his 'die with dignity' request .

"By . Paul Revoir, Liz Thomas and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 14:39 EST, 23 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:15 EST, 24 August 2012 . Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth told Rebekah Brooks to quit as boss of News International because of the phone hacking scandal. Ms Murdoch also suggested her brother James stepped down as chairman because harmful publicity was badly damaging her father's business, she revealed last night. Infamously it was claimed she had ‘railed’ against Ms . Brooks and told her she had ‘f****d the company’, but the media mogul's daughter denied this happened when she spoke at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. But both did eventually resign in 2011, after the closure of the News of the World. Warning: Last night at the Edinburgh International Television Festival Elisabeth Murdoch, left, admitted she told Rebekah Brooks, right, to resign but denied telling her she had 'f***** the company' Asked if it was true that she had . advised James to step back and Ms Brooks to resign during a question and answer session, she said: 'Yes, it . is, but... it was said within closed walls and Rebekah did resign.' Ms . Murdoch, who is the third member of her family to give the landmark . address to the TV industry, said one reason for giving it was to make . sure 'not everybody is tarred or marked with the same brush'. Asked if she had ever said James or Ms Brooks had f***** the company, she said: 'No, for the record, absolutely not.' Bold: Elisabeth Murdoch warned that 'profit without purpose is a recipe for disaster' Ms Murdoch said it had been 'a nightmare year for the family' but she was aware it had 'not been as difficult for us as for the people who have been victims or Milly Dowler’s parents'. Tensions: Elisabeth Murdoch appeared to criticise her brother James's attitude to business last night . She said she was 'pleased' her father had told a parliamentary select committee that giving evidence was 'the most humble day' of his life. She said: 'I know he absolutely meant it and it was, if I’m honest as a daughter, heart-breaking.' The bitter tensions within the Murdoch clan were when Elisabeth Murdoch warned that ‘profit without purpose is a recipe for disaster’. She was responding to a speech her brother gave three years ago, delivering the same lecture, where he had claimed the free market alone would guarantee innovation and independence as he also hit out at the ‘chilling’ scale of the BBC. But in what many will see as a further dig at her brother, she said ‘global society’ needed to ‘reject the idea that money is the only effective measure of all things or that the free market is the only sorting mechanism’. She was even in danger of siding with traditional Murdoch enemies such as the BBC and left-wing playwrights, in what many will see as her attempt to distance herself from their perceived failings. Industry figures believe she wishes to become the anointed heir to her father’s empire. Miss Murdoch also admitted her father’s company News Corp, which owned the News of the World and also owns her production company, was ‘currently asking itself some very significant and difficult questions about how some behaviours fell so far short of its values.’ The 44-year-old also warned of the threat to press freedom from ‘enemies within’ - a remark that will be widely seen as a criticism of News International employees caught up in the phone hacking scandal that has rocked the business. Difficult questions: Elisabeth Murdoch, pictured with her father Rupert Murdoch and his second wife Wendi Deng, admitted her father's company News Corp was asking itself some 'difficult questions about how some behaviours fell so far short of its values' In what appeared to be a further acknowledgement of how the allegations of phone hacking have devastated the family firm, she added that ‘personally’ she thought one of the biggest lessons had been the need for organisations to ‘discuss, affirm and institutionalise a rigorous set of values’ based on an explicit ‘statement of purpose’. In a stark contrast to her brother’s 2009 speech she heaped praise on the BBC saying she was a ‘current supporter of the universal licence fee’ and praised the ‘vision and leadership’ of Mark Thompson, the outgoing director general. Sharp contrast: Unlike her brother, Miss Murdoch praised the BBC and its outgoing director General, Mark Thompson . In what many in the industry regard as a subtle attack on her father, she also quoted with approval another former MacTaggart speaker, Dennis Potter who said television should ‘make hearts pound’. The playwright famously used his lecture to demand her father be put on trial and even named his cancer Rupert after him. She also quoted the playwright Alan Bennett and described him as ‘wonderful’, despite his lengthy and public feud with her father. Bennett famously branded him a “bully that should be stood up to publicly” and refused an honorary degree from Oxford University because the magnate has funded a position there. It was unclear if the Shine Group boss had told her father and brother what was in the speech before she delivered it. Miss Murdoch spoke about her brother James Murdoch’s speech, giving the same lecture three years ago, in which he attacked the ‘land-grab’ of the BBC and said that the only real guarantee of independence was profit and commercial competition. But Miss Murdoch said of the licence fee: ‘A few have even questioned the legitimacy of the mandatory levy. However, despite a valuable contribution to this debate – James ended his lecture with a line in which he claimed that the only reliable and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit. ‘He clearly intended the statement to be provocative, and it is, but I also think that it deserves further analysis, . ‘James was right that if you remove profit, then independence is massively challenged but I think that he left something out: the reason his statement sat so uncomfortably is that profit without purpose is a recipe for disaster.’ She added: ‘Do we have such faith in the imperatives of the market that we need have no will of our own other than to succeed on its terms. It’s us, human beings, we the people, who create the society we want, not profit.’ ‘It is increasingly apparent that the absence of purpose  - or of a moral language – within government, media or business, could become one of the most dangerous own goals for capitalism and for freedom.’ Family outing: Media mogul Rupert Murdoch, centre, stands behind his children James Murdoch, right, and Elisabeth Murdoch, left, at the Cheltenham races in 2010 . She also criticised the ‘sometimes self-serving relationships’ between police, politics, media or banking. But she said despite such an ‘unsettling dearth of integrity’ across so many institutions, which has been explored by the Leveson enquiry, ‘the right outcome’ must be ‘the fierce protection of a free press and light touch media regulation’. She added, in what many will interpret as a criticism of senior executives at News International, that: ‘Sadly the greatest threats to our free society are too often from enemies within.’ The TV boss admitted News Corp, which owned the News of the World and also owns her production company, was ‘currently asking itself some very significant and difficult questions about how some behaviours fell so far short of its values.’ Miss Murdoch added independence from regulation is only ‘democratically viable’ when ‘we accept that we have a responsibility to each other and not just to our bottom line’. She said profit should be the ‘servant’ not the ‘master’. Miss Murdoch, who reportedly claimed News International chief Rebekah Brooks had 'f****d the company', also warned of the threat to press freedom from 'enemies within' She said that ‘personally’ she thought one of the biggest lessons had been the need for organisations to ‘discuss, affirm and institutionalise a rigorous set of values’ based on an explicit ‘statement of purpose’. Miss Murdoch became the third member of her family - following father Rupert and brother James - to make the celebrated MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. She founded production company Shine which is responsible for shows including MasterChef and Merlin. In the speech she said: ‘Let’s see what the Leveson enquiry recommends but when there has been such an unsettling dearth of integrity across so many of our institutions, it is very difficult to argue for the right outcome - which must be the fierce protection of a free press and light touch media regulation. Sadly the greatest threats to our free society are too often from enemies within.’ The speech ended with a hymn of praise to her father telling how he ‘had the vision, the will and the sense of purpose to challenge the old world order on behalf of ‘the people’. Her often deeply personal remarks included a reference to the family’s position as ‘permanent outsiders and constant nomads but in ‘pursuit of a greater good - a belief in better.’","Elisabeth Murdoch also suggested her brother James resign as bad publicity was damaging her father's company, News International .

Callous: Team GB Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist Philip Hindes has had his bike stolen after burglars ransacked his home . A Team GB Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist has had his bike stolen after burglars ransacked his home. Philip Hindes, who topped the winner's podium at London 2012 in the Team Sprint alongside Jason Kenny and Sir Chris Hoy, used the expensive bicycle for training. It was taken, along with his car, in a raid on his home in West Didsbury, Manchester, sometime between last Thursday and Sunday. Thieves smashed through patio doors and ransacked the house, which was unoccupied, during the burglary. The thieves stole the bike along with the keys to a blue Volkswagen Golf which they drove off in. Fortunately, his gold medal was not taken. The bike is described as being a Pinarello Paris which is red, white and blue and has a Sky sticker and Hindes' name on. It is used in training and was not the bike which Hindes, 19, rode when he won his Olympic medal. The car was later found burnt out by police. Detectives have appealed for information on the break-in, which took place between 7.30pm on August 23 and 11pm on August 26. Detective . Constable Rob Southern, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'The reason . we have publicised this theft is so that we can catch the people . responsible and return the bike to its rightful owner. 'I . would therefore ask anyone who is offered a bike matching this . description and the image we have released to call police immediately. 'It might be the thieves try and . offload the bike onto a sports memorabilia collector so I would urge . anyone who is offered the chance to buy such a bike to call police . immediately as you could be vital to helping get this bike back. 'I would also ask anyone who has information about the burglary itself, or who might have been involved, to come forward. Hindes was born in Krefeld, Germany, in 1992.  He took up cycling at the age of 15 and represented Germany at the Junior World and European Championships. He joined the British Cycling Academy at the age of 18, possible because he has dual nationality because of his British father. Winners: Hindes, centre, is pictured with fellow Team Sprint colleagues Jason Kenny, left, and Sir Chris Hoy, right . Burglary: The bike was taken, along with his car, in a raid on his home in West Didsbury, Manchester. This is a replica of the stolen bike . He took gold in the men's team sprint alongside Sir Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny in his first Olympic Games. As well as winning gold, the trio also set a new world record. The spectacular win was mired in . controversy after Hindes claimed he had . deliberately fallen from his bike in an earlier round. The British team was allowed to restart the qualifier after Hindes crashed seconds into the race. The trio went on to post a world record time and later won the final against France. Hindes suggested the crash was part of a deliberate ploy because the British team had made a poor start. He . said after winning gold: 'We were saying if we have a bad start, we . need to crash to get a restart. I just crashed, I did it on purpose to . get a restart, just to have the fastest ride. I did it. So it was all . planned, really.' Star: Philip Hindes is pictured with Jason Kenny and Sir Chris Hoy during the men's team sprint finals at London 2012 . Nasty: Hindes is pictured sitting on the ground after falling during the team sprint qualifying heats. Officials had to assist Hindes as his left foot remained clipped in after the fall . British Cycling categorically denied the fall was any part of a . plan and said Hindes's comments were 'lost in translation' from a man . who began learning English only after moving to Manchester from his . native Germany two years ago. The International Cycling Union . confirmed that the incident had been reviewed at the time and the result . was not in question – so all three British cyclists got to keep their . gold medals. Losing . finalists France said the action was not against the rules so they did not dispute the result. But they said it left a 'bitter' taste and they . called for a change in the way such incidents are handled. Hindes . subsequently denied it was deliberate when asked about his earlier . comments. 'No,' he said, 'I just went out the gate and just lost . control, just fell down. 'My back wheel slipped and totally lost control and then I couldn’t handle the bike any more and just crashed.' Anyone with information on the burglary is asked to call police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","Philip Hindes' expensive training bicycle was taken following a raid on his home in West Didsbury, Manchester .

A romantic message-in-a-bottle discovered by a mother and daughter at a Socttish beach has sparked a mystery about whether it could have travelled 5,000 miles across the seas from China. Nicola MacFarlane, 41, and daughter Lucy, four, from Portobello, near Edinburgh, were scouring Portobello Beach when they came across an old glass bottle sticking out of the sand containing  a note inside written in Mandarin. Now the family are trying to work out if the letter has managed the extraordinary journey across the Philippine Sea, into the Indian Ocean and through both the South Atlantic and the North Atlantic Ocean's before washing up on the shores of Great Britain. The love letter was found by mother and daughter, Nicola MacFarlane, 41, and Lucy, four, from Portobello, while they were beachcombing . It is unclear when the letter was sent off, as it was written on Chinese Valentine's Day, or Qixi Festival as it is more traditionally known, which falls on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month. While the letter bears . the date in line with the lunar calendar - July 7, 2012 - it could have . been sent off as recently as six days ago if it followed the modern . calendar, which celebrated the occasion on August 23. Whether the message has travelled thousands of miles from China or whether it was penned by a . love-struck pair much closer to home remains a mystery. But for Nicola it doesn't matter - she was still excited to read about the Chinese love story after having it translated. She said: ‘I really do hope that it is from China but even it is from . nearer to home, it’s still a lovely gesture and an inspiring find. It’s a . love story regardless of where it came from.’ Nicola, . who runs a beach art business in Portobello, added: ‘I’m always at the . beach looking for bits of driftwood but I’ve never come across anything . like this before.. Did the message travel across the Philippine Sea, into the Indian Ocean and through both the South Atlantic and the North Atlantic Ocean's before washing up on the shores of Scotland? A map shows the ocean currents which would have directed the bottle from China to Great Britain . ‘We saw the bottle sticking out of the sand and just thought it was junk that someone had left behind . ‘But after picking it up I noticed there was a piece of brown paper rolled up inside and there was some foreign writing on it. ‘We quite excitedly took it home and carefully uncorked the bottle and took out the sheet of paper using some tweezers. ‘We knew it was Chinese, but we had no idea what it said.’ Unable . to read the Mandarin text, Nicola turned to the internet and her . Australian friend, Julie Gould, whose daughter attended a Chinese school . in Sydney. Several hours later Julie returned with the news that it was in fact a love letter. The . translated letter reads: ‘Da Hai: Ocean, I hope no-one will get this . bottle, as we just wish you can hear our voice, and get your blessing. The bottle contained a letter written in Mandarin that the mother and daughter asked a friend to translate . The letter which said it was sent on Chinese Valentine's Day revealed a passionate love story . ‘Today . is the Chinese Valentine’s Day, we pray that our relationship will last . forever and we will have a long happy life together.' Nicola said: ‘It sounds to me like the couple are in love but cannot be together so they have sent the message to tell the world of their love. ‘I’m blown away by it to be honest - it’s incredible that it has travelled all this way.’ In May 2008, a message in a bottle turned up on a Hebridean beach after completing a 4000-mile sea journey from the Bahamas.

The 16-year-old boy accused of killing five-year-old Isabella Tennant in Niagara Falls, New York, and dumping her body in a trash can, has been described by the victim's mother, as a 'mooch'. John Freeman, 16, lived three doors down from Isabella's great-grandmother's house and, according to Crystal Walker, had been a regular fixture there, using her computer, sleeping in her spare room when his heat was cut off and helping to mow the lawn. The teen is pleading not guilty to second degree murder after a coroner's report found the toddler was choked to death by bare hands and testimonies have placed him at the house on the night. Devastated: Murdered five-year-old Isabella Tennant's mother Crystal Walker told interviewers that John Freeman was a 'mooch' and she had asked her great-grandmother to stop letting him wander into her house . In a heartbreaking interview, Isabella's mother revealed how her grandmother, Sharon Lascelle, had always found . it hard to turn Freeman away even though Ms Walker had asked her . repeatedly to stop 'just letting [him and his stepfather] come in . whenever they want'. 'She's just so welcoming in her home and just trusts everyone,' a devastated Ms Walker told WIVB-TV on Tuesday. 'I do blame my grandmother because she... she was responsible at the time. But then again I can't because it wasn't her fault, she trusted this kid.' Charged: John Freeman, 16, has pleaded not guilty to second degree murder of five-year-old Isabella though he was placed in the house the night she was killed . Accomplice: Tyler Best, 18, has been charged with evidence tampering after he showed police where he had allegedly helped his friend dump Isabella's body when Freeman killed her . John Freeman and his stepfather, she explained, often came over when times were tough after the teen's mother, who was 'really bad into drugs' deserted them. Isabella's family had referred to Freeman as a trusted friend while a neighbour, speaking to the local Buffalo news channel, lamented: 'He's been around for about seven years. He'd known her since she was a baby.' Ms Walker and the police are puzzled as to why Freeman would have done such a terrible thing after knowing the family so long, and authorities are still attempting to ascertain a motive since no signs of sexual abuse have been found. Motherly love: Crystal Walker called her daughter 'warm' and 'energetic' and doesn't understand how anyone could kill a little girl in such a cold, calculated way . Sweet: Friends and family recall Freeman having been a regular fixture at Isabella's great-grandmother's house since before she was even born . A coroner confirmed, however, that Isabella died at the bare hands of her killer from an obstructed airway and compression of the neck most likely due to choking. The blue-eyed, blonde haired girl had been wearing pink pyjamas with black stars. Isabella had been staying at her great-grandmother's on Sunday night while her mother worked a shift at sports bar, Player's, in Niagara Falls but on Monday morning when Ms Walker went to pick up her daughter, they discovered she was not in the home and a search was mounted with dogs. Happy days: Isabella's mother described how excited she had been to start kindergarten in two weeks . Police suspect that Freeman came to the house sometime on Sunday night, after Lascelle went to bed around 11pm and knowing that Ms Walker and police went straight to his house to ask if he knew anything. But, she recalled, holding back the tears on Tuesday, Freeman appeared uncommunicative and told them only that he had last seen Isabella colouring at Ms Lascelle's when he left that night. 'He didn't even ask to help us look for her,' Ms Walker recalled. The . body of the five-year old, who has been described by her mother as . 'energetic', 'warm' and 'full of life', was found on Monday afternoon . after a friend of Freeman's, Tyler Best, led police to the trash can  four blocks from Ms Laschelle's home. Best, 18, has been charged with tampering with evidence and accused of helping to dispose of Isabella's body. 'I . don't understand,' Ms Walker cried thinking about the gruesome details . of her daughter's death. 'He could have left her in the basement and . made it look like she fell. But instead, he took her little body three . streets away and put her in a garbage can. I mean, who does that?' At the arraignment on Tuesday at . Niagara Falls City Court, during which both boys appeared on television . blurred out, Freeman spoke only to answer the question: 'Are you a . student?' 'No,' he replied looking only briefly at his own family and avoiding eye contact with Ms Walker, according to WIVB.com. Home sweet home: Sharon Lascelle lived at this house and frequently invited Freeman and his stepfather in when their electricity was cut off or if the boy wanted to use her computer . Crime scene: Isabella had been staying at her great-grandmother's on Sunday night while her mother Crystal, worked a shift at the Player's nightclub in Niagara Falls, but had not been there on Monday morning . But though Isabella's mother called Freeman a 'mooch', others outside the court had contrasting stories to tell of the boy. Former . Cadet leader, Christopher DiDonna, told News 4 that two years ago, . Freeman had been a member of the Niagara Falls Junior Military Cadets, a . program aimed at keeping kids off drugs and out of gangs. 'He . was a squad leader,' Mr DiDonna recalled. 'He was an excellent cadet. I'm shocked. I can't believe this happened. [He] never had any violent . tendencies.' Memorial: A teddy bear is left to mark the place where Isabella's body was found dumped in the trash after 18-year-old Tyler Best led police there on Monday . Praying: Andrea Brown of Niagara Falls, attends a candlelight vigil in Hyde Park for Isabella on Monday night to which over a thousand residents of the area are estimated to have shown up . Though aware of the boy's unfortunate family situation, Mr DiDonna said that he seemed like any normal kid. 'I had great hopes for his future,' he said. 'I thought he would join the military. Leave the cadet program, . join the military and become quite successful.' Freeman is being tried as an adult and though he has pleaded not guilty to second degree murder, his future now seems gloomy.. Defense . Attorney Robert Viola asked the judge on Tuesday for extra time to . speak with his client and requested the confession be sealed. Remembrance: Neighbours and friends pay tribute to the little girl and pray for her family on Monday night . He told reporters that he will seek to challenge Freeman's alleged confession to police and is considering having Freeman's competency tested to see if he is fit to even stand trial. 'It's my understanding the people's case for the most part rests on a reported statement given by my client,' he said. On Tuesday night, about one thousand people from the Niagara Falls community gathered for a vigil and lit candles in Isabella's memory. Grief-stricken: Ms Walker says it's hard not to blame her grandmother but that she can't because she trusted Freeman and that wasn't her fault . A neighbour told WIVB: 'We just held hands with the kids and told them, ""say a prayer, taker her to heaven, tell Jesus to let her in and send that boy to hell.""' While Ms Walker struggled to come to terms with her tragic loss, Isabella's father, Michael Tennant issued a statement saying: 'Isabella was loved deeply by her daddy Mike and his fiancee Maria. Isabella enjoyed spending time with her cousins and family. 'Anybody who knew Isabella always saw her warm beautiful smile. The Tennant family appreciates your thoughts and prayers at this time of grieving.' Evidence: Ms Walker conveyed her bewilderment at why the two boys went to such lengths to hide the body in the trash when they could have made it look like an accident . Busy: Niagara Falls Police crime scene investigators work in the area where the body was found . Mr Tennant had been a big part of his daughter's life though the couple were separated, caring for her a few days a week while Ms Walker worked two jobs to make ends meet. Ms Walker recalled the youngster's excitement to start kindergarten in two weeks. 'She already packed a lunch, and it doesn't even start for two weeks,' she said. 'I just want everyone to know what a great girl she was and so full of life.' 'I just don't want it to be real. I just want her back. Everyone says ""What can I do, what do you need?"" I don't need anything but her back.' VIDEO: 5-year-old Bella's mother speaks on immeasurable loss .","John Freeman previously called a 'trusted friend' by friends and family .

Sporting horn-rimmed glasses and an itchy-looking jumper, he is an unlikely heart-throb, let alone promising amateur baker. But 21-year-old medical student James Morton is the surprise star – and viewers’ darling – of BBC2’s Great British Bake Off. His appeal – not to mention his choice in knitwear – has helped the show  cement its status as the summer’s television sensation. This week’s episode, the third in the series, pulled in 200,000 more viewers than last week, scoring a peak audience of 4.5million. It means the show could beat the ratings of BBC1, the corporation’s flagship channel, in the coming weeks. BBC1’s medical drama Holby City, which also aired at 8pm on Tuesday, won just 350,000 more viewers than BBC2’s Bake Off. ITV, which broadcast a repeat of the  detective drama Lewis, managed to pull in a peak audience of 2.6million. Fans of the cookery show tuned in to watch Morton, from Hillswick in the Shetland Islands, crowned ‘star baker’, an accolade given to the contestant who produces the best bakes. This week, contestants had to produce three tarts – a French-style tarte tatin, treacle tart, and ‘show-stopper’ fruit tart. Morton wowed judges Mary Berry and . master baker Paul Hollywood with a perfect treacle tart and . macaroon-topped rose, raspberry and lychee tart, making him a sure . contender to win the series. Showstopper: Great British Bake Off's harsh and honest judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, centre, flanked by presenters Sue Perkins, left and Mel Giedroyc . As . well as praise for his skills in the kitchen, he has also attracted a . lot of female attention thanks to the range of woollen jumpers he has . worn on the series so far. Scores . of fans have taken to Twitter and other social networks to discuss . Morton, who studies at Glasgow University, and his style. Eleanor . Smith said: ‘I’m in love with Great British Bake Off.

Fans of hip hop group N-Dubz are being investigated by police after tweeting threats to kill a judge overseeing the case of former band member Dappy. Menacing messages were posted on Twitter warning that the judge’s life or safety would be in danger if the star was sent to prison. The performer is facing trial for affray and appeared with his co-accused earlier this months to deny the charge when his followers took to the internet. He is in no way linked to the messages. Denies affray: Former N-Dubz star Dappy appearing at Guildford Crown Court earlier this month. Fans of the hip-hop group are being investigated by police after threatening to kill the judge if he was sent to prison over the allegations . One said: ‘Don’t go to jail!!!!!!!! Or we’ll have to kill the judge!’ before adding: ‘If @TheDappy gets sent down today then we’re all gonna go to Guildford Crown Court & kill the judge’. Another sent a message saying: ‘I will kill those judges. Don’t worry,’ after earlier stating: ‘I will chop the judges (sic) heads off if they send Dappy to prison.’ Others suggested they too would be after the senior legal figure. A Tweeter said that if the defendants were sent down they would ‘smash the courts up then go f*** the judge up’ and another warned they would ‘hunt the judge down’. A spokesman for Surrey Police confirmed that officers had begun an investigation into the comments made about the resident judge at Guildford Crown Court. Scene: Dappy and three co-defendants are accused of brawling on the forecourt of this Shell garage in Woodbridge Road, Guildford . A spokesman for the force said: ‘Surrey Police is aware of a number of comments on social media regarding a Crown Court judge and the issue is being looked into.’ He added: ‘Surrey Police will not tolerate language used in a public place, including on social media websites, which causes harassment, alarm or distress.’ Anyone who sees any such messages was asked to contact police. The No Regrets singer, real name Dino Costas Contostavlos, appeared at Guildford Crown Court on August 23 when he and three co-accused - Kieran Patrick Vassell, Kalonji David Stewart and Alfred James Miller - were accused of brawling on a petrol station forecourt. The incident - captured on CCTV cameras from various angles - was said to have happened at a Shell garage, in Woodbridge Road, Guildford, Surrey, at 3.30am on February 28. Rather than remand them, Judge Christopher Critchlow, the Honorary Recorder of Guildford, showed leniency by granting an application by 25-year-old Dappy’s legal team to adjourn the trial until after the New Year so he could perform on a £1million music tour. They have been released on unconditional bail. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","No Regrets star, 25, denies brawling on petrol station forecourt .

The nurse who stabbed her four-year-old daughter before cutting her own wrists left a suicide note saying ‘I couldn’t leave her with no mummy, that would be too cruel’. Dawn Makin, 35, was found lying unconscious next to the body of daughter Chloe Burke on a bed surrounded by cuddly toys at their family home as she faced prosecution over leaking patient information to an accident claims firm. She was jailed for 12 years yesterday for the killing which she committed while in a ‘spiral of descent into despair’. In her suicide note, Makin wrote: ‘I’m . so sorry I have taken her away from you all but I couldn’t leave her . with no mummy, that would be too cruel, sorry.’ Suicide note: Dawn Makin was jailed for killing her daughter after she stabbed the four-year-old and slit her own wrists, leaving a note reading 'I couldn't leave her with no mummy, that would be too cruel, sorry' The court heard that Chloe was found in her pyjamas and had suffered deep wounds to her neck and chests and tests showed would have been alive for a number of hours after the attack. Makin is now confined to a wheelchair due to brain damage caused by swallowing anti-freeze during the attack on Valentine’s Day last year. The nurse of 15 years was sacked after . being unmasked as a ‘mole’ for feeding confidential data from Moorgate . Primary Care centre in Bury, Greater Manchester to her boyfriend Martin . Campbell, 34, who was trying to sign up patients for a personal injury . litigation company in 2010. Permanent brain damage: Makin, here outside court yesterday, is now confined to a wheelchair after swallowing anti-freeze in the killing she committed while in a 'spiral of descent into despair' So ashamed by what she had done, Makin pretended to her parents that she was still working until she found out that she faced charges for data protection offences. Prosecutor Stephen Wright said: ‘She did seek further employment but every application floundered. She was getting nowhere.’ Makin had made an earlier attempt to gas Chloe and herself in February last year but stopped before any serious harm was done. Tried to protect herself: The court heard that Chloe suffered deep wounds to her neck and chest and in juries to her hands showed that the four-year-old tried to protect herself . 'Life is not fair': Chloe's father Michael Burke, left, said he felt sorry for Makin, right, because she was not in the right state of mind at the time of killing Chloe who 'was a princess' to him . Judge Anthony Russell said Makin had been suffering from a depressive disorder at the time of the killing. She wept as he jailed her for manslaughter, telling her: ‘The facts of this case are appalling. ‘The victim was a four-year-old child, someone who trusted you. ‘Finally, the physical injuries you have caused to yourself which are permanent and the knowledge you have killed your only child will be with you for the rest of your life.’ Injuries on Chloe’s hands show the little girl tried to protect herself, Preston Crown Court heard. Outside court, Chloe’s father Michael Burke, 40, said of Makin: ‘She had chances to speak to me, but she was too ashamed. ‘I miss my daughter. She was beautiful and lovely, and she was a princess to me. I just miss her so much… life is not fair. The day of the killing: Makin sent text messages to recent ex-boyfriend Martin Campbell saying 'I'll make sure you pay for this for the rest of your life' and 'I feel really low. My life is over' before killing Chloe . ‘I feel sorry for her in a way, she wasn’t in the right state of mind and didn’t know what she was doing.’ Makin’s boyfriend Campbell, who was fined after admitting data protection offences in June last year, used the details of 29 road accident victims who had been treated at the centre to make contact and try to encourage them to make personal injuries claims in December 2009, the court heard. Campbell and Makin had then separated causing her ‘great distress’ and on the day of the killing she learned that she had been summoned to court to face data protection offences. She tried to rekindle her relationship with Campbell but he told her he was taking another woman out to dinner. She sent text messages to Campbell saying: ‘I’ll make sure you pay for this for the rest of your life’ and ‘I feel really low. My life is over.’","Dawn Makin, 35, left a suicide note after killing her daughter and attempting to commit suicide .

A South Florida high school could be getting a new quarterback – with a long, blonde ponytail. High school senior Erin Dimeglio in on track to be one of the first female quarterbacks to take the field in Florida, after strutting her stuff in a preseason game last week. The 17-year-old is a backup quarterback for the South Plantation High School Paladins, in Sunrise, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale. Scroll down for video. You go girl: Erin Dimeglio was recruited for the flag football team, when her natural talent was spotted and she began to train with the school's varsity football team in May . The Florida teen has been practicing with the team since May and was able to hold her own during the fourth quarter of the Paladins game on August 24, calling plays and completing two passes, a sign that more field time could be in the cards during the upcoming season. Unfortunately, the game had to be called off early, with 2:43 remaining, due to heavy lightening in the area and the Paladins lost to Seminole Ridge High School, 35-20. 'I couldn't take the smile off my face,' she told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel about her field play last week. 'The other players have been great. After the game, they shook my hand and said it was great I was playing football.' A basketball star in her own right, Dimeglio was actually recruited to play flag football but as she trained, her natural talent for the sport became evident. Paladins football coach, Douglas Gatewood, observed her moves and invited her to train with the varsity team - and a star was born. No special treatment: Dimeglio's coach and fellow team members praise her talent and sportsmanship, insisting that she has to hold her own . Football in Florida is like a religion. The Sunshine State has been a breeding ground for NFL greats like Emmitt Smith, Deion Sanders and current up-and-comer Jets QB Tim Tebow. The state is joined by Texas and California in producing the most NFL players. Though high school football has seen female participation in the past, most have been in spots like kickers, receivers, defensive backs and offensive linemen (or linewomen). Rarely has a woman ascended to the high profile position of quarterback on the team. Logistically speaking, Dimeglio joins the team in pretty much everything - except the locker room. She changes into her uniform in the empty girls locker room, on the other side of her school. Off the field: Erin Dimeglio (left) says her older sister Amy (right) thinks she is crazy for playing with the boys . 'She doesn't ask for any special treatment,' Coach Gatewood said about his no-nonsense approach to incorporating Dimeglio. 'She's not trying to show anybody up, she really just trying to do her thing and if a boy takes it the wrong way, that's on him, not on her.' 'She's got to walk in the middle of [the football huddle] and tell them what to do and when to do it and they better listen to her ... and they do,' the coach added. State records show a total of 523 female Floridians have taken to the field in high school football since 1973. In 2011, a total of 36 girls played for teams across the state. 'We've had girls in South Florida that had the ability to [play quarterback], but they never have,' Larry Blustein, a Florida high school football analyst, told the Sun-Sentinel. 'You have to give her credit. I've never seen anything like this before,' he said. Leader: As QB, Erin has had to earn the respect of her teammates 'they better listen to her ... and they do,' her coach said . Erin said her older sister, Amy, thinks she is crazy, but 'I just think this is so much fun,' she said. 'I've played flag football since the fourth grade. Scoring on boys is really fun, just to see their reactions, see the coaches get mad. I'll be nervous, yeah. But this is like any other game. You just have to get in the zone and play.' Despite Erin's enthusiasm, her parents are carefully monitoring their daughter in the contact sport known for harrowing injuries. As a veteran athlete, the high schooler has had her fair share of injuries from her tenure on the basketball team, including a broken nose, a broken finger and multiple concussions. 'I've often joked that I wanted her to play basketball with a helmet on,' Kathleen DiMeglio, Erin's mother, said. 'She's no weakling and I think I have confidence after seeing her strength. But of course my greatest fear is injury,' the concerned mom added. And her mom isn't the only one concerned for her safety. Paladin lineman Kevin Avila said that having a girl on the team makes the defensive line feel like they need to step it up. From the court to the field: The 17-year-old high school senior got her start on the basketball team . 'I see her like a sister and you wouldn't want nobody to hurt your sister,' Avila said. 'Since she's a girl, you don't want her to get hurt,' Avila said. 'We want to have more protection for her.' Coach Gatewood has assured her parents that she'll have minimal field time, and would only be brought in to play when the game is going favorably for the team, to avoid unnecessary roughness. With all the fanfare surrounding her athletic pursuits, the teenager insists that it isn't all about sports to her. ‘As important as playing basketball is in my life, school and my education are a priority,’ she wrote in her profile on a local sport's recruiting website. Adding that her motto is ‘work and train hard, both on the court and in the classroom. It is as important to take care of your body as it is your mind.' Despite her tough-guy approach on the field, Erin isn't afraid to show her girly side. After her momentous field time last week, her coach encouraged her to take off her helmet to greet the crowd as she exited the field . 'Coach, my hair's all messed up,' she said in protest. 'Don't worry,' he said 'You just played football. Get used to it.'","Erin Dimeglio, 17, played in preseason varsity  football game last week .

Rumours of a toymaker's direction to remove the Confederate flag from future Dukes of Hazzard's General Lee cars launched a firestorm this week amid claims by Warner Bros the plans were never true. Posted to an online message board last week, an insider with manufacturer Tomy Toys allegedly revealed the Southern flag's future ban on all 2013 General Lee cars due to sensitivity issues with its cultural symbolism. 'Starting January 1, 2013 all Dukes of Hazzard General Lee vehicles will not be allowed to be produced with the Confederate flag on the top of the vehicle. This directive has been passed onto us from the licensor Warner Brothers,' the post on HobbyTalk.com read. Upset: Rumours by Tomy Toys that they would no longer be producing toy cars from the Dukes of Hazzard that feature a Confederate flag on its roof sparked outrage this week . Argued: Rumour of the flag's removal from all future toy cars from the hit TV show, pictured, was rebuffed by Warner Bros . Word of its imminent removal rushed fans of the late 1970s - early 1980s show who made claims on the message board of having already seen versions of the toy vehicle for sale without the flag. A spokesperson for Warner Bros reported the post’s claims as being false. 'We were not, and are not, planning to change the design of the General Lee on merchandise. All reports to the contrary have been inaccurate,' a spokesperson told NBC. A blatantly Southern car featured in nearly every episode in the hit TV show, with its painted flag, the orange Dodge Charger driven recklessly throughout Hazzard County by fictional cousins Bo and Luke Duke was aptly named after the Confederate General Robert E Lee - while also playing the first line of Dixie as its horn. Southern bell: The orange Dodge Charger pictured from the early 1980s TV show, was aptly named General Lee after the famous Confederate General and played the first verse of Dixie when its horn was blown . Standing up to the alleged leak this week by both the toy company and Warner Bros who owns the theatrical, DVD and licensing rights to The Dukes of Hazzard, was former Dukes of Hazzard actor Ben Jones. Rallying through his museum's website of Cooters Place, named after his character of Cooter Davenport on the show, Mr Jones collected signatures fighting the so-called plans. Mr Jones also penned a letter directed to Warner Bros calling their move 'a new level of ""P.C."" idiocy.'

This is a new level of ""P.C."" idiocy. I don't know about you, but I am tired of being insulted by morons,' he wrote in a release. - Dukes of Hazzard actor Ben Jones . After collecting signatures, votes and encouraging fans' emails to the entertainment powerhouse, on Thursday Mr Jones released a new statement on his Facebook page capping their efforts. 'There were reliable and verifiable reports from WB car licensees with whom we do business that as of January 1, 2013, the Confederate Banner on top of the General Lee would be removed because some people “found it offensive,” Mr Jones wrote. Reacting to the news of Warner Bros arguing having never planned to remove the flag from the cars, Mr Jones called the alleged change of heart a 'victory.' 'This is not only a victory for those who love the show, but a victory for the voice of the people, and in my opinion, a victory for mutual respect among people of different ethnicities and backgrounds,’ he wrote. His elated news reverberated from fans on his Facebook page who gave ample yeehaws, and one woman, an ‘Awwwwwwright!’","News of the Southern flag's removal by an alleged spokesperson for the toymaker caused outrage among fans of the hit TV show .

The former Abbot of Ealing Abbey and leader of the attached St Benedict’s School is the most senior British Catholic to have been caught up in the abuses scandals rocking the church. Scotland Yard’s decision to renew the appeal follows the appointment of a new lead investigator and an appeal launched this week by Catholic magazine Faith Today. Having worked for nearly 30 years at the £12,000-a-year private school, now expelled monk Soper quit Britain in 2001 for Rome to become treasurer at the Benedictine Order’s headquarters at St Anselmo. Following allegations by a former pupil, Soper was arrested and questioned by appointment by the Metropolitan Police in September 2010. However, investigators allowed him to retain his passport and did not take a picture, asking him through his solicitor to return to London. Instead, after leaving St Anselmo on March 4, 2011, apparently to fly to Heathrow, Soper skipped bail and vanished.

One of Oxfam's private advisers accused . investors as using the food market as a 'playground', when it should be . used by farmers as a place to buy and sell, the newspaper reported. Barclays was unavailable to respond to accusations that speculation pushed up prices when the MailOnline went to press. The World Bank published their Food Price Index, revealing worrying figures that global food prices have increased by 8 . per cent in the last four months since December 2011, and in March 2012 . were only 6 per cent below their February 2011 historical peak. All key food prices have increased, except for rice. The WMD highlighted the major problems, saying: 'In July, world food prices jumped 10 per cent. 'Maize prices hit a record level after rising 25 per cent in that month. 'The . price of maize in Mozambique, where people spend over half of their . income on food, more than doubled between April and July. 'South . Africans faced a 27 per cent hike in wheat prices during those three . months and over the last year, maize prices soared by 174 per cent in . Malawi.'

Amy Horton, campaigner at the World . Development Movement, said at the time: 'Barclays is gambling with the price of . food, and therefore with people’s lives. The price indices of grains, fats and oils, and other foods all increased in each month since January 2012. The Food Price Index weighs export prices of a variety of food commodities . 'Speculation benefits a tiny minority . in the financial sector, and at the same time fuels food price spikes . which force millions of people to go hungry. Governments must take . urgent action to curb this reckless practice.' In a report from September last year, . the World Development Movement said that it was not just natural . causes, such as weather, that was prompting the food crisis and blamed banks on sparking the hike in prices. It said: 'Many have argued that the . huge increase in financial participation in commodity derivative markets . has played a central role, fuelling price inflation and increasing . price volatility.' 'The huge growth of financial speculation has led to prices no longer being driven . by supply and demand for food, but by the sentiments of financial . speculators and the performance of their other investments. It said the bank's role in speculation has: 'Created huge inflationary pressure in the market, forcing food prices up, increased herding and price volatility, caused the prices of unrelated commodities to move together.' And the movement demanded tough new rules to try and prevent more food crisis. The report said: 'Clear, hard rules . are required to control financial speculation and to help prevent . another global food crisis. Bad return: Drought-affected harvests around the world have pushed up food prices . 'The policies of the UK government and . others who oppose effective regulation risk condemning millions to a . future of hunger and poverty.' It also said that Barclays is also the leading European . player in oil speculation which is pushing up oil prices. 'Since oil is a . key input in agricultural production, higher oil prices means higher . costs of production and therefore rising food prices. Critics attacked trading giant Glencore for describing the global food crisis and price rises as a 'good' business opportunity. But it's not just poorer countries who are suffering from the soaring food prices. The Office of National Statistics said consumers have faced an average of 37.9 per cent rise in shop food prices over the last seven years, the Independent newspaper reported. In March the WMD released a report highlighting how the average household pays 3.7 per cent more for their food than the did a year ago, meaning their annual grocery bill has risen by more than £100, . It said: 'Real incomes in the UK are shrinking and almost a billion people face hunger worldwide, but curbing speculation would help prevent price spikes and would cost the Treasury virtually nothing, says the anti-poverty group.' Deborah Doane, director of the World Development Movement, called on the government to intervene: . 'Treasury ministers repeatedly cite the high price of commodities, which includes food, as one of the reasons people in the UK are facing such hard times. 'But what the Treasury does not seem to have grasped is that George Osborne can take easy, painless action to tackle financial speculation, one of the major drivers of high food prices. 'If Osborne wants to ease the burden of Britain’s economic woes on ordinary families, and at the same time safeguard the world’s poorest people from the impact of soaring prices, he should put his weight behind effective market regulation.' Banks must drive up standards and put . customers first 'to transform a sector that has lost its moral compass', . the chief executive of consumer group Which? has said. In an open letter to Anthony Browne, . who has been appointed the new chief executive of the British Bankers' Association (BBA), Peter Vicary-Smith asks him to take the opportunity . to lead by example and work with the banks to 'take real action to . reform their practices'. Mr Vicary-Smith described a 'real . crisis' in consumer trust and confidence, which he said was at an all . time low, while there was a perception that banks put bankers before . customers. Almost three-quarters (71%) of people . do not think UK banks have learnt their lesson from the financial crisis . - up from 61% in September last year, he said. He tells Mr Browne that as the new . head of the BAA, an organisation that represents more than 200 banks, he . is in a unique position and has a 'golden opportunity' to transform the . sector which has been blighted by scandal in recent years while bankers . have continued to receive 'excessive' bonuses. Mr Vicary-Smith said fundamental changes were needed, and he asks Mr Browne to prioritise five actions. As well as driving up standards and . putting customers first, he asks him to demonstrate leadership and . establish the BBA as a credible voice. The fifth request is for him to up the . pace of reform in order to help banks make changes immediately rather . than wait for the regulator or the Government to force them to act. He adds: 'The time is right for making . a positive difference and your appointment presents a timely . opportunity for a fresh start for the BBA. 'I hope you embrace and push forward . the reforms that are desperately needed to turn banking into an industry . that consumers can trust, where banks are for customers, not bankers.'","Investors accused of using food market 'as a playground'

The cost of land to be used for development of the high-speed rail line between London and Birmingham has been dramatically reduced by the Government. Officials have cut the 'landscape value' of some of England's finest countryside by as much as 90 per cent, it was reported. The new figures were only discovered after campaigners against the 109-mile route going through the London green belt and the Chilterns - an Area of Outstanding Beauty (ANOB) - made a number of request under the Freedom of Information Act. Protest: A sign marks the spot where a new rail bridge is proposed to be built across the countryside for the new HS2 high speed train link at the village of Middleton in Staffordshire . Officials use the 'landscape impact value' to quantify in cash terms how much damage a development will do to Britain's green space and the environment. It is different criteria from the commercial or sale value of the land. In the official 2010 assessment of damage to the landscape, it emerged that the estimate by HS2 Ltd which is building the line, was £4.3 billion. Just under £1.1 billion was estimated for the London green belt and Chiltern ANOB. But new figures issued by the Transport Department now reveal that the route's damage would cost £978 million - down 78 per cent - and the Chiltern-London impact would be £114 million, down 90 per cent on the 2010 figure. An artist's impression of the high-speed HS2 train which will travel between London and Birmingham . The department has made some budget cutbacks by introducing longer tunnels and roofing over  railway cuttings, but the biggest savings have been the new values placed on the countryside. They have based their figures on seven categories with urban parkland being the most valuable, followed by ANOBs and other unspoilt natural land and then green belt the third most valuable.In the new assessment, almost all the London green belt and AONB land along HS2’s proposed route has been demoted, for valuation purposes, to the lowest category of 'intensive farmland' worth just £103 per hectare.Hilary Wharf, of the HS2 Action Alliance, claimed that the move established a precedent that the 'most precious green space can be devalued whenever the Government wants to build on it badly enough.' Beautiful landscape: The view across the Chiltern Hills towards a lion carved in the chalk hillside of Dunstable Downs . She told the Sunday Telegraph: 'We may see this happening with future big projects all over the country.' Earlier today Chancellor George Osborne signalled he wanted to speed up planning laws which would allow developers to build on the green belt as long as the green space is replaced by the local authorities. Research by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) published last week warned that green belt land around cities and towns was under threat from plans for at least 81,000 homes, as well as roads, industrial parks, mines and airport growth. There would be an expansion of Birmingham airport, proposals for freight terminals near St Albans, Luton and St Helens, an opencast coal mine at Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, and a hotel and golf course in Leatherhead, Surrey. A spokesman for the Transport Department described the HS2's 2010 estimates as 'crude' because they did not include a number of factors including extra tunnelling. The estimate was 'not comparable' to the recent more sophisticated exercise, it was reported.",New figures discovered after campaigners against the line made requests under Freedom of Information .

Vile British killer Keith Herring may have to be deported to the UK on a chartered flight after twice wreaking havoc on commercial jets in Australia. The murderer had spent 22 years locked up after drowning his wife at their Sydney home in 1989. Yesterday the 66-year-old had to be removed from a Thai Airways flight at Sydney airport after he spat at a crew member, smashed a TV monitor, tore a telephone from a phone seat, screamed abuse at passengers, urinated in a holding cell and tried the same in an aisle. Keith Herring terrorised passengers and crew at Sydney airport until he was kicked off his flight . Now Australian authorities are considering paying for a private jet to fly him back to Britain – at an estimated cost of $1million - £600,000 - to Australian taxpayers. He caused similar problems the day before on a Qantas jet. That resulted in three security guards and an immigration official boarding the plane to take him off to prevent further alarm to passengers. Britons convicted of serious crimes in Australia are almost always deported to the UK once they have served their time. But Herring has shown his determination to remain in Australia. Australian authorities hoped the killer would have a swift departure but he had other plans . After his release from jail he was moved to Villawood Detention Centre, on the edge of Sydney, to await deportation. From there launched a determined fight to remain in Australia. He took his case to the Federal Court. But this week he lost his bid to stay and was escorted to the Qantas jet. But his wild and abusive behaviour frightened passengers and crew so much he was escorted from the plane, Sydney’s Daily Telegraph reported today. A second attempt to fly him to Britain, this time on a Thai Airways jet, also failed. Once again he verbally abused passengers and crew. In a phone call with the paper earlier this year Herring admitted for the first time he was guilty of murder and complained about his accommodation. ‘I caused a death. I paid my time,’ he said. ‘The rooms are dirty, the areas we live in are dirty. I have a heart condition I am waiting for an operation.’ During Herring’s unsuccessful 1995 appeal against his conviction,  Supreme Court Judge Jeremy Badgery-Parker claimed he had ‘an extraordinarily manipulative nature.’ Worried he will try to cause further mayhem on another commercial flight, the Australian authorities are considering their options to get rid of the killer. The alternative to paying for a private plane is to book rows of seats on a regular flight to isolate him. That would also cost tens of thousands of pounds. A spokesman for Australia’s Immigration Department insisted they were examining all options ‘for the removal of this client at the earliest opportunity and in the most cost effective way.’ The brute was removed from the airport but Australia insists he will go back to Britain . He added: ‘Misbehaviour in no way deters the department.’ Herring already had a prison record when he was granted a migration visa to Australia in the early 1990s. In the UK he had been convicted for assault and grievous bodily harm. In Australia, he was convicted of killing his Philippine-born wife in the swimming pool of their Sydney home in 1995. He claimed he was innocent but the prosecution said bruises on her head pointed to foul play. During his trial Herring exposed himself, called the prosecutor a ‘fat slug’ and leapt from the dock at the judge. In jail he committed numerous offences, mainly assault and intimidation. His behaviour - on top of the murder conviction - assured him of deportation once he walked free. But the refusal by commercial pilots to fly Herring may leave the Australian government with no option but to choose the expensive option for fly him alone but for his police minders.","Keith Herring abused crew, smashed TV, broke phone and urinated in cell .

Authorities say Kimberly and Jacob Taschler’s daughter Kayla died after left without food or water for 16 hours in their Palmerton, Pennsylvania home in 2010.

Sentenced: Parents Kimberly & Jacob Taschler were sentenced to time behind bars in the death of their 18-month-old daughter found starved and dehydrated in their Pennsylvania home . Both parents cried in Carbon County court on Thursday. Kimberly Taschler said she was overwhelmed at the time of the baby’s death and didn't seek proper help. Authorities had alleged that the Taschlers had long neglected Kayla even before her death in January. She was found weighing just 13lbs when her mother brought her to Palmerton Hospital. Police believe she had been dead for several hours before arriving. In July of this year prosecutors said that Kayla had missed doctors' appointments, had suffered excessive weight and muscle loss and was not properly provided with fluids and food. Reaction: Seen in July, Jacob Taschler said he loves all his children, with two others placed in foster care since their sister Kayla's death . A defense attorney had called the baby's autopsy report 'junk science' this week. 'The problems occurred in the last days, the last day really. I really don’t have an explanation as to why in terms of why is this child bound for dehydration, why, when there is food in the stomach, there is wasting,' their attorney George Dydynsky told WNEP in July. In court Jacob Tashler said he loves all his children, having two others who are currently in foster care since Kayla's death. Prosecutors say the mother received a longer sentence because she was home when the baby died and was her primary caretaker. Both pleaded guilty to charges in July - Jacob Tashler to endangering the welfare of a child and Kimberly Tashler to involuntary manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child.","Police said Kayla Taschler was dead for several hours before she was taken to a hospital in January of 2010 .

For decades, it has been the picturesque gateway for millions of visitors to the Yorkshire Dales. Countless sightseers en route to the rolling countryside have discovered the gentle charms of Masham, with its cobbled, tree-dotted Georgian market square, traditional tea shops and the famous Theakston’s Brewery. But now the tranquillity of the ancient town on the banks of the River Ure has been punctured by a very British battle between residents and the bureaucrats they blame for pushing it ‘off the map’. Once a popular tourist route to the Dales, the picturesque village of Masham is now far quieter as passing trade is no longer directed to the village . Visitor numbers have plummeted since long-standing road signs directing drivers to the town from the nearby A1 were removed as part of a multi-million-pound upgrade of the dual carriageway to a six-lane motorway. The original turn-off to the town was closed and no new signs were erected at a new junction two miles further south. Many drivers now do not leave the A1 until the next junction, about 11 miles further north – depriving local businesses of hundreds of thousands of pounds in passing trade. Caravan park owner and parish councillor Flo Grainger, 66, will soon permanently close her Old Station cafe on the road into Masham, with the loss of five part-time jobs and an estimated annual income of £50,000 to £60,000. She said: ‘We used to be open most days of the week but recently we have reduced this to weekends, which is not sustainable. The number of cars on this road has dropped hugely. It is devastating.’ In the market square, Susan Turner, who runs a plant and pet food stall, said: ‘Something needs to be done. We are losing passing trade as tourists use other routes.’ Theakston's Back Sheep Brewery relies heavily on passing trade. Pictured attending the Masham Sheep Fair held at the end of September in the village Market Place . Lucy Scott Paul, who has run the sweet shop Bah Humbug for eight years, said: ‘Business has been dreadful. I have experienced a  20 per cent drop in sales. Some people think the issue of the signs is a small matter, but to us it is having a significant impact.’ Her sentiments are echoed in other shops, from the Joneva delicatessen to the Border House tea rooms. Masham Parish Council chairman Andrew Burrell warned that other businesses, from a farm making its own ice cream to a restaurant favoured by Prince Charles, are also vulnerable. ‘The route through Masham and the lower Wensleydale area is about 12 miles long, and other  villages such as East Witton could lose out,’ he said. ‘We are not  talking about a pub and six  houses. There are hundreds of businesses involved.’ The parish council was told it would have to pay more than £36,000 to erect brown tourist signs, an amount it cannot afford. Jo Theakston, the 36-year-old marketing director of the renowned Black Sheep brewery, one of two in the town run by the Theakston brewing family, said his business relied heavily on  the tourists who stopped off at its visitor centre. ‘I am extremely angry,’ he said. ‘It has been such a long campaign and now they say we have to  pay. It’s ludicrous. This is one of the most iconic and well-known tourist areas in the country.’ His cousin Simon Theakston, 55, the executive director of Theakston’s Brewery in Masham, added:  ‘I don’t think the Government could have done a better job in inconveniencing people. I don’t know who is to blame, but whoever it is should be deeply embarrassed. I am angry because it is completely incompetent.’ The traditional junction on the A1 for Masham was closed as part of an upgrade of the road. Under a scheme agreed between the North Yorkshire County Council and the Highways Agency,  a new turn-off was created – Junction 50 – some two miles further south. The roads into and out of the Yorkshire village are far quieter since the changes were made to the A1 . But parish councillors in Masham – . pronounced ‘Massam’ – say it was only when the disruptive road-widening . work began that they found out all six signs that had previously . directed  drivers to Masham were to disappear and would not be replaced. Councillors were told that because the A1 was becoming a motorway, new . criteria applied, and Masham did not qualify for signs as it was not a . ‘primary destination’. However, . after a campaign by Conservative MP Julian Smith, the Department of . Transport ruled Masham could have two large brown tourist signs at the . new Junction 50 to help regenerate its flagging tourist trade. But as . the signs are ‘outside normal regulations’, the town was expected to . fund them itself. Businesses in the picturesque village of Masham are in uproar as the traffic to the village has fallen dramatically due to the lack of signs . To the horror of Mr Smith, an initial assessment by the Highways Agency costed the two signs at £190,000. This was eventually reduced to £36,000 on the condition that the parish council would sign an open-ended deal agreeing to meet any unforeseen extra costs – something the council feared could lead to bankruptcy. Mr Smith said: ‘I have been staggered by the sums of money quoted for the installation of two brown signs and very disappointed by the lack of appreciation by the Highways Agency of the devastating economic impact that not having signage is having on Masham.’ Last night, the Highways Agency said it has now placed tourist signs to Masham for motorists driving down from the north –  at Junction 51 where the A1 is still a trunk road – but that it was still trying to find an ‘affordable solution’ for drivers travelling from the south.","Work to expand the number of lanes on A1 has resulted in the village losing its signpost and its old exit .

The impact caused the gun to ‘accidentally discharge,’ Commissioner Kelly said, striking the man in his left shoulder. Scroll down for videos . Innocent: Reynaldo Cuevas, 20, a worker at his uncle's bodega, was shot dead by an NYPD officer as he tried to escape during an armed robbery, witnesses said . Helping hand: Cuevas worked at his uncle's bodega in the South Bronx . Dramatic moment: Security footage shown at a press conference this afternoon shows the moment Cuevas ran out of the bodega and into an NYPD officer . Alternate angle: Another camera angle shows the moment the bodega worker was shot; police commissioner Ray Kelly said it was an accidental discharge . The New York Post reported that one . of the three gunman, Orlando Ramos, pistol-whipped the owner of Aneurys . and then barked orders for him to get on the floor. He was joined by accomplices Ernesto . Delgado and Christopher Dorsey, who took to stealing cigarettes, lottery . tickets, and a little more than $700 from the cash register. According to the Post, it was Ramos, . 31, who heard police sirens and told his partners to run for cover. Dorsey, 17, who was unarmed, was left in the front of the store. Seeing their chance, the bodega owner . and Cuevo ran for their lives. Police surveillance video obtained by . NY1 shows the owner running to safety, but apparently Cuevo running . straight into the NYPD officer, who had his gun drawn. Commissioner Kelly said in a press . conference held this afternoon that the collision early Friday morning . happened ‘within a matter of ‘split seconds.’ The head of the NYPD declined to name . the officer involved in the shooting, saying only that he has since . been assigned to administrative duties. He said in a message to the Cuevas family: ‘We want to extend our deepest condolences for their loss.’ But the apology was not accepted by . Cuevas’ uncle, Alcibiades Cuevas, 52, who told DNAInfo in Spanish: ‘The . police killed him. They thought he was a thief.

In talks: NYPD officers speak to one another behind yellow police tape at the scene . Cuevas’ cousin, Jose Garcia, told the New York Daily News that men raided the bodega early Friday morning. He said he witnessed the whole horrifying scene from across the street. When Garcia got off of work around 2am, he was with a friend who wanted to buy cigarettes. As they were nearby, they went into the bodega where Garcia’s cousin worked. 'The . police killed him. They thought he was a thief. They killed him like a . dog.' -Alcibiades Cuevas . Garcia’s friend noticed the bodega owner was behind the safety glass at gunpoint on the floor. Dashing away, the man called 911, according to the New York Post. When the friend fled, the two armed men barricaded themselves in the corner deli, taking the bodega workers hostage. According to witnesses, the standoff between the two men and NYPD officers lasted for at least two and a half hours. At that point, the owner and his nephew, Cuevas, tried to escape the robbers and ran into the street. Garcia said: ‘The owner opened the door and came out with his hands up. He said “They’re robbing me.”’ But he said that Cuevas didn’t have his hands visible and said nothing. ‘He just came out running,’ Garcia told the Daily News. Extending condolences: Police Commissioner Ray Kelly apologised to the Cuevo family and showed reporters the surveillance video . Conflict: Crowds have been gathering outside the bodega debating the man's death and the effectiveness of the NYPD . Witness and Morrisania resident Jesse Rodriguez, told DNA Info that while running out, Cuevas ‘tripped by the fire hydrant.’ He continued: ‘And the cops shot him.’ Rodriguez said that while Cuevas was running out, frantic onlookers were yelling, ‘He works there! He’s an employee!’ He added: ‘He was innocent.’ Garcia told the New York Post that an NYPD officer shot his cousin in the neck. Cuevas was rushed to St Barnabas Hospital, but died from his injury. The famous police operation has had several fatal shootings in the past few weeks, including a machete-weilding man in Times Square who refused to drop his weapon, and Empire State Building shooter Jeffery Johnson. All nine people injured during the dramatic confrontation between police and the gunman outside the Empire State Building were wounded by gunfire from the two officers, police said. Two of the bystanders hit by stray bullets may be looking to sue the city, it was reported. First responders: Dozens of police vehicles flooded the streets early Friday morning as authorities tried to piece together what happened .

Harry Potter star Emma Watson is the favourite celebrity bait for cyber criminals trying to lure internet users, it has emerged. Internet security firm McAfee said today that the English actress is the 'most dangerous' celebrity to search for online. That's because many sites use Miss Watson to trick users into downloading malicious software or to steal personal information. When searching for the 22-year-old, there's a one-in-eight chance of landing on a malicious site. This is the sixth time the Intel-owned security technology company has conducted the study, which was last year topped by Heidi Klum. Female celebrities are far more likely to be utilised by cyber criminals: late-night host Jimmy Kimmel was the only male in the top 20. Others among the riskiest celebrities to search online are Jessica Biel, Eva Mendes, Selena Gomez and Halle Berry. McAfee says people using the internet should be aware of malicious content hiding in 'tiny' places like shorted URLs which can spread virally in emails, text messages or social networking sites. The firm has previously said that singers and sports stars are safer searches than models and movie stars. Last year, supermodel and TV host Heidi Klum was named as the most dangerous celebrity in cyberspace. McAfee said searching for downloads and screensavers for the Project Runway judge and former Victoria's Secret model, 38, ran at nearly a one in 10 chance of landing on a malicious website.

The innocent teenager, who had been waiting for his Koran teacher, was brutally hacked down in a murderous attack on the doorstep of his home in Cardiff, south Wales, in April 2010. Upon hearing the mens loud howls, the A level student's parents Iqbal and Parveen, rushed to the door to save their son's life but were themselves stabbed in the process. Ben Hope, 39, and Jason Richards, 38, went on trial today at Swansea Crown Court charged with murder. Both men are also each accused of two separate counts of attempted murder on the victim’s parents. They deny all charges. Patrick Harrington QC said Hope and Richards -both heroin addicts - had gone to the wrong address. Their intended victim lived in a similar red brick end-of-row house in a parallel road. The men, the court heard, were paid cash for the contract killing by a third man, who can't be named for legal reasons. The jury was told he was in dispute with intended victim Mohammed Tanhai, the owner of the house nearby, who owed the unnamed man £50,000. 'On Sunday April 11 2010, a young man, Aamir Siddiqi, was stabbed to death in the hallway of his home,' Mr Harrington said. 'His father Iqbal and his mother Parveen intervened to try to stop this murderous attack and they too were stabbed. They were unable to stop their son’s murder.' He said the murder could be described as a 'contract killing' because the two men were recruited to carry it out. But with 'staggering ineptitude', Hope and Richards took a wrong turn. 'Tragically for the deceased and his family, although fortunately for the intended victim, the killers went to the wrong house.' Mr Harrington said that Hope and Richards had used a stolen Volvo car on the day of the murder, which was later found abandoned. Upon examination, traces of the teenager's blood was found in its footwell together with Hope’s fingerprints and DNA matching Richards. Investigators used Cardiff’s CCTV network to trace the movements of both men before and after the killing. And evidence from mobile phones allegedly used by both men has also been used in the case against them, the court heard. In the dock: This artist impression shows Jason Richards (left) and Ben . Hope (right) who are accused of stabbing Aamir Siddiqi to death in a case of mistaken . identity . Mr Harrington said that after the brutal killing Hope and Richards were paid cash, before the alleged mistake in murdering the wrong person was revealed. 'Ben Hope went and bought himself a new pair of trainers and a laptop computer with the wages he was handed for murder.' Within days both men were arrested and 'each defendant has contrived to create a case which blames the other', Mr Harrington added. He told the jury that the prosecution agreed with both men to the extent that 'the killer is in the dock'. 'They are both right,' Mr Harrington added. 'Jason Richards is right when he said Ben Hope did the killing and Ben Hope is right when he said that Jason Richards did the killing. 'What happened is that they did it together.'

Liam Fox last night met George Osborne to urge him to take bigger risks to get the economy growing. The former defence secretary, a standard bearer of the Tory right, enjoyed a drink with Mr Osborne, who is coming under increasing pressure to change course to steer Britain out of the double dip recession. Today Dr Fox issued a demand for the Treasury to deliver a ‘totemic shock’ to the economy, raising the prospect of massive tax and welfare cuts. Liam Fox said the Treasury needed to deliver a 'totemic shock' to the economy, including axing capital gains tax for three years . The former Tory leadership challenger also challenged David Cameron to wield the axe on paternity leave and benefits paid to pensioners, something the Prime Minister has repeatedly ruled out. ‘If we don’t take some risks we’ll not get growth and if we don’t get growth we’ll not get re-election, Dr Fox told The Times. ‘We should simply throw down the gauntlet and say that we are cutting our taxes, we are making Britain more competitive, we are going to reform our labour laws, make hiring and firing easier and do what we know works because it’s worked before.’ Speculation is growing that Mr Osborne will use his autumn statement on December 5 to unveil a business-focussed package aimed at stimulating growth. However, there are doubts about whether the Treasury will be able to meet its target that by 2015-16 debt will be falling as a proportion of gross domestic product. Liam Fox (right) and George Osborne are old friends, having worked together for many years including on the 2005 Conservative Party election campaign . Sources have played down the idea, insisting the coalition’s plan is ‘working’ giving them room to do ‘other things’ which will help get the economy moving. But Dr Fox is clear that the Treasury needs to be bolder. His key idea is scrapping capital gains tax, currently 28 per cent, for three years, and then bringing it back at a lower rate of 10 per cent. ‘Deficit reduction alone won’t be enough. We have to have a growing economy. We need to shock the system.’ Taking aim at the benefits and welfare system, Dr Fox added: ‘We need to have a look at everything that we have in terms of paternity leave and all the other things that are there. Prime Minister David Cameron has ruled out making cuts to many pensioner benefits . ‘With the sort of economic problems . that we face in the UK it is irrational and unreasonable to expect that . those in work should keep all their social benefits and workplace . benefits should be protected, at the cost of making the next generation . unemployed. 'That is not a sustainable generational compact.' He also urged ministers to bring forward the decision no new airport capacity in the South East. Allies of Mr Osborne insisted the Chancellor was relaxed about Dr Fox’s comments. Before the election Mr Cameron was clear that benefits for wealthy pensioners would be protected. ‘Let me say very clearly to pensioners if you have a Conservative Government your Winter Fuel Allowance, your bus pass, your Pension Credit, your free TV licence all these things are safe. 'You can read my lips, that is a promise from my heart.’ He has repeated the pledge several times since becoming Prime Minister.","Former Defence Secretary demands the Treasury deliver a 'totemic shock' to the economy .

'There were polar bears, crevasses, sudden storms, and freezing water, then once at the edge, the danger of the glacier calving while standing on the edge amplified the feeling of difficulty and consequence.' During their 12 day round trip from Longyearbyrn in Svalbard, temperatures plummeted as low as minus 19 Celsius with the wind chill - cold enough to catch hypothermia in a matter of minutes. But the excitement of the jump kept them going. Chris added: 'It had been a long day to get to the edge, and I was the last to jump, so I was getting pretty cold, but the anticipation kept me plenty warm.'

An elderly couple concerned about speeding in the quiet village where they live fell foul of authorities after erecting a fake road sign saying 'Slow - Heaven is full!' The sign on Wotton Lane, Lympstone, east Devon, was put up by George and Mary Truell on the road which is used as a rat run between nearby Exmouth and the main road to Exeter. Highways bosses, who say the sign is illegal and the lane’s speed limit is 60mph, have written to the Truells ordering the sign be taken down. End of the road? George and Mary Truell from Lympstone, Devon, are pictured alongside their sign warning motorists to 'Slow - Heaven is full!' Sign of the times: The elderly couple erected the sign after they found a rise in speeding traffic made it difficult to cross the road . But the Truells said they were refusing to remove it because it was on their land and they wanted to prevent accidents. The sign, paid for by the Truells’ son, was put up after they said they had had difficulty crossing the road because of speeding traffic. Mrs Truell, 84, said: 'People just drive too fast. 'We know we live on a lane and we accept the idea it has a lot of traffic on it. 'But speed is completely unnecessary and there could be bad accidents.' Her husband, 86, who served as a soldier for 40 years, added that the sign was on his land and it was staying for the moment.

David Cameron has issued an appeal for party unity – as a poll revealed his rival Boris Johnson would make a far more popular leader. The Prime Minister used a speech to a private Tory fundraising dinner to warn that voters always punished divided parties. A source at the annual Carlton Club dinner on Thursday night said the Prime Minister told senior Tories that the party ‘must not go back to the bad old days’. Rivals: David Cameron has issued an appeal for party unity - as a poll revealed his rival Boris Johnson would make a far more popular leader . His decision to speak out on the issue underlines growing concern within Tory high command about discontent with both the Coalition and Mr Cameron. But his discomfort increased last night with the release of a poll showing London Mayor Mr Johnson was now a far more popular choice to lead the country. The YouGov survey for the Guardian said that Mr Johnson was the only serving politician in Britain to enjoy a positive approval rating with the public. Mr Johnson’s net positive rating of 25 contrasted sharply with Mr Cameron’s rating of minus 18. Ed Miliband fared even worse with a rating of minus 29, while Nick Clegg’s rating was minus 52, just ahead of the Chancellor George Osborne. The highest rated Coalition minister was Foreign Secretary William Hague, with a rating of minus one. Mr Johnson’s popularity has soared in the wake of the Olympic Games. Many Tories believe his optimism, Euroscepticism and belief in cutting taxes could prove a winning formula. Some Conservative MPs now openly describe themselves as ‘outriders’ for Mr Johnson and are hatching a plot to help him return to the Commons to enable him to stand for the leadership. Mr Cameron’s call for unity came just hours after reports that 14 Conservative MPs have written to Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, demanding a leadership contest. Popular: The highest rated Coalition minister in the poll was Foreign Secretary William Hague, with a rating of minus one . Under Tory rules a contest is triggered if 15 per cent of the party’s MPs write letters to Mr Brady calling for the leader to go. The reported 14 letters remain well short of the 46 needed to trigger a leadership contest. But thanks to a quirk of the rules, they remain on file indefinitely, meaning that Mr Cameron could face a ‘drip, drip’ build-up of discontent. Tory sources say this month’s Cabinet reshuffle has ‘greatly increased’ unhappiness with Mr Cameron at Westminster. A study yesterday revealed that there are now only 24 Tory MPs on the backbenches who have not rebelled against the Government.","PM used a speech to a private Tory fundraising dinner to warn that voters always punished divided parties .

Police are hunting a thug who gunned down a pet cat in the street and left it with such severe injuries that its front leg had to be amputated. The brute shot eight-year-old Toby with an air rifle from a range of up to 50 feet while he was hunting field mice in farmland near his home in Cheshire. Despite his wounds, the whimpering moggie managed to limp back home and was later found covered with blood in his owner’s back garden. Injured: Toby the cat (pictured) had to have his front left leg amputated after he was shot with an air rifle while out hunting. His owner Georgina Hoult (pictured, right) has slammed the heartless thug who injured her beloved pet . Disabled: Toby (left) is still learning to hobble around on three legs following the amputation. An X-ray (right) shows the damage done to the bone in the cat's leg by the air rifle pellet . Xrays revealed a pellet from the rifle had shattered a bone in Toby’s front left leg and, despite the intervention of a vet, the leg could not be saved and the animal had to have 14 stitches. Today Toby’s owner Georgina Hoult, 26, of Mobberley, near Knutsford, Cheshire, said she was 'heartbroken for him.' 'Toby is such an active little thing and this is going to diminish what he’s able to do,' she said. 'It was just so shocking to see Toby like that. 'Everyone who has seen him has burst into tears. 'It’s such a tragedy he had to go through this and I’m angry that someone’s been so callous and cruel to do this to him. Violence: Miss Hoult said that whoever shot her pet is 'callous and cruel' 'Whoever has done it can have no education about how to use that kind of weapon. 'Possibly they have done [this] for some kind of sick thrill. 'This person who did this is probably the type who play on video games and when they shoot things the targets get back up. They don’t realise that in real life it’s very different.'The incident is believed to have occurred on September 6 after Toby went out roaming in the neighbourhood. He failed to return that evening and the truth emerged the following morning, when he was found hurt in Miss Hoult's garden. At first she thought Toby had been hit by a car. 'I scooped him up and noticed his leg was really rigid,' she said. 'I rushed him to the vet and they found a big hole in the leg. 'The vet did everything he could but there was nothing he could do about Toby’s leg. 'He’s recovering at home now but is very groggy. 'He seems to be adapting to it well though. He’s wobbling around on his three legs. 'He’s a very good-natured thing, very happy and enjoying cuddles from everyone.' But Miss Hoult said that every time she opens the door for the other cats Toby wobbles over and sits by the door mournfully because he cannot go out too. 'I think he was shot in a local field and he managed to hobble home. The injury is quite horrific. From the wound it looks like he was shot from about 50 feet away. 'He’s a big white fluffy thing. I can’t comprehend the mentality where someone would want to shoot a cat.' Miss Hoult's mother Pauline Hoult, 59, a child care worker, said it is upsetting to watch Toby try to negotiate the stairs on his three remaining legs. Games: The Hoults have put some of the blame for the incident on the growing popularity of violent video games amongst young people. The injury has badly affected Toby's mobility . 'The worse thing is that we have spoken to a gun club who said that Toby was shot from 50 feet away so they would have known exactly what they were doing,' she said. 'I can’t think of anybody that could be this heartless. The law on air rifles is ridiculous. 'I never realised, but if they are misused then the law is the same as if you are using a real gun. 'However they are bringing the age down to be able to use them to 15 which is ridiculous. People don’t realise how dangerous they can be.' Mrs Hoult placed some of the blame on the growing popularity of violent computer games among the young. 'The first thing you learn with guns is to never point it at anything living,' she said. 'They are all acting it out in their [computer] games but they have never seen the result of what guns can do. 'Toby is lucky that he managed to get home, otherwise he would have bled to death. 'These thugs don’t think of anybody else but themselves.' Sgt Andy Miller of Cheshire Police said: 'We will not tolerate animal cruelty of any kind. 'We will be investigating this matter, and appeal to anyone with any information about the incident to come forward.'

A gay executive has won a six-figure insurance payout after his boyfriend was cleared of torching his home in the throes of a childish 'hissy fit'. Tony Howe admitted his tendency to what his lover, Jonathan Smyth, affectionately called 'Tony Bear Tantrums', and described one episode in which he had lain on the floor of a Marks & Spencer branch because he couldn’t get his own way about a bacon sandwich. However, Judge John Randall QC today exonerated Mr Howe, ruling that the fire that gutted the couple’s then home in Brighton, was probably caused by a cigarette end carelessly discarded or dislodged by a housemate. Cleared: Jonathan Smyth (left) has won a six-figure payout after his boyfriend Tony Howe, 41, (right) was cleared of deliberately setting his house . on fire in the throes of a childish 'hissy fit' Mr Smyth returned home from work on . the evening of Tuesday, January 22, 2008, to find his house alight and . firefighters battling to put the blaze out. The fire, which started in a . basement bedroom, caused huge damage and killed three pet cats. An . information security manager with Direct Line, Mr Smyth, in his . forties, shared the four-storey house with 41-year-old Mr Howe and two . others and made a claim for £200,000 against his policy with St Andrews . Insurance Plc. But the . company refused to pay up, asserting that Mr Howe had 'set the fire' when ‘intoxicated' and having what Mr Smyth described in court as 'a . Tony Bear tantrum'. Today, . Judge Randall ordered St Andrews to honour the policy after ruling that . it was 'more likely than not' that the blaze was sparked by a . smouldering cigarette, carelessly discarded or accidentally dislodged by . the couple’s house mate, Rebecca Alexander. Damage: The fire started in a basement bedroom of Mr Smyth's former home in Brighton and made it uninhabitable. Three pet cats were also killed in the blaze . In . contrast to the fiercely house-proud Mr Howe, who did the cleaning . whilst his boyfriend was at work, the judge said Miss Alexander, 35, was . a 'messy person' who smoked in her bedroom and annoyed him with her . untidy habits. Admitting she . didn’t tidy her room 'out of sheer laziness', Miss Alexander, from . Birmingham, discarded flammable material - including used make-up . removal tissues - around her bedroom and the state of her room was 'a . serious fire hazard', the judge said. Mr . Howe had given his evidence calmly and consistently, whereas Miss . Alexander was 'to put it at its kindest an overly defensive witness' who . had given 'at least slanted information' to the police after the fire, . leading to Mr Howe’s arrest. The . judge said the most plausible explanation was that the 'naturally . careless' children’s home care worker had discarded or dislodged a . burning cigarette whilst in a tired, anxious and agitated mood following . a 'shouting match' with Mr Howe. Cause: Judge Randall ruled that the blaze was 'more likely than not' sparked by a smouldering cigarette, carelessly discarded or accidentally dislodged by the couple's house mate, Rebecca Alexander . Housemate: The judge said Rebecca Alexander, 35, was a 'messy person' who smoked in her bedroom and annoyed Mr Howe with her untidy habits . The . court earlier heard the housemates had a 'history' of rows 'about . tidiness' in the house. Mr Smyth, now of Stirling, Scotland, had . received a text from Miss Alexander while on his way home from work, . saying that Mr Howe had gone into a 'big fat Tony Tantrum' and that the . pair had fallen out. The . fire was discovered and the house evacuated whilst Miss Alexander, at . the foot of whose bed the heart of the blaze was found, was out. She . subsequently made 'accusations of arson' against Mr Howe. He was . arrested, but later released without charge after a police officer . described his account as 'very credible'. Mr . Smyth, in the witness box, admitted his boyfriend was 'rather prone to . having hissy fits' but denied that he would have done anything to damage . the house or harm any of its occupants . 'Tony . had tantrums yes, hissy fits,' he said. 'I called them Tony Bear . tantrums - it was like watching a five-year-old stamping and shouting,' he added. 'The tantrums . varied. Sometimes it was just a moan, a complaint. On much rarer . occasions it was a full stomp the feet and shout. Generally it was a . hissy fit, not a full-on shouting match, a complaint, a bit of attention . seeking,' he went on. 'What I call a Tony Bear tantrum covered a wide spectrum from the full blown row to a little ""look at me"" attention seeking.' Defending . his boyfriend from the accusation that he would have set the house on . fire in a 'rage', Mr Smyth said: 'Tony is soft - he wouldn’t lift a . finger - it’s not in his nature.' Mr . Howe admitted that the descriptions of 'Tony Tantrums' were accurate. 'I do have other types of Tony Tantrum. I have lain on the floor in . Marks & Spencer completely sober and made everybody laugh because I . couldn’t get my own way about a bacon sandwich,' he said. Mr . Howe admitted that he had been drinking in pubs on the night of the . blaze to celebrate his birthday and was 'merry' before returning home . and rowing with Miss Alexander about the state of the kitchen. He . said that he yelled swearwords at Miss Alexander as she left the house . and that the row had been 'on the bad end of the Tony Bear tantrum . spectrum.' Judge Randall’s . ruling that Mr Howe did not set the property on fire means . St Andrew’s must honour Mr Smyth’s insurance policy and pay out for the . damage caused by the accidental blaze.","Fire started in a basement bedroom, made house uninhabitable and killed three cats in January 2008 .

Donna Sams, 31, exploited the trust of the vulnerable pensioners she cared for as she repeatedly helped herself to their cash - because she found it 'easy' to rob them. During her thieving spree, Sams tried . to gain the sympathy of her elderly clients by inventing a daughter and . saying she was saving up money to visit her. But she was unmasked as a fraud after . police found out used the stolen money to purchase a luxury holiday in . New Zealand with a luxury stopover in Sydney, Australia where it is . believed she saw Sydney Opera House. At Carlisle Crown Court Sams, of Carlisle, worked for the Bluebird Care Agency pleaded guilty to ten charges of theft. One 86-year-old woman who suffered from memory loss, diminished eyesight and poor hearing would sit chatting to Sams - not realising her carer was systematically rifling her purse for bundles of cash including £280, £150 and £80. Another victim lost £900 to Sams whilst lying seriously ill and helpless awaiting the arrival of an ambulance. Cumbria Police said she had been caught red handed after taking one vulnerable and elderly victim to the bank in a bid to withdraw thousands of pounds. Inquiries found knowing that her victim did not have the mental capacity to understand the value of the money or what she was doing with it. Following her arrest in March 2012, police worked closely with Bluebird Care Agency and Adult Social Care in order to identify additional victims and eventually uncovered evidence that proved Sams stole a total of £4,647 from six elderly people. She now faces a Proceeds of Crime hearing. After the case Detective Constable Carolyn Willacy of Cumbria Police said: 'This was a particularly difficult investigation as Sams deliberately targeted her victims by choosing the most vulnerable in our society, knowing that her victims would be unaware, too afraid, or too confused to report when money went missing. 'She was a callous, heartless individual who has shown no remorse at all and only admitted to the thefts when faced with irrefutable evidence. 'When later interviewed by police and asked why she had chosen to steal from this particularly vulnerable patient, Sams said ‘because it was easy'. 'She manipulated and deceived her employers and colleagues as well as those she was paid to care for. 'She began a web of lies to gain the sympathy and trust of her elderly clients, telling them she was saving to fly back to New Zealand to see her young daughter - the investigation proved that this daughter does not exist. 'All of the elderly victims we identified live with very few luxuries and do not have the means to replace the stolen money. 'As Sams has undermined their ability to manage their own finances, she has taken from them the little independence they had left. 'Police, along with partner agencies, are dedicated to protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities. 'We will do everything we can to keep them safe and will pursue those who target them to bring them before the courts. 'It is important that we safeguard the people in our neighbourhoods who need it most so if you have suspicions that they are being targeted by criminals, please come forward and contact police. 'In this case, a Proceeds of crime order has been made so that Cumbria Constabulary can work on the victims' behalf to get the money back that they deserve.'","Carer found it 'easy' to rob the elderly pensioners who trusted her .

These baby dwarf crocodiles are part of a record breeding programme at Britain’s only crocodile zoo. Shaun Foggett, who starred in successful television series Croc Man, is thrilled to have bred 24 dwarf caiman crocodiles with eight more to hatch any day now. At Crocodiles Of The World in Witney, Oxfordshire, Mr Foggett has no problem handling these babies but that might change when they are fully grown, up to 4.9ft long. Happy hatchings: Shaun Foggett has successfully bred 24 dwarf caiman crocodiles at the UK's only crocodile zoo . Mr Foggett, the 33-year-old owner of the zoo, tried to breed the crocodiles 12 months ago but only one dwarf caiman hatched out of 14 eggs so this time around he was thrilled with the outcome. He attributed the successful births to special vitamins he fed the newborns’ parents. He said: ‘Last year, we had one out of 14 eggs that hatched so this year has been incredibly successful. The baby crocodiles are about eight inches long and weigh about 1.5 ounces at the moment but will grow up to 4.9ft long . ‘All the babies are okay. They are doing well and swimming around. ‘They are about eight inches long and weigh about 1.5 ounces at the moment.’ The hatchings are part of the zoo’s conservation programme and its success means Mr Foggett will have to move into bigger premises in the near future to make room for the new arrivals. The breed is thought to be the most primitive of all crocodiles and originates from northern and central South America. Threats to the species include habitat destruction and pollution such as through gold mining activities. Collection for the pet trade has also reduced populations in some countries. Conservation programme: Mr Foggett tried to breed this species last year but only one of 14 eggs hatched, so this time he was very pleased with the new additions at Crocodiles of the World . Mr Foggett said: ‘We are the only crocodile zoo in the UK but a lot of what we do is about conservation work for crocodile species. ‘Probably about half will stay with us and we have had a great deal of interest from other zoos for the other half.' The eggs were removed after their two mothers buried them in dirt and bark. Mr Foggett kept them at a constant 30⁰C for 100 days until they hatched. He said: ‘They are fed on a diet on insects such as locusts and crickets but will move on to dead rodents and small chickens and rabbits.’ Five weeks ago 14 West African dwarf crocodiles were also born, making Mr Foggett the first private breeder to hatch the species. Interest from others: Half the babies will stay at the zoo in Witney, Oxfordshire while the other half will go to other zoos. Mr Foggett said he has already had a great deal of interest . The baby crocodiles will join the 12 different species of crocodiles at the zoo including an endangered 10ft Siamese crocodile and a Chinese alligator, a species with only 120 left in the wild. Mr Foggett, a married father of three, has always been fascinated by crocodiles and began keeping reptiles from the age of 15. After studying the husbandry of crocodiles, he began to keep them privately before selling his family home to build and open the zoo in February last year. Mr Foggett starred in television series Croc Man, a wildlife documentary series which followed the zoo’s opening. The series was highly successful, with a peak audience of more than one million viewers for the final episode in August 2011. The zoo is now a popular tourist attraction.","The 24 baby dwarf caiman crocodiles were born at Crocodiles of the World, Britain's only crocodile zoo .

'That was the only time he lost his sense of humour and swore. His jeans were also expensive and he was pretty upset they had to cut them off. 'But he has still got his sense of humour and smile. He is so brave and we are all really proud of him. 'It is a miracle he is still alive. We were worried sick and so thankful. The police have been fantastic. They never gave up on him.' The drama began on Tuesday evening when Mr Margrave left his home in the East Yorkshire Village of Rawcliffe Bridge on his black Yamaha, telling a friend he was going for a short ride. He was only 15 to 20 minutes into his journey when his machine left the road less than ten miles from the village.

But in fact, the gorillas seem to be simply intently watching the movements of the furry little thing - following their progress with their huge black eyes just inches from the insect. The anthropomorphic primates seem to communicate as they huddle around the caterpillar to take a look. One gorilla even bats his companion's head away from the animal - whether to get a better look or fend off greedy advances, it is not clear. Hands off!

He was forced to make an emergency landing at the bottom of a waterfall in a gorge that was 260ft deep and just 40ft wide. Scroll down for video . Daniel Hunt was visibly relieved after finally being rescued from the remote part of a gorge following a three-day hunt .

With only hours before bad weather was . due to overwhelm the remote mountain, Mr Hunt, of Shepherds Bush, was . finally spotted at 12.20pm, waving and shouting next to his SOS sign. His best friend Nadeem Al-Khafaji climbed down into the gorge and helped to winch him to safety in a private helicopter. Found: Daniel Hunt, 33, from Shepherd's Bush in west London, disappeared on Saturday . Exhausted but on his feet, Mr Hunt was . immediately taken to hospital for medical tests after enduring three . nights in freezing conditions. He is thought to have suffered a . suspected broken ankle but no other serious injury. Last night he issued a brief statement . thanking everyone who had helped to find him. It read: ‘I am so . grateful, touched and humbled by all the help. Thank you from the bottom . of my heart.’ A picture was also released showing him dishevelled but smiling and holding his arms aloft in triumph. Mr Al-Khafaji added: ‘He is good spirits and is overwhelmingly fine.’ Another close friend and fellow . adventurer, Pedro Pimentel, said: ‘This is the best day of my life. 'I . was trying to be positive but also fearing the worst.’ Mr Hunt’s long-term girlfriend Nadia . Niznanska, 28, said: ‘We are all ecstatic, relieved and overjoyed. The . nightmare is finally over.

Negligence claims: Ian and Nikki Singleton lost their twins after medics failed to spot a ruptured uterus . After losing their only son Josh at the age of 16, Ian and Nikki Singleton were desperate to build a family again. They went through 13 bouts of IVF before Mrs Singleton became pregnant again – this time with twins. But an inquest yesterday heard how the birth turned to tragedy following a string of medical failings. Mrs Singleton was rushed to hospital suffering from severe stomach pain just 30 weeks into her pregnancy. After being transferred to another hospital and enduring an agonising wait to be treated her baby boy Reuben was stillborn and his twin sister Esme died the following day. The hearing found medics had failed to spot Mrs Singleton, 49, had suffered a rupture to her uterus when she arrived at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Cardiff in July 2009. Her condition worsened as she waited two hours for a Caesarean section that resulted in Reuben being stillborn and Esme showing no signs of life. After 22 minutes of resuscitation Esme began breathing again but she had suffered such severe brain damage that the Singletons – who lost their son Josh to a brain haemorrhage – agreed to turn off her life support machine the next day. Aberdare Coroner’s Court heard midwives had ignored the warning signs of Mrs Singleton’s condition despite the fact she was in severe pain. Consultant gynaecologist Hatel Tejura said the lack of uterine activity and a foetal heartbeat should have sent alarm bells ringing then. The inquest was being held into the death of Esme only because there are no inquests into the deaths of stillborn children. It heard that when Mrs Singleton . arrived at the Royal Glamorgan a midwife could only detect one heartbeat . instead of the two there should have been. But at this point at 12.40pm medics believed she was in premature labour and had not diagnosed a ruptured uterus. There . was then a two hour delay before a Caesarean section was performed in . which time Esme is believed to have suffered severe brain damage. The hearing found medics had failed to spot Mrs Singleton, 49, had suffered a rupture to her uterus when she arrived at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Cardiff in July 2009 . Glamorgan coroner Louise Hunt recorded a narrative verdict saying:  ‘Esme was well at 12.40pm – it is most likely there was a critical event then with things changing radically but not being appreciated by the medical staff. They have acknowledged that today. ‘Because it was not appreciated that she was in serious difficulties there was a considerable delay in doing a Caesarean section. Esme was not delivered for two hours – more than enough for the damage to have been done. ‘She died from brain damage caused by the rupture which went undiagnosed in labour resulting in delay in the delivery.’ The inquest heard the local Cwm Taff Health Board had accepted failing in their standard of care and offered its apologies to the Singletons who were living near Cardiff at the time. After the hearing Mrs Singleton, who now lives in Swindon, Wiltshire said: ‘This happened three years ago but the pain is still there and will never, ever go away.’ Her husband, 50, said: ‘We feel that Esme’s death was a mixture of incompetence, negligence and a cavalier attitude.’ The couple are pursuing a legal case against the hospital for negligence.","Ian and Nikki Singleton had been through 13 bouts of IVF .

Barmy: Motorists will be fined £50 or £70 if . they park on the lines in Canterbury, Kent, which aren’t even big enough . to park a skateboard. Locals say the lines are 'ridiculous' and say its 'petty rules gone mad' Nearby homeowner Charlotte Sparrow, 26, said: 'I can’t believe the council would bother to paint yellow lines that short and then warn drivers that they face fines over for parking over something you can hardly see. 'It’s petty rules and regulations gone mad.' But Canterbury City Council, which painted the lines, said they are crucial for separating different parking areas. Bob Pollard, council street enforcement manager, said: 'The lines are in a small gap that separates the 20-minute restrictions and residents’ pay and display parking bays. Necessary? Motorist Ade Onabadejo checks that he is not parked on the new yellow lines. The council insists they are necessary as they separate the 20 minute restrictions and residents' parking bags . 'If a vehicle is parked over the yellow lines, the driver could incur one of two penalties, primarily not parking within the confines of a parking space or technically for parking in a restricted street during prescribed hours. 'The lines were placed to differentiate between the two different types of parking bay and avoid confusion. 'We would request drivers take care when parking and keep within the lines of the parking bays. By parking correctly this will prevent them receiving a penalty charge notice. 'And we would request drivers take care when parking, read the signs that apply to the parking bay and keep within the lines of the parking bays.' It's not the first time bungling council workers have painted short yellow lines. The shortest recorded yellow lines in the UK are in a street in Norwich and measure 17 inches. Meanwhile, earlier this year a motorist in Derby was stunned when he returned to his car to find double yellow lines had been painted underneath his car while it was parked - and then given a ticket. In Oxford, council workers drove residents around the bend with their double yellow lines which stretched across the road.","Motorists will be fined up to £70 if they park on the lines in Canterbury, Kent .

Saad Al-Hilli, from Surrey, was murdered in a suspected assassination while on holiday with his family in France . The British engineer murdered at an isolated Alpine beauty spot was on the verge of selling a ruined property 400 miles away across France, it emerged yesterday. Saad Al-Hilli, 50, was shot dead along with his wife, Ikbal, 47, and his mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, on September 5th. All had been on a holiday with the Al-Hilli’s two children Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, staying in their caravan by Lake Annecy, in eastern France. The Al-Hilli family were all murdered as they sat in their BMW estate, on the outskirts of the nearby village of Chevaline, while French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, died next to the car. Until now, French detectives assumed that Mr Al-Hilli’s 1 million pounds plus family home in Clayton, Surrey, was their sole residence. But Sud-Ouest (South West), the regional newspaper, tonight revealed that they also had an ancient house at Saint-Macaire, in the Gironde department, some 30 miles from Bordeaux. It is a significant find because it proves that Mr Al-Hilli had investment interests in the country where his horrific murder took place. The fact that he was involved in a property business deal will also be of great interest to investigators. Mr Al-Hilli had bought the property in the medieval village, which has a population of just over 2000 people, in the 1990s for an unknown sum, and had been seen working on it over the years. Despite this, it is today little more than an overgrown ruin, in Admiral Courbet Road, in the lower part of the hilled village. Locals told Sud Ouest that Mr Al-Hilli had been ‘planning to create a small apartment in order to rent it.’ The paper adds: ‘On a number of occasions he turned up to rebuild the floor and roof, before leaving the area without returning.’ Property: Mr Al-Hilli was on the verge of selling this ruined property in Gironde near Bordeaux . Ramshackle: Mr Al-Hilli had bought the property, little more than an overgrown ruin, in the 1990s for an unknown sum, and had been seen working on it over the years . Sud Ouest says the house has never been occupied, and is practically in the same state as when he left. ‘It seems that the owner had put it up for sale, but the deal had not been concluded,’ the paper adds, displaying a picture of the house on its website. The development came as detectives admitted they were no closer finding the killers responsible for the outrages, nor indeed the motive. No theory has been ruled out, including the possibility that Mr Al-Hilli’s past life in Iraq, where he was born, may have involved him with sinister forces. Family disputes and business conflicts are also being looked at, while detectives have not ruled out the possibility that cyclist Mr Mollier may have been the intended target of a professional ‘hit’. Claims that only one gun was used to kill everybody is likely to be disproved by full ballistics test results which are out in October.

A rare bone cribbage board played on by Viscount Nelson as he sailed to fight at Trafalgar has been discovered after lying in a dusty drawer for more than 70 years. The item had lain at the back of the jammed drawer until it was found by auctioneer Toby Jenkins in a Victorian desk worth just £30. Mr Jenkins had been given the desk to sell as part of the clearance from a small English museum. Discovery: The rare bone cribbage board had been hidden in a dusty drawer for more than 70 years . Entertainment: Admiral Nelson kept himself busy by playing the game as he sailed to fight at Trafalgar. Despite . its low value Mr Jenkins decided to smarten up the lot for auction and ensure . the desk was in working condition which meant he had to battle with one . particularly stubborn drawer. Having eased it open Mr Jenkins was amazed to discover a tiny bone cribbage scoring board with an inscription on the back. Nelson had to keep himself amused at sea . On the reverse there was a handwritten label dated around 1940s in appearance stating the name of the donor as Byron S.G Penn. Handwritten in ink next to that label were the words: 'The cribbage board used by Victory Nelson & Admiral Quilliam' Admiral John Quilliam rose quickly through the ranks before he was hand-picked by Nelson to serve under him as a first lieutenant on the famous HMS Victory. During the Battle of Trafalgar he bravely steered the Victory into action on October 21, 1805. An extract from James’s Naval History of Great Britain reads: 'Just as she (the Victory) had got about 500 yards of the larboard beam of the Bucentaure the Victory’s mizzen-topmast was shot away, about two-thirds up. 'A shot also struck and knocked to pieces the wheel; and the ship was obliged to be steered from the gun room, the first lieutenant (John Quilliam) and master (Thomas Atkinson) relieving each other at the duty.' Mr Jenkins, from Auction-Plus, Nuneaton, Warks, said what could have been just the sale of a £30 desk could now be worth thousands. A similar cribbage board with no connection to Nelson would be expected to fetch £400 - £600, but the last item of Nelson memorabilia - a quill pen and handwritten letter went for £8,500. Delicate: The rare bone cribbage board withstood the rough seas and has been out of action for 70 years . Trafalgar: The Franco-Spanish fleet lost twenty-two ships, without a single British vessel being lost. He said: “At first we thought this was . too good to be true, but after further investigation we discovered . papers in the National Archive relating to the donor’s name Byron S. G. Penn. 'His name had been applied to the piece by a museum back in the 1950s and had himself been a direct descendant of Admiral Quilliam. 'Upon the donor’s death his family had indeed donated items to the district in which the bureau had originated and from where it came to us. 'The last curator of the museum was as far as we know the first to properly catalogue the items in their possession around the late1980s. Bargain: The Victorian desk in which Toby Jenkins found the cribbage game was worth just £30 . Blast from the past: On the reverse there was a handwritten label dated around 1940s in appearance . 'The last curator of the museum was as . far as we know the first to properly catalogue the items in their . possession around the late1980s . Lucky find: auctioneer Toby Jenkins only wanted to fix the desk . 'It’s not surprising that this unique object was missed whilst cataloguing the items more recently especially as no recent staff could have had any idea that such a thing was hiding in their possession for all these years.' In cribbage players put pins in holes on the scoreboard until a target number of points is reached, typically 61 or 121. Points are scored for card combinations that add up to fifteen, and for pairs, triples, quadruples, runs, and flushes. Mr Jenkins said that at first he thought the cribbage board was just a piece of wood lodged in the drawer. He said: 'I managed to open all parts of the desk but one drawer with relative ease but could only force the last drawer to open slightly. 'I could see by torch light through a crack that there was something like a piece of wood jammed. 'Such items often have thin wood stationary dividers within them so I immediately thought it was such a piece which had become dislodged. 'With a little brute force and a screw driver together with 20 minutes or so jiggling I eventually managed to prize the drawer open.' Nelson’s and Quilliam’s cribbage board will be sold at auction with some 800 other items from the same museum on October 20 and 21. www.auction-plus.com . Cashing in: A similar, unconnected cribbage board would fetch £400- £600 but this could go for a lot more . Cribbage . is thought to have been created by the English poet Sir John Suckling . in the early 17th century, as a derivation of the game ""noddy"". Updated: Today's cribbage boards tend to be made of wood . While noddy has disappeared, cribbage has survived, virtually unchanged. Cribbage in England is primarily a . pub game and is one of the few games allowed by Statute to be played in a . public house for small stakes. Also know as 'crib', it is a card . game traditionally for two players, that involves playing and grouping . cards in combinations which gain points. A board, such as that used by Nelson, is used on which to keep score. Although Nelson's board was made of bone, today they are more commonly made on wood. The objective of the game is to be the first player to score a target number of points, typically 61 or 121. Points are scored for card combinations that add up to fifteen, and for pairs, triples, quadruples, runs, and flushes. Players choose the order in which . to lay their cards in order to maximize their score; experienced players . refer to this as either good or poor 'pegsmanship'. If one player reaches the target (usually 61 or 121), the game ends immediately and that player wins. To reach that point is known as 'to peg out', which was origin of the same phrase meaning to die.","Auctioneer wanted to get the desk in working order so he could sell it on .

The parents of a three-year-old girl whose body was found in a canal just hours after recovered wandering the streets alone have been charged with felony child neglect. Police in Dansbury, Wisconsin say the parents of Reena Mae Williams turned themselves in on Sunday, two days after a warrant was placed for their arrest in the child's death. Jenna Danish, 33, and Thomas Jay Williams, 42, face a maximum of 25 years in prison after Reena's body was found approximately 25 yards from their home last month. Tragedy: The parents of Reena Mae Williams, pictured, whose body was found in a canal last month, have been arrested and charged with felony child neglect . A complaint filed against the couple claims their drug use contributed to a pattern of neglect, with the girl found wandering from home at least six times this year. In several of the incidents police say she was found a mile and a half from home. 'That was just appalling, that she could go missing and get returned, then be missing again an hour later,' Diana Naylor told KMSP. Ms Naylor says that just two hours before a search was launched for the three-year-old she found the girl wandering 12 blocks from home. Accused: The girl's parents Jenna Danish, 33, pictured, and Thomas Jay Williams, 42, are accused of a pattern of neglect with the girl as well as drug use in their home . Grim discovery: A search party recovered the three-year-old in this canal approximately 25 yards from her home last month . She said she returned the child to her home though no one immediately answered the door when she knocked. She said Williams eventually entered the yard, appearing unconcerned that his daughter had been found so far from home. Police reported Danish later telling a friend she was asleep at the time. 'I was sick. I couldn't go to work the next day because all I could think about that day was ""What if?"" Maybe we would have called police; maybe she would have lived,' Ms Naylor told KMSP. At the time, the mother publicly thanked those who had helped find her daughter. Not the first: A neighbour of the child claims to have returned the girl to her parents just hours before she went missing after finding her wandering 12 blocks from home . Danger: Reena's home was later deemed too dangerous for a three-year-old with the property lacking fencing around the nearby water, pictured, she was tragically found in . Unsupervised: A filed complaint also claims the girl had been found wandering from home at least six times this year, in several of the incidents a mile and a half from home . 'I just wanted to thank everybody for helping out, for the generous offers, the time that they gave,' she said according to WCCO. 'That’s it. That’s all I have to say.' As police continued their investigation they would deem the couple's house too dangerous for a three-year-old, having found synthetic marijuana inside as well as no fencing around the yard's surrounding water and bed sheets covering the windows that looked out at the canal. A witness also told police that he had smoked synthetic marijuana with Williams minutes before Reena disappeared. Adding to Ms Naylor's frustration was the fact that the day after the girl’s body was found, she says she saw Danish inside a local casino drinking with friends. 'I just hope they come forward instead of running and face up to what they did,' Ms Naylor told KMSP while the warrant was still in place for the couple. 'Maybe get some help for themselves, because they obviously need it.' An autopsy is planned for the girl's body. 'Reena loved her home on the water, her family, and the color pink,' the girl's obituary read last month for her service held in Berlin, Wisconsin. It reads Reena being survived by three sisters.","The body of Reena Mae Williams, 3, was recovered hours after a neighbour said she found the girl wandering alone from home .

Beachgoers are being warned to think again before taking a plunge - after tests revealed high levels of raw sewage are spilling into the sea. Some of Brtain's most popular beaches, including Weston-Super-Mare, Exmouth and Blackpool, recorded the worst bathing water quality standards for more than a decade, according to a list obtained by The Sunday Times. All of the 26 beaches in England and Wales failed to meet even the most basic standards this summer. Always popular with tourists in the summer, high levels of pollution were even seen at Exmouth in Devon . The beach at Seaton Carew has made it onto the list for poor water quality this year . Plymouth Hoe has been affected by sewage spilling into the sea water . The results are the worst seen in ten years, despite water companies investing billions of pounds in stopping raw sewage being pumped out to sea and could spell disaster for beach towns across Britain that rely on tourism. In 2015, tougher standards are being introduced and will be partly based on this year's results. At the worst beaches, signs will go up warning people not to swim. At a conference in Blackpool on Monday, Robert Keirle, pollution programme manager for the Marine Conservation Society warned that beaches could be left deserted unless improvements were made. Mr Keirle estimated that Blackpool alone could face losing about £1billion in lost revenue over 15 years. Water companies needed to make more efforts, as well as farmers and householders to protect beaches from becoming polluted and there needs to be more information on the times of sewage overflows, added Mr Keirle. 'It is essential that all sewage overflows are mapped and monitored,' he told the conference. Tourist risk: Blackpool North and Blackpool South were both on the list . On the coast: the village of Staithes in North Yorkshire . The overflows, which operate during heavy rainfall, are one of the biggest causes of pollution flowing into the sea along Britain's coastline. They are supposed to operate only three times in one bathing season, but some resorts can have more than 100 sewage spills during a wet summer. More than 450 can also affect designated bathing areas, including 50 blue flag beaches. Steven Mogford, chief executive of United Utilities, based in the north-west, said the company was working to provide more information to the public about sewage overflows. The beach at Penzance, Cornwall, is picturesque, but the water quality for bathers is poor . Kimmeridge Bay, Dorset is another tourist hotspot, but has also been slated for poor bathing water standards . With its sweeping landscape, Mount's Bay, West Cornwall attracts plenty of visitors, but beware of the sea water . But the situation is critical for more than 40 beaches in England and Wales, which are projected to fail when the new standards are introduced in 2015. These include Rock in Cornwall, Combe Martin in north Devon and Blackpool. According to Surfers Against Sewage, the current sewer system is 'woefully inadequate' and said many overflows were not fit for purpose. But the environment department said 50% or resorts were expected to meet the standards, with 90% achieving at least the minimum.

Lord Ashdown told the Lib Dem conference he believed the British public would vote to stay in the EU . Britain is now ‘irretrievably’ on course hold a referendum on membership of the EU, Paddy Ashdown warned Nick Clegg today as the party sought to defend its pro-European credentials. Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown insisted he was a ‘passionate’ European and still hoped that Britain would one day join the euro single currency. And he revealed he had told Mr Clegg that he believed a referendum was inevitable after David Cameron wielded the British veto to block an EU treaty change in December last year. ‘We were now irretrievably on the way to a European referendum,’ Lord Ashdown said today. The admission is likely to be seized on by Eurosceptics in the Tory party who have repeatedly called for Mr Cameron to commit to holding a vote. However, Lord Ashdown beleives the British public would not vote to abandon Brussels: ‘Provided we have that referendum on in or out, it can be won.’ Lord Ashdown was speaking at a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference in Brighton, where he warned the currency crisis meant future shape of Europe was not yet clear. Critics have complained that there is no foreign affairs debate in the main conference hall, weeks after Mr Clegg gave up a ministerial role in the Foreign Office in exchange for a Lib Dem being farming minister. Lord Ashdown said: ‘I don’t think we have yet understood the terms of existence of the European Union.’ But if Britain becomes more detached politically from the continent it would be like ‘corks floating around behind other peoples ocean liners’. He predicted the Eurozone will eventually shrink, leaving just Germany, Austria, the Benelux countries, Finland and France. ‘I am a passionate European. We have to be passionate. As Europe moves, as it must, towards deeper federalism… this is a dance we have to sit aside from. 'We need to do it with apologies and regret but the Tories will do it with scorn. ‘If it should ever become in Britain’s interests to join the Europe,, I am in favour of us doing so.’","Former Lib Dem leader says David Cameron's EU veto set Britain 'irretrievably' on course for a referendum .

Controversial remarks: Business Secretary Vince Cable today used his a . speech at the Liberal Democrat conference to talk up the possibility of an alliance with the Labour party after the next election .

Mr Cable said the Lib Dems should . ‘fight the next General Election as a totally independent, national, . credible challenger for power’ but made it clear he believes they will . remain in government whoever wins the election. ‘I don’t believe tactually that the .

Instead of handing over his licence and registration to the Clay County sheriff's deputy in Florida, Michael wound down his window to explain that he was in a bind and that 'he had a squirrel eating him.' Detecting the strong smell of alcohol from Michael, the officer wrote in his report that 'I had the defendant secure the squirrel and then exit the vehicle,' after which he ran Michael through a series of tests to work out how drunk he was. Scroll Down for Video . Warren Thomas Michael was charged with Driving Under the Influence after sheriff's deputies in Florida pulled him over after they witnessed him driving erratically - he blamed his pet squirrel DUI . Initially, the deputies witnessed Michael swerving across the lanes of Highway 17 on Fleming Island, caught up to him and pulled him over to ask him for identification. Walking to the drivers side to meet Michael, the officer didn't even have the chance to him for his ID as the report states, 'Upon contact with the defendant, he immediately told me he had a squirrel eating him.'

The report from the on goes on to say, that 'After some discussion about the squirrel I introduced myself and explained the reason for the stop.' After Michael left the car, he was put through his paces on several field sobriety tests, failing all of them. According to the arrest report, he could not divide his attention between looking for the items that the officer needed such as ID and answering questions about his name and birth date. 'I believed the defendant was impaired,' indicates the Clay County deputy's report. 'I had the defendant secure the squirrel and then exit his vehicle. 'I had the defendant stand behind his vehicle while I checked his information through NCIC. 'I watched the defendant as he had a slight sway while standing without holding onto anything.' Alexandra Rock (left) told the arresting deputy that she has problems controlling her boyfriend Warren Thomas Michael when he has been drinking . When Michael had failed his sobriety tests he was breathalysed, registering samples of .145 and .156, which is nearly twice Florida's legal limit to drive of .08. After Michael was informed he was going to be arrested for Driving Under the Influence by the officer, he was allowed to call his girlfriend, Alexandra Rock who arrived on the scene to berate her boyfriend and pick up their squirrel, who they have now named DUI.

'The police officer considered calling animal control,' said Michael to News4Jax.

Controversial: Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge has said furious householders have the right to get rid of burglars in their homes . Frightened and furious householders have the right to get rid of burglars in their homes, the most senior judge in England and Wales said today. Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge made the controversial comments after Michael Pert QC said yesterday that being shot by homeowners was simply a chance that burglars took. The top judge said: 'If your home is burgled and you’re in there, you have the right to get rid of the burglar'. Jailing burglars Joshua O’Gorman and Daniel Mansell for four years each, judge Pert had told Leicester Crown Court: 'I make it plain that, in my judgment, being shot is not mitigation. 'If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally held shotgun, that is the chance you take. 'You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.' Asked about the comments at the Royal Courts of Justice in central London today, Lord Judge said: 'I take a very serious view about an offence of burglary. 'Burglary of a home, whether it’s a grand mansion or a very modest one up one down, is always an offence against property, but more importantly it is an offence against the person. 'The householder is entitled to use reasonable force to get rid of the burglar.' The Lord Chief Justice admitted that 'occasionally it looks as if the householder is the criminal', but said: 'Well, the householder is not in a position to exercise calm, cool, judgment. 'You’re not calmly detached, you’re probably very cross and you’re probably very frightened, a mixture of both. 'And your judgment of precisely what you should or should not do in the circumstances cannot - as another predecessor of mine said, Lord Lane - you can’t measure it in a jeweller’s scale. Burglars: Joshua O'Gorman, left, and Daniel Mansell, right, who were . both jailed this week after they were shot by the owner of the house they . were trying to steal from . 'You have to face the reality of how people are and how people react to these situations, and justifiably react.' Andy Ferrie and his wife Tracey: Both were held for 40 hours after Mr Ferrie shot two burglars with a shotgun as they tried to raid his country home . Lord Judge went on: 'In measuring whether the force is reasonable or not, you’re not doing a paper exercise six months later. 'You’ve got to put yourself in the position of the man or woman who has reacted to the presence of a burglar and has reacted with fury, with anxiety, with fear and with all the various different emotions which have been generated and has no time for calm reflection.' Lord Judge said it was 'not a matter of being sentimental'. 'It’s a matter of how people feel,' he said. 'When you’re at home you want to feel safe, and in my view you’re entitled to feel safe and secure. This is your haven, this is your refuge, this is where you have the right to be safe. 'The burglar takes your property, but even if you’re not at home when he takes very little property there is a sense of violation and it destroys peace of mind - and if your peace of mind in your home is destroyed you have lost something immensely precious. Now that’s why burglary’s always serious.' He added: 'A predecessor of mine 400 years ago who said, ‘Your home is your castle’. That’s what he is reflecting on. This is the place where you pull up the drawbridge and the moat makes you safe. 'Your home is your safe place, so burglary is always serious.' O’Gorman, 27, and Mansell, 33, who have a string of convictions between them, were blasted with a legally-owned shotgun by Andy Ferrie as they attempted to ransack his isolated farm cottage in the early hours of September 2. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said the . Ferries were woken by the sound of breaking glass as the raiders forced . their way into their home with a garden fork handle. Shooting: The farmhouse in Welby, Melton Mowbray, where Mr Ferrie tried to defend his home from intruders . As they made their way downstairs, Tracey . Ferrie, the registered keeper of the shotgun, handed the weapon to her . husband. Mr Murphy said: ‘Mr Ferrie described seeing three men in the . hall or kitchen wearing some form of face coverings. ‘One of the men was reaching into a drawer that held a number of knives. As a result Mr Ferrie fired his shotgun.’ O’Gorman, who was shot in the face, . and Mansell, who was hit in his right hand, had pleaded guilty to the . break-in in Welby, near Melton Mowbray, at an earlier hearing.

The pair were about to begin their meal when Tracy's 22-year-old daughter screamed at the sight of the huge toenail sticking out of the family dinner. Mrs Arnold said she was completely shocked by the 'disgusting' discovery, which she had initially thought was a piece of gristle. She quickly realised the foul object was a toenail that had either came from the pasta sauce or from a packet of minced beef she had bought from an Aldi store that morning. She said: 'It was the most disgusting thing I have ever found in food in my life. It was huge, it looked like it had been cut.' Huge: The man's toenail that Tracy found in her food was more than 1cm long . The next day she took the toenail back to the supermarket in Wisbech where staff were shocked by her discovery.

A woman’s teenage lover murdered her severely disabled toddler while she was on the school run. She then desperately tried to cover up their affair with the boy, ten years his senior. Cameron Rose, 18, is alleged to have swung epileptic three-year-old Rhys Lawrie by his right leg into a hard object, causing massive head injuries, jurors at Old Bailey heard. Tragic: Three-year-old Rhys Lawrie, who was killed at his home in Eltham, south east London . The court heard how Rose had allegedly attacked the boy two times before the fatal attack while Sadie Henry, Rhys’ mother lied repeatedly to paramedics and police to try to cover up the relationship because she realised it was ‘ill-advised and inappropriate’. Rose of Eltham, southeast London claimed the injuries were caused by accidental falls and Rhys knocked himself during epileptic seizures the court heard. Rose is accused of beating Rhys four days before he died, and on another occasion in December 2010. Miss Henry was 26-years-old when she began her relationship with Rose, when he was just 16-years-old. Sally Howes QC, prosecuting, said: ‘While it is not illegal for a woman to have a sexual relationship with a 16-year old it may be considered by many to be a the very least ill-advised and inappropriate. ‘The apparent need to conceal the truth of the relationship between Sadie Henry and Cameron Rose forms the backdrop of the police investigation into the death of Rhys Lawrie. ‘Sadie Henry lied repeatedly to paramedics, hospital staff and unfortunately to the police in an effort to hide the true events and circumstances surrounding the death of Rhys and two earlier episodes of assault.’ A post-mortem examination found Rhys had suffered serious head injuries three to five days before death, and on the day he died. Rhys' mother Sadie Henry, left, lied repeatedly to paramedics and police to try to cover up the relationship with Cameron Rose, right, because she realised it was 'ill-advised and inappropriate' He also had extensive, fingertip-sized bruising to his face, ears, body and both legs and his right leg was fractured. Forensic expert Doctor Nathaniel Cary found that the injuries were ‘atypical for accidental origin’ and were ‘indicative of multiple blunt force impacts and or gripping to the facial area’. It is alleged that the tibia fracture was caused by Rhys being swung by his ankle. Sally Howes, prosecuting said that Dr Cary suggested that ‘the fatal head injury arose from Rhys Lawrie being forcibly swung from the right leg causing an impact to his head or face’. Rhys suffered from a severe epileptic condition and had to go a special school because he was barely able to walk. Miss Henry, a former army medic, met Rose in 2010 at a bonfire party and the pair kept their sexual relationship secret from his mother, who thought he was staying with his brother when he was at Miss Henry’s flat. Rose would stay with her from Thursday to Monday over most weekends and had only been left alone with Rhys for long periods three times. Sadie Henry desperately administered CPR and called the emergency services but nothing could be done to save Rhys . Miss Howes told the jury: ‘This is a man who, on the three occasions when he was alone with this child, this child ended up with injuries, and on the last occasion fatal injuries.’ On the first occasion Rhys was injured, nursery staff noticed that he had severe bruising on his face and was ‘wobbly’ in his chair in December 2010. When the nursery contacted Miss Henry about the bruises, Miss Howes said: ‘She gave the explanation that Rhys had been falling down quite a lot at that stage.' The mother later told police that Rose told her he had been playing a game with Rhys and he had fallen off the table. She did not suspect him because Rose had been so ‘calm and collected’ when he gave the explanation. On the second occasion, Rose claimed he had accidentally elbowed Rhys in the face while in bed. The toddler then fell off a kitchen counter as Rose bent down to the freezer to get something cold to hold against his face, he said. Miss Howes told the jury: ‘When she (Miss Henry) returned Cameron Rose met her in the corridor of the flat saying she was stupid to leave Rhys in bed with him as he had elbowed Rhys quite hard in his sleep.’ The boy’s face was so badly swollen that Miss Henry called an ambulance and said her son had suffered two fits because she knew he would have to be taken to hospital. Rhys was likely to have suffered brain damage in this incident and the injury could have caused ‘confusion and even unconsciousness’ but he was sent home after treatment. Four days later, Miss Henry left Rhys alone with Rose again. When she returned, Miss Henry asked Rose about Rhys’ whereabouts. Miss Howes said: ‘Cameron Rose responded that Rhys was in bed as he had a seizure. ‘He said he had choked and he had to bang him on the back quite hard.‘Cameron Rose added Rhys’ eyes were rolling and he had foamed at the mouth. ‘Sadie Henry went to the bedroom. Rhys was under the bedclothes. He looked blue in colour. She was later to tell police: “I knew Rhys was dead when I saw him”.’ The mother desperately administered CPR and called the emergency services but nothing could be done to save Rhys. After Rhys died, Rose told police he did not get on with Miss Henry’s older child, identified only as B, because he had hit him in the face once and he held ‘grudges’ but he claimed he got on well with Rhys. Rose denies murder and causing Rhys actual bodily harm. Miss Henry met the toddler’s father, Chris Lawrie, who was also in the Armed Forces, in 2003. Miss Henry left the forces shortly after she had Rhys and after her relationship with Mr Lawrie failed, she moved into a flat in Erith, south east London. The trial was adjourned until next Tuesday.

A retired policeman is back behind the wheel of his old patrol car - almost 40 years since they last cruised the streets together. Ex-constable Tony Peters, 67, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was stunned when he saw the Ford Cortina Mark II Lotus police car while flicking through an edition of Classic Cars on holiday last year. The limited edition high-performance vehicle was once the enemy of many a villain on the Mid-Anglia police force patch four decades ago. Reunited: Former constable Tony Peters, 67, with the Ford Cortina Lotus Mark II he last drove in the 1970s . Tony instantly recognised the picture of himself and colleague PC John Cooper standing next their old friend 'Tango 8 in 1972. The pair used to patrol the county together in much the same way as officers in the popular 1960s TV show Z-Cars. Now, 40 years after they were snapped, Tony has been reunited with the cult car. The former bobby last drove his beloved souped-up squad car in 1974 before it was sold at auction for £300. The 1970 Cortina, which packed a 1600cc, 109bhp Lotus engine, finally emerged from under a dust cover in 2006. Car enthusiast Steve 'Ozzy' Osborne bought the exclusive motor, which could hit 108mph, for just £500 intending to use only its engine and sell the rest for scrap. Nostalgia: Tony Peters, left, snapped with the Ford Cortina alongside his colleague John Cooper back in 1972 . But Ozzy changed his mind after researching the car's history and decided to restore the rare vehicle - thought to be one of just two ever made for the police. Tony said this particular Cortina Lotus was built specially for the police and could out-perform other traffic motors at the time by more than 20mph. 'Ford made us the four-door version of the car because we couldn't ask criminals to climb over the front seats,' he said. 'It had a sports engine in a normal car and could do 0-60mph in nine seconds. I suppose for police cars these days it's more like five.' Tony joined the force in 1962 and transferred to the traffic unit in 1970, where he stayed until he left in 1994. The picture was taken by a Crime Scenes Investigation officer at the scene of a fatal accident on the A604 between Spalding and Bythorn, he said. 'I hadn't seen the image before I saw it in the magazine because I forgot to pick it up,' he said. Z-Cars: Tony patrolled the streets in his Ford Cortina in much the same way as the cult TV show. Donald Gee, left, plays PC Ray Walker and Geoffrey Whitehead, right, plays PC Ken Baker in an episode from 1965 . OverviewThe Mark II version of Ford's Cortina was Britain's most popular new car of 1967.Tony's patrol car was a version of the most sough-after model - the Lotus 1600E.Number produced: 1,159,389 units0-60mph: 15.1secsTop speed: 87mphPower: 58bhp Torque: 71lb/ftLength: 4267mmWheelbase: 2490mmWidth: 1650mmHeight: 1440mmWeight: 875kgs . The glamorous and highly sought-after Ford has been on show at Cambridgeshire Police HQ in Hinchingbrooke. 'Seeing the car again was brilliant,' said Tony. 'Ozzy has done a really good job at getting it back into its former state. I got to drive it again. It didn't feel exactly the same as it did all those years ago but I'm so glad that it was saved from the scrapyard. 'It brought back many flashbacks of running blood samples and transplant organs to Papworth Hospital. 'We could get there about five minutes quicker than any other squad car. But . seeing the old car next to the current police fleet of Audi 7 series . shows just how much technology and motoring has changed over the years.' The . Cortina Lotus is now worth more than £16,000 and Ozzy hopes to restage . the 40-year-old photo of Tony and PC Cooper with their old motor at the . same spot. The . ex-police car's story will be completed when it meets its sister - . which is close to being fully restored by a Ford mechanic in Kent.","Retired constable Tony Peters, 67, saw a picture of himself with his former patrol car from 1972 in an edition of Classic Cars magazine .

Derek Ramsden, 81, was holidaying in Wales with his wife Ada, 71 and his two dogs Bruno, an 18-year-old Staffie Cross and Toby - a seven-year-old Lhasa Apso. He was walking the dogs when he slipped and fell from a small ridge. While Bruno simply walked away, Toby ran for a quarter of a mile to alert staff at the Brynowen Holiday Park in Borth, Aberystwyth to his master’s plight. Derek, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: 'I managed to get hold of a railing on the bridge. It was frightening. I could not get out and you can’t hold your grip for long at my age. 'I don’t like to think what would have happened if not for Toby. He definitely saved my life. 'Toby had barked anxiously at the staff. They must have known there was a problem and followed him back to me. Toby led the way and kept stopping for his helpers to catch up. 'Toby is dedicated to both of us and I think he is a hero, I was surprised because he doesn’t normally make friends and he had already barked at the staff when we walked past them. 'He’s my very own Lassie. He saved my life and I’m very grateful.' Ada said her husband had been missing an hour and she grew concerned and set off in search of him. 'My very own Lassie': Derek was suprised by Toby's quick thinking, saying the seven-year-old Lhasa Apso 'doesn't normally make friends' She then came across him and the park staff who had pulled him to safety. 'He was covered in mud from head to foot. If he had let go he could have slipped down further. Toby saved him,' she said. Derek suffered bruising to his back. Park maintenance manager Ben Thompson had earlier seen Derek and the dogs setting off and told how he and his colleague Martin Riley came to the rescue.

Secret celebrity crushes are a secret no more after a new survey revealed the nation's most coveted fancies. Topping the list for the men were the formidable Dragon's Den star Deborah Meadon, followed by Vicar Of Dibley star Dawn French, with Princess Beatrice third and Former This Morning host Fern Britton fourth. Curvy Ex-EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy came fifth and as for the women, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, funny men James Corden and David Mitchell topped the polls. Dragon's Den star Deborah Meaden and TV funny woman Dawn French topped the list as men's secret celebrity guilty pleasure . Controversial television host Piers Morgan was fourth and Eddie Izzard was fifth. Yesterday, a spokesman for Iphone app Celebalike, who carried out the research, said: 'We're flooded with images of people that conform to traditional ""Hollywood"" notions of beauty, but it isn't always about looks. 'The results show many Brits have a secret celebrity crush that they would be less keen to voice or feel others wouldn't agree with them about. 'That shows that there's more to attraction and it seems a strong personality or authority plays a part, with Deborah Meaden and Gordon Ramsay proving popular.' The Celebalike app works using a complex algorithm through a computer program that performs high-performance face identification and facial feature recognition. And it means men may be able to find their own Deborah Meaden - the dragon has been matched nearly 80,000 times since the app launched. As for the women, it was celebrity foul-mouthed chef Gordon Ramsay who took the crown and James Corden was also a favourite . While, according to the app results, there are also 73,527 James Corden look-alikes out there and 24,444 Piers Morgan doppelgangers. Three quarters of Brits admit that they are attracted to a celebrity that wouldn't really be classed as good-looking in the traditional sense. And six in ten people have a crush on a celebrity that they think other people wouldn't be able to understand. In fact, a quarter of Brits have been attracted to a celebrity without really knowing what it is about them that they like so much. Of course the Brads and Angelinas of this world are always going to be held up as sex symbols, but many people have a soft spot for people who don't conform to the traditional stereotypes, said a spokesperson . The Celebalike spokesman added: 'Of course the Brads and Angelinas of this world are always going to be held up as sex symbols, but many people have a soft spot for people who don't conform to the traditional stereotypes. 'It's reassuring to see that we aren't always consumed by the perfect images of celebrity and that those people that are a bit more 'real' are still able to win our hearts. 'Unfortunately for most of us, we can't emulate the standard of beauty shown to us in the media, but the celebrities on this list are a lot more down to earth in their appearance, and that's reflected by the number of Celebalike matches people like Deborah Meaden have.' 1.             Deborah Meaden . 2.             Dawn French . 3.             Princess Beatrice . 4.             Fern Britton . 5.             Natalie Cassidy . 6.             Anne Robinson . 7.             Delia Smith . 8.             Ann Widdecombe . 9.             Camilla Parker Bowles . 10.          Susan Boyle . 1.             Gordon Ramsay . 2.             James Corden . 3.             David Mitchell . 4.             Piers Morgan . 5.             Eddie Izzard . 6.             James May . 7.             Rupert Grint . 8.             Chris Moyles . 9.             Boris Johnson . 10.          Justin Lee Collins .","Secret celebrity crushes revealed with three quarters of Brits admitting they're attracted to non-traditionally good looking celebrities .
