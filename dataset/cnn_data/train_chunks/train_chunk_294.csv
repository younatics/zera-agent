"(CNN) -- Arizona's immigration law, Senate Bill 1070, has generated a lot of ink recently, especially with a court ruling last week that allowed a controversial provision that in my view will result in racial profiling to move forward. The law's goal is chilling: ramp up deportations of undocumented people by forcing local police into the difficult role of immigration agents. And with last week's ruling, police are now required to go out of their way to investigate the immigration status of everyone they ""suspect"" might be undocumented whom they arrest or stop. In practice, that will mean targeting people just for the way they look or speak, separating families, and trapping undocumented people in local jails for minor infractions to await deportation. As an undocumented American -- and I am, in my heart, an American -- it is my hope that our nation doesn't follow Arizona's discriminatory example. Will Arizona become the norm, or can we work as a nation to fix dysfunctional immigration policies so that they reflect our best values as Americans? All eyes are now on California for a key part of the answer. Sitting on the Gov. Jerry Brown's desk is the most important piece of legislation for immigrant communities this year. By signing the bill, called the TRUST Act, Brown can prevent the separation of thousands of families, establish an alternative to Arizona's approach and send a powerful message to the nation: In a state built and replenished by generations of immigrants, fairness and equality matter. Under the TRUST Act, local law enforcement would only be able to hold people for extra time, for deportation purposes, if the person has been convicted of, or charged with, a serious or violent felony. With the TRUST Act, Juana Reyes, the ""tamale lady,"" never would have been stuck in Sacramento County Jail for 13 days on an immigration hold after the most absurd of arrests. With the TRUST Act, Reyes' children wouldn't have spent weeks worrying if they would ever see their mother again. She's still undocumented. If Brown signs the bill, he will bring hope to millions of undocumented Americans like me, and some relief to our family members who fear that if we are arrested for even the most trivial of charges, they will never see us again. Undocumented people and their allies -- their relatives and friends, their neighbors and co-workers -- have created a new political climate in which the passage of the TRUST Act is not simply the right thing to do, but the politically strategic thing to do, with supporters from across the political spectrum, from Nancy Pelosi to right-leaning think tanks such as the Cato Institute and Competitive Enterprise Institute. The enactment of TRUST would also help turn the page on a painful era of our state's history that the implementation of the Arizona law evokes. A year after I arrived in this country at the age of 12, four years before I knew about my own undocumented status, I watched with anxiety as California voters passed Proposition 187. That ballot initiative, in many ways, was the precursor to SB 1070 and House Bill 56, Arizona's and Alabama's ""show-me-your-papers"" laws, respectively. Although courts would ultimately reject Proposition 187, fear immediately gripped immigrants in California upon its passage in 1994. The specter of local police acting as immigration agents was one of the measure's most unsettling provisions. And despite how much California has changed in nearly two decades, the federal Secure Communities deportation program, which was supposed to target people ""convicted of serious criminal offenses,"" has instead effectively done what Proposition 187's backers tried to do -- turn local law enforcement into de facto immigration authorities. What if while driving from my alma mater, San Francisco State University, down to my hometown of Mountain View, I were stopped for the most minor traffic infraction? Or, perhaps, simply profiled? I could be detained for driving without a valid license. Then, under ""Secure Communities,"" my fingerprints would be sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement no matter how minor the charge. ICE would then ask the jail to hold me for extra time, at local expense, until it came to pick me up for deportation as my grandmother, a naturalized American citizen, waited for me at home in Mountain View. This is essentially what's happened to about 80,000 Californians who have quietly been torn from their families under the ridiculously named federal deportation program, ""Secure Communities."" Seven out of 10 people detained nationally under Secure Communities either had no convictions or committed minor offenses, according to ICE statistics. And even though top law professors have confirmed that requests to detain immigrants for additional time are ""optional,"" many California jurisdictions have submitted, no matter the damage done to community-police relations. Enter the TRUST Act, which limits responses to ICE's requests to detain people in local jails for additional time for deportation purposes. It should not be lost on anyone that the bill's author is Democratic Assemblyman Tom Ammiano, who was San Francisco's first openly gay teacher. Ammiano fought for equality alongside Harvey Milk in the 1970s. As a gay man myself, I see many parallels in the history of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and immigrant communities' fights for inclusion. Brown's signing of the TRUST Act would be a watershed moment in the long journey toward permanent reform to recognize our common humanity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jose Antonio Vargas.","Jose Antonio Vargas: Law awaiting Gov. Jerry Brown's action important for immigrants .

"(CNN) -- In Monday's foreign policy debate, President Barack Obama said former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney had criticized his administration for being too tough against China and bringing a protectionist case at the World Trade Organization. The statement: Obama cited a case in which the Chinese ""were flooding us"" with cheap tires. ""And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Gov. Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn't be good for American workers and that it would be protectionist,"" Obama said. CNN Fact Check: Romney, Obama and Iraq . The facts: In 2009, the Obama administration sought tariffs against China for dumping tires into the United States. The World Trade Organization upheld the tariffs. On its website, Romney's campaign cites where the Republican candidate addressed the case in his 2010 book ""No Apology."" ""President Obama's action to defend American tire companies from foreign competition may make good politics by repaying unions for their support of his campaign, but it is decidedly bad for the nation and our workers,"" Romney said. ""Protectionism stifles productivity."" The result was indeed inherently protectionist, according to Douglas Paal, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""It means it will raise prices for American consumers on tires, both domestic and imported,"" Paal said. But the case was a minor one in the overall scheme of things, he added. Both sides have engaged in such symbolic activity, ""but neither is willing to take action that would seriously affect economic relations between our two economies,"" he added. CNN Fact Check: Comparing costs of Iraq, Libya missions . The subject of China has been raised over and over during the campaign, with each candidate accusing the Chinese of stealing American jobs through unfair trade practices. In broad terms, both men offered similar views, even using some of the same language: . ""China is both an adversary, but also a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules,"" Obama said. ""So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else."" ""They're making some progress; they need to make more,"" said Romney, who vowed to label China a currency manipulator on his first day as president. ""They have to understand we want to trade with them. We want a world that's stable. We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."" First, has China really stolen U.S. jobs? The numbers say yes. Since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, the U.S. trade deficit with China ""eliminated or displaced more than 2.7 million U.S. jobs,"" according to a report published in August by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. The primary category from which jobs have been lost has been in the manufacturing sector. The candidates have complained because, while the United States allows the free market, in large part, to dictate how much a dollar is worth and how much people will be paid in the United States, China uses its power to keep wages low. CNN Fact Check: Obama's apology tour? So, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics says the average employer has to pay about $35 per hour in salary and benefits to hire a worker on a production line, a Chinese factory pays only about $1.36 per hour for the same work. In response, many companies have moved jobs to China to take advantage of the lower wages. Consequently, Chinese products tend to be cheaper to buy all over the world. The result has been that Chinese exports to the United States have soared in recent years, while U.S. exports to China have lagged far behind. What can a U.S. president do about that? Probably not much. If the United States were to raise trade barriers, China could do the same. If the United States were to forbid U.S.-based companies from shipping jobs to China, that might leave U.S. companies less competitive in the world market. And if China were to say it is no longer interested in buying U.S. debt, that could make it harder for the U.S. government to borrow the money it needs to operate. The conclusion: In the tire case above, Obama is correct in his characterization of Romney's position. In the larger case of what to do about U.S.-China relations, both candidates have promised to get tough. But that will hardly be the last word.

"(CNN) -- Katherine Webb says she's flattered that broadcaster Brent Musburger gushed about her beauty during live coverage of the college football championship -- and she's taken aback by a backlash against him. Webb -- girlfriend of Alabama's starting quarterback and subject of Musburger's on-air fawning during the Crimson Tide's 42-14 thrashing of Notre Dame on Monday night -- told NBC's ""Today"" that Musburger is getting a bum rap. ""I think the media has been really unfair to him,"" she told the NBC show on Wednesday morning. ""If he would have said something along the lines of that we were hot or sexy, or made any derogatory statements like that, that would have been different. ""But the fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous, I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that. I think they've been a little bit unfair to him, and so I don't take any offense to it at all."" During Monday's game, an ESPN camera focused on Webb, a former Miss Alabama USA who is dating Crimson Tide quarterback AJ McCarron. She was in the stands, sitting next to McCarron's mother -- and Musburger's river of compliments began. ""Now when you are a quarterback at Alabama, you see that lovely lady there, she does go to Auburn, I want to admit that, but she's also Miss Alabama and that's AJ McCarron's girlfriend, OK?"" the ESPN play-by-play man said. ""Wow, I'm telling you, quarterbacks -- you get all the good-looking women. What a beautiful woman,"" Musburger continued. ""Whoa! If you're a youngster at Alabama, start getting the football out and throw it around the back yard with pops."" Opinion: Give Musburger a break . In the middle of that, Musburger's broadcasting partner, Kirk Herbstreit, added: ""Wow! AJ is doing some things right down in Tuscaloosa."" The 73-year-old Musburger attracted some derision on social media, with some Twitter posters calling his comments ""creepy."" On Tuesday, ESPN said ""We apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far, and Brent understands that."" Webb told ""Today"" she's flattered by the attention -- her Twitter following rose from 526 on December 26 to more than 233,000 on Wednesday, according to the stats site TwitterCounter.com. Is Alabama college football's new dynasty? Webb, a 2011 Auburn University graduate, said it took her a while to find out what was happening, because her phone had stopped working before the game. ""During the game, a few of my friends sitting beside me kind of turned around and were like, 'Oh my gosh, Katherine, look what's on the Internet,' "" she told ""Today."" But she said that attention needs to start swinging back to Alabama's football team, which won its third national title in four years. ""I think that we need to draw back our attention to who the real winners are, and that's that Alabama football team,"" she told ""Today."" ""They've spent so long getting ready for this season."" Another woman whom Musburger helped lift to fame -- Jenn Sterger, subject of the sportscaster's on-air compliments more than seven years ago -- told CNN Wednesday that Musburger is a great guy who just comments on what his producers give him. Sterger was one of three scantily clad football fans whom ABC showed during a broadcast of a Florida State football game in 2005. At that moment, Musburger said that ""1,500 red-blooded Americans just decided to apply"" to the school. Sterger went on to appear in Playboy and Maxim, and took a job as stadium host for New York Jets football games. Later, quarterback Brett Favre got in trouble for sending her lurid messages while he was a Jets player. ""I think (Musburger) is a really great guy,"" Sterger told CNN's ""Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien"" on Wednesday. ""Maybe he went a little bit overboard (on Monday) and got carried away, but what else was he supposed to be talking about? Did you see the score of that game?"" Would she give any advice to Webb? ""Everybody walks different. It's not my place or anyone else's place to make a decision what she's going to do with it,"" Sterger said. ""I think she's got a great head on her shoulders. ... It's her journey. ""Embrace it and have fun along the way. Don't get too wrapped up in it."" CNN's Michael Pearson and Soledad O'Brien contributed to this report.","Alabama quarterback's girlfriend tells NBC's ""Today"" says she's flattered by attention .

"Dallas (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has delayed the scheduled execution on an inmate on death row in Texas amid questions about a psychologist who testified that blacks and Hispanics were more likely to commit future crimes. Duane Edward Buck already had eaten a final meal of fried chicken, fried fish, french fries, salad, jalapeno peppers and apples when news came of the court's decision on Thursday evening, Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark said. ""Praise the Lord Jesus,"" Clark quoted the condemned man as saying. ""God is worthy to be praised. God's mercy triumphs over judgment, and I feel good."" Buck had been set to die by lethal injection, but the court delayed the execution to give it time to review the way a lower court handled the case. While that happens, Buck remains on death row. Buck was convicted of the 1995 killings of Debra Gardner and Kenneth Butler. According to Texas officials, Buck shot Gardner in front of her daughter, who begged for her mother's life. A third person, Phyllis Taylor, was shot, but she sought clemency for Buck this week. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, however, recommended against granting Buck clemency . Buck's attorney, Katherine C. Black, said the recommendation, ""fails to recognize what the highest legal officer in the state of Texas has acknowledged: No one should be executed based on a process tainted by considerations of race."" Black is referring to U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who was the state's attorney general in 2000, when he spoke of seven death row inmates, including Buck. Cornyn said he believed the inmates had been unfairly sentenced to death based on testimony that was racially tainted by psychologist Walter Quijano, who repeatedly told juries that black or Hispanic defendants were more likely to commit future crimes. Because of that testimony, six of those seven inmates were granted resentencing trials. Buck, who is black, was not among them. ""We want to make sure people aren't executed based on the color of their skin,"" Black said. On Monday, Linda Geffin, a former Harris County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Buck, joined Taylor in calling for Buck's execution to be stopped. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Buck eats what might have been his final meal when he learned of the stay .

"Jackson, Georgia (CNN) -- Troy Davis, whose case drew international attention, was put to death by lethal injection for the 1989 killing of an off-duty police officer in Savannah, Georgia, prison officials announced Wednesday night. Davis was defiant to the very end. After he was strapped to the death gurney, he lifted his head to address the family of the slain officer. He told the family of Mark MacPhail that he was not responsible for the officer's death and did not have a gun at the time, according to execution witnesses. Davis said the case merited further investigation, talking fast as officials prepared to give him the lethal cocktail. The execution followed the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of a stay, allowing the state to proceed. Davis was declared dead at 11:08 p.m. ET. Throughout the day, Davis' lawyers and high-profile supporters had asked the state and various courts to intervene, arguing he did not murder MacPhail in 1989. Davis initially had been scheduled to die by lethal injection at 7 p.m. ET. But the proceeding was delayed more than three hours as the justices pondered a plea filed by his attorney. Several hundred people, most of them opposing the proceeding, gathered outside the state prison in Jackson where Davis, 42, awaited his fate. Others held a vigil in a nearby church. The inmate's sister, Martina Davis-Correia, was among those who held a vigil outside the prison. Before the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, she said officials needed to take more time to examine the case. ""When you are looking at someone's life, you can't press rewind."" More than 100 officers, many in riot gear, stood guard over the largely-quiet gathering, which featured candles, occasional prayers and songs. At least three people who crossed the street had been taken away in handcuffs. ""Tonight the state of Georgia legally lynched an innocent man,"" Davis' lawyer Thomas Ruffin Jr. said. ""Tonight I witnessed something tragic."" Davis' supporters, who also rallied outside the U.S. Supreme Court building, argued that his conviction was based on the testimony of numerous witnesses who had recanted, including a jailhouse informer who claimed Davis had confessed. ""There's a genuine feeling among people here and across the nation that we're about to do the unthinkable,"" said Isaac Newton Farris Jr., president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. But prosecutors have stood by the conviction, and every appeal -- including the last-minute petitions filed Wednesday -- has failed. Davis's supporters cheered and hugged each other when news of the earlier delay reached them. But it did not sit well with McPhail's mother, who remained at home. ""This delay again is very upsetting and I think really unfair to us, because we want this situation closed,"" the slain officer's mother, Anneliese MacPhail, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" earlier in the evening. She said the execution would bring her ""relief and maybe some peace."" Davis' attorneys started the day by asking a judge in Jackson, where Georgia's death row is located, to halt the proceeding, citing a new analysis they say shows ballistics testimony at his trial was ""inaccurate and misleading."" They also note that a federal judge found in 2010 that a jailhouse informer's testimony that Davis confessed to killing MacPhail was ""patently false"" and that prosecutors knew a key eyewitness account was wrong. ""Clearly, the fact that Mr. Davis's death sentence rests in part on 'patently false' and egregiously inaccurate and misleading testimony, evidence and argument renders the death sentence fundamentally unfair, unreliable and therefore violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments,"" his attorneys argued in a motion filed Wednesday morning. That appeal was denied Wednesday afternoon. The state Supreme Court followed suit a short time later, leading his attorneys to turn to the U.S. Supreme Court in the final hour before the execution. Davis has been scheduled to die three times before, most recently in October 2008. That time, the U.S. Supreme Court halted the execution two hours before it was scheduled to take place. This time, Davis declined to request the special last meal offered inmates prior to execution and was offered a standard meal tray: Grilled cheeseburgers, oven-browned potatoes, baked beans, coleslaw, cookies and a grape drink. ""He has continued to insist this is not his last meal,"" said the Rev. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. Pope Benedict XVI, South African anti-apartheid leader Desmond Tutu and former President Jimmy Carter said the execution should have been called off. Amnesty International and the NAACP led efforts to exonerate Davis, and U.N. human rights officials joined those calls Wednesday. ""Not only do we urgently appeal to the government of the United States and the state of Georgia to find a way to stop the scheduled execution, but we believe that serious consideration should be given to commuting the sentence,"" read a joint statement from the U.N. special rapporteurs on arbitrary executions, judicial independence and torture. But the man who originally prosecuted the case, Spencer Lawton, said those who do not believe there is physical evidence in the case are wrong. ""There are two Troy Davis cases,"" Lawton said Tuesday. ""There is the legal case and the public relations case. We have consistently won in court, and consistently lost in the public relations battle."" Since Davis' 1991 trial, seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted or contradicted their testimony. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered a district court in Savannah to review his claims of innocence in 2009, but District Judge William Moore ruled the following year that the evidence did ""not require the reversal of the jury's judgment."" The parole board rejected a plea for clemency on Tuesday. In Georgia, only the board -- not the governor -- has the right to grant clemency. And a request that Davis be allowed to sit for a polygraph by his attorneys was also rejected by the state Department of Corrections. Davis' supporters argue he was the victim of a rush to judgment by police seeking justice for the death of one of their own, as well as widespread racial prejudice in the criminal justice system. Warnock noted to CNN that several other inmates have been proven innocent in recent years. Supporters argued that the original witnesses who testified against Davis were fearful of police and spoke under duress. Other witnesses also have since come forward with accounts that call Davis' conviction into question, according to his supporters. According to prosecutors, Davis was at a pool party in Savannah when he shot a man, Michael Cooper, wounding him in the face. He then went to a nearby convenience store, where he pistol-whipped a homeless man, Larry Young, who'd just bought a beer, according to accounts of the case. Prosecutors said MacPhail rushed to the scene to help, but wound up being shot three times by Davis. They said Davis shot the officer once in the face as he stood over him. A jury convicted Davis on two counts of aggravated assault and one count each of possessing a firearm during a crime, obstructing a law enforcement officer and murder. The murder charge led to the death sentence. Anneliese MacPhail told CNN earlier this week that she didn't begrudge protesters their opinions. But she said they don't understand the facts of the case. ""To them the point is the death penalty. Ninety-nine percent have absolutely no idea who Troy Davis is or who Mark MacPhail was,"" she said. ""They're just following their belief.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A young boy dressed in women's clothing, his face caked in make-up, dances the night away for a crowd of men. The bells on his feet chime away, mimicking the entertainment and sexual appeal of female dancers. But there is no mistaking his pubescent body and face as he concentrates, focusing on every step in order to please his master and his master's guests. This all played out in a video that CNN obtained from a person involved in the parties. The boy is but one youth among many throughout the country forced into an age-old underground tradition known as ""bacha bazi,"" or ""boy play,"" in which young boys are taken from their families, made to dance and used as sex slaves by powerful men. The number of boys involved is unknown -- the practice has been going on for centuries, in a country where such practices are overshadowed by conflict and war. ""It's pretty much unappreciated by [the] society, unaccepted and illegal,"" said Mohammad Musa Mahmodi of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, one of the few organizations in the country working to end ""bacha bazi."" Islamic scholars have denounced ""bacha bazi"" as immoral but the practice continues in Afghanistan, where the government is in the throes of an increasingly bloody battle with insurgent Taliban militants and is also working to recover from decades of conflict. The abuse stays on the backburner of issues in Afghanistan. People are aware of it, but they don't really talk about it. Almost everyone in the country is coping with some level of injustice, and they are just trying to survive. It is widely known among the population that, most of the time it is commanders, high-ranking officials and their friends who partake in the abuse of the boys. ""It continues because of the culture of impunity and lack of legal provision against this practice,"" Mahmodi explained. Farhad,19, and Jamel, 20, are two grown dancers who were forced into ""bacha bazi"" about five years ago. Farhad was 13 when his older neighbor tricked him into coming to his home. He was made to watch a sex tape and then raped. After the brutal assault, he was taken to another location where he was locked up and used as a sex slave for five months. ""I got used to him,"" Farhad said, trying to explain why he stayed with his neighbor after the traumatizing experience. ""He would sometimes take me to parties, and sometimes other places. I was with him all the time,"" he said. In Afghan society the victims of rape and assault --- both male and female --- are often persecuted and punished rather than the perpetrator. The shame forces boys like Farhad to continue in leading such lifestyles, even when they have the chance to break away. Jamel, Farhad's friend and dance partner, is now married but he was the ""bacha bereesh"" -- or ""boy without a beard"" -- of a powerful warlord who has since left the country. He said the only reason he continues to dance is to provide for his younger brothers and sisters. ""I make them study, dress them, feed them. Any money I make I spend on my family. I don't want them to be like this, be like me,"" he said, brushing his shoulder length hair away from his eyes, framing his thin oval face. Farhad and Jamel say their families know what is going on now but are powerless to stop it -- in fact they need the money and income they make. Both Jamel and Farhad look and act more like women than men, a trait that can be deadly in Afghanistan's male-dominated society. Even the police can't be counted on for protection. Farhad said that he was taken from a party by four police officers one night and almost gang raped at the station Before their commander walked in and stopped the assault. But then, ""He said if I wanted to be set free I should give him my money and my mobile,"" Farhad said. ""I had no real choice, so I gave him my money and mobile."" The boys said they are continuously threatened, beaten and raped by men who attend the parties they dance at; parties fueled by alcohol and drugs. ""The nights we go out, we are scared,"" said, Jamel, who is the more talkative of the pair and the one who more resembles a woman. ""We always think about how we will be able to get out without someone attacking us."" Despite the dangers, they continue to dance, making $30 for the night -- a night that usually ends in assault -- because they say it is the only thing they know and their only way to make money. There are no opportunities in Afghanistan for people like them. And once branded as men who danced as women, there is no turning back. ""We are not happy with this line of work,"" Jamel said. ""We say that it would be better if God could just kill us rather than living like this.""","Young boys in Afghanistan are used as sex slaves through ""bacha bazi"" or ""boy play""

"(CNN) -- Americans are spending less time stuck in traffic and wasting less gas, according to a new report. Americans spend a little less time in traffic, a study shows, but drivers on I-110 in Los Angeles might not notice. Rising joblessness and stinging gas prices have put the brakes on worsening trends in traffic congestion, according to a study issued Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute, the nation's largest university-based transportation research facility. ""It's temporary, but real,"" said institute spokesman Bernie Fette about the declines. ""As goes the American economy, so goes traffic. There's fewer people going to work."" The institute attributed the changes to the recession, but the U.S. economy did not begin to slow significantly until the end of 2007. The organization began tracking traffic trends in 1982, and by ""every measure, congestion has increased substantially"" in those 25 years, the latest Urban Mobility Report said. Not in 2007. Researchers surveyed 439 urban centers in the United States and found that travelers spent one hour less stuck in traffic in 2007 than they did in 2006 and wasted 1 gallon less of gasoline. Congestion delay per traveler in 1982 was 13.8 hours. In 2005, that number had almost tripled to 37.4 hours. But it was down to 36.1 hours in 2007, representing a ""rare break in near-constant growth,"" the report said. Because the changes were nominal, most people may not have noticed any change in their commutes. The average person still needs 25 percent more time to travel during rush hour than during other parts of the day, Fette said. ""Things were so congested and bad, it was kind of hard to notice,"" Fette said. Among the report's other findings: . • American travelers still wasted 4.2 billion hours stuck in rush-hour traffic jams. That amounts to nearly one full work (or vacation) week for every traveler. • The overall cost, based on wasted fuel and lost productivity, reached $87.3 billion in 2007, the report said. That's more than $750 per person. • The amount of wasted fuel, from sitting idle with the motor running, topped 2.8 billion gallons, or three weeks' worth of gas, for every traveler. Congestion has slowed but, said the report's authors, that means only that things are getting worse slower, ""hardly a positive goal statement."" The Urban Mobility Report database includes a few similar periods from regional recessions in the past -- northeastern states in the early 1980s, Texas in the mid-1980s, California in the early 1990s.

"(CNN) -- Facebook unveiled changes to its terms-of-use document on Friday, tweaking earlier drafts in an apparent effort to ease users' concerns about privacy and how their information is used. The proposed changes to the networking giant's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities come after the plan was opened up for user comments last month, and just weeks before Facebook is expected to go public in a stock offering some expect could value the company at $100 billion. Front and center in the announcement was an effort to explain that the way Facebook collects and shares data is not being changed. ""Some of our users and a number of journalists mistook the proposed update to our SRR for changes to the way we collect or use data,"" Facebook said in a post on the site. ""Our Data Use Policy (which used to be called our privacy policy) governs how we collect and use data. We are not proposing any updates to that document at this time."" Little has slowed Facebook's ascent to the top of the social-media world. What began as a dorm-room project for Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard classmates grew into a phenomenon that has amassed more than 800 million active users. But if Facebook has had an Achilles heel, it's been concerns about how user data is used. Because it's a free service, Facebook depends on targeted advertising and a cut of the micro-payments users make in games and other apps running on the site. Users' activity on the site is used to paint a picture of them, and shared by Facebook to help those advertisers pick their targets. Web privacy advocates, including some government officials in the United States and elsewhere, have repeatedly expressed unease with the sheer amount of data Facebook possesses about its users and how that data may be used. It's obvious that the company wants to tamp down user concerns about that in advance of its arrival on Wall Street. In its filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the word ""privacy"" was used 35 times. That document, which is required for companies filing to go public, was obviously largely positive about Facebook's upside. But when required to acknowledge potential downsides, Facebook wrote that if users ever widely became concerned about their privacy and use of their data, they could lose some of them. Facebook writes that it must avoid adopting ""policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing or user data that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public."" CNNMoney: Facebook strips 'privacy' from new 'data use' policy explainer . In a set of bulleted posts Friday, Facebook outlined the tweaks it has made in response to user feedback and explained items it says raised concerns. -- In a change first noted last month, the document now uses the term ""Data Use Policy"" instead of ""Privacy Policy."" Facebook says this reflects a change that was made last year because they ""believe the name is more descriptive of the information the document provides."" -- Language that said ""you or other that can see your content and information"" was removed for a different definition of how and when apps can access data about your friends. It adds links to more information and how users can control that. -- Facebook also clarified language saying that people should not ""tag users if you know they do not wish to be tagged"" in photos. That passage doesn't change how tagging works, but is merely meant to be a guideline, the company said. -- The changes remove a line saying that Facebook reserves the right to deny or limit access to users outside the United States. The site says that line was unclear and meant to reflect places where services are legally unavailable, or places where Facebook is banned. The document also included a not-so-subtle swipe at one of Facebook's chief competitors. ""Unlike other Internet companies, we propose updates to our SRR and give our users an opportunity to comment before they go into effect,"" Friday's announcement said."" Your insights and perspectives are really valuable to us, enabling us to respond to your questions and make substantive changes to address your concerns before changes are implemented."" Earlier this year, Google (which has launched social platform Google+ as a Facebook rival) rolled out significant changes to its privacy policy. While Google went out of its way to publicize the changes to users, feedback was not as aggressively sought and did not appear, at least publicly, to lead to any major changes. Facebook users can comment on the latest round of proposed changes until April 27, the post said.","Facebook unveils, and explains, proposed changes to its terms of use .

"(CNN) -- A rare tropical disease called Guinea worm is closer to being eradicated, according to former President Jimmy Carter and other experts. There are now only 542 known cases of Guinea worm left worldwide, as of 2012, representing a 48% decrease from 2011, officials said Thursday at a news conference. ""We cannot rest until we get and contain the very last case,"" said Dr. Donald R. Hopkins, affiliated with the Carter Center in Atlanta, which has been instrumental in the effort to wipe out Guinea worm. The World Health Organization this week said in a report that Guinea worm, also called dracunculiasis, has a global eradication target for the year 2015. So far, only one disease has reached the status of worldwide eradication since 1980: smallpox. Guinea worm a greater challenge than smallpox . In 1986, when the Carter Center began leading its international campaign against Guinea worm disease, there were 3.5 million cases in 21 countries. South Sudan has the most known cases today, at 521, followed by Chad (10), Mali (7), and Ethiopia (4), according to the Carter Center. These are the only four countries that still have transmission of Guinea worm. In Sudan, a war is waged to eradicate the 'fiery serpent' A main obstacle to eradication is that one case of Guinea worm disease, if not addressed quickly, can spread to hundreds more people, Carter said. Communities that depend chiefly on open water sources like ponds in rural and isolated areas are especially affected, according to the World Health Organization. The disease gets into the body when people drink contaminated water, which contains water fleas that have ingested Guinea worm larvae. The human stomach kills the water fleas, but not the larvae within. Worms can get through the intestinal wall and move around under skin tissues. A patient will develop a painful skin blister, through which a worm will emerge about 10 to 14 months after infection. The worm can be up to three feet long, and looks like a very long spaghetti noodle. When the patient heads to a body of water to try to soothe the fiery pain, the worm deposits more larvae in the water, and the cycle starts over. No vaccines or treatments are available for Guinea worm, but the international effort has made significant strides with health education and encouraging behavior changes. How fight against Guinea worm was won . Prevention strategies include filtering drinking water and discouraging people with Guinea worm from wading in water. Water can also be chemically treated with larvicide. While Guinea worm disease does not usually result in death, it is associated with incapacitating pain and secondary bacterial infections. Patients find it difficult to work, farm and function. In a household where a parent has had Guinea worm, toddlers will be less well nourished because the infected parent will have difficulty farming, Hopkins said. Carter recalled Thursday that he first saw people living with Guinea worm in Ghana. He saw a young woman, about 20, who appeared to be holding a baby. But he discovered that it was not a baby; it was her right breast, which was swollen because of the disease. The international effort is monitoring about 7,000 villages, Carter said. ""We need to find anyone who has Guinea worm"" and ""prevent them from going back to the water source,"" he said. In terms of government support from individual countries, South Sudan is most strongly behind the eradication efforts, Hopkins said. In that country, there are about 110 workers on payroll, and some 12,000 unpaid volunteers, Carter said. The program in Mali, however, has not been able to operate fully, or at all, in areas occupied by rebel groups, said Ernesto Ruiz-Tiben, director of the Guinea Worm Eradication Program at the Carter Center. The unrest there has made efforts to stop Guinea worm more difficult. Educating people about Guinea worm has other benefits besides preventing this specific disease, Hopkins said, such as helping people to think more carefully about the water they drink. A clean water supply can help prevent other diseases. Such education efforts also empower local populations, showing them that they can do something to correct their own problems, Carter said. Villagers often want to know how to address other diseases, too. ""The people themselves say, 'How can you help us with other problems?' "" Carter said. CNN's Madison Park contributed to this report.","Guinea worm disease cases worldwide have dropped by 48% in a year .

"(Hong Kong) (CNN) -- The Australian women's basketball team and the Japanese women's soccer team flew in premium economy seats in their flights to Europe, while their male counterparts stretched out in business class. Nevermind that the women's Australian basketball team has won silver medals in the last three Olympics -- and the Aussie men have won none. And it also mattered little that the women's Japanese soccer team won last year's World Cup. The difference in how the women's teams traveled has sparked outrage and accusations of sexism. It prompted Basketball Australia to announce that it would review its travel policy ""with the goal of ensuring there is equity between travel arrangements for the men's and women's teams attending future Olympics."" That review, which was announced Friday, is expected to take about three months. Basketball Australia quoted Scott Derwin, its acting chief executive, in a statement explaining that each national team has discretion over how their funds are spent, including travel arrangements. ""We should bear in mind that in fact, historically, more funding has been directed towards the Opals,"" Derwin said in the statement. The Opals refer to the Australian women's basketball team and the Boomers are the men's basketball team. The spokeswoman for Basketball Australia declined to comment when reached by CNN on Friday. In the statement released Friday by the organization, Derwin said: ""But the simple fact is when a policy results in gender inequality, it's very clearly not the right policy going forward."" The incoming chief executive officer of Basketball Australia, Kristina Keneally said in the statement, ""In this day and age, there's just no excuse for men's and women's sporting teams to be treated differently when they both compete at the same world class level. ""In fact, in this circumstance, the disparity is even more glaring when you consider that our women's basketball team is one of the best in the world - enjoying the number 2 spot in international rankings,"" Keneally added. Australia's Minister for Sport, Kate Lundy, agreed. ""They shouldn't have to travel a different class because they're both world class,"" she said in a statement Thursday. While saying that travel arrangements are a matter for the national Olympic committee and the relevant national sporting organization, Lundy stated: ""My view is that team travel should be equitable for our male and female athletes."" The Japanese Olympic Council confirmed that the Japan Football Association upgraded its male Olympic team to business class and the female team to premium economy. It refrained from commenting on the matter. Japanese Olympic Council provides its country's Olympic-bound athletes with economy class tickets. It is up to each member association or athletes whether those seats will be upgraded or not. Japanese netizens were divided about the seating arrangements, with some saying the difference was unfair, while others said the economic reality is that the male team earns more money.

"(CNN) -- Getting ahead in your career is not just about being successful; it's about being noticed. So how do you stand out to be hired by potential employers? How do you stand out for a promotion to a superior? How do you stand out as loyal to the people you are leading? It's simple: do the things that others aren't willing to do. Whether you're a leader, a team member, or a candidate, success comes from having the discipline to do the things that you know you should be doing, even when you don't feel like doing them. When you practice this kind of self discipline regularly, you'll naturally stand out from the pack -- because most people avoid the hard stuff. It's just easier to put it off. But the truth is that what feels easy now creates problems down the line. And what feels hard now -- doing the stuff you don't feel like -- makes everything easier in the long-term. Self discipline doesn't have to be hard -- you just have to change the way you think about it. Read more: Ambition could make you reach, but not happy . Successful people have mastered the art of self discipline. I've spent the last 10 years studying and coaching some of the most successful people in business, figuring out what makes them different. They're not smarter or more talented than the average person -- they just consistently do what others aren't willing to do by keeping three principles in mind: . Do it scared. Fear is one of the biggest saboteurs of our goals, because it inhibits action. The next time you feel yourself putting something off because you're afraid -- of uncertainty or failure -- just ""do it scared."" I once heard a true story of a woman who was trapped in a burning building on the 80th floor. She was terrified of heights and enclosed spaces, and when the fire alarm went off, she refused to follow her colleagues into the stairwell to evacuate to safety. The firemen did a sweep of the building and found her hiding under her desk, waiting to die. She was screaming ""I'm scared, I'm scared!"" as the firemen insisted she walk down the stairwell. Until one fireman said: ""that's OK, just do it scared."" He repeated it all the way down the 80 flights of stairs, until he brought her to safety. We've all faced these moments in our careers -- when you know what has to be done, but your fear holds you back. In order to stand out, you must develop the habit of acting in the face of fear. It's fine to be scared -- do it scared. It's fine to be unsure -- do it unsure. It's fine to be uncomfortable -- do it uncomfortable. Just do something. This is the attitude of the most disciplined and successful people on the planet. They might be scared, but they do it anyways. And by just doing something, you create movement and momentum that will lead to progress and results. Read more: Realize your potential, 'dare to be different' Habits, not results. Perfectionism is one of the most common reasons people procrastinate, and we've all done it at some point. The best way to overcome this impulse is to put your self esteem into stellar work habits instead of results. It can take a while to see the fruits of your labor -- whether you're spearheading a new initiative, trying to launch a business, or planning a second act career. To keep yourself motivated, take pride in sticking to your work habits, rather than looking for immediate results. In time, success will follow. Remember the big picture. The pursuit of any goal will inevitably face a number of obstacles. The difference between those who stand out in the careers and those who blend in lies in what you do when you reach these critical turning points. Do you hesitate and turn back? Or do you press forward? When you feel frustrated, depressed, or disappointed, don't give up -- just get some perspective. I have a mental reminder that helps me push past these hurdles. I hold my pen up to my eye and stare directly down the barrel. Then, I pull it away and look at it in its entirety. It's a quick way to remind myself to look at my life in the same way. Stop fixating on the here and now, and think about the big picture. Today's challenges may not make sense, but you must have faith that over the long-term, they will be nothing more than blips on the radar screen. Having this perspective and faith will help you press forward at the moments when others turn back. Contrary to popular belief, people who have reached the highest levels in their careers aren't necessarily better educated, more talented or better connected. Neither are they simply more motivated or harder workers. Rather, successful people have realized that getting to the top means that they first have to do the things that they don't want to do related to their goals. It's not about enjoying self discipline -- it's about adopting a few new ways of thinking that simply make discipline easier to endure. And when you develop the habit of doing things that others won't do, you're putting yourself on the fast track to the route to the top. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rory Vaden.","Successful people consistently do the things that others aren't willing to do, says Rory Vaden .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's young leader has been in the job for more than a year and has managed to step out of the considerable shadow left by his late father, Kim Jong Il. The humiliation of April's failed rocket launch after a typically jingoistic build-up was followed up by a successful attempt in December despite a chorus of international condemnation. Pyongyang claimed it had put a satellite into orbit, while the U.S. and South Korea insisted it was all a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. When the United Nations expanded sanctions as punishment, the North Korean leadership bared its teeth and vowed to conduct another nuclear test and continue experimenting with long-range rockets -- with the U.S. in mind. Kim Jong Un seems determined to make his own mark as leader. Far from floundering in his own inexperience, Kim has worked swiftly to consolidate his power base domestically by replacing senior figures in the military -- many loyal to his father -- with his own people. Whereas the elder Kim's leadership was centered around ""military first"" politics and tied to the powerful National Defense Commission, a government body, the younger Kim is returning the center of gravity for the regime back to the Party apparatus, according to Ken Gause, director of the International Affairs Group at CNA, a not-for-profit research and analysis organization. But some North Korea watchers believe the Swiss-educated fan of Western movies and basketball lacks the absolute power enjoyed by his father and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea. ""I believe he is in overall control of the Korea Workers Party, the military, and the state -- but with the help of his uncle, Jang Sung-taek, and his family confident, Choe Ryong Hae, chief of the general political bureau of the Korea People's Army,"" said Chung-in Moon, Professor of Political Science at Yonsei University in South Korea. ""Whereas his father Kim Jong Il had the absolute consolidation of power base and direct full control of the Party, the military, and the state, his son Kim Jong Un seems to reign than rule."" Moon added that his aunt, Kim Kyung-hee, is the other main influence on the younger Kim. However, the 20-something leader has a very different style to his father, demonstrating a softer, seemingly personable side. In the last 12 months, the world was introduced to his wife during a number of high-profile public appearances, something that never happened during his father's reign. In one memorable scene last year, a visibly relaxed and smiling Kim and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, were filmed taking in the attractions at an amusement park outside the capital. He has also shown a willingness to speak publicly, even acknowledging the suffering of his own people during one speech in April last year. ""Our Party is determined our people will not have to tighten their belts but will enjoy wealth and the honor of socialism,"" Kim told a crowd of thousands at Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang. His father is believed to have made only one brief broadcast while in charge. ""Kim Jong Un basically grew up on Google and his father grew up on letters and stamps,"" said Jasper Kim, founder of Asia-Pacific Global Research Group. ""It's a new era and Kim Jong Un realizes the more he can kind of shape the narrative to the international community, the more it is to his benefit in terms of getting security and money and everything else that he wants for his country."" But despite signs Kim could be someone the world can do business with, the recent aggressive posturing and rhetoric emanating from Pyongyang suggest otherwise -- with the country's leadership seemingly united. ""As far as regime and national security is concerned, there is a unity between hardliners and moderates,"" said Moon. ""The North Korean leadership does not think that their behavior is aggressive. For example, launching a rocket for peaceful use in space is, they believe, their sovereign right. And any aggressive behavior such as the third nuclear test is a rightful reaction to unfair and unjust punishment by the U.S. and the U.N. ""There seems to be a huge perception gap."" Meanwhile, little is changing for the people of North Korea. Aid groups say malnutrition is still rampant in the countryside where citizens lack access to safe water and sanitation. According to Human Rights Watch, hundreds of thousands of people remain enslaved in prison camps which are ""notorious for horrific living conditions and abuse."" The rights group also claims that on taking power Kim's new government gave shoot-on-sight orders to border guards to stop citizens fleeing to China.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Ex-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged his government secretly signed off on U.S. drone strikes, the first time a top past or present Pakistani official has admitted publicly to such a deal. Pakistani leaders long have openly challenged the drone program and insisted they had no part in it. Musharraf's admission, though, suggests he and others did play some role, even if they didn't oversee the program or approve every attack. In an interview this week in Islamabad, Musharraf insisted Pakistan's government signed off on strikes ""only on a few occasions, when a target was absolutely isolated and no chance of collateral damage."" Still, his admission that Pakistani leaders agreed to even a limited number of strikes runs counter to their repeated denunciations of a program they long claimed the United States was operating without their approval. The drone strikes -- which the nonpartisan public policy group New American Foundation estimates have killed at least 1,990 people in Pakistan, including hundreds of civilians -- are unpopular in Pakistan. ""Today, the world superpower is having its own way, without any consent from Pakistan,"" former Interior Minister Rehman Malik said last month. Despite such pronouncements, there's been speculation that the story might have been different behind the scenes. In a cable sent in August 2008 and later posted online by Wikileaks, then-U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Anne Patterson mentioned a discussion about drones during a meeting that also involved Malik and then-Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani. ""Malik suggested we hold off alleged Predator attacks until after the Bajaur operation,"" Patterson wrote. ""The PM brushed aside Rehman's remarks and said, 'I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people. We'll protest in the National Assembly and then ignore it.' "" Unmanned U.S. drones began launching attacks in Pakistan in 2004, by which time Musharraf had been president for five years after taking power in a bloodless coup. He said that Pakistani leaders would OK U.S. drone strikes after discussions involving military and intelligence units and only if ""there was no time for our own ... military to act."" This happened ""only rarely,"" said Musharraf, who left office in 2008 and spent years in exile before returning to Pakistan last month to launch a political comeback. But sometimes, he said, ""you couldn't delay action."" ""These ups and downs kept going,"" he said. ""It was a very fluid situation, a vicious enemy, ... mountains, inaccessible areas."" Musharraf said that one of those killed by U.S. drones was Nek Mohammed, a tribal leader accused of harboring al Qaeda militants in Pakistan's western border region. At the time, in June 2004, Pakistan intelligence sources said Mohammed died after Pakistani forces launched a missile at a house where he was staying. Anti-drone bill advances in Florida .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- The search teams comb through the backyards of the half-million-dollar homes with metal detectors, placing red flags on the manicured lawns every time they get a hit. To the shock of residents, they sometimes find live bombs. The Army Corps of Engineers digs up metal in search for live bombs in an Orlando neighborhood. The bombs are left over from a 12,000-acre World War II bombing range. The area has become an Orlando neighborhood with thousands of homes. The Army Corps of Engineers has launched a $10 million cleanup of what used to be the PineCastle Jeep Range, but it said bombs could remain there once they're done. ""Chances are, it's not a problem,"" said Mike Ornella, the man leading the Army Corps cleanup. But he conceded, ""We're never going to be 100 percent sure. We're never going to give a 100 percent guarantee that the properties are clear."" The developer refused comment for this story. Residents are enraged.  Watch the Army Corps blow up bombs » . ""It's incomprehensible,"" said Frank Kruppenbacher, the general counsel of the Orange County school board. ""It starts with my wondering why the U.S. military ever allowed any of these properties [to] be developed without first saying you have to go through X-checklist."" The first bomb was found last summer next to the Odyssey Middle School track. Since that time, 126 rockets and bombs -- with high explosives -- have been found on school property, along with other military debris. No children have been injured by the explosives. Two adults who found munitions on school property suffered minor burns, including a worker, who while making repairs on the track, uncovered a fragment that was buried under concrete and it caught fire. A handful of explosives have been found in the housing developments, but no residents have been hurt, officials said. Kruppenbacher is furious. ""Before they get to walk away and claim 'we're done,' we're going to have a real day of reckoning and assurances,"" Kruppenbacher said. Danette Lamb said she and her husband, Russell, raided their retirement savings to pay for their townhouse in the Vista Square subdivision. Their son, Johnny, attends Odyssey Middle School.  Watch neighborhood outrage over live bombs: ""It's wrong"" » . ""It makes you feel bad as a parent because I don't have the funds to go and take my son and put him in private school,"" she said. She added that her property value has plummeted since the bomb discoveries. ""What am I going to do with this? Nobody wants to touch this neighborhood. I'm stuck. So this is not my little American family dream that we had."" Red flags mark spots in the ground where metal has been found and needs further inspection. ""For Sale"" and ""For Rent"" signs are everywhere. Most want to know: How could this happen and who's responsible? The Army Corps of Engineers maintains it's not responsible. ""It was known that this was a demonstration area for war fighting,"" said Ornella. ""People knew it and the information was available. Absolutely available."" Asked if the Army Corps raised enough concerns, Ornella said, ""I believe the Army Corps followed the process we are required to follow."" The Army Corps of Engineers did publish government reports more than a decade ago about the bombing range. A 1994 report said the site ""is a possible danger to the public,"" and a 1997 report cited ""strafing, practice bombing, air-to-ground rocket firing, some high explosive bombing."" Ornella said the Army Corps wasn't required to do more to inform anyone about the possible dangers, even though their records show they knew construction was coming. ""Development expected in near future,"" read a July 1994 report. The bombing site in Orlando is one of 9,000 formerly used by the Pentagon in the United States, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. Some are being cleaned up, but they said most are not. As in Orlando, some have been the target of lawsuits and some, including a site in Dallas, Texas, have been developed. The Orlando site jumped to the top of the priority list last summer, when live bombs were found in the area. Local officials say it's disturbing that home construction was allowed anywhere near the property. The school board, builders and engineering firms all say they didn't ask because they had no idea it was an old bombing range. Multiple lawsuits have been filed, accusing builders of gross negligence and seeking unspecified monetary damages. John K. Overchuck, a lawyer representing homeowners, is suing one builder, Lennar. ""They're the ones who made the money off this property. They're the ones who bought this for dirt, and built these houses for up to a half a million dollars,"" he says. ""They're the ones who made the profit, they're the ones who are responsible because they've got these people suckered into these houses."" Lennar would not consent to an interview to CNN, but did provide a written statement. Lennar says it relied on studies that ""made no mention of ... a military range,"" and claims the military did not show up in property ownership records because, ""it had leased the land."" But at the same time, it was no secret that the military once used the property. Nearly two decades ago, the 1989 development order, in which the county granted the permission to develop the land, shows that builders and developers knew ""of the site's history of military use."" The order specifically says that ""project construction personnel shall be notified ... of the site's history of military use."" It states that construction management must be notified of ""suspected findings of potentially hazardous military material."" It further states that in the event of such findings, ""the developer shall immediately stop construction at the site of discovery and notify Orange County and the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation."" Homeowner Danette Lamb wants answers. ""Somebody knew something. A lot of somebodies turned their heads and tried to make a quick buck,"" she said. Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers continues to survey the land and homeowners' properties. But they can only survey the common areas and grassy areas. Sensors and examining equipment cannot see under roads, cement or the foundations of homes. Local and federal law enforcement officials say that the issue is a civil matter and that no criminal investigations have begun. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer says homeowners deserve to be angry about the situation. ""We have to make sure that the federal government, who has the ability to right this wrong, does so,"" he said. ""They [the Army Corps] need to restore the faith in the neighborhood, that their neighborhood is safe and making it a neighborhood that somebody would want to come buy a house in."" But that faith may be a long way away -- if even achievable. ""You can't even give this place away right now. I've tried to re-finance. ... I can't do anything,"" Lamb said.","More than 100 bombs and rockets have been found on Orlando school property .

The lawsuit alleges that some equipment on the plane was improperly installed or defective, resulting in inadequate warnings for the pilots about low airspeed. ""Boeing was aware that its low airspeed warning system was inadequate,"" the suit states. More than 80 of the plane's 291 passengers are named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

Once again, there's a high-profile tea party vs. mainstream GOP Senate primary showdown. The election, in Mississippi, is the anti-establishment's best shot at ousting an incumbent Republican senator running for re-election this year. In Iowa, the front-runner in the GOP Senate primary has rare support from both sides in this intra-party battle. If Republicans can flip Iowa and five other Democratic-held seats, they will regain control of the Senate. And keep an eye on California, which becomes the largest state in the country to hold an open, or ""jungle"" primary, where the top two finishers advance to the November election, regardless of party affiliation. Here are five contests worth watching on Tuesday: . 1. A big test for the tea party: For tea party supporters, the GOP Senate primary in Mississippi represents perhaps their most high-profile chance to claim victory after facing a string of defeats this year. With the exception of some races in Texas last week, conservative challengers have lost in key congressional contests, including in Idaho, Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina and Oregon. Polls in Mississippi show the Senate race there will go down to the wire. At 76, Thad Cochran is the second oldest Senate incumbent running for re-election this year. State Sen. Chris McDaniel says Cochran's six terms in Washington are enough and he's running on a platform of change for Mississippi. ""We don't have six more years of the status quo,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. ""I am not going to Washington, D.C., to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals. I'm going up there to fight and defend the Constitution."" Cochran supporters argue the senator knows what's best for the state, and they point to McDaniel's out-of-state help. Former Gov. Haley Barbour blasted McDaniel for bringing in ""outside celebrities"" such as former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who campaigned for McDaniel in the past week. New ads in nasty Mississippi GOP Senate race . Cochran was considered the most vulnerable GOP senator facing re-election. But momentum shifted after questions arose about the McDaniel campaign's knowledge of a bizarre plan to shoot pictures of Cochran's ailing wife in a nursing home bed. Nasty Senate race digs deeper into the mud . 2. Both sides in the bag: Iowa State Sen. Joni Ernst doesn't have to take sides in the battle between grass-roots conservatives and the Republican establishment: She's got the backing of both. Ernst, a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard who grabbed national attention earlier this year by touting her hog castrating skills in a campaign commercial, has the support of some top names and groups among both the tea party movement and the mainstream GOP. A Des Moines Register poll released over the weekend put Ernst at 36%, 18 percentage points ahead of businessman Mark Jacobs. If no candidate cracks 35% of the vote, the nomination will be decided by around 2,000 delegates at a state party convention. The GOP nominee will face off in November against Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who faces token opposition in his party's primary. The winner of November's general election will succeed longtime Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who is retiring at the end of the year. Republicans feel they have a good shot at flipping Harkin's seat in their drive to retake the Senate. Big name Republicans from both establishment and conservative wings of the party like Mitt Romney, Marco Rubio and Sarah Palin have joined Ernst on the trail and she's gotten support from establishment groups like the Chamber of Commerce as well groups like the Senate Conservatives Fund, which often backs conservative candidates who launch primary challenges against incumbent Republican senators. Ernst has backing from both sides . 3. The battle for second: No one is questioning whether Democrat Jerry Brown, who's bidding for an unprecedented fourth term as California governor, is the overwhelming favorite in Tuesday's Golden State primary. The big question is whom the incumbent will face come November. For the first time in statewide races, California is holding ""open"" or ""jungle"" primaries, in which all candidates compete in a single contest and the first and second place finishers, regardless of party affiliation, advance to the general election. So, who will be Brown's opponent in November? The latest polling indicates former Bush administration treasury official Neel Kashkari is slightly ahead of State Rep. Tim Donnelly for the second spot. Both are Republicans but which candidate advances to November could make a difference for the party's chances in the general election. Some GOP strategists said they're concerned that if it's Donnelly, a conservative with tea party backing, it could hurt Republican candidates in down-ballot races in a state where the general election electorate is much more moderate than that of the GOP primary. But wait, there's more. One time anti-war protester Cindy Sheehan is also on the ballot, the nomine of the Peace and Freedom Party, a socialist party whose gubernatorial candidates have traditionally grabbed about 1% of the vote. Sheehan became the face of the anti-Iraq war movement in 2005 when she protested for weeks outside then-President George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, after her son Casey was killed in combat. 4. A very, very crowded primary: A new-age spiritual healer. A public radio host. A sports executive. A television producer. Those are just four of the 16 candidates running in the primary for California's 33rd Congressional District, which includes Hollywood. The district also contains parts of Westside Los Angeles, as well as the opulent cities of Beverly Hills, Bel Air and Brentwood. The area is losing its longtime congressman, Democrat Henry Waxman, who announced earlier this year he would retire at the end of his 20th term. Keeping up with the celebrity endorsements and the money race in this part of the state can be a challenge. Marianne Williamson, the self-help guru, has the backing of Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian, for example. Los Angeles City Controller Wendy Greuel and state Sen. Ted Lieu, both Democrats, are considered the most likely candidates to place in the top two and advance to the general election. But with just as many Republicans and independents as Democrats running for the seat -- and an expected low turnout -- it's possible the race may not end up as an intra-party fight. Wild battle to represent Beverly Hills . 5. Democrat incumbent challenged in Montana: Republicans view Montana as another chance to pick up a Democratic seat and regain control of the Senate. The incumbent, Democrat John Walsh, was appointed to the seat in February after longtime Sen. Max Baucus resigned to become U.S. ambassador to China. Walsh faces two Democratic primary challengers, rancher Dirk Adams and former Lt. Gov. John Bohlinger. Walsh is considered the front-runner and political observers will watch to see how big -- or how small -- his margin is over his competitors. If he fails to win by a landslide, it could spell trouble in the fall. The Democratic nominee will face the winner of the GOP race -- another three-way contest -- in November. Rep. Steve Daines is considered the favorite in the GOP primary and has the support of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He faces state Rep. Champ Edmunds and political newcomer Susan Cundiff.","What has been the country's nastiest primary is to be decided in Mississippi .

"Burlington, Vermont (CNN) -- Residents of Vermont know their work is cut out for them as they struggle for normalcy after enduring the wrath of Irene. The landlocked rural state saw fast-moving floods spawned by the storm swarm towns from Brattleboro to Woodstock. ""It's heartbreaking to see your home and home state destroyed -- and seeing places and landmarks that you can recognize even from early childhood now destroyed by flooding,"" said Ryan Ritter who lives in Rutland near the state's border with New York. There was no way in or out of his town, the 20-year-old Ritter said. The story was much the same in the southern town of Wilmington. Cut off on several sides, the Vermont National Guard had to travel through neighboring Massachusetts to get rescue crews to the small, cut-off community. ""Irene hit us hard. A lot of businesses were destroyed. Loss of property -- roads, bridges, homes washed away,"" said Rachel Lazelle. ""It is going to take a long time to rebuild."" On Tuesday, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate planned to tour flooded communities in the state. A day earlier, President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration, allowing federal aid to the state. ""It's just devastating,"" Gov. Peter Shumlin said Monday. ""Whole communities under water, businesses, homes, obviously roads and bridges, rail transportation infrastructure,"" he said. ""We're tough folks up here but Irene ... really hit us hard."" Three deaths had been confirmed as a result of the storm. Hundreds of people remained trapped in communities cut off by raging floodwaters that washed out or otherwise damaged 263 roads and bridges, Shumlin said. Exactly how many were stranded remained unclear, he said, because it's difficult to get into many communities. The governor described conditions as ""probably the toughest flooding that we've seen in the state of Vermont in our history."" Normally tranquil streams poured through city streets and thrashed against buildings and bridges, including some of the state's iconic covered bridges. Four to six of the covered bridges were destroyed in the flooding, officials said. Even the state emergency management headquarters in Waterbury was flooded, forcing officials to evacuate to Burlington, about 20 miles away. Many areas of the state remained under flood watches and warnings early Tuesday, with the National Weather Service reporting continued record flooding in some locations. Unlike many states, Vermont did not order or suggest evacuations. Many of the state's towns are in lowlands and there are few large areas of dry land, so large-scale evacuations are impractical, Shumlin said. Marc Leibowitz, a New Yorker, knew the threat Irene posed for his home state. But he didn't think he'd feel its effects in Vermont where his friends and family had arrived over the weekend for his wedding. ""My friends were telling me, 'This is awesome! You got us out of New York for the weekend,"" Leibowitz said. Now, they are stranded in Pittsfield in central Vermont, with no roads to get them out. ""We are making the best of things,"" he said. But he is also keeping an eye on the calendar and his fingers crossed. He is really looking forward to his honeymoon Thursday. CNN's Stephanie Gallman and iReport's Christina Zdanowicz and Carly Costello contributed to this report.","Many parts of the state remain under flood advisories .

"(CNN) -- ""Excuse me,"" the woman called. ""Is the president still speaking?"" ""I think so,"" I called over to her. She let her face scrunch up into an expression of mild dismay. It had nothing at all to do with politics. This was in central Ohio; she was standing next to a furniture-delivery truck near the intersection of two streets called Sherwood and Dawson. President Barack Obama was addressing a rally on the campus of Capital University in Bexley, a few blocks away. People attending the event had jammed the residential neighborhood with their parked cars, and some of those cars were so close to her driveway, on Sherwood, that the furniture truck could not maneuver into it. ""I had this delivery scheduled, but I didn't know it would be the same time the president was here,"" she said, her voice pleasant. ""The guys from the truck are looking for another way to get it to my house. I told them I'd stand here and guard the furniture."" Ohio is getting plenty of visits from the candidates. During the time I was in the middle of Ohio this summer, Paul Ryan was in the area twice, Mitt Romney was there at least once, and on this early afternoon Obama had made his way to Capital. Scenes like this repeat every four years; there are days in highly contested states when something seems almost amiss if you don't encounter a motorcade or a police escort. They are traveling salesmen, the candidates are; they hit the road bearing their products -- the products being themselves. And although presidential and vice presidential candidates are the most celebrated politicians in the land, they become not so different from the thousands of other sales reps who lug their sample cases across America every work week of the year. Gergen: Harsh realities for Democrats . And the people in the towns -- especially in the swing states -- find out what it's like to be suddenly wanted, to be the recipient of exceptionally fervid sales ardor. When you are in the market for a big-ticket item -- a house; a new car -- you notice how accommodating the real-estate agent or the car dealership is toward you: always checking back, asking what they can do to win your business, generally being constantly around and ever available. After you've bought the item, they tend not to come calling. That's how it is during that small sliver of time when the people running for president and vice president can't do enough for the potential voters. For those voters in the states that can tip the balance of an election, it can be flattering -- and also a little wearying -- to be so relentlessly courted, even while knowing that the courtship has a hard expiration date in early November. Begala: Democrats fix their enthusiasm gap . The candidates, however low on sleep and tugged in all directions, travel great distances to try to make the sale. Despite the much-vaunted reach of television commercials and social networks, they understand that, to close the deal, they had better be there in person, just like the real-estate agent or the car dealer. Because if they aren't, they know that the other real-estate agent or car dealer will be. To watch the major-party candidates move through the country in these months ... well, for all their fame, there's more than a bit of literature's most unforgettable salesman, Willy Loman, present: ""a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine."" On the day Obama spoke on the campus lawn at Capital, the Secret Service and the local police had closed down Pleasant Ridge Avenue to traffic, but allowed pedestrians to slip around the barricade if they wanted to give the pizzeria one door down a little business. A local man walking with a cane, running for an office considerably less lofty than president or vice president, stopped at each of the outdoor tables and handed a leaflet to each pizza-eater, saying: ""I'd like your vote this fall. I'm on the ballot."" In less than nine weeks, two of the four men crisscrossing the nation -- Obama, Romney, Ryan, Joe Biden -- are going to find out that they failed to make the sale after all, and two of the men are going to find out that they have successfully culminated the transaction. The nervous uncertainty of that is what can make their high-level pursuit at times feel utterly life-sized. Arthur Miller, in that same play in which he introduced Willy Loman to the world, understood the compulsion behind all of this quite well: . ""A salesman is got to dream, boy. It comes with the territory."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene was in Ohio this summer, where presidential candidate visits were constant .
He says they are like traveling salesmen who must show up if they want to close the deal .
He says Ohioans get weary of the courting, even though they know it ends in November .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's leader has approved a plan to prepare rockets to be on standby for firing at U.S. targets, including the U.S. mainland and military bases in the Pacific and in South Korea, state media reported. In a meeting with military leaders early Friday, Kim Jong Un ""said he has judged the time has come to settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists in view of the prevailing situation,"" the state-run KCNA news agency reported. ""If they make a reckless provocation with huge strategic forces, [we] should mercilessly strike the U.S. mainland, their stronghold, their military bases in the operational theaters in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in South Korea,"" KCNA reported. Analysis: Just what is Kim Jong Un up to? Later Friday, North Korean state media carried a photo of Kim meeting with military officials. The young leader is seated in the image, leafing through documents with four uniformed officers standing around him. On the wall behind them, a map entitled ""Plan for the strategic forces to target mainland U.S."" appears to show straight lines stretching across to the Pacific to points on the continental United States. South Korea and the United States are ""monitoring any movements of North Korea's short, middle and middle-to-long range missiles,"" South Korean Defense Ministry Spokesman Kim Min-seok said Friday. Kim's regime has unleashed a torrent of threats in the past few weeks, and U.S. officials have said they're concerned about the recent rhetoric. ""North Korea is not a paper tiger, so it wouldn't be smart to dismiss its provocative behavior as pure bluster,"" a U.S. official said Wednesday. But Pentagon spokesman George Little said Thursday that it was important to remain calm and urged North Korea to ""dial the temperature down."" ""No one wants there to be war on the Korean Peninsula, let me make that very clear,"" he told CNN's ""Erin Burnett Outfront."" Behind North Korea's heated words about missile strikes, one analyst said, there might not be much mettle. North Korea's threat: Five things to know . ""The fact is that despite the bombast, and unless there has been a miraculous turnaround among North Korea's strategic forces, there is little to no chance that it could successfully land a missile on Guam, Hawaii or anywhere else outside the Korean Peninsula that U.S. forces may be stationed,"" James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly, wrote in an opinion column published Thursday on CNN.com. North Korea's latest threat Friday morning came after the United States said Thursday that it flew stealth bombers over South Korea in annual military exercises. The mission by the B-2 Spirit bombers, which can carry conventional and nuclear weapons, ""demonstrates the United States' ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes quickly and at will,"" a statement from U.S. Forces Korea said. The North Korean state news agency described the mission as ""an ultimatum that they (the United States) will ignite a nuclear war at any cost on the Korean Peninsula."" The North has repeatedly claimed that the exercises are tantamount to threats of nuclear war against it. But the U.S. military stressed that the bombers flew in exercises to preserve peace in the region. ""The United States is steadfast in its alliance commitment to the defense of the Republic of Korea, to deterring aggression, and to ensuring peace and stability in the region,"" the statement from U.S. Forces Korea said, using South Korea's official name. ""The B-2 bomber is an important element of America's enduring and robust extended deterrence capability in the Asia-Pacific region."" The disclosure of the B-2 flights comes a day after North Korea said it was cutting a key military hotline with South Korea, provoking fresh expressions of concern from U.S. officials about Pyongyang's recent rhetoric. Tensions escalated on the Korean Peninsula after the North carried out a long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions on the secretive regime. U.S. officials concerned over North Korea's 'ratcheting up of rhetoric' Pyongyang has expressed fury over the sanctions and the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises, due to continue until the end of April. The deteriorating relations have put paid to any hopes of reviving multilateral talks over North Korea's nuclear program for the foreseeable future. Indeed, Pyongyang has declared that the subject is no longer up for discussion. While Kim appears to have spurned the prospect of dialog with U.S. and South Korean officials, he met with Dennis Rodman during the U.S. basketball star's bizarre recent visit to North Korea. Sharp increases in tensions on the Korean Peninsula have taken place during the drills in previous years. The last time the North cut off military communications with the South was during similar exercises in March 2009. North Korea has gone through cycles of ""provocative behavior"" for decades, Little said Thursday. ""And we have to deal with them. We have to be sober, calm, cool, collected about these periods. That's what we're doing right now,"" he said. ""And we are assuring our South Korean allies day to day that we stand with them in the face of these provocations."" The recent saber-rattling from Pyongyang has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea, as well as the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is null and void. On Tuesday, the North said it planned to place military units tasked with targeting U.S. bases under combat-ready status. Most observers say North Korea is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile, but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles. Little said Thursday that the United States was keeping a close eye on North Korea's missile capabilities. ""The important thing is for us to stay out ahead of what we think the North Korean threat is, especially from their missile program,"" he said. ""They've been testing more missiles, and they've been growing their capabilities and we have to stay out ahead."" Korean nightmare: Experts ponder potential conflict . CNN's K.J.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government can use lethal force against an American citizen overseas if the person is a senior operational leader of al Qaeda or one of its affiliates, according to a Justice Department memo. The document, provided to select members of Congress last year, provides insights into the Obama administration's policy of targeted killings carried out by the use of drone strikes against suspected terrorists. Read more: The Danish agent, the Croatian blonde and the CIA plot . Several of those strikes have killed Americans, notably Anwar al-Awlaki, the Yemeni American who had been connected to plots against the United States but never charged with a crime. Awlaki died in a drone attack in September 2011 in Yemen. The 16-page white paper -- titled ""Lawfulness of a Lethal Operation Directed Against a U.S. Citizen who is a Senior Operational Leader of Al Qaida or an Associated Force"" -- is a policy paper rather than an official legal document. Read more: Anwar al-Awlaki: al Qaeda's rock star no more . The memo was given confidentially to members of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees by the administration last June, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the intelligence panel chair, said in a statement. NBC News first reported on the contents on Tuesday. A congressional source verified the document's legitimacy to CNN. Details surfaced just days before the confirmation hearing for John Brennan, who has been nominated to head the CIA. Brennan has served as President Barack Obama's top counterterrorism adviser and is considered to be behind the administration's dramatic rise in the use of targeted killings against suspected terror suspects. Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are expected to grill him on the policy at his hearing on Thursday. The memo stated that Americans abroad retain their constitutional rights to due process, but the government can use lethal force against a citizen under certain circumstances. These include: . - ""Where an informed, high-level official of the U.S. government has determined that the targeted individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States."" - ""Where a capture operation would be infeasible -- and where those conducting the operation continue to monitor whether capture becomes feasible."" - ""Where such an operation would be conducted consistent with applicable law of war principles."" But the document also said the government is not required ""to have clear evidence"" that an attack against the United States will occur in the immediate future to determine that an imminent threat is posed by a U.S. citizen. The memo cites both congressional authorization and judicial approval for the use of military force to counter the threat of terrorist attack by all individuals. Amanpour: Grandfather grieves teenage grandson killed by U.S. drone . The Supreme Court has held that the military may constitutionally use force against an American who is a part of enemy forces. The document dismissed arguments by commentators that the war against al Qaeda cannot extend outside of Afghanistan. It asserted that ""the United States retains its authority to use force against al-Qaeda and associated forces outside the area of active hostilities when it targets a senior operational leader of the enemy force who is actively engaged in planning operations to kill Americans."" The White House said questions around the issue are important and have been weighed against legal concerns and discussed publicly. ""The attorney general made clear that in taking such a strike, the government must take into account all relevant constitutional considerations. But that under generations-old legal principles, and Supreme Court decisions, U.S. citizenship alone does not make a leader of an enemy force immune from being targeted,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Tuesday, recalling a speech last year by Attorney General Eric Holder. The American Civil Liberties Union called the Justice Department document ""profoundly disturbing."" Hina Shamsi, the director of the ACLU's National Security Project, said, ""It summarizes in cold legal terms a stunning overreach of executive authority, the claimed power to declare Americans a threat and kill them far from a recognized battlefield and without any judicial involvement before or after the fact."" Shamsi called on the Obama administration to release the 50-page legal memo on which the white paper is based. A group of senators also called for the administration to release its legal opinions on presidential authority. ""It is vitally important, however, for the Congress and the American public to have a full understanding of how the executive branch interprets the limits and boundaries of this authority so that Congress and the public can decide whether this authority has been properly defined and whether the president's power to deliberately kill American citizens is subject to appropriate limitations and safeguards,"" according to a letter the lawmakers sent to Obama on Monday. The letter is signed by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, Mark Udall, D-Colorado, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, of the Intelligence Committee as well as Mike Lee, R-Utah; Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon; Dick Durbin, D-Illinois; Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont; Tom Udall, D-New Mexico; Mark Begich, D-Alaska; and Al Franken, D-Minnesota. Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that the Justice Department memo and other information has permitted the Intelligence Committee to conduct ""appropriate and probing"" oversight into the use of lethal force. ""That oversight is ongoing, and the committee continues to seek the actual legal opinions by the Department of Justice that provide details not outlined in this particular white paper,"" Feinstein said.","Justice Department memo sets out the conditions for using lethal force .
The 16-page document is a policy paper, not an official legal document .

"(CNN) -- A former Soviet Army soldier who went missing in action in 1980 during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has been found alive almost 33 years after he was rescued by Afghan tribesmen. Now living under the name of Sheikh Abdullah and working as a traditional healer in the Shindand district of Herat Province in western Afghanistan, former Soviet soldier Bakhredtin Khakimov was an ethnic Uzbek. Khakimov was tracked down by a team from Warriors-Internationalists Affairs Committee, a nonprofit, Moscow-based organization that leads the search for the former Soviet Union's MIAs in Afghanistan. ""He received a heavy wound to the head in the course of a battle in (Shandand) district in September 1980 when he was picked up by local residents,"" the organization said in a statement posted on its website. ""He now leads a seminomadic life with the people who sheltered him."" The organization said it made contact with the man two weeks ago and, while he had no identity papers, he was able to positively identify photos of other Soviets who served at the time. ""He could understand Russian a little bit, but spoke it poorly, although he remembers his Uzbek language,"" the organization said. ""The effects of his wounds were clearly manifested: His hand trembles, and there is a visible tic in his shoulder."" The deputy head of the organization, Alexander Lavrentyev, told a news conference on Monday that Khakimov, originally from the city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan, was nursed back to health by a village elder. The elder was an herbal healer who taught him his trade, Lavrentyev said. ""He was just happy he survived,"" Lavrentyev was reported as saying by Russia's RIA news agency. Lavrentyev met with Khakimov in the city of Herat in late February, . The former soldier -- who married in Afghanistan but is now a childless widower -- was keen to meet his relatives. That's something the committee is working to arrange, Lavrentyev told reporters. A chief of police in Ghor province, Dilwar Dilawar, told CNN Khakimov converted to Islam in 1993. Local reports, however, conflict with the Russian version of events. Local journalist Sharafudin Stanekzai, who spoke with Khakimov, told CNN that Khakimov separated from his unit after stealing a gun and then handed the weapon over to Mujahedeen Islamic guerrillas. The Warriors-Internationalists Affairs Committee is working to track down 263 Soviet soldiers whose fates are unknown after the bloody nine-year campaign in Afghanistan. So far, it says it has tracked down 29 missing Soviet soldiers. Lavrentyev said 22 chose to be repatriated to their homes while seven elected to stay in Afghanistan. About 15,000 of the 600,000 Soviet soldiers who served in the near decade-long war were killed, according to figures cited by RIA from the Soviet General Staff. Regarded as one of the last Cold War confrontations, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan on Christmas Eve 1979 to protect a Soviet-backed government against rebels armed and trained by Western and Islamic countries.","Former Soviet Army soldier who went missing in 1980 found in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- ""Game of Thrones"" is heading into its season four finale with some pretty large expectations. Show runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss have already promised that Sunday's season closer will be the series' best yet, and Kit Harington -- aka Jon Snow -- is making that same bet. ""I think this could be one of the best episodes of 'Thrones' we've done,"" Harington said at a June 11 screening of his new movie, ""How To Train Your Dragon 2."" ""Usually the big impact episode is (the ninth), and then we wrap everything up in the 10th. But this show doesn't like doing what people think is going to happen; we like changing things up, and it's a lot that happens in this episode. It's going to throw a lot of people, it's going to be very exciting."" On ""Game of Thrones,"" ""exciting"" can also be a stand-in for ""bloody"" and ""heartbreaking,"" and chances are Harington's tease will just make fans more nervous for season four's final hour. Eerily titled ""The Children,"" the 10th episode has a lot to wrap up. The penultimate episode, June 8's action-packed ""The Watchers on the Wall,"" was focused entirely on Castle Black up at the Wall, making room for several questions leading into the finale. To begin with, most fans want to know what will happen to Peter Dinklage's Tyrion, who's going into episode 10 staring down a death sentence. As one of the series' most essential characters -- both for his centrality to the story and because of the welcome balance he brings -- it's hard to imagine Tyrion meeting this unjust fate, but ""men meeting unjust fates"" could be another tagline for ""Game of Thrones."" There's also the question of where Arya Stark and the Hound will go from here, now that they've learned the woman they've been searching for this season is dead. (Cue poor orphaned Arya's giggle-fit.) Will they continue their strange mentor-mentee relationship, and if so, what's their next destination? Meanwhile in Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen is now without her most-trusted adviser, Jorah Mormont, but she still has those dragons -- so what's the next step in her game plan? The promo for the season finale hints that at least Bran will find what he's been searching for on his (seemingly endless) vision quest, but reveals little else about what's to come for the rest of the crew. (There is another hint that Arya and the Hound may have a face-off with some unwelcome visitors, which might not bode well for the Hound and his neck wound.) As for Jon Snow, he's ""focused on being a leader"" when episode 10 picks up, Harington teased to Elle magazine. After losing his wildling love, Ygritte, in episode nine, Snow is ""a much colder person after this. He loses a lot of whatever warmth he had, which, let's face it, wasn't a lot. There's a lot of lessons he's learned in this last episode about doing what you need to do to survive and surviving past losing your love is one of those things. At the beginning of episode 10 you see a very broken man."" And, contrary to popular belief, Snow does know something, the actor added. ""He's not naÃ¯ve. He knew there was the possibility of seeing her die or her seeing him die at the battle. You know that thing when you break up with someone and you're walking around the town where you both live and you're just really hoping to see them? You know that you're not supposed to see them, but there's nothing you want more."" Basically, Jon Snow couldn't quit Ygritte, kind of like how we can't quit ""Game of Thrones"" no matter how many heads explode. Yet it doesn't seem we have to worry about the ""traitor bastard's"" head being on the chopping block. Next up for Harington, the actor said, is ""doing 'Thrones' season five."" CNN's Joan Yeam contributed to this report.","Show runners and star say the season four finale is the best yet .
It will have to answer a lot of questions after episode nine .

"(CNN) -- Laura Silsby, the American missionary accused of trying to take nearly three dozen children out of Haiti after the devastating January 12 earthquake, has been freed from jail by a Haitian court, her defense attorney said Monday. Silsby is at the Port-au-Prince airport preparing to board an American Airlines flight to the United States, scheduled to depart at 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), said her lawyer, Chiller Roy. Roy declined to comment on reports that Silsby had been convicted and freed on time served. A Haitian prosecutor was seeking a six-month prison sentence in the case. Silsby was charged with trying to arrange ""irregular travel"" for 33 children she planned to take to an orphanage she was building in the Dominican Republic. She was jailed January 29, along with nine other American missionaries who were later released. Last month, Judge Bernard Saint-Vil dropped kidnapping and criminal association charges against Silsby and the other missionaries. They were stopped while trying to take the children out of the country; authorities said the group didn't have proper legal documentation. Silsby originally said the children were orphaned or abandoned, but the Haitian government and the orphans' charity SOS Children say that all have at least one living parent. Some said they placed their children in Silsby's care because that was the only way they knew to ensure a better quality of life for them. The 10 Americans, many of whom belong to a Baptist church in Idaho, have said they were trying to help the children get to a safe place after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake flattened cities and towns in Haiti.

"(CNN) -- North Korea, under its untested young leader Kim Jong Un, has ratcheted up the threats toward South Korea and the United States to unprecedented levels and with greater intensity than ever before. A torrent of threats has flowed from North Korean spokesmen, including a promise of preemptive nuclear strikes on the United States and calls to ""break the waists of the crazy enemies, totally cut their windpipes and thus clearly show them what a real war is like."" North Korean brinkmanship, bluff, and bluster are stock elements in its diplomatic toolkit, but why have the threats become so outsized, and how worried should we be? Is North Korea playing the same game it has always played, or does the now-nuclear playbook of a rash young leader represent a new threat the we cannot afford to ignore? Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . In some respects, we have seen this movie before. North Korea has long used its bluff and bluster as a form of self-defense to keep potential enemies off guard, to strengthen internal political control, magnify external threats to promote national unity, and to symbolically express dissatisfaction when international trends are not going its way. This year, converging factors are squeezing North Korea, creating a stronger-than-usual response in the face of seemingly greater international pressure. The U.N. Security Council resolution passing financial sanctions on North Korea following its satellite and nuclear tests were tougher than expected, and coincide with U.S.-South Korea military exercises organized to show political resolve to deter North Korean aggression. The establishment of a U.N. Commission of Inquiry into North Korea's human rights situation tarnishes the standing of the new leadership. North Korea's over-the-top responses belie a sense of vulnerability. North Korea has a record of testing the mettle of each new South Korean leader through threats and provocation in an apparent hazing ritual that also determines its strategies toward the South. South Korea has responded threat for threat in recent weeks to signal to North Korea that it will not be blackmailed by its neighbor's seeming nuclear advantage. Recent South Korean media reports of military plans to target thousands of statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in North Korea are virtually guaranteed to throw North Koreans into a frenzy of effort to defend and show loyalty to the Kim family leadership. North Korea's threats: Five things to know . But the intensity and frequency of threats in Kim Jong Un's first year of leadership is uncomfortably high, raising questions about whether junior Kim fully understands the ritualistic rules of the inter-Korean ""threat-down""; whether he might be more accepting of risks than his father, and whether he's more likely to make miscalculations that could drive a hair-trigger situation over the edge. Moreover, no one can be sure whether internal political challenges or a need to consolidate political control are driving young Kim to walk even closer to the edge than usual. North Korea has historically employed guerrilla-style methods in carrying out provocations, using elements of surprise and ambiguity of attribution to avoid risks of full-scale escalation. If North Korea decides to follow through on its threats through direct confrontation, however, this would be evidence that something is going terribly wrong inside its new leadership. How can North Korea's frenzy of threats be brought under control? Past behavior shows a pattern of threats followed by diplomatic ""charm offensives"" designed to ease tensions and reap diplomatic gains in an environment of general relief that the situation has calmed down. Analysis: What's Kim Jong Un up to? Although South Korea and the United States are weary of this game, South Korea has started to provide opportunities for North Korea to climb down as spring military exercises start to wrap up. The new South Korean government has separated humanitarian aid from nuclear weapons negotiations, and President Park Geun-hye has patiently held out an olive branch in the form of her ""trustpolitik"" policy, which promises step-by-step efforts to stabilize inter-Korean relations. Given the North Korean leadership's contradictory need for South Korea to be both an enemy and a source of economic assistance, this might prove to be the more difficult phase in dealing with North Korea as its well-worn strategy of alternating threat and diplomacy continues to yield diminishing returns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott A. Snyder.","Scott Snyder: Kim Jong Un ratchets up threats toward South Korea and U.S. to record level .
Snyder: Bluff, followed by ""charm offensive,"" is typical strategy but Kim gets closer to brink .
We don't know what Kim is trying to prove, Snyder says, or what political events drive him .

"(CNN) -- As a young woman growing up just miles from O'Hare Airport outside of Chicago, Lorraine Rodgers was fascinated with aviation. It was the early 1940s, and Amelia Earhart had become the first woman to fly solo, nonstop across the Atlantic Ocean a decade earlier. Charles Lindbergh had done it a few years before that. ""I read every word I could about them and what they did,"" said Rodgers, now 93. ""I wanted to fly."" Rodgers got a job so she could pay for flying lessons every Saturday. In the fall of 1942, she read in the paper about an experimental program to train female pilots for domestic duty and free up men to fight overseas. The 21-year-old Rodgers was quick to sign up and stood on her tiptoes in order to meet the height requirements. She trained from sunup to sundown, seven days a week at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas, to become part of the Women Airforce Service Pilots program -- ""WASP"" for short. She later moved to what would become her permanent base, Love Field outside Dallas, ferrying military planes all across the country for two years. ""We would go to the plants or factories or the bases and pick up certain planes and deliver them where they were supposed to go,"" she said. It was often dirty work. ""We were oily and covered with sand from flying over the desert. Far from glamorous."" On New Year's Day, these pioneering pilots will be celebrated with a float in the 125th Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, California, part of an effort to bring attention to an often overlooked part of American history. Women pilots honored 65 years after World War II service . First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was an early supporter of the program, writing in a September 1942 newspaper column: ""This is not a time when women should be patient. We are in a war and we need to fight it with all our ability and every weapon possible. Women pilots, in this particular case, are a weapon waiting to be used."" By 1943, 25,000 women had applied to join the WASP program. ""These ranged from farm wives in Iowa to dancers in New York to schoolgirls in California,"" said Kate Landdeck, a history professor at Texas Woman's University who has been studying the program for 20 years. ""All across the country, women applied to this program. All ages."" 'Everything the men did, we gradually took over' Fewer than 2,000 were chosen for training and just over 1,100 served. Between 1942 and 1944, they flew more than 60 million miles in every military aircraft in the arsenal -- bombers, transports and trainer aircraft. In addition to ferrying planes, they flew weather flights, chauffeured top military brass around the country, test-flew planes and even towed targets so male pilots could practice shooting them. ""Everything the men did, we gradually took over,"" Rodgers said. And the men took notice. ""When we were out ferrying planes, the men would come and see it was a girl and smile and wave, but then they would start doing circles around us."" It was a dangerous job. Rodgers once had to bail out of her plane when it went into a tailspin over Texas. Afterward, she wouldn't let go of her parachute's ripcord for hours. Thirty-eight female pilots were killed while serving their country. The program was disbanded with little fanfare in December 1944, months after a bill to give the women military status failed in Congress. ""As the bill was working its way through Congress and being much debated through Congress, at the same time, you have the armed forces marching through Europe towards Germany,"" Landdeck explained. ""And at the same time, you have a group of male pilots who are very actively opposing the women becoming part of the military because they want to do the WASP jobs rather than being shipped overseas -- particularly to Japan, which is where they were going to be most needed."" The very vocal opposition to the plan to officially militarize the WASP program, combined with the success of the war in Europe, meant the legislation had no chance. ""The combination of the two was just enough to kill this fairly radical idea of bringing women into the military as pilots,"" Landdeck said. 'We couldn't believe it. This was our life' Rodgers and many others were devastated. ""When we got the word 'You are out of here December 20th,' we couldn't believe it. This was our life,"" she said. ""They supplied planes with male pilots to fly us all home, and that was it."" Not a day goes by that Rodgers doesn't think about her time in the air, singing to herself in the cockpit high above the clouds. ""I enjoyed every minute,"" she said. ""There was nothing like it."" It wasn't until 1977 that President Jimmy Carter signed legislation -- passed with the help of Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater -- awarding the WASP military status and making participants eligible for veterans' benefits. In 2010, the surviving WASP members were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in a ceremony at the Capitol. Inspired in part by a 2010 float honoring the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of WASP participants and supporters raised nearly $200,000 to build the Rose Parade float to highlight the wartime contributions of these trailblazing women. The Wingtip-to-Wingtip Association, an organization formed to honor the WASP, helped spearhead the effort. Landdeck is part of the group. ""These women are being saluted, and I just think it's a great tribute,"" said Tim Estes, president of Fiesta Parade Floats, the award-winning company that built the float. ""I think it's an important story to tell."" The 20-ton float took more than 2,000 hours to construct and more than twice that time to decorate. Work was set to continue up until Tuesday, attaching pounds of onion, poppy and lettuce seeds, crushed sweet rice and about 35,000 roses. There are fewer than 200 WASP participants still living, and the youngest is 89, Landdeck said. On parade day, eight of them from across the country will ride the float, and 20 other female pilots from airlines and the military will walk alongside it. ""We want the WASP to know that the work that they did during the war -- and the work they've done since in representing women who served as pilots -- that legacy lives on,"" she said. ""Their journey may be ending, but their story isn't finished.""","About 1,100 women served in the Women Airforce Service Pilots program in World War II .

"(CNN) -- An uncle of President Barack Obama was arrested last week in Framingham, Massachusetts, for allegedly operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, police Lt. Ronald Brandolini told CNN on Monday. Onyango Obama was arrested on August 24 after failing a field sobriety test, Brandolini said. An administration official confirmed to CNN that the arrested man is the half-brother of President Obama's father. There was no other administration comment immediately available. According to a a federal law enforcement source who spoke on condition of not being identified, Onyango Obama was not legally in the United States and has been previously ordered removed from the country. His case is now going through the immigration process, the source said. A spokesman at the Department of Homeland Security said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not comment on specific cases. According to a statement from Framingham police, an officer in an unmarked police cruiser stopped Onyango Obama just after 7 p.m. after a sport utility vehicle he was driving failed to make a proper stop at an intersection. The arresting officer, Val Krishtal, said Obama had red and glassy eyes, slurred speech and appeared unsteady on his feet, the statement said. Obama told Krishtal he had consumed two beers, and then failed ""several"" field sobriety tests, according to the statement. Obama was arrested for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, failure to yield and operating a motor vehicle to endanger, the statement said. Obama was being held without bail at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it said.

"(CNN) -- The Walt Disney Company has given notice to the Boy Scouts of America that it will pull all funding to the group starting in 2015 because of a BSA membership policy that bans gay leaders, the entertainment company said Friday. Disney does not give money directly to the national organization or local BSA councils. However, through its VoluntEARS program, Disney allows employees to do volunteer work in exchange for cash donations to the charities of their choice. Employees taking part in the VoluntEARS program will no longer be able to submit the funds to the Boy Scouts, the organization said. The new policy will not affect Walt Disney employees who volunteer with the Scouts, the company said. ""We believe every child deserves the opportunity to be a part of the Scouting experience, and we are disappointed in this decision because it will impact our ability to serve kids,"" BSA spokesman Deron Smith said in a statement. ""America's youth need Scouting, and by continuing to focus on the goals that unite us, we continue to accomplish incredible things for young people and the communities we serve."" Though the Boy Scouts voted last year to allow gay youths to join its ranks, the group maintains a ban on gay Scout leaders. According to Disney's charitable giving guidelines, groups become ineligible to receive Disney funding if they ""discriminate in the provision of services unlawfully or in a manner inconsistent with Disney's policies on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, marital status, mental or physical ability, or sexual orientation."" Disney would not divulge its formula for converting volunteer hours to dollars, but a chart on Disney's corporate website shows that in 2010, employees raised $4.8 million via 548,000 volunteer hours, which works out to $8.79 an hour. Among the events for which employees volunteered were a triathlon for Children's Hospital Los Angeles, the Revlon Run-Walk for cancer, Children's Hospital of Orange County Walk at Disneyland Resort and the Champion 5K at ESPN for the V Foundation, according to Disney. Deena Fidas, the director of workplace equality for the Human Rights Campaign, said Disney's decision ""carries a unique weight. When you think about brands that exemplify childhood, you think of Disney, and with them dissociating with BSA, it speaks volumes of where we are with the views we want to send to young people."" In a recent report, HRC cited numerous victories in its quest to ensure workplace equality and applauded the majority of Fortune 500 companies that now offer sexual-orientation and gender-identity protections to their employees. Despite that, ""we know that over 50% of (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) employees remain closeted on the job,"" the report said. On Thursday, Scouts for Equality, which says it works to end discrimination within the BSA, praised Walt Disney World for ending local support for the BSA's Central Florida Council. ""We're never happy to see Scouting suffer as a result of the BSA's anti-gay policy, but Disney made the right decision to withhold support until Scouting is fully inclusive,"" Eagle Scout and Scouts for Equality co-founder Zach Wahls said in a statement. Scouts for Equality says Disney joins Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar, Major League Soccer, Merck, Intel and UPS as companies who have ended partnerships with the Scouts because of its policy. Fidas said Alcoa and AT&T are also on that list. Openly gay youth now welcome in Boy Scouts of America .","A Disney program allowed employees to give to the Boy Scouts, but no more .

The 200 so-called underground cities of Cappadocia -- dense elaborate networks carved into the soft rock of the Turkish region, capable of sheltering thousands of people -- may have been started as long ago as the 8th century BC. Whoever built them failed to leave their initials on the walls but the Phrygians (an ancient Indo-European tribe) may have been responsible, with later expansion by the Persians. It's known early Christians hid in the man-made caves while they were still being persecuted for their religion. Derinkuyu, extending to a depth of 60 meters, is the largest cave -- it once housed 20,000 people, as well as their livestock. Almost half of Derinkuyu is open to tourists.

"(CNN)  -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice to break the record for goals in a La Liga season as Real Madrid routed Almeria 8-1 in the Bernabeu Saturday night. Ronaldo's goals in each half took him to 40 for the season, two clear of the  previous record set by Athletic Bilbao's Telmo Zarra in 1951 and matched by Real Madrid's Mexican star Hugo Sanchez in 1990. The Portuguese ace notched the record breaking number 39 after just four minutes and slammed home his second in the 76th. On-loan Emmanuel Adebayor grabbed a hat-trick and Karim Benzema scored twice, the second set up by an exquisite backheel from Ronaldo, as Real turned on the style for their fans in their final game. Joselu rounded off the scoring three minutes from time against already relegated Almeria. Former Manchester United star Ronaldo will win the Pichichi crown, the award given for the league's top-scorer, the first Real Madrid player to claim the honor since Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy won it in 2007. ""I would like to thank my team-mates for helping me get these 40 goals,"" ""The season didn't go as we wanted but the coach wanted a lot of goals from us to start the next campaign full of hope,"" he told AFP. Earlier, three-time title winners Barcelona warmed up for their Champions League final against Manchester United with a 3-1 win at Malaga. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola rested several of his star players, including Lionel Messi, ahead of next Saturday's game at Wembley.

"Washington (CNN) -- Sharon Ilstrup was looking forward to a very special date night with her husband, Blake -- a chance to attend one of the Inaugural balls with the president and the first lady. But a mistake by Ticketmaster -- the online sales agent tasked with managing the ticketing process -- led to the early release of all of the tickets to the Inaugural balls and the Inaugural parade, derailing the plans for Ilstrup and thousands of other couples. ""[We] just very excited about the possibility of going to the official Inaugural ball,"" said Ilstrup, 48, whose family of four is traveling across the country from Seattle to Washington for President Barack Obama's second Inauguration. ""We were planning to rent a tux and gown."" It started on Sunday when Ilstrup received an e-mail from Juliana Smoot, the co-chair of the 2013 Presidential Inaugural Committee. The e-mail said that tickets with a unique link would be sent out the next day with access information to purchase the $60-a-piece tickets Inaugural ball tickets on a first-come, first-serve basis. The login allowed people to purchase tickets to the parade as well. ""I was all ready,"" Ilstrup said, ""I was going to stay home [the next day]. ... I would just get on the computer and jump on it."" So when she saw another e-mail come in later that day explaining that tickets were available, she didn't think much of it. But Ilstrup checked the e-mail later and realized that it contained a password and link to purchase the Inaugural ball tickets. ""I tried the Ticketmaster link on Sunday and got an error message. When I finally got in, it showed that both the parade and ball were sold out. Then it showed just the ball. Then just the parade."" ""It was as if the [Presidential Inaugural Committee] was online scrambling to fix the issue. I tried again later and was blocked. My code and password no longer worked,"" she explained. Civil rights leader's widow to give invocation at Obama's inauguration . A third e-mail, this time from Ticketmaster, sent out later Sunday night explained the mix-up: . ""Public tickets to these events were originally scheduled to go on sale tomorrow morning -- you received the e-mail tonight in error, and Ticketmaster takes responsibility for this mistake,"" the message said. Ilstrup wasn't the only person upset by the glitch. The Presidential Inaugural Committee Facebook page was lit up by people upset, angry and confused. Some even thought it was a conspiracy to get tickets to a select group of attendees. ""Agree that [Ticketmaster] and [Presidential Inaugural Committee] certainly knew. It seems likely that such a sophomoric 'mistake' was planned by someone and those tickets will be seen on the black market soon,"" Kathleen Falconer-Finnegan wrote on the Presidential Inaugural Committee's Facebook page. ""I think that the PIC and TM should cancel all tickets sold before the scheduled time and start over. This is the only honest thing to do and certainly possible given the event is more than 2 weeks away..."" ""Kimberly W"" from Atlanta started a petition on the White House website to, ""Add another public Inaugural Ball or have the erroneous Ticketmaster Ball ticket sales voided."" The petition has received seven signatures -- just 24,993 short of the threshold needed for the White House to address the issue. Chief Justice Roberts to get another go at oath . A Presidential Inaugural Committee spokesperson revealed later that the e-mail containing the access information was supposed to be a test, but was instead sent as the live e-mail. ""On Sunday evening, Ticketmaster experienced a technical error that inadvertently caused an e-mail to go out ahead of schedule to people who had signed up for Inaugural ticketing information with an invitation to purchase public tickets for The Inaugural Ball and the Inaugural Parade,"" the spokesperson said. ""The Ticketmaster website was overwhelmed, slowing the purchasing process. Ticketmaster has taken responsibility for this mistake."" But the e-mail explaining the mix-up is was little solace to Ilstrup who thinks that the tickets should be null and void and the process begun again, anew. ""You show up at the start time ready to go and its fair game,"" Ilstrup said. ""Its not a fair game when some people were able to show up to the race start a day early and win."" A PIC spokeswoman said that the Presidential Inaugural Committee would honor the sold-out tickets to the Inaugural parade and the ball. The website explains now that due to an overwhelming demand, no more tickets are available. And while the Ilstrups, who are Obama supporters, are disappointed that they won't get their night on the town, their visit, which is meant to be an educational experience for their children -- Alec, 14 and Anna, 11 -- won't be a complete loss. The family previously secured tickets to the Inauguration through their local Member of Congress. Still, shut out of the balls means that a special date night is now all but out of reach. ""The good news is, you can now go on eBay and purchase tickets to the ball for $6,500,"" Ilstrup joked. Indeed, individual tickets and bundled tickets to the official Inaugural ball have been going for thousands of dollars on both eBay and Craigslist. But PIC spokeswoman Addie Whisenant told CNN that ""Tickets to official Inaugural events may not be sold, resold or offered for resale in any manner unless expressly authorized by the Presidential Inaugural Committee (PIC). Tickets may be revoked at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of the PIC."" She added that the inauguration committee is reaching out to ticket brokers and online distributors to seek the ""nullification of those tickets"" sold through unauthorized outlets.","Ticketmaster was supposed to distribute tickets to the Inaugural balls and parade .
They mistakenly released the tickets early, and they were sold out when most of the public went looking for them .
Thousands were shut out, upset at the snafu .
The Presidential Inaugural Committee said no more tickets are available ."
"(Budget Travel) -- If you tirelessly rack up frequent-flier miles only to encounter snags when you try to redeem them, it's time you discovered the increasingly generous world of hotel reward programs. Short on both business and leisure travelers of late, hotel chains are doing whatever it takes to fill their beds. ""This is an awfully good time to be using hotel points,"" says Tim Winship, publisher of FrequentFlier.com, a site that tracks loyalty programs. ""You'll save money, and you shouldn't have any problems getting a free night."" Rick Ingersoll knows full well how generous hotels can be. The retired mortgage banker and his wife, Katy, aren't paying a dime for 58 of the 61 nights they've booked on an around-the-world trip starting in April. The couple piled up points with five different chains by using hotel-reward credit cards and signing up for all the giveaways they could find. (They even endured a 90-minute time-share tour in Hawaii to earn 7,500 Starwood points.) ""It takes time to learn the system, and you've got to keep your eyes open,"" says Ingersoll, who pens a blog on travel deals, FrugalTravelGuy.blogspot.com. ""But I rarely pay for a hotel room."" Budget Travel: Best value hotels . Stay (almost) any night . Many travelers have long harbored a big gripe when it comes to hotel loyalty programs: blackout dates. But those discouraging words may be a thing of the past. Initially, Starwood was the only chain that allowed rewards members to trade in points for a room on any night. But then InterContinental and Hyatt followed suit in the early 2000s, and two other biggies, Hilton and Marriott, relaxed their rules this past year. Fantastic news, right? Unfortunately, there's often a hitch: Many chains still have what are known in hotel lingo as capacity controls, or curbs on the number of rooms available to loyalty club members during peak travel times. Of the major players, only Hilton and Starwood claim not to have any capacity controls, while Marriott, InterContinental, and Hyatt admit that some standard rooms are off-limits on popular nights, such as New Year's Eve at the New York Marriott Marquis overlooking Times Square. One other alert: Some chains require that you keep your account active every year by earning or redeeming points -- or your stash will disappear. Have a hotel shopping spree . A free room isn't the only thing your points buy -- InterContinental has iPod Nanos and Nintendo Wiis for sale at its online mall, Marriott dangles rounds of golf at its links in Jamaica and Hawaii, and Hilton hawks tickets to Saturday Night Live tapings. Not to be outdone, Starwood last fall became the first chain to allow rewards members to directly exchange hotel points for airfare. For example, a round-trip ticket worth about $350 on any airline costs 25,000 points -- and there are no dreaded blackout dates or extra fees. Another plus for loyalty members is the current bonanza of point bonuses. Starwood recently showered guests at its Aloft hotels with quadruple the points they'd normally earn for a night, while Hyatt is bestowing between 2,000 and 20,000 extra points for stays of two to eight nights through the end of April. A great resource for finding these bonuses is the delightfully nerdy new Web site PointMaven.com, which has a database of thousands of offers across the country, color-coded to show the best deals. Finding the right match . Because every program is different -- and many can be mind-numbingly complex -- comparing them is tricky. For one, every chain has its own formula for calculating how points are earned. Marriott doles out 10 points per dollar spent at most of its hotels, Starwood awards two points per dollar, and InterContinental allots 2,000 points per visit at its main brand, no matter how long you stay. Many chains also have partnerships with credit card companies, allowing you to amass points every time you make a charge. The cards are usually free for the first year, and hotels often give away as many as 25,000 points just for signing up. Trading in your cache is another matter: Each chain requires a different number of points for a room, depending on the grade of the property and the desirability of the location. You'll spend 7,500 points for a night at a low-frills Marriott hotel (such as a Fairfield Inn) or a whopping 20,000 points to live it up at the deluxe Atlanta Marriott Downtown. To help you zero in on the program for you, we've broken down exactly how much you have to spend in dollars to earn a free night at five of the biggest chains (see the chart). Experts have their favorite programs. Randy Petersen, publisher of InsideFlyer.com, another Web site that tracks loyalty clubs, likes Starwood's cash-and-points option, which lets travelers use money to make up the difference when they don't have enough points for a free stay. Ingersoll is a fan of InterContinental's PointBreaks promotions, which make rooms available for 5,000 points, half the normal rate. His best piece of advice: Just dive in. ""It doesn't cost anything to sign up, so join all the programs. Then stay poised for the deal with your name on it.""

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- Prosecutors say a 25-year-old Army private accused of aiding the nation's enemies through the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history ""craved"" notoriety. The defense on Monday painted Pfc. Bradley Manning as ""naive but good-intentioned."" So began the first day of the former intelligence analyst's court-martial at Fort Meade in Maryland. It could be the beginning of the end of a saga that began three years ago when thousands of classified Afghanistan and Iraq war documents appeared on WikiLeaks.com. Some of the U.S. documents that appeared on WikiLeaks were shared and then analyzed and reported on by major news outlets such as The New York Times, the UK newspaper the Guardian and Germany's der Spiegel. Though WikiLeaks' founder, Julian Assange, has grabbed much of the international media spotlight since that time, Manning's trial has fanned debate. Is he a hero or a traitor? In February, Manning pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 charges he faced and could be sentenced to two decades in prison on those charges. But he has not admitted to the most serious count -- aiding the enemies of the United States. If convicted on that count, he could go to prison for life. In an hourlong opening statement Monday, prosecutor Capt. Joe Morrow said Manning had access and incentive to provide information to the enemy, including information later found in Osama bin Laden's hideout. He said the government will provide evidence that material al Qaeda operators had delivered to bin Laden can be traced to Manning's illicit downloading and transmission to WikiLeaks. Morrow also said Manning helped WikiLeaks edit the cockpit video from a U.S. helicopter gunship attack that killed about a dozen people in Iraq, including two Reuters photojournalists, in 2007. An Army aviator will testify how the video can be useful to adversaries, Morrow said. The video showed Reuters photographer Saeed Chmagh had survived an initial strafing by the gunship, but he apparently died when the fliers opened fire on people attempting to get him off the sidewalk where he lay. A U.S. investigation into the attack found that the crew mistook the journalists' cameras for weapons while seeking out insurgents who had been firing at American troops in the area. Morrow said disclosures such as the video and other documents WikiLeaks released represented ""potentially actionable information for targeting U.S. forces."" And he said Manning, who appeared in court in his full-dress uniform, ""used his military training to gain the notoriety he craved."" The prosecutor showed slides as part of his statement. The first slide was said to be a quote from a message Manning once posted, using the instant message handle ""bradass87."" ""If you had unprecedented access to classified networks 14 hours a day 7 days a week for 8+ months, what would you do?"" it read. That is purportedly part of a string of instant messages that a person -- alleged to be Manning -- sent to ex-hacker Adrian Lamo. Manning, who was based in Iraq, allegedly instant-messaged Lamo and, over a period of days, said that he had accessed documents. Lamo has said he reported Manning to authorities. Prosecutors also said Monday that they plan to call forensic experts who recovered chat logs from computers, purported conversations between Manning and Assange, that will allegedly show how they worked together. The government's case hopes to convince the military judge that Manning, an intelligence analyst, ""systematically harvested 700,000 government documents, and attempted to hide what he was doing."" Soldier's supporters . Manning's supporters have adopted the phrase: ""I am Bradley Manning."" One of the country's most famous leakers, Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers, says Manning should be viewed as a hero. The Pentagon Papers showed that the government had lied to Congress and the public about the progress of the Vietnam War. Ellsberg provided all 7,000 pages to The New York Times, which published them in 1971. During the February hearing, Manning spent more than an hour reading a statement that detailed why and how he sent classified material to WikiLeaks. He said he passed on information that ""upset"" or ""disturbed"" him but he didn't give WikiLeaks anything he thought would harm the United States if it were made public. ""I believed if the public was aware of the data, it would start a public debate of the wars,"" he told the court. On Monday, Manning's civilian lawyer, David Coombs, told the military judge his client lives by a philosophy that values life, and that he had a custom-made inscription with the word ""humanist,"" on the back of his dog tags. ""He's 22, excited to be in Iraq, hopefully to make Iraq a safer place,"" Coombs said, characterizing his client's mindset as he began his deployment. But Manning became deeply affected by an attack on a convoy with his comrades. A roadside bomb exploded beneath a car full of civilians that had pulled aside to let the military vehicles pass. Although members of his 305th Military Intelligence Battalion were not hurt, Coombs said, at least one civilian was killed. That changed Manning's outlook on the war, his lawyer said. He ""struggled."" Manning was affected by knowing that civilians were hurt while trying to getting out of the way of the U.S. convoy. Manning then started selecting information to reveal, believing that it would be better if it were public, Coombs said. Coombs said his client was selective in the information he diverted from a controlled-access computer system where he worked as an ""all source"" intelligence analyst. That includes U.S. State Department cables that WikiLeaks published. The diplomatic messages, Manning felt, ""showed how we dealt with other countries, how we valued life, and how we didn't,"" Coombs said in court Monday. ""Unfortunately, in his youth, he didn't think we (the United States) always did the right thing."" Memory card from an aunt's computer . Military officials at Fort Meade say the spectators in the courtroom Monday included Manning's aunt and a cousin. Prosecutors said investigators recovered a computer memory card from the aunt's home in Potomac, Maryland. The government said it contained classified information that Manning downloaded, and that forensic analysts would testify how they traced it back to him. Also among the spectators Monday was Medea Benjamin, a co-founder of the activist group Code Pink, who recently disrupted a presidential speech to protest conditions for detainees the U.S. holds at the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Manning is accused of downloading and transmitting hundreds of detainee assessments conducted at Guantanamo. Prosecutors say investigators recovered chat logs in which Manning later discusses the value of those reports with Assange. Prosecutors plan to call several forensic investigators as witnesses. In his statement in February, Manning said he initially contacted The Washington Post and The New York Times to offer information. He said he either wasn't taken seriously or got voice mail, so he gave the material to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information. Protests before the trial . On Saturday, Manning's supporters rallied outside Fort Meade. ""People came from great distances to stand with a true American hero,"" said Jeff Paterson, director of the Bradley Manning Support Network. ""From Bradley's demeanor in court, it's clear he takes strength from the outpouring of support."" Manning was formally charged in February 2012. On the eve of the court-martial, his lawyer, Coombs, issued a rare public statement through his website. He thanked those who raised money and awareness over the past three years, bringing ""worldwide attention to this important case."" 2012: Prosecutors say Manning didn't report any mistreatment to them . CNN's Paul Courson reported from Fort Meade and Ashley Fantz wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Carol Cratty, Larry Shaughnessy and Mark Morgenstein contributed to this report.","Pfc.

"(CNN) -- If Cristiano Ronaldo feels threatened by Gareth Bale's arrival at Real Madrid, it certainly isn't showing in his performances. Ronaldo followed up his midweek Champions League treble with another two goals in Sunday's 4-1 win over Getafe, while this season's marquee signing Bale was unable to make his home debut due to an injury suffered in the warmup. The win kept Real in third place, two points behind Barcelona and Atletico Madrid after five matches, and the double lifted Ronaldo into fifth on the club's all-time scoring list with 208. Ronaldo failed to score in Real's opening two La Liga matches, but including his hat-trick for Portugal in a World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland he now has 10 goals in his last five games -- fully vindicating the bumper new contract he signed after Bale arrived. Bale -- a world-record signing according to his former club Tottenham, but not as expensive as Ronaldo was in 2009 according to Real -- was replaced in the starting lineup at the Bernabeu by the highly-rated Isco, another newcomer to Madrid. Bale scored on his debut in the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, playing an hour, and also came on to replace Isco in the 6-1 Champions League thrashing of Galatasaray -- but his only other time on the pitch this season is a substitute appearance for Wales before joining up with Carlo Ancelotti's squad. ""He had a small problem in the warmup. I don't think it is a big problem, but we have to wait till tomorrow to do a scan to see how bad the injury is,"" Ancelotti told reporters. ""The player wasn't comfortable, he was worried, so it was better to avoid problems. He was desperate to play his first game in the Bernabeu, but he has plenty of games ahead of him here. ""His pre-season was very unusual, not just physically, but mentally too. He was waiting for a long time (before signing) and I think this is a problem."" Getafe stunned the home crowd by taking the lead in the fourth minute when Angel Lafita's shot deflected in off Pepe, but the Real defender equalized just before 20 minutes after Ronaldo's shot was only blocked by keeper Miguel Angel Moya. Ronaldo put Los Blancos ahead just after half an hour from the penalty spot, as Michel was ruled to have deliberately handled his free-kick inside the area, and he joined Real's former Mexico star Hugo Sanchez on 207 goals. Isco, who last season inspired Malaga to the Champions League quarterfinals despite the club's financial problems, made it 3-1 in the 57th minute. Fed by Ronaldo's quick free-kick, the 21-year-old Spain international made no mistake with his fifth goal in six games. Getafe had Michel sent off five minutes from time when the midfielder was booked a second time, and Ronaldo crowned his night with a cheeky backheel to score from Sami Khedira's low cross. Promoted Villarreal stayed fourth after drawing 0-0 at Celta Vigo, while there was a mid-table stalemate between Real Betis and Granada. Valencia ended a run of three La Liga defeats and a Europa League loss to Swansea by beating bottom club Sevilla 3-1, as Jonas scored twice. Meanwhile, Sunday's Istanbul derby between Besiktas and Galatasaray was abandoned due to crowd trouble at the end of the match between two of Turkey's leading teams. Galatasaray had led 2-1 through two goals by Ivory Coast veteran Didier Drogba when his Brazilian teammate Felipe Melo was sent off in time added on, and fans then invaded the pitch. ""How the proceedings will continue will be announced later by the Turkey Football Federation,"" the Galatasaray website reported. In Italy, Roma went top on goal difference after beating Lazio 2-0 in the capital derby for a fourth successive win. Second-half goals from Federico Balzaretti and Adem Ljajic put the Giallorossi marginally above Napoli -- also with a 100% record after winning 2-1 at AC Milan. Uruguayan defender Miguel Britos put Rafael Benitez's team ahead in the sixth minute and Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain doubled the lead on 53 before Mario Balotelli's late consolation for 11th-placed Milan. However, the Italy striker had earlier missed the first penalty of his professional career, saved by keeper Pepe Reina, as Napoli beat Milan at the San Siro for the first time since 1986. Third-placed Inter Milan crushed Sassuolo 7-0 as Argentine striker Diego Milito marked his long-awaited return from a serious knee injury with two goals. It left Fiorentina fourth on goal difference after a 2-0 win at Atalanta, while fifth-placed defending champion Juventus also ha 10 points after coming from behind to beat Verona 2-1 thanks to goals from summer signings Carlos Tevez and Fernando Llorente. The battle for supremacy between France's two big-spending clubs ended in a 1-1 draw as Monaco came from behind to deny defending champion Paris Saint-Germain. Zlatan Ibrahimovic put the home side ahead but Radamel Falcao -- like his Swedish striking counterpart, a marquee signing of intent -- leveled to keep Monaco top of the table, two points ahead of second-placed PSG.","Cristiano Ronaldo scores twice as Real Madrid beats Getafe 4-1 on Sunday .

"New York (CNN) -- The FBI said Friday that white powder found at New Jersey hotels near the site of the Super Bowl and at the Manhattan office of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani proved to be non-hazardous. Hazardous materials teams and bomb squads responded after white powder was found at several hotels near New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, authorities said. In a statement late Friday, the New Jersey State Police said most of the locations that the Joint Terrorism Task Force and hazard materials responded to because of the suspicious powder had been secured. No injuries were reported. The FBI In New York tweeted Friday afternoon: ""Substances in suspicious letters in New York and New Jersey deemed non hazardous. Additional testing to come."" The contents of one letter sent to the Homewood Suites in East Rutherford were tested and determined to be cornstarch, East Rutherford Mayor James Cassella said. A New York police spokesman said the letter sent to Giuliani's office contained a ""nontoxic substance."" Still, eight employees in the mail room were decontaminated as a precaution, and no one has shown any sign of illness, he said. Giuliani told CNN's Wolf Bitzer on The Situation Room that the letter with white powder was addressed to his administrative assistant. ""Of course, it created tremendous concern,"" he said. ""But the police department showed up. My firm . ... is a security firm, thank goodness, so they knew how to handle it immediately. They did a a test. The preliminary test is that it's nontoxic... We don't know if it's connected to the six or seven that were sent in New Jersey."" He added, ""It's kind of a strange letter, more than a threatening letter. Said something about 'you're being my best friend' and this person is not my best friend or my assistant's best friend, or anyone we know. ... At this point, all we know is the good news is it's not toxic. The bad news is we don't really know if it's connected."" The letter was postmarked from Toronto, Ontario, and contained a name and return address. New York law enforcement authorities were in touch with Canadian authorities to pursue the source of the letter, police said. In New Jersey, Hackensack University Medical Center evaluated some people who may have come in contact with the suspicious letters, a State Police spokesman said. No illnesses or injuries were reported. In a statement, the FBI said earlier Friday: ""The Joint Terrorism Task Force and Hazard Materials units have responded to several locations that have received a suspicious letter and substance. There are no reported injuries at this time, and the locations are being secured."" The scares come amid tight security before Sunday's game. More air marshals and behavioral detection officers, radiological detection teams and random baggage checks at transit hubs are among the security measures the federal Homeland Security Department deployed to help local police in New Jersey and New York secure the Super Bowl. The stadium's location near a major airport and busy commuter train lines presents security challenges. Unlike audiences for other championship games, spectators of Super Bowl XLVIII will rely heavily on mass transit. Chris Murray, business management president at the Quality Inn in Lyndhurst, said the hotel received a suspicious letter but he did not know what was inside the envelope. He said local police were at the hotel and that a Hazmat team and bomb squad were expected to examine the letter. Murray said other hotels on the same corner in Lyndhurst also received suspicious envelopes, including the Renaissance and Marriott Courtyard. The letter was sitting on a desk in his office, Murray said. Other hotels that received suspicious packages included the Econo Lodge, Holiday Inn and Hampton Inn in Carlstadt, and Renaissance Inn and Homestead in Rutherford. Law enforcement officials said six letters were discovered in New Jersey. CNN's Ross Levitt, Allie Malloy, Haimy Assefa, Haley Draznin and Julia Lull contributed to this report.","FBI says content of letters isn't hazardous .

"(EW.com ) -- Do you belieb that one of Canada's biggest exports could be deported as a result of his recent Miami arrest? The possibility is slim. Nevertheless, less than a week after it was first posted to the government's ""We the People"" platform, over 100,000 Americans have signed a petition asking the Obama administration to revoke Bieber's green card. (Why? Because ""he is not only threatening the safety of our people but he is also a terrible influence on our nations youth."") And according to the site's terms of participation, this means that the White House must now respond to the petition ""in a timely fashion."" Just don't expect that response to come soon â€” or to affirm that Bieber really will be kicked off our amber waves of grain. Facetious pop culture petitions aren't exactly a top priority for the White House; in the past, they've taken two months to respond to calls for the construction of a Death Star (""The Administration does not support blowing up planets"") and the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel Live! following an offensive segment (""The First Amendment of the Constitution protects free speech, even if individuals might personally find it offensive or distasteful""). And perhaps more importantly, DUIs and drag-racing aren't deportable offenses. As The Hollywood Reporter points out, immigration visas can only be revoked in the event of a violent crime or a prison sentence that exceeds one year; Bieber faces an array of potential consequences, but if he is sentenced to prison, he'd only get up to six months for drag racing and up to six months for the DUI. Bieber's arraignment is scheduled for Feb. 14. In the meantime, he'll be kept busy with his Los Angeles egging charges and, perhaps, the sale of his Calabasas mansion.

"Singapore (CNN) -- Lior Peleg cuts an incongruous figure at the Singapore Airshow. Among the suited middle-aged men selling military hardware she looks more like a beach-loving backpacker, casually dressed in a black tank-top with a camera slung around her neck. But what really marks her out among all the arms salesmen touting the newest military technology -- ""lethal but affordable"" reads one sign above a missile manufacturer -- is that she one of the few people present with operational military experience. She's a former drone pilot for the Israeli military and represents the new face of air force pilots. Peleg now works for Israel Aerospace Industries training future operators of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Typically they would sit in front of a number of display monitors, often thousands of miles away from the drones themselves, using just a mouse, joystick and ergonomic pad to direct the deadly payload. Training takes only a few months depending on the trainee's knowledge, she says, and it helps to know something about aeronautics and physics. But so far removed are modern unmanned aerial vehicle pilots from their counterparts in cockpits, that basic computer knowledge isn't even essential before learning to fly a UAV. ""Some (we train) don't know how to use a mouse,"" says Nir Tel-Oren, a senior consultant the Israel Aerospace Industries. ""Not all of our customers are in the modern world,"" he adds. Drones have become a huge part of military operations across the world. According to a U.S. Congressional research paper, the U.S. has nearly 7,500 UAVs of all sizes and capabilities, making up nearly a third of all its military aircraft, compared to 2005 when they were one in twenty. That ratio will probably rise in the next few years with some in the industry predicting that within five years half of U.S. military aircraft will be unmanned. Other countries, from the Caucuses to Southeast Asia, are developing their own UAV systems, made possible by their relative cheapness compared to manned aircraft. From the smallest that can be launched by hand to the largest that can be the same size as a Boeing 737, drones are used to do what most in the industry call the three Ds: dull, dirty and dangerous. The ""dull"" part covers missions like border surveillance and maritime patrols that need eyes in the sky for hours at a time. ""Dirty"" is much more open to interpretation, but the ""dangerous"" part is clearly defined as when a pilot in a similar mission could become a casualty. Tel-Oren was a pilot in the Israeli air force and can recall missions he might rather have not have flown when he was a pilot. While obviously an advocate for unmanned systems, he suggests their role can be divisive, even within his own family. ""My son is a pilot in the air force and we have a lot of arguments. I believe that unmanned technology will take over and do some missions that I would prefer my son not to do; he thinks otherwise,"" he says. More UAVs in missions also brings into question the role of humans in combat environments. As well as keeping pilots out of danger, could keeping a human out of an immediate mission area lead to better, calmer decisions being made during critical missions? ""It depends on the mission, but you'll always need to have that critical thinking capability in a pilot,"" says Major Rod Secor of the U.S. Army's Unmanned Aircraft Systems division. ""You need people to assess situations, especially landing in a hot zone of some sort, but I think it is the future for our defense; more and more unmanned."" Unmanned land vehicles that can offer support behind ground troops or drive themselves in convoys are still being trialed and developed by the likes of Lockheed Martin, but aerial drones are now so prevalent that some in the industry think the market is saturated with manufacturers. Yet as UAV technology improves they are set to become an even more important part of security and military operations -- part of a system that gathers and relays information to other drones, ground control, manned aircraft and satellites. ""They've become a network of networks, like the internet,"" says Tel-Oren, who says IAI alone has a $10.5 billion backorder for UAVs and the communications systems they are part of. As well as a different face, Peleg then represents just one small part of this new network changing the way militaries operate. On a human level they are quite straightforward, ""UAVs are easy to fly,"" she says. ""Anyone can be trained.""","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles -- drones -- now a huge part of military operations across globe .

"Washington (CNN) -- Assisted by a colorful cast of characters, Comedy Central funnymen Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert held a raucous rally on the National Mall Saturday in typical fashion before a cheering throng of supporters. Amidst all the hilarity, however, the ""Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear"" carried a message about Americans turning their backs on hate and working together to make the world a better place. Stewart and Colbert staged a mock battle, with Stewart supporting peace and sanity and Colbert promoting fear before a crowd that stretched nearly the length of the mall, most of the distance between the Capitol and the Washington Monument. During the rally's opening, Colbert appeared on a video screen, saying he was trapped in his ""fear bunker"" and worried no one had shown up. Drawn by cheers, however, Colbert ascended to the stage in a device like that used to bring up the trapped Chilean miners earlier this month, wearing a superhero costume. Former ""Saturday Night Live"" character Father Guido Sarducci -- played by comedian Don Novello -- provided a benediction, thanking God for ""making it so easy to find parking spaces."" And actor Sam Waterston of ""Law and Order"" fame read a poem entitled ""Are You Sure?"" about fears including ""funnel clouds and hail/Anthrax in the mail ... someone's robbing your house/I can see through your blouse/Your mother was right, you chose the wrong spouse."" Cat Stevens, who now goes by Yusuf Islam, sang his song ""Peace Train"" as part of a duel with Ozzy Osbourne singing ""Crazy Train."" Stewart stopped Osbourne, rooting for Islam, as Colbert urged Osbourne on. The two compromised on the O'Jays, who showed up to sing their hit ""Love Train."" CNN's Pete Dominick on the rally . Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and ""Star Wars"" robot R2-D2 provided a lesson in tolerance and against stereotyping. ""We're all on the same team,"" said Abdul-Jabbar, referencing Colbert and Stewart's discussion about Muslims. There were some serious notes struck during the event, however. Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow performed a musical number about changing the world, including the lyrics, ""The least that I can do is care."" ""This was not a rally to ridicule people of faith, or people of activism, or to look down our noses at the heartland, or passionate argument, or to suggest that times are not difficult and we have nothing to fear,"" Stewart told the crowd as the rally drew to a close. ""They are, and we do. But we live now in hard times, not end times. And we can have animus and not be enemies, but unfortunately one of our main tools in delineating the two broke."" He was speaking of what he called ""the country's 24-hour politico pundit perpetual panic conflictinator."" It did not cause the nation's problems, Stewart said, ""but its existence makes solving them that much harder ... If we amplify everything, we hear nothing."" Crowd: Serve us up sanity, not Tea . ""There are terrorists and racists and Stalinists and theocrats, but those are titles that must be earned,"" Stewart said. ""You must have the resume. Not being able to distinguish between real racists and tea partiers, or real bigots and Juan Williams or Rick Sanchez is an insult, not only to those people, but to the racists themselves, who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate -- just as the inability to distinguish terrorists from Muslims makes us less safe, not more."" Most Americans, he said, don't live their lives solely as Republicans or Democrats, but as ""people who are just a little bit late for something they have to do, often something they do not want to do. But they do it."" Some may paint the nation as fragile and torn by hate, he said, ""but the truth is ... we work together to get things done every damn day."" ""There will always be darkness, and sometimes the light at the end of the tunnel isn't the promised land,"" Stewart said. ""Sometimes it's just New Jersey. But we do it anyway, together."" After the rally, Stewart and Colbert deflected questions from reporters about whether they would attempt to parlay the rally into a sustained movement. ""We're not running for anything,"" Stewart said at the National Press Club. ""We don't have a constituency,"" he said. ""We do television shows for people that like them and we hope that they continue to like them so that Comedy Central can continue to sell beer to young people."" ""We wanted to do a really good show for people that wanted it,"" he said of the rally. Asked what his next steps would be, Colbert said, ""We have a show on Monday and we have to go write that and we have a live show Tuesday."" At the rally, Stewart awarded his ""Medals of Reasonableness"" to recipients including Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga, who lost a perfect game in June when an umpire mistakenly called what would have been the last batter safe at first base despite the fact replays showed he was clearly out. Galarraga, who lives in Venezuela, accepted via videotape, telling the audience the umpire is ""a good man."" Another recipient was Velma Hart, chief financial officer for AMVETS, who challenged President Barack Obama at a town hall meeting in September; and comedian and wrestler Mick Foley; and Jacob Isom. A video of Isom telling how he swiped a kerosene-soaked Quran from would-be burners, telling them, ""Dude, you have no Quran,"" went viral, and was set to a dance mix. Colbert's ""Medals of Fear"" went to recipients including a 7-year-old girl who he said had more courage than the media organizations who did not send representatives to cover the rally out of fear they would appear biased, as well as to ""Anderson Cooper's tight black T-shirt."" Colbert said that when CNN's Cooper ""shows up on your front yard, you know something terrible has happened in your community."" A small black T-shirt was brought on stage on a hanger, and the medal hung on it. Stewart and Colbert announced the rally in September, less than three weeks after conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck hosted a much-publicized ""Restoring Honor"" rally on the National Mall, urging large crowds to ""turn back to God"" and return America to the values on which it was founded. CNN's Kate Bolduan and Ed Hornick contributed to this report.","NEW: Stewart after the rally: ""We don't have a constituency""

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo provided the perfect riposte to FIFA president Sepp Blatter after scoring a hat-trick as Real Madrid beat Sevilla 7-3 on a night when Gareth Bale grabbed his first goals at the Bernabeu. Days after Blatter had made a bizarre impersonation of the Portuguese while saying the star spent ""a lot of money at the hairdressers"", the 28-year-old scored his third career hat-trick against Sevilla to go top of the scoring charts in Spain with 11 goals. He celebrated his first goal from the penalty spot with a military salute in a mocking response to Blatter's description of him as a ""commander"" last week. The absorbing victory also allowed Real to put Saturday's defeat by Barcelona behind them, not just because of the three points but also because Bale, the most expensive footballer in history, began to repay some of his fee. Making his first start as a home player at the legendary Bernabeu, the Welshman scored twice, made another two and also managed to complete his first 90 minutes in his seventh appearance for Madrid. Despite Bale's largely anonymous display at Camp Nou, which was blamed on a lack of match practice, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti was wholly vindicated by his decision to keep faith in the 24-year-old, who curled home a fine opener before a free-kick was deflected in as he handed Real a 2-0 lead. On a satisfying night for the hosts, for whom substitute Xabi Alonso made his first appearance of the season after injury, Karim Benzema also grabbed a brace as Real moved up to third in the table, six points behind Barca. Sevilla were reduced to 10 men late on when Stephane Mbia received his second yellow card. In Italy, both Napoli and Juventus closed the gap on Roma to just two points, but the league leaders can extend their lead -- and register a perfect 10 victories from their opening 10 league games -- when hosting bottom side Chievo on Thursday. Goals from Jose Maria Callejon and Dries Mertens helped Napoli win 2-1 at Fiorentina, with both sides reduced to 10 men late on, while Andrea Pirlo and Carlos Tevez were among the goals as Juventus thumped Catania 4-0 at home. Elsewhere, Brazilian Kaka scored his first goal since returning for AC Milan as the seven-time European champions were held to a 1-1 draw by visitors Lazio. One of the most surprising results of the night came in France, where big spending Monaco suffered their first defeat of the season at the hands of fellow Ligue 1 side Reims in the League Cup. Fielding a weakened side that was deprived of the suspended Radamel Falcao, Monaco were knocked out of the cup after suffering their first defeat since May -- as midfielder Antoine Devaux fired home in the first half. Claudio Ranieri's side travel to Lille, who have not conceded a goal in six league games, at the weekend in a battle of the two sides immediately behind Paris Saint-Germain at the top of the table. In England, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City both progressed to the quarterfinals with respective victories over Hull City and Newcastle United. City won 2-0 in extra-time thanks to goals from Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko, while Spurs won through 8-7 on penalties after drawing 2-2 at home against Hull. Spurs' win capped a miserable week in London for Egypt's Ahmed Elmohamady, who missed the decisive penalty just days after being penalized for a harsh handball in Tottenham's 1-0 league win against the same opponents on Saturday.","Ronaldo hits a hat-trick and Bale a double as Real Madrid beat Sevilla 7-3 .

"(CNN) -- OK, there's no way to write this article without name dropping. To cut to the chase, I know Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, and you don't. I used to work for ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report"" as the audience warm-up act. Not a bad day job. But knowing the hosts didn't mean I got to parade on stage at Saturday's ""Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear."" I was in the audience with the thousands of fans, reporting on the events for CNN. But the audience was where the real spectacle unfolded this weekend. Stewart, Colbert preside over rally . In a lot of ways, the people congregating on the National Mall looked just like the people I used to perform for back at ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report."" Black, white, Hispanic, old, young -- every race, every  ethnicity and every age group was represented in the sea of fans. The unifying characteristic, however, was that they were overwhelmingly thoughtful and hilarious Americans. They appreciate good comedy and political satire. And they know how to create it themselves. That was made was obvious in the signs they carried. ""God Hates Nags,"" ""Hitler was a total Nazi"" and the mundane but humorous ""this is not a protest sign."" And like all good comedy shows, everyone sported a smile. Humor brought everyone together. In the days to come, there will be some commentators questioning whether Stewart and Colbert crossed the line from comedians to political commentators. In all honesty, I'd say, yeah, I think they did make a political stance at the rally. The fact is comedy is an art form. And comedians are artists. People at rally: No Tea please . You can't be passionate about something and not have some part of yourself and your beliefs shine through. The message Stewart and Colbert were peddling came through loud and clear. As Jon said: ""We live now in hard times. Not 'end times.' "" Whatever your politics, I think everyone can agree that taking a step back and approaching our nation's problems rationally and sanely is the only way solve them. And we have to do it together. As difficult as that might sound, we have to learn more about the issues we all care so passionately about. And then we have to have a civil conversation. Without fear, and without insanity.","CNN's Pete Dominick once worked with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert .

"(CNN) -- It's not every day you meet an active field agent of Israel's super secret spy agency, the Mossad. Generally, if you did, you wouldn't know it. But there he was, taking us on a tour of ""Operation Finale: The Story of the Capture of Eichmann"" before the V.I.P. guests arrived for opening night. This spy is the curator of the extraordinary exhibit of recently declassified spycraft chronicling the capture of Adolf Eichmann, one of the chief architects of the Holocaust. It's a passionate side project to document one of Mossad's most famous successes. I can't use his name and we couldn't film him, but he told us why he spent months in the archive. ""It was our first big 'James Bond' operation. I knew we had the material in the archive,"" he says, ""but until today, people only knew a small part of the story, we had to tell the whole thing."" The story starts with Eichmann, a German SS officer put in charge of orchestrating the ""final solution,"" the Nazi plan to kill all of the Jews in Europe, during World War Two in the early 1940s. Eichmann was the chief logistician, organizing transport for millions of Jews to the gas chambers. In the waning years of the war, when Nazis were trying to destroy all evidence of the Holocaust and halted the killing, Eichmann insisted on continuing his evil work. At the end of World War Two, Eichmann escaped and evaded capture several times. He was a wanted man, but the trail went dry. But in the 1950s, word began to reach Mossad and Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, that Adolf Eichmann was hiding in Buenos Aires using the name ""Ricardo Klement."" At first, agents sent to Argentina didn't believe that the shabby suburb where Klement lived could be the residence of a senior Nazi officer. Agents then traveled to Argentina to take photos of the man who called himself Klement. They pretended to be property investors. The small Leica camera, a simple converted business case with a secret camera trigger, and original photographs, are part of the ""Operation Finale"" exhibit. The agents took the negatives to a developing shop in town and got three shots of an ordinary looking man standing over a barbed wire fence. But Adolf Eichmann was no ordinary man. The covert pictures were compared to SS photos in Mossad's files. A 10-point analysis of his ears (apparently ears are unique) told Mossad they had their man. Avi Armoni, the CEO of the Museum of the Jewish People, says the exhibit shows the evolution of Mossad, then in its early days. ""Even the mighty Mossad started with improvising solutions,"" says Armoni. And it's painstakingly documented in an exhibit crammed with originals: the crudely made license plates; the fake passports used by agents, the metal syringe used to drug Eichmann. ""What people react to in museums, aside from the story, is to see original artifacts, to feel that they are in the presence of the real thing,"" he says. ""And to all of us it symbolized evil, it symbolized the Holocaust, it symbolized the notion of justice."" To bring Adolf Eichmann to justice, 11 agents traveled to Argentina under assumed names. Dozens of Jews living in Argentina helped provide the cover needed to succeed. The agents put Eichmann in an El Al crew uniform and shoved him into a Pontiac. They slipped him onto a special El Al flight and spirited him out of Argentina. In April 1961, the trial of Adolf Eichmann began in Jerusalem. During nine months of testimony, the world was astounded by the personal testimony of 120 witnesses (99 of them Holocaust survivors). The impact was greatest in Israel. ""I grew up in Israel. I was born here,"" says Armoni. ""The whole notion for young Israelis growing up here -- of the Shoah, of the Holocaust -- was very much not spoken of, it was hidden, we were in shock."" ""The capture of Adolf Eichmann -- bringing him to court and to justice in Jerusalem -- was for so many Israelis of my generation a watershed event. It actually brought out the stories and the horror of what happened to the Jews in Europe."" The ""Operation Finale"" exhibit ends with the actual bulletproof glass booth where Adolf Eichmann sat impassively during the duration of the nine-month trial. The message is clear. The agents who painstakingly tracked down and captured Eichmann were after one thing: justice.","An exhibition documenting Mossad's capture of German Nazi Adolf Eichmann has just opened .

"(CNN) -- Donald Sterling -- the longtime owner of the Los Angeles Clippers -- is under investigation by the NBA for ""offensive and disturbing"" remarks he allegedly made about African-Americans. Sterling, who has owned the franchise for nearly three decades, made the comments in a 10-minute argument he had with girlfriend V. Stiviano on April 9, according to TMZ, which posted the audio late Friday. If authentic, the remarks seem to reflect Sterling's embarrassment and frustration with Stiviano over her associating with African-Americans at Clippers games and for posting such pictures on her Instagram account. Clippers president Andy Roeser on Saturday questioned the recording and suggested a woman -- whom he doesn't mention by name -- was ""getting even"" with Sterling over a lawsuit. Reaction: 'Disturbing and offensive' NBA commissioner Adam Silver said at a press conference in Memphis on Saturday night that the league's investigation will seek to determine whether the tape is authentic and to figure out the context in which these ""offensive and disturbing"" comments were made. Silver cautioned that Sterling must be afforded due process, so he would not speculate on any possible punishment, if any -- but said that the investigation will move ""extraordinarily quickly."" Speaking about the recording, Roeser said, ""we do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered. We do know that the woman on the tape -- who we believe released it to TMZ -- is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would ""get even."" TMZ does not say who made the recording or how the celebrity-centric website obtained it. Attempts to reach Stiviano on Saturday were unsuccessful. She is part African-American, according to the recording. The man alleged to be Sterling takes particular exception to a photo she posted to Instagram with NBA icon Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" the man says. ""If it's white people, it's OK?"" she responds. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?"" Bird, the longtime Boston Celtics star, was Johnson's NBA rival. ""I've known [Magic] well and he should be admired .... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately,"" the man on the recording says. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put [Magic] on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games."" Johnson responded Saturday afternoon via his verified Twitter account. ""I feel sorry for my friends Coach Doc Rivers and Chris Paul that they have to work for a man that feels that way about African Americans"" read a tweet from @MagicJohnson. ""I will never go to a Clippers game again as long as Donald Sterling is the owner,"" read another. Roeser said that Sterling is upset and apologizes for sentiments attributed to him about Earvin Johnson. ""[Sterling] has long considered Magic a friend and has only the utmost respect and admiration for him -- both in terms of who he is and what he has achieved."" Sterling is ""emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect his views, beliefs or feelings,"" Roeser said. ""I don't know if I'm surprised or not,"" Clippers head coach Doc Rivers said at the team's practice Saturday, adding that he ""obviously"" didn't like the comments. Rivers, who is in his first year coaching the team, told reporters that he didn't want the controversy to distract from the playoffs. He said he would be the sole person speaking on behalf of the team. The players union's response will be led by NBA player-turned-mayor of Sacramento Kevin Johnson. ""The reported comments made by Clippers owner Donald Sterling are reprehensible and unacceptable,"" he said in a statement. Former players universally denounced the recorded comments. ""Should this guy continue to be an owner?"" asked Shaquille O'Neal, who also called the comments ""repugnant."" ""We cannot have an NBA owner discriminating against the league,"" said Charles Barkley. ""We're a black league."" Both discussed the issue during the Atlanta Hawks-Indiana Pacers halftime program on TNT, which like CNN, is a division of Time Warner. In an interesting wrinkle, Sterling is set to be given a lifetime achievement award at an event next month to mark the 100th anniversary of the Los Angeles NAACP. The Clippers are set to play the Golden State Warriors in Oakland on Sunday in the fourth game in their best-of-seven playoff series. Silver said Sterling has agreed to not attend. Golden State head coach Mark Jackson said that he was ""disappointed in the comments made. I think there's no place in society for those feelings.""","NEW: NBA commissioner says ""we will move extraordinarily quickly""

"London (CNN) -- China is experiencing a ""meteoric rise"" in the publication of scientific papers in the past two decades, and while the United States remains on top, its dominance is slipping, a new study found this week. Fewer than one out of 20 of the world's scientific articles came out of China in the decade up to 2003, the study shows. But the number rose to more than one out of 10 in the period from 2004 to 2008. That pushed it up from sixth place to second, Britain's Royal Society found. The United States was in first place in both time periods, but its share of publications dropped from more than one in four to about one in five. The United Kingdom held steady in third place, but its share dropped from 7.1% to 6.5%, according to the study, ""Knowledge, Networks and Nations: Global scientific collaboration in the 21st century."" China's influence and prestige in science may not be rising as fast as its output, the paper suggested. The Royal Society measured how often each country's papers were cited by other researchers, a ""means of evaluating the quality of publications,"" and found the United States first and the UK second. China is rising, ""although the rise does not mirror the rapidity of growth seen in the nation's investment or publication output."" Other nations are also newly making a mark in science, including Iran, Tunisia and Turkey, the paper found. And it also discovered a rise in international collaboration on research papers. Only a quarter of articles had authors from more than one country 15 years ago, while today it's more than one in three. The full report is available on the website of the Royal Society, Britain's national scientific academy.","China moves from sixth place to second in the publication of science articles .

"(CNN) -- In Sydney's trendy eastern suburbs, tattoo parlors are almost as ubiquitous as hairdressers. Fashionable, arty and with a long list of celebrity customers, the tattooists at Bondi Ink -- along the hip strip on Bondi Beach's Campbell Parade -- have taken the art form a long way since blue birds of happiness and 'death before dishonor' skull designs formed the stock in trade of parlors in the onetime port city. ""We run it like a hair and beauty salon -- usually Mondays and Tuesdays are our mums and prams day,"" co-owner Wendy Tadrosse told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. While boutique tattoo parlors such as Bondi Ink like to highlight their family-friendly credentials, police estimate that at least one-in-four tattoo parlors across Australia are affiliated with outlaw motorcycle clubs such as the Hells Angels, the Gypsy Jokers and the Finks. This month, New South Wales passed new laws requiring tattoo parlor owners and employees to provide detailed information about their personal associations and criminal histories. Tadrosse said the new law unfairly targets the new breed of boutique tattoo parlors. ""It's like we've been tarred with the same brush,"" she said. ""If there's a shooting somewhere it's like, ""Oooh, you know, bikies, tattoos."" Arthur Katsogiannis of the New South Wales Gang Squad said growing gang membership is now presenting serious law and order concerns across Australia. ""Murder to armed robbery to arson to malicious damage, firearms offences - tattoo parlors are synonymous with outlaw motorcycle gangs,"" Katsogiannis told the ABC. ""Predominantly the way they make their income is through the manufacturing and distribution of illegal drugs, and by having the tattoo parlors opening, they can put some of the income derived from those illegal practices and declare it as income through the tattoo parlour, which then legitimises that particular income,"" he said. He estimates that in New South Wales alone, there are just over 2000 gang members of outlaw motorcycle clubs and that recruitment is accelerating both in Australia and internationally. Besides the Tattoo Parlors Act, members of motorcycle clubs -- or 'bikies' as they are known in Australia -- have had to contend with anti-association laws in New South Wales and South Australia. Engaging lawyers to overturn the laws in those states, bikies are now about to fight another battle in the northern Australian state of Queensland which on Wednesday passed a law banning gang members from owning, operating or working in tattoo parlors. The suite of laws aimed at disbanding gangs named 26 criminal organisations, including the Bandidos, Finks and Mongols, and banned members and associates from gathering and recruiting for new members. The laws also carry additional jail terms of 15 to 25 years for bikies who commit serious crimes. The state government, however, says it intends to go further, driving bikies out of the security, gym and second-hand car industries and even mooting a special bikies-only jail. Queensland Premier Campbell Newman vowed to hunt down ""relentlessly"" criminal gangs in the state. ""This is not some flash in the pan or momentary phase. We are going to hunt you down,"" he told parliament this week. ""Take off your colors, get a real job, act like decent, law-abiding human beings and become proper citizens in the state of Queensland and you will not have to go to jail."" Australian writer and journalist Adam Shand -- author of ""Outlaws: The Truth About Australian Bikers"" -- told CNN that the bikie threat was often exaggerated by state governments who found a convenient populist target in outlaw gangs. ""Almost all the states have at one time or another -- usually to distract from problems or get re-elected - elected have brought up the bikie issue up,"" he said. ""We've seen vast amounts of money spent on task forces and crackdowns and new laws but in that period of about 10 years, the club numbers have only gone up: it's actually attracted more young guys to the movement who figure 'well, if the cops don't like it, there must be something good going on.' ""You've got a whole bunch of disaffected alienated at kids out there who see bike clubs as a cool alternative."" He said bikie chic in Australia was now so commonplace that fashion houses were releasing their own line in four-piece 'rockers' -- the traditional leathers worn by motorcycle gang members. ""Of course, you probably wouldn't want to be standing next to a bikie when you went out wearing one,"" he said. While critics, including the president of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, Terry O'Gorman, and NSW director of public prosecutions, Nicholas Cowdery, have derided the new laws as 'hysterical', bikies have been involved in some high-profile murders including beating to death a rival gang member at Sydney Airport in plain view of passengers in 2009. Australia's most notorious turf war between rival clubs occurred in 1984 when members of the Comancheros and the Bandidos motorcycle club clashed in the Sydney suburb of Milperra. Seven gang members and one bystander were killed in the shooting spree which eventually led to 63 murder convictions and became the catalyst for significant changes to gun laws in New South Wales.","Queensland passes raft of tough new laws targetting motorcycle gangs .

"(CNN) -- ""Justin Bieber accused of roughing up photographer."" When I read this headline, my initialÂ reaction was: Who would admit to being beaten up by Justin Bieber? I think most of us would take that secret with us to our grave. For those unfamiliar with Bieber -- if that's even possible -- he's an 18-year-old international pop sensation who stands at an imposing 5 feet 7 inches and probably weighs about 135 pounds. But on Sunday, Bieber was accused of channeling his inner Alec Baldwin, lashing out at a member of the paparazzi who was trying to snap some photos of him and his famous girlfriend, Selena Gomez, as the two exited a movie theater. To me, however, the real issue is not this incident. I predict this matter will be quickly resolved, possibly with a transfer of funds to the photographer's bank account. The issue that truly needs to addressed is this the paparazzi's daily pursuit of celebrities as if they were contestants in ""The Hunger Games."" They stake out hotels, restaurants, schools, homes, trying to snap a photo of a celebrity or their families. The obvious reason is that the photographers sell these photos, and often for big bucks. But why should these photographers be allowed to profit off the images of celebrities without the celebrities' consent? If a corporation wants to use an image of celebrities in an advertising campaign, they must first obtain their approval and typically pay them a fee. This is because our copyright laws provide that if you take a photo, you own the copyright to that picture. Consequently, members of the paparazzi who snap a photo, even over the objections of the person, are awarded the full bundle of rights afforded by the federal copyright laws, including the right to sell the photo for a profit. This is simply wrong. Our nation's copyright laws were enacted to protect original works. One of the goals of the law is to foster creativity, so people will invest the skill and effort needed to create works to which they will own exclusive rights, such as books, paintings, music and movies. No one can argue that people who snap a photo of George Clooney as he exits a Pinkberry eating strawberry frozen yogurt or, worse, hang around outside grammar schools taking photos of someone's children deserve the same legal protection as those who create a movie, music or other work of art. Our laws should be revised so that the copyright owner would no longer be the photographer who took the photo. Instead, the owner should be the person whose appearance in the photo makes it valuable: the celebrity. Let's be honest, media outlets aren't buying these photos from the paparazzi because of the photographer's great talent for lighting. It's because the photo contains an image of a celebrity. Why shouldn't the person giving the image its value own the rights to it? Indeed, our legal system has long recognized that we all have a ""right of publicity,"" which means that we each have the right to control the use of our name, image and likeness. And obviously, this is a bigger issue for well-known people because their images yield a monetary value. To me, the unauthorized taking of person's photo and selling it for profit is akin to stealing a valuable asset from that person. This statutory revision would remove the financial incentive for the paparazzi to stalk celebrities, because the photos could not be sold or distributed to any third party without the celebrities' consent, with exceptions for occasions that are newsworthy, such as a court appearance or arrest. But walking down the street, going to the gym or taking your children to school should be off-limits. The definition of ""celebrity"" and what constitutes a legitimate photograph would be defined by statute and the court decisions interpreting the law. Although this would create a different legal standard for celebrities versus private citizens, our legal system makes a similar distinction in defamation cases, holding public figures to a higher standard of proof than the average person. I know some people have zero sympathy for stars. True, they have chosen this life, and there are certain consequences that accompany fame. And some have achieved fame with the least talent possible: I'm looking at you, cast of ""The Jersey Shore."" But why should a talented singer, musician or actor be sentenced to a life with no privacy simply because of their success? Shouldn't we all have the right to a quiet meal with our family or the chance to walk our children to school without having cameras jammed into our kids' faces? This doesn't put the paparazzi out of business. There will still be plenty of work taking photos of famous people who consent. Celebrities still need to be in the media and so do their projects. It will mean only that in normal day-to-day situations, celebrities will be able to retain a shred of privacy and no longer have to worry about paparazzi chasing them as they go food shopping or trying to enjoy ""date night,"" as in the case of the ""mighty"" Justin Bieber. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Justin Bieber allegedly lashed out at a photographer trying to get pics of him and girlfriend .

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities have ordered ExxonMobil to make safety improvements to a ruptured pipeline in Montana that caused 750 to 1,000 barrels of crude oil to gush into the Yellowstone River last week. The cause of the pipeline break is still under investigation, authorities said. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a corrective action order to ExxonMobil Pipeline Company that will require the safety measures along the Silvertip hazardous liquid pipeline, the federal agency said late Tuesday. The order will require ExxonMobil to re-bury the pipeline underneath the river bed to protect it from external damage, the federal agency said in a statement. The oil company will also have to conduct a risk assessment on the pipeline where it crosses any waterway. Exxon will then need to submit a restart plan before operation can resume, officials said. ""The safety of our nation's pipelines is a priority and the investigation into this incident is ongoing,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. ""It is our responsibility to ensure pipelines are safely delivering energy to U.S. households and businesses, and when companies are not living up to our safety standards, we will take action. We will continue to work with the EPA, while ensuring that those responsible are held accountable."" The Silvertip Pipeline is a 12-inch pipeline about 69 miles long and carries crude oil from the Silvertip station in Elk Basin, Wyoming, to an ExxonMobil Refinery in Billings, Montana, federal officials said. This spring, in the wake of several major pipeline accidents, LaHood announced an action plan to immediately begin addressing concerns about the state of the nation's aging pipeline infrastructure, and he called upon U.S. pipeline owners and operators to conduct a comprehensive review of their oil and gas pipelines to identify areas of high risk and accelerate critical repair and replacement work. LaHood has also proposed federal legislation that would improve oversight on pipeline safety and increase the maximum civil penalties for pipeline violations from $100,000 per day to $250,000 per day, and from $1 million for a series of violations to $2.5 million for a series of violations. On Tuesday, Montana's governor declared a state of emergency in Yellowstone, Treasure, Rosebud, Custer, Prairie, Dawson and Richland counties, all of which have been affected by the spill that occurred just before midnight Friday. ExxonMobil reported 750 to 1,000 barrels (32,000 to 42,000 gallons) of oil spilling into the river in Laurel, about 16 miles southwest of Billings. The longest undammed river in the United States, the Yellowstone eventually leads into the Missouri River, one of the biggest in the United States. Gary Pruessing, the president of the ExxonMobil Pipeline Company, told reporters Tuesday that spilled oil had been confirmed 25 miles away, with most pockets of oil within 19 miles of the leak site. But in the emergency declaration, which paves the way for emergency funds for the seven counties, Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer claimed that oil has since been discovered beyond Hysham, about 90 miles from the leak site. But the federal order says that overflights conducted as recently as Sunday have observed oil deposits as far as 240 miles downstream in Terry, Montana. Schweitzer, a Democrat, stated in the executive order that the ""ExxonMobil Pipeline Company (is) the responsible party for this release."" ExxonMobil has seen ""measureable progress,"" said Pruessing, as it has stepped up its cleanup effort -- one that's come under criticism from Schweitzer. The Texas-based firm has committed 350 people to the spill response, and of those, between 150 to 200 people are actually on the ground, cleaning up and looking for oil, Pruessing said. The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said it has three inspectors on site and they are working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Coast Guard to conduct investigations. ""We're going to keep adding resources,"" ExxonMobil Alan Jeffers told CNN on Tuesday. ""That's our focus -- find the oil, clean it up and get it back to its original state as quickly as possible."" Schweitzer toured the spill site Tuesday morning, one day after criticizing the speed and effectiveness of the response in an interview with CNN. Later that day, Pruessing of ExxonMobil said, ""We do not yet have a resolution, as to what caused the incident."" While no official determination has been made on what caused the pipeline rupture, the governor said it is easy to see the dangers posed by fast-moving waters. Any pipelines built now, Schweitzer noted, must be buried deeper under the riverbed in order to prevent such incidents. The governor called it premature to minimize the spill's potential impact by saying, for instance, that it has only affected 10 miles of the river. His fear is that the abundance of fish, birds and animals in the area, which is about 100 miles downstream from Yellowstone National Park, may be hurt in the short and long term. ""My biggest concern is those 1,000 barrels,"" Schweitzer said. ""You cannot dump (that much oil) into a pristine trout stream without causing damage to the fisheries."" Besides the fish, the area is home to Canada geese, ducks, ospreys, otters and bald eagles, said Charles Preston, an ecologist and conservation biologist who heads the Draper Museum of Natural History. The birds, in particular, might die directly or indirectly as they go after fish. Toxins may kill critical insects, which in turn could have a trickle-down effect on the multimillion-dollar fishing industry, he said. ""It could take years to really understand the impact of the spill,"" Preston said. The Yellowstone is the nation's longest river without a dam -- a plus for the spill cleanup efforts because the continuously running water more easily breaks up the toxins, but a negative because any ill effects could spread into the Missouri River and its other tributaries, Preston said. More than 48,000 feet of absorbent boom and 2,300 absorbent pads had been used as of Tuesday to soak up the oil, while ""vacuum trucks"" and tankers have been positioned nearby to transport them from the scene, according to ExxonMobil. The company said the air quality and municipal water systems are also being monitored, while planes are routinely flying over the river to help detect patches of oil. David Eglinton, an ExxonMobil spokesman, said the company is committed to staying the course and studying the effects through the whole course of the river. That includes checking water quality as far downstream as Miles City (144 miles) and Glendive (222 miles) from the original spill site. CNN's Greg Botelho, Matt Cherry, Alan Silverleib, Matt Smith and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","An ExxonMobil official says oil detected 25 miles downstream .

"Spielberg, Austria (CNN) -- Inside the Red Bull Ring -- home to the returning Austrian Grand Prix -- Mercedes toreadors Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were effectively left to slog it out by their peers in Sunday's race. Hamilton flew from ninth to fourth by the end of the first lap to once again put himself into a fight with his teammate and chief world title rival. The two Mercedes circled each other like silver sharks in the final 20 laps around the undulating circuit but each time Hamilton bit into Rosberg's lead, the German responded. There was to be no final attack and Rosberg took a third win of the season to stretch his lead in the 2014 Formula One drivers' championship to 29 points. ""It's a nice gap,"" said Rosberg, who remains determined to stem rising expectation that he will emulate his father Keke and be crowned world champion. ""It's still so early in the season. I'm more or less taking it step by step, and every weekend my aim is to extend the lead. ""It worked out well and I'm extremely happy with the result."" Interactive: Results and standings . Hamilton had hampered his chances of clawing back ground on his rival and long-term friend after making a mistake in qualifying Saturday. The 2008 champion's fastest time was scratched because he infringed the rules by running wide at Turn Eight and he then spun on this second attempt to grab pole position. Hamilton made amends Sunday with a sensational start, which saw him jump five places on the opening lap. He then passed the Williams of Valtteri Bottas after the first round of pit stops to start the chase to Rosberg. ""It was a good start,"" Hamilton said. ""It's probably one of the best I've ever had. ""(It was) damage limitation to get from ninth to second behind Nico. In the last couple of laps I tried to eke it up a bit but I'm just grateful I finished."" The English racer has retired twice this season while Rosberg has sailed to three race wins and five second places. A resurgent Williams team announced itself as Mercedes' closest rivals after Felipe Massa had taken pole position ahead of teammate Bottas. But the former champions appeared to run a conservative race, content to settle with third place for Bottas -- the first podium of the Finn's career -- rather than risk a solid result by taking the fight to Mercedes. Dictated by Williams' tire strategy, Massa had to pit for fresh rubber three laps after Rosberg, effectively surrendering the lead. The Brazilian eventually finished fourth. Bottas said: ""Overall it was my best ever weekend so I'm really happy. ""We need to analyze if there was anything we could have done better. It was difficult to know the real difference between optimum (supersoft tire) and prime (soft tire) so we really thought it would be difficult to undercut."" Austrian billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz is credited with returning the Austrian Grand Prix to the calendar after an 11-year absence. After revamping the picturesque A1 Ring circuit and renaming it the Red Bull Ring, the owner of the race team with the same name probably expected to see his four-time world champions run rings round the competition. It was ironic that the power-dependent circuit did not suit Red Bull's car or the 2014 Renault engines that give his Bulls their muscle. Daniel Ricciardo -- a surprise winner in Canada last time out -- finished eighth while reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel had to suffer the ignominy of retiring with engine trouble at the halfway point. ""It was frustrating today,"" said Ricciardo. ""We tried to push and catch the others but we just didn't have that much pace."" Fernando Alonso and his Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen, who finished 10th, were the only cars inside the top-10 which are not powered by the Mercedes hybrid engines. Alonso finished a hard-worked fifth ahead of Sergio Perez's Force India, McLaren's Kevin Magnussen, Ricciardo and the second Force India of Nico Hulkenberg. The Red Bull F1 brand may have its own race team and a beautiful circuit but there is growing speculation a Red Bull engine could be a future project for the team's technical guru Adrian Newey. ""We want to make sure we're competitive for the long term,"" team principal Christian Horner said after Sunday's race. ""Designing and manufacturing our own engine currently isn't part of that plan. ""It's highly improbable. First of all we need to see what the plans for Renault are. ""We've obviously had a lot of success with Renault but the situation isn't improving and the reliability and performance is unacceptable. ""It can't continue like this -- it's not good for Renault and it's not good for Red Bull."" As F1 returned to Austria, the hills were alive with the sound of Mercedes music.","Nico Rosberg extends world championship lead with victory in Austria .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel has broken up an al Qaeda terror cell that planned a coordinated attack that included bombing the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israeli authorities said Wednesday. Three men -- two from Jerusalem and one from the West Bank -- have been arrested in connection with the plot that called for a double suicide bombing targeting the embassy and the Jerusalem Convention Center, according to Israel's Shin Bet intelligence agency. It is the second time in recent months that authorities claim to have halted an al Qaeda attack planned by Palestinian militants, according to Israeli media. In November, authorities claimed three Palestinians with ties to al Qaeda were killed by Israeli troops during a gunfight in the West Bank, according to the reports. The Israeli intelligence agency alleged Wednesday Iyad Halil Mohammad Abu Sara of East Jerusalem is ""the relevant member"" of the three-man operation, a statement released by Shin Bet's media office said. Abu Sara was allegedly recruited by al Qaeda to go to Syria for training and return to Israel, where he was to connect with others who were to have entered the country using forged Russian documents, the statement said. The arrests came as peace talks were under way in Geneva, Switzerland, to end the Syrian civil war, a conflict where violence has been spilled into neighboring countries and raised fears it could destabilize the region. Chief among those fears is that the chaos generated by the conflict has allowed an al Qaeda-linked group to take hold in Syria, attracting foreign fighters who can strike neighboring countries. While authorities did not say how far along Abu Sara and the others allegedly were in carrying out the plot, the intelligence agency claims it seized computer files sent from Gaza that instructed Abu Sara in the manufacturing of explosives. Abu Sara allegedly mapped routes to the convention center and had checked out the U.S. Embassy. He also was accused of planning an shooting rampage on a bus going from Jerusalem to Ma'ale Adumim, an Israeli settlement in the West Bank. As part of the plan, according to Shin Bet, the attack would include shooting out the wheels of the bus in an attempt to overturn it. Former CIA operative and national security analyst Robert Baer questioned the credibility of the threat posed by Abu Sara. ""I don't think it is credible. It may have been aspirational,"" he said on CNN's The Lead. ""They may have had the plans on the books and sent people here and there, but al Qaeda can't operate in the West Bank or Jerusalem or Gaza. It is too difficult for them ... The Israelis have the place too well wired for them to get away with this."" The United States is working to corroborate the details, State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters. ""We've been in contact with the Israeli government regarding these threats. We're closely monitoring the situation,"" she said. ""...I don't have independent corroboration of some of those specifics. Our folks are working on that right now. But because this was Israeli information, I'd point you to them for the corroboration. But obviously we're looking into it as well. I don't have reason to believe it's not true. I just don't have independent verification."" Ben Wedeman and Michael Schwartz reported from Jerusalem, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I don't think it is credible.

"London (CNN) -- Fifteen years after Diana, Princess of Wales died in a Paris car crash while being chased by the paparazzi, a French edition of the magazine Closer has angered the British royal family by publishing topless pictures of her son's wife Catherine. The pictures were taken while Diana's oldest son Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge were staying at a private chateau in Provence, France, according to Closer magazine. A palace spokesman said their privacy had been invaded in a ""grotesque and totally unjustifiable manner"" adding: ""The incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, and all the more upsetting to The Duke and Duchess for being so."" France is famous for its strict attitude to privacy -- the nation only found out about former President Francois Mitterrand's second family just before he died -- so why have the images appeared in France? CNN examines some of the key questions about privacy. Doesn't France have some of the strictest privacy laws in the world? ""Indeed it does,"" says Claire de Than, senior lecturer at London's City University Law School. She explains that there is comprehensive protection for privacy, potential civil and criminal liability, and human rights protection under the European Convention on Human Rights. ""Photographs of private events and individuals cannot legally be published without their consent,"" she said. ""The French Civil Code states that 'everyone has the right to privacy' and the courts have generally been strict in enforcing that right. The photographs should only have been published if they are in the public interest, or with consent. There is criminal liability for taking and transmitting photographs of private events without consent."" So how come the photos have been published there? De Than says some organizations are willing to face the potential penalties, presumably hoping that fines will be lower than the massive increases in sales. ""It is true that average fines have dropped in France in recent decades but image rights have been strengthening and there is a significant risk of this case reversing that trend,"" she said. Can France handle the truth on sex lives of rich and powerful? How does French law differ from that in the UK? Again, de Than explains that French law is stricter since privacy has constitutional protection. ""The media have generally been more reluctant to publish private information (including photographs) than in the UK. ""However, once photographs have been published then the harm has been done and it is much more difficult to obtain an injunction, so when media are willing to break the law and face the consequences it simply does not matter how strong the legal protection is for citizens' rights."" Does European law play a part? Yes. The European Convention on Human Rights is incorporated into French law, just as it is in UK law. Article 8 says that everyone has the right to respect for private and family life, but article 10 protects the right of freedom of expression, although it also adds that the exercise of this freedom carries ""duties and responsibilities."" In making a judgment about privacy infringements the European Court of Human Rights has to balance the two, with neither right taking automatic precedence.The interpretations of the convention's provisions evolve through case law in each member state. Earlier this year, key rulings in the European Court were welcomed by press freedom campaigners in the UK as tipping the balance towards the right to free speech. Can the royal family start proceedings under the ECHR and if so how would they go about it? Yes it can, but as privacy expert Jennifer Agate at London law firm Wiggin LLP explains, it would first have to issue proceedings in the French courts, where the breach of privacy has taken place. ""The national courts have a duty to enforce Article 8, so if proceedings there did not provide an adequate remedy, and having exhausted the French appeal process, the Palace would then be able to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights who would rule on whether France had failed in its Article 8 obligation,"" she said. ""This was the approach taken by former F1 racing chief Max Mosley when he felt that the UK courts had failed to protect his Article 8 rights by not imposing a duty to notify the subjects of tabloid stories before publication."" (Mosley won a privacy case against the now-defunct News of the World after it published a story falsely alleging that he took part in a Nazi-themed orgy.) Mosley: Can the press be free but responsible? Has anything changed since the death of Diana in 1997? Christopher Meyer, the former chairman of the UK Press Complaints Commission, told CNN he thought much had changed in the UK. ""I don't think the paparazzi are coming back with a vengeance,"" he said. ""In the UK there are pretty strict rules about what is private... but it doesn't stop the paparazzi from selling to other markets. It's difficult to police but that isn't an argument for not having some rules."" Only last month, Prince William's brother Harry was snapped naked at a party and the pictures were published in the American magazine TMZ. Only one British tabloid, The Sun newspaper, chose to publish the images. Meyer rejected a comparison saying: ""That's a different case with different arguments."" What's the likelihood of the photos being published by newspapers elsewhere in the UK or around the world? Jennifer Agate said prevention would be very difficult. ""In the UK they would be able to get an injunction against publication, but realistically they won't be able to stop publication elsewhere, particularly in the United States where the First Amendment is sacrosanct,"" she said. ""The photographs are also likely to become available online, which presents an enforcement nightmare."" She adds: ""The photographs are so obviously private and indefensible; it seems unimaginable that the major publishers in the UK will decide to publish. The British press have typically shown a respect for the royal couple's privacy, agreeing not to publish photographs taken on their honeymoon. Unfortunately that won't stop the photos becoming available online. ""This is a blatant breach which won't change the law, but it does highlight the inconsistencies in the approaches to privacy taken in different countries. What makes this so staggering is that publication has taken place in France, a country renowned for its strict privacy laws."" It is a view echoed by Roy Greenslade, professor of journalism at City University, London, and a former tabloid editor. He told the BBC he doubted any British newspaper or British-based magazine would dare to publish the images. ""They quite clearly will be in breach of the editors' code of practice which says you are not to photograph individuals in private places without their consent, and you would need to have a public interest reason for overcoming that and I can't see that there would be one."" He also said the British press risked a backlash from the public if they published them. ""I have a feeling that there might be a bad reader reaction to obviously intrusive pictures. I may be misreading the public view here, but I think she's quite a popular figure and the idea they might intrude in this fashion might lead to a boycott by readers,"" he said. How has the royal family responded? There is no doubting the anger within the British royal family. A statement from St James's Palace said the couple have been ""hugely saddened"" by publication of the pictures. It added: ""Their Royal Highnesses had every expectation of privacy in the remote house. It is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs, let alone publish them. ""Officials acting on behalf of Their Royal Highnesses are consulting with lawyers to consider what options may be available to The Duke and Duchess."" How has the magazine Closer reacted? A statement on behalf of Closer Magazine UK says the UK publication is published by Bauer Consumer Media but the French edition is published under a license by a different Italian business called Mondadori. It adds: ""Closer magazine UK was not offered any pictures of this nature and certainly has no intention of publishing the photographs of the Duchess of Cambridge which have been published in France this morning. ""Closer magazine UK takes its obligations under the PCC [Press Complaints Commission] Code extremely seriously and would never publish topless images of a member of the Royal family on its cover or otherwise.""","Legal expert Claire de Than: French law is stricter since privacy has constitutional protection .

"Northern Syria (CNN) -- On the northern edge of this war-torn country, barely 100 meters from the Turkish border, thousands of desperate Syrians slept in the dirt. They were hard to spot at first, hidden among ancient olive groves. But as the sun rose, bodies stirred beneath filthy blankets, next to pitiable shelters of plastic sheets strung up between olive trees. Children began scavenging in surrounding fields for twigs to use for cooking fires. Women lined up next to a water tank pumping milky, chalky water presumed to have given many residents of this make-shift camp diarrhea. A month ago, there was no camp here. But now rebels from a local Free Syrian Army group that slept in a tent with the words ""police office"" spray-painted on it estimated there were between 5,500 and 6,000 people living here, with more arriving every day. More: War marks highest daily death toll . ""I came here because my house was destroyed,"" said Youssef Dabul, an English-speaking 30-year-old man who said he used to manage a KFC restaurant in Aleppo. ""I never imagined in all my life to come here and live under the olive trees."" Many of the residents told similar stories of rockets and airstrikes pummeling their villages and towns, forcing them to flee their homes. Ousama Hamdou sat on a plastic mat under a tree holding his 2-year-old daughter, Maram. Long, wide scars stretched across her chest, still pink from the explosion last month that left her badly burned. ""I don't know what exploded, whether it was a rocket or a bomb,"" Hamdou said. The blast destroyed his home in the battleground city of Aleppo, in a flashpoint neighborhood called Sakari. When a reporter asked ""how are you?"" in Arabic to Maram, she didn't respond. Hamdou explained that the explosion left the little girl deaf. In his other arm, he held Maram's one-and-a-half-month old brother, whose face was covered with insect bites. ""He's being bitten by mosquitoes, and he has diarrhea and fever,"" Hamdou said, adding that he and his family of eight had already spent more than two weeks waiting here by the border for the Turks to let them in. ""Every day that we stay here we come closer to dying."" For more than a year, Turkey maintained what it described as an ""open door policy"" for Syrian refugees fleeing their government's military assaults. Turkish border guards met families who escaped to the border fence with vans and buses that transported them to camps that foreign dignitaries have frequently described as clean, well-managed and orderly. More: Witness says scores killed in massacre south of Damascus . But over the last month, the refugee population in Turkey has swelled to more than 87,000 people, prompting Ankara to at least partially shut its ""open door"" policy as the Turkish government struggles to build more camps. ""Our speed of constructing camps... cannot compete with the pace of the violence of the Ba'ath regime against its own people,"" said Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal, in a phone interview with CNN. ""There is no policy change,"" another Turkish official insisted, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We intend to continue this policy of open door as long as we can. The thing is, our capabilities are being strained."" ""We've started to extend humanitarian aid, food, medicine, to the zero point on the border,"" the official added. ""That's the best we can do at the moment."" There were signs of food distribution and delivery of basic supplies at the olive orchard camp. But no international aid organizations appeared to have a presence here. As parents have watched their children succumb to disease due to the filthy conditions, tempers have periodically flared. ""I'm ready to beg (Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip) Erdogan to help us,"" said a man dressed in a track suit who called himself Abu Saleh. He showed a laminated card that identified him as an FSA fighter. But Abu Saleh explained he quit the rebel movement after his wife was killed by a government airstrike last month. Now the former rebel was trying to transport his surviving children to safety in Turkey. An hour later, Abu Saleh led a procession of about 100 men and boys past piles of burning garbage, to the barbed wire border fence. There, under the eyes of Turkish gendarme officers watching from a guard tower that overlooked the camp, the refugees held a futile protest, begging the Turks to let them in. ""Erdogan, Erdogan, today we sleep in Turkey,"" the crowd chanted. More: Report details Syrian children's horror stories . ""We want to send a message to the leaders of the Arab world, of the Islamic world, they abandoned us,"" Abu Saleh yelled. ""And the first one who let us down was Obama."" As the crowd chanted, a lone Turkish municipal employee worked a few meters away on the Turkish side of the fence, spreading mortar onto a recently constructed cinder block wall. In the Syrian village below the camp, hundreds of other displaced families had taken shelter in schools and a village mosque. There were new arrivals every day. A pickup truck loaded with at least 30 people and their belongings rolled up outside of one of the schools Wednesday. A woman who only gave the name Um Mohamed said this wasn't the first time her family vacated their homes in the village of Kafr Zeita, near the city of Hama. ""We fled our homes many times before to neighboring villages,"" she said, still sitting in the back of the loaded truck. ""But now we can't stay there... the situation is very, very bad. Rockets and bombs, falling day and night."" Um Mohamed's family also wanted to go to Turkey. Since Turkish authorities were only allowing a few hundred refugees to enter every day, some Syrians resorted to desperate tactics to escape their country. Under the cover of pre-dawn darkness, a family of at least 10 stood quietly in fields not far from the Turkish border fence. With a signal from a smuggler, they then walked single-file toward the border, carrying suitcases and bags on their heads. The family then began crawling, one by one, through the barbed wire fence. Suddenly, flashlights flared in the darkness. A squad of Turkish gendarme soldiers ran along the fence toward the refugees, bellowing at the top of their lungs. Moments later, the family members came stumbling back to Syria, still clutching their suitcases. For now, there would be no escape.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The first daughters have gotten it along with other children, and more residents around the nation may soon be able to get the H1N1 flu vaccine as health officials say more is on its way. According to a statement posted on the White House Web site by Catherine McCormick-Lelyveld, press secretary for first lady Michelle Obama, daughters Sasha and Malia received their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines last week. The president's daughters received the vaccine ""after the vaccine became available to Washington, D.C., schoolchildren,"" according to the statement. Since Friday, about 6 million more doses of H1N1 flu shots and nasal spray have been released. ""We have 22.4 million doses available for shipment out directly to providers and we're getting to the level where it will become significantly easier to find and receive vaccine."" Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday during a press conference. Frieden told reporters, ""We wish it had been available weeks or even months earlier but we're beginning to get to a significant increase in the availability."" The CDC had hoped that about 40 million doses of H1N1 -- also know as swine flu -- vaccine would be available by the end of October. On October 16, CDC officials announced that only 28 million to 30 million doses would be available this month, because of manufacturing delays. Sens. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, expressed ""strong concerns"" about the distribution of the H1N1 vaccine in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Frieden also told reporters that while the H1N1 flu is still widespread across the country, some areas are seeing flu activity start to decrease. But he said the decrease is patchy, even within some states. He confirmed H1N1 is decreasing in Georgia, which was hit hard when schools reopened in August. Michigan schools were recently affected, with 117 schools still closed in the state, down from more than 240 last week, according to James McCurtis of the Michigan Department of Community Health. McCurtis said on the department's Web site that most schools are closed because of high absenteeism. He said parents are keeping children with flu-like symptoms at home, which is what health officials have been recommending. CNN's Saundra Young contributed to this report.","Since Friday, 6 million doses of H1N1 flu shots, nasal spray released .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Taliban spokesman says the group's phones and website were hacked, and text messages sent out saying their reclusive Afghan leader Mullah Mohammed Omar is dead -- a claim the group has denied. Omar is alive and the reports ""are just propaganda against our leader and our mission,"" spokesman Zabihullah Nujahid told CNN. NATO said it has no operational knowledge of Omar's condition or whereabouts. This is not the first time speculation of Omar's death has surfaced. In May, the Taliban forcefully denied reports that their leader is dead, dismissing them as ""claims and rumors"" from the ""Kabul stooge regime's intelligence directorate."" At the time, a news report by Afghanistan's TOLOnews suggested Omar was dead. A spokesman for Afghanistan's intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, said in May that Omar had disappeared. Lutfullah Mashal said at the time that he hoped Omar was dead, but could not confirm it. Omar was a rural Islamic cleric when he became a leader of a group of students -- or ""Taliban"" -- who took over Afghanistan in the early 1990s and established a hard-line Islamic fundamentalist regime that gave shelter to Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network. U.S. Navy SEALs killed bin Laden in May in Pakistan, nearly 10 years after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The United States led an invasion of Afghanistan soon after the attacks, toppling the Taliban and sending bin Laden into hiding. The secluded Omar refused to be photographed or filmed, and rarely traveled. He infrequently gave interviews and was thought to have met only two non-Muslims in recent years. Nonetheless what Omar said passed as law when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, and to challenge him was unknown. Those who had met Omar said he cast an imposing figure -- bearded with a black turban and one eye stitched shut; the result of a wound suffered during a gunfight with Soviet troops during their occupation of Afghanistan. In the wake of the Soviet withdrawal, Omar created the Taliban to overcome what he saw as Afghanistan's descent into a lawlessness landscape dominated by warlords. His recruits came from the Islamic schools within Afghanistan and in the Afghan refugee camps across the border in Pakistan. Driven largely by faith, they swept across the country. With most of the country under Taliban control, he set himself the goal of transforming Afghanistan into the purest Islamic state in the world, declaring himself Amir-ul-Momineen, or head of the Muslims. While many ordinary Afghans disagreed with his hard-line interpretation of Islam, others were willing to endure the Taliban's excesses in exchange for the relative peace they brought to the territory they controlled. In building the perfect Islamic state, though, he had little regard for the concerns of the outside world. Public executions and amputations were common, and the Taliban's treatment of women attracted much international condemnation. Omar vanished after a U.S.-led coalition booted the Taliban and their leaders from power in Afghanistan in December 2001 for refusing to hand over bin Laden after the 9/11 terror attacks. His appearance has remained a mystery to many, and that presented a challenge to those on his trail, according to Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The U.S. government offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to Omar's capture.","The Taliban says their phones and website were hacked, and Mullah Omar is still alive .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Legendary pop singer Whitney Houston was found dead Saturday at a Beverly Hills, California, hotel, officials said. She was 48. The entertainer, whose incredible talent was discovered at an early age, was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m. (6:55 p.m. ET) at the Beverly Hilton hotel despite resuscitation efforts, a police spokesman said. Beverly Hills Police Lt. Mark Rosen said there were ""no obvious signs of criminal intent"" and that the cause of her death is being investigated. Houston's bodyguard found her body, said Courtney Barnes, publicist for hip-hop artist Ray J, who was dating the pop diva. According to her official website, Houston sold more than 170 million albums, singles and videos. But she also struggled with addiction problems over the years. Houston, whose hits included ""The Greatest Love of All,"" died on the eve of the 54th annual Grammy Awards at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. She had performed as late as Thursday night at a pre-Grammy event in the area. A pre-Grammy party was scheduled Saturday night at the Beverly Hilton. Music producer Jimmy Jam, after conversations with those heading up to Sunday's night show, told CNN that he believes the event will change significantly -- including a tribute to the singer. The entertainer recently returned to a movie set for ""Sparkle,"" a remake of the 1976 hit, which was loosely based on the story of The Supremes. It is scheduled be released nationwide in August, according to Sony Pictures. It was her first movie role since 1996's ""The Preacher's Wife."" News of her death elicited a flood of reaction from fans and fellow celebrities alike. Singer Aretha Franklin said, ""I just can't talk about it now. It's so stunning and unbelievable. I couldn't believe what I was reading coming across the TV screen. My heart goes out to Cissy (Houston's mother), her daughter Bobbi Kris, her family and Bobby (Brown)."" Dolly Parton, who wrote ""I Will Always Love You,"" said, ""mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken over the death of Whitney Houston. I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed.'"" Another entertainment legend, Quincy Jones, said he was ""absolutely heartbroken"" by the news. ""She was a true original and a talent beyond compare,"" he said. Houston's body of work included a string of Billboard No. 1 hits in the 1980s, including ""Saving All My Love for You,"" ""How Will I Know,"" ""The Greatest Love of All,"" ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go,"" and ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)."" Billboard put her soundtrack to the 1992 movie ""The Bodyguard"" as one of the top 10 biggest-selling albums of all time. She also starred in the film with Kevin Costner. The soundtrack included the hit,""I Will Always Love You."" Whitney Houston was born on August 9, 1963, in Newark, New Jersey. Famed music producer Clive Davis reportedly spotted Houston 20 years later in a New York nightclub, signing her on the spot, according to her website. Davis steered Houston's career for more than 25 years, also serving as a mentor. Just Thursday, Davis told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" that, with Houston, ""I saw a depth and a range and soul ... that rarely ranks at the top level. And that's why we've been working together ever since."" The singer's rendition of the national anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl, days into the first Persian Gulf War, earned raves and cemented her place in the American musical landscape. After ""The Bodyguard,"" Houston went on to appear in several more films in the 1990s, including ""Waiting to Exhale."" In 2000, Houston earned her sixth Grammy for best female R&B performance and, a month later, she was named female artist of the decade at the ""Soul Train"" Music Awards. Her career stalled, however, in subsequent years as she entered rehab for addiction problems. Houston took a hiatus for several years before releasing her first album in seven years, ""I Look to You,"" in 2009. ""I just took a break, which sometimes you have to,"" said Houston. ""You have to know when to slow that train down and kind of just sit back and relax for a minute."" In May 2011, Houston got help for her much-publicized struggle with drugs and alcohol, her representative said at the time. In a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Houston recalled how her mother arrived one day at her doorstep at her daughter's house with sheriff's officers and a court order in a drug intervention. She talked about doing cocaine and smoking marijuana. ""(My mother) says, 'I have a court (injunction) here,'"" Houston said. ""Either you do it my way, or we're just not going to do this at all. We are both going to go on TV, and you're going to retire.'"" Houston had a high-profile and tumultuous marriage to Bobby Brown, a former ""New Edition"" star who has had multiple brushes with the law. The couple appeared together in the mid-2000s on the reality show ""Being Bobby Brown."" They had one child together, Bobbi Kristina. Houston was the cousin of Dionne Warwick, another acclaimed performer. Singer Lionel Richie told CNN that Houston was one of the best. ""She had that voice that could just turn a story, a melody into magical notes,"" Richie said.

"(CNN) -- An anonymous group says it stole copies of GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's tax records and will release them unless the company it stole them from pays $1 million. The Secret Service said it is investigating, and the company said there is no immediate sign that any such theft took place. ""Using your office"" in Franklin, Tennessee, the group tells PricewaterhouseCoopers in an online posting, ""we were able to gain access to your network file servers and copy over the tax documents for one Willard M Romney and Ann D Romney."" It threatens to send encrypted copies to ""all major news outlets"" and warns, ""If the parties interested do not want the encrypted key released to the public to unlock these documents on September 28 of this year then payment will be necessary."" If the money is not received, ""the entire world will be allowed to view the documents with a publicly released key to unlock everything,"" the group warns. The group demands $1 million worth of the online currency Bitcoins. It also says that people who want the documents released can send money as well, and whichever side sends $1 million first will win. Bitcoin is a digital currency not overseen by any government or bank. Various merchants accept the currency for goods and services. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers tax services as well as auditing and more, tweeted that it is ""working with the Secret Service. At this time, there is no evidence of unauthorized access to our data."" The anonymous postings say that flash drive copies of the stolen material have been sent to the company, as well as to the county Democratic and Republican offices, and that a scanned image of Romney's signature from the forms was included. Jean Barwick with the Williamson County, Tennessee, Republican Party told CNN that her office found the package -- a padded envelope -- on Friday outside the door to the party offices. The package ""didn't seem credible,"" partly because it said ""for learders"" instead of ""leaders,"" she said. Inside were a letter -- one that has been posted online -- and a flash drive. ""I didn't put that in any of our computers,"" and no one has looked at the contents, she said. ""I put it in the drawer."" She called state party officials, who were in Tampa, Florida, at the Republican National Convention at the time, she said. Her office later reported the package to local police, and the Secret Service picked it up Wednesday, she said. County Democratic Party Chairman Peter Burr also told CNN the package arrived last week, and the Secret Service came Wednesday to collect it. ""We did not view it,"" Burr said. He added that he considered looking at it, and the party attorney ""advised us not to."" ""We wouldn't have been interested to use it even if it was"" real, he said. The package was dropped through the mail slot to the party office, Burr said. It had been hand-addressed with a blue highlighter. The state party advised the office to turn it over to the Secret Service, Burr said. He said he thinks it was a scam. In an online posting, the group said the alleged theft took place on August 25. The Franklin Police Department did not respond to any calls at the building containing the PricewaterhouseCoopers office in August and did not take a report from any tenants of the building during the month either, a police spokesman said Thursday. On Wednesday, it responded to the Republican Party office, and ""due to the nature of the call, we contacted the Secret Service who met with our officers at the scene and assumed responsibility for the investigation,"" Lt. Charles Warner said. Romney campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg directed questions to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Chris Atkins, a spokesman for the firm, said the company does not share information on how long it has done taxes for any client. Atkins added that he has no idea why the Franklin office would be named in the claims. The company has more than 80 offices around the country and there's nothing unique about the one in Franklin, he said. While the postings, on the website pastebin.com, refer to ""a team"" involved in the alleged break-in, one ends with a line stating that certain ""considerations did not deter me from the path of duty"" and a reference to ""the will of my Heavenly Father."" The postings go into detail about how the alleged theft was carried out. The group says it obtained ""all available 1040 tax forms for Romney,"" including some from before 2010, but it does not say which years. Romney has released his 2010 and 2011 tax returns, and has said he will not release others. The issue has been a source of controversy on the campaign trail. Pastebin allows users to paste text anonymously for a period of time. The company explains on its website that it was created to help programmers, and anything not related to that ""which results in unusually high traffic will be flagged for investigation. Your paste may be deleted and your IP blocked. In particular, please do not paste email lists, password lists or personal information."" The company did not immediately respond to an e-mail from CNN asking whether it plans to remove the posts. The site logs files of users' Internet protocol addresses and service providers, along with some other information, the website explains. But the data is ""not linked to any information that is personally identifiable."" Many hackers take numerous steps to protect anonymity, making it difficult to track them down. Jeff Garzik, listed on the Bitcoin website as part of its development team, told CNN the ""consensus among the Bitcoin chattering class appears to be that this is a hoax."" He cited an online forum in which many users express that view. The currency is traceable, even if users go by pseudonyms, Garzik said. Every transaction is stored in a ""block chain,"" which he compares to ""a public ledger."" ""It seems unlikely that thieves would make so public a heist, with law enforcement so likely to watch the block chain and associated Bitcoin exchanges,"" he said. CNN's Dave Alsup, Carol Cratty and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","NEW: A Bitcoin developer says such a heist seems unlikely .

"(CNN)  -- Double amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius has moved a step closer to realizing his dream of participating in the Olympics after running the 'B' standard qualifying time for next year's Games in London. The 24-year-old, who was born without fibulae in both legs, clocked 45.61 seconds to win the 400m race at the Provincial Championships in his home town of Pretoria in South Africa on Wednesday. Dubbed the 'Blade Runner' because of his carbon fiber prosthetic limbs, Pistorius must now run 0.6 seconds faster to be granted automatic qualification. But his time could still be good enough to earn him a place in the South African team depending on the performance of other athletes. After narrowly missing out on the time required for the Beijing Olympics, the Johannesburg-born athlete expressed his delight at the achievement on his Twitter page. ""One of the best nights of my life. Ran a 45.61sec 400m Olympic qualifying time and fastest time in South Africa,"" Pistorius, whose legs were amputated when he was just 11 months old, wrote. ""Thanks to everyone who has supported and believed in me in my Quest to 2012 London Olympics. One step closer. I'm hungry for it."" After finishing sixth at his National Championships in 2007, Pistorius was blocked from competing alongside his able-bodied counterparts as his blades were considered to give him an unfair advantage. But in 2008 the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled in favor of the four-time Paralympic champion after a lengthy legal battle with the IAAF. Should he make it to London 2012, Pistorius would become the first amputee sprinter to compete in an Olympics. He first competed in the Paralympic Games in Athens in 2004, where he won gold in the 200m and bronze in the 100m, after having only taken up the sport eight months previously. His compatriot Natalie du Toit, a single amputee swimmer, and Natalia Partyka, a Polish table tennis player who was born with one arm ending just below her elbow, competed at both the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Beijing. His new personal best time, 0.41 seconds better than his previous fastest, could also allow him to compete in the World Athletics Championships, which take place in Daegu, South Korea later this year.","Oscar Pistorius runs 'B' standard qualifying time for the London 2012 Olympics .

"New York (CNN) -- Muslim-American leaders gathered Monday to voice their support for the building of mosques in America and, more specifically, for the planned Islamic center and mosque to be known as Park51 near Manhattan's ground zero. Imam Al-Amin Abdul Latif, president of the Islamic Leadership Council of Metropolitan New York, read a joint statement on the steps of the Park51 location. ""We stand for the constitutional right of Muslims and Americans of all faiths to build houses of worship anywhere in our nation as allowed by local laws and regulations,"" he said. He added that the group represents more than 55 mosques and Islamic organizations in New York City that ""stand against the racism, hatred, religious intolerance and ethnic bigotry directed against Islam and American Muslims."" The group's statement also called for ""a week of dialogue to help combat bigotry and promote understanding and religious tolerance in civil society."" Latif told reporters that a number of mosques all over the country will hold open houses during the weekend of October 22-24 to help people of other faiths better understand Islam and Muslims. Mahdi Bray, a Muslim leader from MAS Freedom, said that he believes the Park51 Islamic center should be seen as ""a symbol of reconciliation, a symbol of unity and a symbol of mutual respect."" He noted that ""none of our organizations is capable of putting money into this. We're putting ideas and we're putting social and political support behind it."" The developers of Park51 issued a written statement following the news conference thanking Muslim-American leaders for their support: . ""Our community remains committed to building bridges of understanding to our neighborhoods, to our city and to the rest of America. Park51 will embody that commitment. In doing so it provides much needed services to New Yorkers of all backgrounds who live and work in Lower Manhattan."" Nihad Awad of the Council on American-Islamic Relations acknowledged that the developers could have handled the project better but said they are doing what everyone does when they misstep: ""You just pick yourself up and move forward and that's what happening now,"" he said. The Park51 project is no longer a case, it is a cause, Awad said. And because it has become a cause he believes it will get the funding it requires to be completed. ""This is America. Nothing moves America like a cause, and that includes money,"" he said.","Leaders representing mosques, Islamic groups gather to back controversial center .

"(Mashable) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has stepped down, more than two weeks after the protests that began January 25 in the country -- and launched a flood of #Jan25 and #Egypt tweets as well as media coverage that broke the mold -- to remove the president from power. From the beginning, the revolution in Egypt was propelled by the use of social media. It at least partlybegan on Facebook with the creation of Facebook groups that gained hundreds of thousands of members and promoted the early protests in Cairo. Subsequently, the government blocked Facebook and Twitter and eventually shut down Internet access completely. And with the outside world following the unfolding revolution online, political leaders and others, including Twitter, spoke out against the violence and freedom of expression issues at risk. But even a government shut down couldn't keep the news from flowing. Twitter and Facebook users found ways to work around the blackout. Though, eventually access was completely restored. The events in Egypt served as a flash point for journalists on the ground, too. For perhaps one of the first times in history, history itself has been recorded instantaneously, as reporters took to Twitter to share 140-character updates and personal stories from the protests. The messages provided a stark reality to readers in the outside world, especially as the protests turned violent and police turned on journalists -- the very people many of us outside the country were following. But Al Jazeera had its ""CNN Moment,"" and although it couldn't reach viewers in the U.S. by cable television, it found a way to viewers -- on YouTube. The network live streamed Mubarak's public address -- in which many believed he would resign -- Thursday via YouTube. But Al Jazeera's comprehensive coverage put it on the radar for U.S. viewers and it created a campaign to bring its English-language network to U.S. televisions. Images of the turmoil spread around the world via Flickr and Youtube, too. Al Jazeera made its images available by a Creative Commons license and its work reached an even broader audience around the world. Without a doubt, social media, mobile devices and the web have brought the stories from Egypt closer to home. And conversely, the events in Egypt have shown the strength of these tools for both organizing and informing people. The Egyptian people and reporters alike found ways to share their messages even when the government tried to stop them. Using VPN, proxy sites, third party apps and other tools, they were able to continue sharing news with those of us on the outside. And at the same time, the rest of the world found ways to use tech to curate and disseminate information. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Wildlife lobbyists are mounting an online campaign to urge Vietnam's prime minister to reprieve an animal sanctuary threatened with closure. Comic actor Ricky Gervais and broadcaster Stephen Fry are among the many people who have used Twitter to call on Vietnam to lift the threat to shut the Bear Rescue Center, operated by Hong Kong-based charity Animals Asia. The centre was set up to provide a safe home for bears previously captured and exploited by farmers as a source of bear bile -- regarded as a traditional medicine by many people in east Asian countries. Bears in the illegal bile industry can be held for decades in cramped cages, having their bile regularly extracted direct from their abdomens in conditions described as barbaric by animal welfare campaigners. Animals Asia says it's operating on land allocated by the government in 2005 for the purpose of a bear sanctuary, in Tam Dao National Park north of Hanoi. It now houses 104 rescued Asiatic black bears -- also know as moon bears, for their crescent-shaped chest markings. The charity says it has been told the center has to leave the site after coming under pressure from the director of the national park. It claims he lobbied the Ministry of Defense to declare the area is of national defense significance -- a status the charity says is not justified. It alleges the true motive for reclaiming the land is to develop it for profit. ""We are desperate to ensure that the rescue center is not closed down and relocated,"" said Jill Robinson, the founder and chief executive of Animals Asia. The charity says it has invested $2 million of donors' money in the bear rehabilitation center, which will be lost if the centre closes. Robinson said it would also cost 77 local people their jobs, and added: ""The welfare of 104 bears, who have already suffered enough, would be seriously compromised."" Now she and Animals Asia are pinning their hopes for a reprieve on an appeal to Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. They say he can override the eviction ruling, and are urging him to honor the original agreement to set land aside as a home for bears. Stephen Fry this week joined the campaign to stop the sanctuary from being shut, tweeting to his 4.9 million followers: ""Stop 104 rescued bears losing their home! Email Vietnam's PM to save Animals Asia's sanctuary #stoptheeviction"". The government of Vietnam has so far not responded to CNN's requests for comment.","Online campaign launched to save bear sanctuary in Vietnam from closure .

"(CNN) -- The United States and its allies face a variety of risks in taking direct military action against Syria over allegations that it used chemical weapons against civilians, including more poison gas attacks and retaliation against American interests. Those warnings come from experts in chemical weapons and veteran Middle East analysts, some of whom say Washington faces no good choices in confronting embattled Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Missile strikes on Syrian military command bunkers, airfields or the artillery batteries and rocket launchers used to fire chemical projectiles are among the options U.S. officials say are under consideration. But there is no indication that the missiles would target stockpiles of chemical weapons -- something Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the British military's chemical defense regiment, called ""the worst possible option."" Syria: How did we get here? ""If the missile and the explosive are big enough, they will, of course, destroy it,"" de Bretton-Gordon said. ""However, there will be a downwind hazard, and those people in the vicinity -- and it's very difficult to say how far, but certainly a kilometer or so -- are likely going to suffer and become casualties from the fallout of those exploding chemical weapons."" And any attack on Syria might encourage al-Assad to order more chemical attacks on rebel forces and civilians in opposition-held areas, said Amy Smithson, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Washington. Syria 'a 10-year issue,' U.S. general says . ""Not doing anything tells Assad he's not going to get punished, go out and use the chemicals,"" said Smithson, who has studied chemical and biological weapons for two decades. ""Striking the chemical sites presents a very real risk of releasing toxic chemicals over nearby civilian populations. Not striking the chemical sites leaves Assad with potent weapons in his hands that he's shown he's willing to use."" Striking other military targets leaves ""a very ticked-off despot that is now perhaps even more tempted to use his chemical arsenal,"" she said. ""He's already been punished for it."" That might convince al-Assad to go out ""in a blaze of glory -- or in this case, infamy."" 'Red line' debate: Are chemical weapons worse than attacks? Juan Cole, a professor of Middle Eastern history at the University of Michigan, said the kind of intervention being discussed isn't likely to affect the balance of power in the 2-year-old Syrian conflict beyond providing a psychological boost to the rebels, who have suffered battlefield setbacks over the summer. ""This is more about Washington saving face, it seems to me, than it is a consequential intervention in the Syrian conflict,"" Cole said, adding, ""When you're in a position where it is assumed that the United States must do something, a couple of Tomahawks make a statement."" The war ""is being fought in alleyways and at close quarters, with artillery and tanks inside cities,"" he said. Missile strikes from distant warships or aircraft wouldn't be able to knock out enough of those weapons to make a difference without inflicting extensive civilian losses, he said. Opinion: Syria 'a problem from hell' Syria has admitted to possessing chemical weapons but has denied using them, saying its troops were the victims of rebel attacks. U.N. inspectors are now in Syria to investigate whether the reported deaths of hundreds of people outside Damascus a week ago was the result of a chemical attack. But U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Tuesday there was ""no doubt"" government troops used chemical weapons on civilians. The United States has already demanded that al-Assad cede power and is supporting Syria's opposition, but the possible American strikes are not about removing him, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday. ""They are about responding to a clear violation of an international standard that prohibits the use of chemical weapons,"" Carney said. Opinion: Why Western intervention in Syria will leave chaos . Syria's civil war is already spilling over the borders of its neighbors in the form of bombings and refugees and is widely seen as a proxy war among different regional powers. Cole said al-Assad's government might try to strike back by targeting American military, diplomatic or commercial interests in the Middle East, perhaps employing its allies in the Lebanese militia Hezbollah -- which has a long and bloody track record targeting Americans during Lebanon's long civil war. ""If Washington bombs things in Syria, I wouldn't want to be an American in Beirut within reaching distance of Hezbollah,"" he said. ""You could see a return to 1980s types of things happening, when our embassy was blown up in Beirut and our CIA station chief was kidnapped and killed in the woods."" Both de Bretton-Gordon and Smithson said a better course of action might be to start supplying Syrians with the means to defend themselves against chemical attack. That means distributing masks, detectors and drugs used to treat patients exposed to nerve gas and training Syrians how to use them. What justifies intervening if Syria uses chemical weapons? Smithson said those supplies and training could be provided by numerous countries, whose militaries are trained in chemical defense, and rushed into the field by aid agencies and opposition groups, possibly via neighboring Turkey. It could be done ""very quickly and very publicly,"" and with broader support from the international community than American airstrikes, she said. ""If the civilian population can be equipped to contend with this, just as they have adjusted their lifestyles to adapt to urban warfare around them, then perhaps that takes away some of the advantage,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Yahoo has announced a plan to ""recycle"" old e-mail addresses, a move meant to free up accounts for folks who want them but that has sparked privacy concerns. In a blog post, senior vice president Jay Rossiter announced that Yahoo e-mail accounts that have been dormant for more than a year will be reset so that active users can have access to them. ""If you're like me, you want a Yahoo! ID that's short, sweet, and memorable like albert@yahoo.com instead of albert9330399@yahoo.com,"" he wrote. The one-year period will officially begin July 15, when users can ""claim"" a dormant account name. They'll find out in mid-August if they got the account they wanted. It's clearly an effort by Yahoo, which has been working to redefine and rejuvenate itself under new CEO Marissa Mayer, to re-engage older users and reward active ones. But it has security experts nervous. Security analyst Graham Cluley doesn't mince words. ""In short: as an idea it sucks, and it shows Yahoo's lack of respect to customers who created accounts with them in years gone by,"" Cluley wrote Wednesday. Cluley lists several scenarios where the plan could backfire. They include situations in which a user has another primary e-mail account, but has given their Yahoo address as a backup in case of security situations, lost passwords and the like. He said the move appears to be ""an underhanded way to get people to re-engage with the site"" and that people who may not actively use their Yahoo mail, but use it to store old messages and other documents, could lose them without ever realizing it. Mat Honan of CNN content partner Wired, himself the recent victim of a high-profile hack, called the move ""a spectacularly bad idea."" In the wake of such complaints, Yahoo released a followup statement saying it's sure the transition can be made without compromising security. ""We're committed and confident in our ability to do this in a way that's safe, secure and protects our users' data,"" the company said. The vast majority of inactive Yahoo IDs don't have a mailbox associated with them, the company said, and any personal data associated with the accounts will be deleted. During a 30-day deactivation period, bounce-back e-mails will alert senders that the deactivated account no longer exists and Yahoo will unsubscribe those accounts from newsletters, commercial e-mail alerts and the like. Businesses, financial institutions, social networks and other e-mail providers will be sent notifications about e-mail addresses that have been deactivated.

"(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee has reinstated India, allowing its athletes to once again compete under their country's flag after a ban of more than a year. The reinstatement raises to 89 the number of countries and territories participating in the Sochi Games. ""It is the first time in Olympic history that a suspension of an NOC (National Olympic Committee) has been lifted during an Olympic Games,"" the IOC said in a statement Tuesday. The decision means that Indian athletes can now compete for India's Olympic committee and walk behind their national flag at the closing ceremony of the Winter Games in Sochi on 23 February, the statement said. At the opening ceremony last week, India's delegation of three athletes had marched under an IOC flag. India was suspended from the Olympic fold in December 2012 after the Indian Olympic Association elected Lalit Bhanot, who spent 11 months in jail on corruption charges, to a top post. The situation remained deadlocked for months, as the Indian association refused to bow to the IOC's demands for changes. But the IOC said Tuesday that it had ended the suspension following the Indian association's general assembly and elections for a new board on Sunday. An IOC delegation that observed the elections reported that they complied with the requirement that ""no person convicted or charge-framed can run for a position within the organization."" Narayna Ramachandran, the president of the World Squash Federation, was voted in as the new president of the Indian association. ""To symbolically mark the lifting of the suspension and in recognition of the three Indian athletes competing in Sochi, the Indian flag will be raised in the Olympic Village,"" the IOC said Tuesday. India responded positively to the announcement. ""I am happy that suspension is over and now Indian teams and players will take part in the International events under the national flag,"" said Vijay Kumar Malhotra, the former acting president of Indian Olympic Association.

"(CNN) -- Iranian lawmakers have drafted a bill that would force the government to enrich uranium up to 60% if new sanctions are imposed, state media reported Wednesday. The move comes less than a week after bipartisan legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate that would authorize new economic sanctions on Iran if it breaches an interim agreement to limit its nuclear program or fails to strike a final accord terminating those ambitions. ""If the bill is approved, the government will be obliged to complete nuclear infrastructure at Fordo and Natanz (facilities) if sanctions (against Iran) are ratcheted up, new sanctions are imposed, the country's nuclear rights are violated and the Islamic Republic of Iran's peaceful nuclear rights are ignored by members of P5+1,"" state-run Press TV reported lawmaker Seyyed Mehdi Mousavinejad said. The so-called P5+1 is the United States, Britain, China, Russia, France and Germany. The draft bill was signed by 100 legislators, Press TV said. A six-month agreement struck in November among the United States, other world powers and Iran calls for Tehran to start limiting its nuclear activities in return for a relaxation of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Talks are under way on a permanent agreement, and the outcome is uncertain. The Senate proposal emerged despite Obama administration appeals for Congress to defer pursuing new sanctions with diplomatic efforts ongoing. The White House said new sanctions would undermine those delicate efforts on the global stage and President Barack Obama would veto the legislation if Congress were to approve it now. The proposal would give Obama more than a year to engage in further diplomacy before any new sanctions would kick in against Iran's oil exports and other key areas of its economy. Sanctions would hit sooner if Iran cheats on the interim deal or fails to reach a final accord. The Obama administration has said the centerpiece of its policy is for Iran to not achieve a nuclear weapon. The United States and other western powers believe Iran is attempting to build a bomb through uranium enrichment. But Tehran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful.

"(CNN) -- Close your eyes and imagine this. It is the 1930s and, as Nazism starts to flex its muscles in Europe, you are in the Middle East bouncing along a rough road on your way to visit an archaeological dig. The excavation is taking place on Mount Carmel, fabled site of the Prophet Elijah's burning altar, and archaeologists are digging deep to uncover the roots of humanity in the region. So far, so Indiana Jones. Except that when you arrive and walk through the tented camp to the trenches, you realize that almost every single person -- from the Palestinian excavators and overseers, to the Cambridge University team directing the project -- is a woman. Because this isn't a feminist fantasy -- this is Dorothy Garrod's excavation project at the Carmel Caves, and it's the reality. If you are surprised, I don't blame you. I felt much the same when I dug deeper into the story of a hero of mine, the pioneering palaeontologist Dorothea Bate. Between 1901 and 1905, totally unchaperoned, the twenty-something year-old Dorothea Bate explored the cliffs, caves and mountains of Cyprus and Crete in search of fossils. She was phenomenally successful, with her fossil finds becoming an important part of the collection at London's Natural History Museum that I now work on. To do all of this as a woman in the early 1900s, I thought, she must have been truly extraordinary. Except I was wrong. Daring, clever, courageous and pioneering, yes -- but extraordinary? It seems not. At the same time as Dorothea Bate was exploring Crete, an archaeologist named Harriet Boyd was directing the excavations of the Minoan town of Gournia. With her were two more women, Edith Hall and Blanche Wheeler. This image of not one, but four Edwardian women, digging for fossils and Minoan potsherds during the turbulent early days of post-Ottoman Crete surprised and captivated me. So I did the obvious thing and tweeted about it. I was totally unprepared for what followed. I was bombarded with more examples of pioneering women archaeologists: Dorothy Garrod, who we met above; cross-dressing Jane Dieulafoy; Gertrude Bell, spy and mentor to T.E. Lawrence; the explorer and painter of Mayan ruins, Adela Breton; Gertrude Caton-Thompson, excavator of Great Zimbabwe; Nina Layard, Jacquetta Hawkes, Freya Stark, Frederica de Laguna, Amelia Edwards, Mary Butler, Agatha Christie (yes, that one), Kathleen Kenyon -- the names just kept on coming, and as they did my delight turned to indignation. Why hadn't I heard of these women? Not the individual names -- I can barely name any male archaeologists from that period -- but the idea of these women, working in such numbers and even leading their fields. It was as though we'd blithely wiped them all from our popular imaginations, and thus allowed each woman to be easily dismissed -- albeit with an approving pat on the head -- as anachronistic and an exception-to-the-masculine- rule. As the names of pioneering women archaeologists bounced around my corner of the Twittersphere, so too did demands for more information, for television programs (which don't exist) and books (which do). These women's lives were packed full of adventure, tales of derring-do and breathtaking discovery, and together they subvert an idea of femininity that persists to this day. Stories worth celebrating. So when Mike Sizemore suggested I start a Tumblr to do just that, I punched the air and the simple brilliance of the idea. Yes! But there was no way I could do it on my own. Fortunately, much as Dorothea Bate wasn't alone in Crete in 1903, I was not alone in the wild frontiers of social media. Brenna Hassett, Rebecca Wragg Sykes and Suzanne Pilaar Birch -- all, like me, in the early stages of their scientific careers -- immediately stepped up. In the space of just a few hours, four women who barely knew each other outside the realm of Twitter, had signed away their free time to start a blog celebrating pioneering women in archaeology, palaeontology and geology. We called it TrowelBlazers. TrowelBlazers is now just over one month old and we already have over twenty posts online, and more submitted, written by people who want share their admiration for the women who inspired them. And we have a lively -- and lovely -- Twitter feed and Facebook page, where hundreds of people join in funny, joyous, free-flowing conversations, celebrating these women, sharing fieldwork stories, and forging new friendships and networks in the process. We're planning Wikipedia edit-a-thons as part of Ada Lovelace Day , and stepping in wherever we think a trowelblazing opinion is needed. And we want everyone to join in. We dare to dream that TrowelBlazers will help to reset people's imaginations -- for it to become as normal to imagine Gertrude Bell as it is Lawrence of Arabia. For Dorothy Garrod to trump Indiana Jones. We want to ask children to draw us pictures of palaeontologists and geologists and archaeologists, and we want those pictures to be of women as often as they men. Because this isn't political correctness, and this isn't fiction -- though the stories are great. It's the reality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Victoria Herridge.","Archaeologist Dorothy Garrod led an excavation in 1930s with all-female team .

"(CNN) -- A Syriac Orthodox archbishop in Britain called for all Christians in Iraq to leave the country Sunday, one week to the day after gunmen stormed a Catholic church in Baghdad. Some 50 people were killed and 75 wounded in the attack at the Sayidat al-Nejat church last week, including women, children and two priests. Archbishop Athanasios Dawood slammed the Iraqi government for not doing enough to protect the rights of minorities and urged Christians to quit the country. ""I say clearly and now -- the Christian people should leave their beloved land of our ancestors and escape the premeditated ethnic cleansing. This is better than having them killed one by one,"" said Dawood, according to prepared remarks he sent to CNN. Speaking at a service in London, he also asked the British government, and those in other European countries, to grant asylum to Christians living in Iraq. ""The Iraqi government is weak, biased, if not extremist. It does not protect us and the other minorities. It has ignored our legal rights. We ask the British government, the EU and the U.N. to protect us,"" he said. ""I ask the British government again to help the Iraqi Christians and grant them the rights of humanitarian asylum in order to preserve what is left of the victims who do not carry a weapon to fight and kill,"" said Dawood. His call came a week after the brutal siege on a Baghdad church. The Islamic State of Iraq, which has local ties to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attack, which was set off when gunman stormed the church and took worshippers hostage. Security forces rushed inside hours later, ending the standoff. The radical group has said all Christians in the Middle East are ""legitimate targets."" On Sunday, evidence of the horrific clash still clung to the walls. Blood stains, bullet holes and black residue from an explosion smeared the sides of the church. Parishioners came to celebrate Mass and to place candles in the shape of a cross on the floor to honor those who died. Most who spoke to CNN said they would not allow terror to prevail, but also expressed fear. ""My nerves are frayed. I can't feel my body. I feel like my blood dried up. My whole body is shaking because what I am seeing is unimaginable,"" said Linda Hagob, a congregant. The church, which before the attack was open for morning and evening Mass on Sundays, will be open daily now. Elsewhere in Baghdad, at Saint Joseph's Church, about a dozen worshippers attended evening Mass, significantly less than a typical turnout, the parish priest said. Father Saad Sirop Hanna said Christians in Iraq are scared of more attacks. He blamed Iraqi politicians, who have been unable to form a government since elections there in March, for much of the violence. ""We blame the government and all the politicians. We consider what happened last Sunday in the church an effect of what they are doing now, and we want all the good people to move and put an end to this situation,"" he said. Hanna also responded to Dawood's call for Christians to quit Iraq. ""Staying or leaving -- we will leave it to the people to decide ... I can understand this bishop, this priest, I can understand him. I agree with him from a certain point of view, but I disagree with him from another."" ""We are afraid, but not desperate,"" Hanna said. CNN's Bharati Naik in London and Jomana Karadsheh and Arwa Damon, both in Baghdad, contributed to this report.","Archbishop Athanasios Dawood says the Iraqi government does not protect minorities .

"(CNN) -- An ALS Ice Bucket Challenge went terribly wrong in Campbellsville, Kentucky, when four firefighters were seriously injured after participating in a group event, according to Campbellsville Police Chief Tim Hazlette. Electricity from a power line shocked the firefighters after they had sprayed water on students. Crews from the Fire and Rescue Department were helping the Campbellsville University band with their video ""Challenge"" around 11 a.m. Thursday. A photo obtained by CNN and taken by witness Tyler Arterburn shows the firetruck's aerial ladder hovering over the challenge participants as firefighters inside the ladder's bucket spray them with water. After the water spray ended, the students left and the firefighters began moving back the ladder, according to Hazlette. This is when the bucket at the top of the ladder came close enough to power lines to shock the firefighters with electricity. There were two men inside the bucket and two on the ground. Captain Tony Grider, 41, and firefighter Simon Quinn, 22, were inside the bucket. They were taken to Taylor Regional Hospital and then transferred to the University of Louisville Medical Center Burn Unit. ""One is in critical condition, the other is fair. Both have been admitted to the hospital's Level 1 burn unit,"" said KentuckyOne Health spokesperson, David McArthur. Two other firefighters, Captain Steve Marrs, 37, and Alex Johnson, 28, received electric shocks when they tried to lower the bucket and an electric current traveled down the extended ladder, said Hazlette. Marrs and Johnson were taken to Taylor Regional. Marrs was released and Johnson was admitted for observation, said Hazlette. Friend of man behind challenge dies . The incident remains under investigation but according to Hazlette, the ladder never touched the nearby power lines. ""From talking with the power company, if you get within a distance of 3 to 4 feet, the energy that surrounds the high-voltage wire will actually arc over another object, in this case being the personnel occupying the bucket,"" said Hazlette. In a statement posted on their website Campbellsville University asked for prayers. ""We express heartfelt sympathy and prayers for the families of the two firefighters who were injured,"" said university President Michael Carter in the statement. The university's Baptist Campus Ministry held a prayer service on Thursday evening. The Ice Bucket Challenge is a social media campaign that aims to raise awareness and money to fight Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The ALS Association has received over $41.8 million in donations compared to $2.1 million during the same time last year.

"(CNN) -- The International Committee of the Red Cross called on Israel to allow it immediate access to Gaza, saying a trip into Gaza City revealed weak children laying with their dead mothers and other ""shocking"" scenes. Israeli artillery fires a shell toward Gaza from the Israel-Gaza border on Wednesday. Red Cross workers and four ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent Society managed to enter the Zaytun neighborhood of Gaza City on Wednesday, according to a written release. The crew found four children, too weak to stand, next to their dead mothers in a house containing 12 corpses, the statement says. Other houses revealed more wounded and three more corpses, the release said. It said Israeli soldiers posted near the houses ordered the rescue team to leave the area -- an order the team refused. ""This is a shocking incident,"" said Pierre Wettach, the ICRC's chief official for Israel and the Palestinian territories. ""The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded. Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestine Red Crescent to assist the wounded."" A spokesman for Israel's military said early Thursday that the Red Cross's news release was the first he had heard of the alleged incident. Speaking after midnight, the spokesman said he was unsure if Israel has received a formal request to investigate. ""We do make every effort and our soldiers do put themselves at risk"" to help wounded civilians, the spokesman told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The Red Cross release said the children and other wounded were taken to ambulances in a donkey cart because earth walls erected by Israeli soldiers made it impossible for the ambulances to reach their neighborhood.

It said the group was told more wounded people were in the neighborhood, and demanded that Israel grant it and the Red Crescent immediate access and safe passage to search for them. The Israeli spokesman said the military has established a 24-hour liaison to maintain contacts with humanitarian organizations.  The Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed at least 680 people and injured more than 3,000 since it launched December 27, Palestinian medical sources said Wednesday. Thirty percent of the deaths are women and children, according to the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing statistics released Tuesday by the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Seven Israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed since the operation, the Israeli military reported. Israel says the purpose of the operation is to stop Hamas militants from firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel.","Red Cross: Workers found weak kids with dead mothers during trip into Gaza City .

"(CNN) -- Three brothers recuperated Thursday afternoon in a once-open field now speckled by the bright blue tarps of a cholera rehydration clinic in the Haitian town of Bercy, where an outbreak has sickened hundreds of people. A cousin brought the young boys to the clinic, set up by Samaritan's Purse, said Roseann Dennery, a spokeswoman for the Christian charity. They plopped down on cots, drained by severe diarrhea and vomiting. What they did not know yet was that the night before, their father had frantically tried to find a motorcycle so he could bring in their mother for treatment. He could not find one in time. So while the boys were regaining their strength with the help of an intravenous drip, their father was making funeral arrangements for their mother. They had survived the earthquake, but this family was ripped apart by a disease that is now feared to be spreading rapidly. The death toll in Haiti's cholera outbreak climbed Friday to 796 people, according to Haiti's Ministry of Public Health and Population. Another 12,303 people have fallen sick with the intestinal infection. Epidemiologists predict the outbreak could last for months and say the entire nation of almost 10 million people is at risk because they have no immunity to cholera. The United Nations warned that Haiti is facing one of the most severe outbreaks of the disease in the past 100 years. It appealed to international donors for almost $164 million in response money. Of grave concern now are four confirmed cases that originated in the tent cities of Port-au-Prince, camps that sprang up to shelter those left homeless by the earthquake last January. Health officials fear that infection could spread quickly in congested, unsanitary conditions and in impoverished neighborhoods where clean drinking water is at a premium. Symptoms of cholera, an acute, diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine, can be mild or even nonexistent. But sometimes they can be severe -- profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting and leg cramps, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration and shock. If left untreated, a person can die within hours. Aid workers like those of the American Red Cross have been going tent to tent in Haiti's makeshift camps, telling people of the importance of drinking clean water and outlining practices that can help avoid contamination. Spokeswoman Julie Sell said Red Cross workers also have been handing out bars of soap. ""Wash between your fingers,"" they tell the camp residents. ""Don't dry your hand with a dirty towel."" ""We find among many people there is very little understanding on how you prevent it,"" Sell said. People are anxious, she said, as the death curve has crept steadily higher and the health minister has proclaimed the cholera crisis a matter of national security. ""Haiti has had more than its share of bad luck,"" Sell said. ""This is another crisis that this country does not need. It's heartbreaking."" Complicating matters is the fact that Haiti has not seen cholera in more than 50 years -- it's yet another unfamiliar hardship for citizens and medical personnel. Also, the country's public health system, already strained before the earthquake, was virtually wiped out after January 12, according to the United Nations. ""Now you have the prospect of tens of thousands of cholera patients streaming into the system,"" Sell said. ""That will be difficult."" Aid agencies already working on the island to help quake survivors have rushed to set up cholera treatment centers. Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) was erecting another 320-bed facility in the Sarthe neighborhood. Samaritan's Purse planned to enlarge its clinic in Bercy -- about an hour's drive north of the capital -- to 100 beds by Thursday night. Dennery said the group was anticipating a need in nearby Cabaret as well. In the meantime, the government has been telling people not to panic; only to remain vigilant. And health workers have been spreading this word through cell phone texts, pamphlets and loudspeakers: Prevention is key. On Route 9 in Cite Soleil, Dennery's team looked more like political candidates than medical personnel when they passed through in their white ""tap-tap"" truck with large speakers mounted on top, she said. Crowds of people rushed to get a cholera flier, as though it were money. The important thing, Dennery said, is that the word is getting out on how to stay alive.","NEW: Haiti cholera death toll rises to 796, more than 12,000 sickened .

"(CNN) -- Just when you thought South Korea had milked the global success of ""Gangnam Style"" rapper Psy for every drop, along comes the unveiling of Seoul's new tourist police force. The connection? The officers' uniforms were created by Korean fashion designer Kim Seo-ryong, who has made costumes for Psy. Naturally, ""Gangnam Style"" was played as a group of Seoul police officers performed Psy's famous horse-riding dance during the tourist police inauguration ceremony at Seoul's Gwanghwamun Square on Wednesday. South Korea's Tourism Board (KTO) says the government decided to launch the force, made up of 101 men and women, in response to the rising number of visitors to the capital. ""These tourist police officers will be patrolling major tourist areas in Seoul such as Myeong-dong, Insa-dong, Itaewon Tourist Special Zone and Hongdae,"" said the official announcement. ""Aside from maintaining law and order and cracking down on overcharging merchants and taxi drivers, the officers will also be providing tourist assistance in English, Japanese and Chinese."" According to the Korea Tourism Organization, complaints from tourists involving shopping rose from 23.6% of all complaints filed by foreign tourists in 2008 to 34.7% last year, while overcharging by taxis and other transportation operators accounted for 15-20% over the last five years, reported Korea's Chosun.com. The tourism police are only on duty in Seoul at the moment, but will be expanded to other regions in the coming years. ""At the moment we don't have enough personnel to expand the service to other regions but we are planning on hiring more officers,"" says Ryou Hyun-cheol, director of foreign affairs planning division at the National Police Agency, in a Korea Times report. ""By early next year, we are planning on launching tourism police in Jeju Island. We will also expand the service to cities such as Busan and Incheon."" This isn't the first time South Korea tourism officials have used Psy's global fame to promote tourism. And who can blame them, really. To date, the official ""Gangnam Style"" music video has had over 1.79 billion views on Youtube.com -- making it the most watched video of all time on the site. In April of this year, Psy was hired to be South Korea's tourism ambassador, a gig that had the star appearing in a series of TV commercials to show off the country. According to the KTO, Psy will hold the honorary position for approximately a year. In the TV commercials, which air in 70 countries, the comedic singer helps showcase things to eat and do and places to visit in South Korea, such as the late-night shopping district of Dongdaemun and ""Cosmetic Road"" in downtown Myeongdong, known for its rows of flashy makeup shops. Psy accepted minimal payment for the gig as officially representing South Korea was meaningful work, he said. Frances Cha also contributed to this report.","Uniforms of Seoul's new tourist police force designed by ""Gangnam Style"" singer Psy's costume designer .

"(CNN) -- Google is preparing to conquer a new dimension: the stratosphere. The Internet giant is releasing 30 high-tech balloons in a trial of technology designed to bring the Internet to places where people are not yet connected. The balloons are being sent up into the sky from New Zealand's South Island this month in the first trial of a pioneering system dubbed Project Loon. According to Google, ""Project Loon is a network of balloons traveling on the edge of space, designed to connect people in rural and remote areas, help fill coverage gaps, and bring people back online after disasters."" Google estimates that two-thirds of the global population is without fast, affordable Internet access. So while it sounds like something from the realms of science fiction, if successful, the project could make a difference to many people around the world. Read more: Using potatoes for inflight wi-fi test . The testers are from Christchurch and parts of Canterbury, New Zealand, and the test balloons will fly around the 40th parallel south, Google says. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key was in Christchurch on Saturday to help unveil the project, according to local media reports. Residents have also been invited to a special event at the local air force museum Sunday to find out more. Images of a test balloon launch on Google+ show one floating, eerie and translucent, above snow-capped mountains. Once released, the balloons will float in the stratosphere above 60,000 feet (18,300 meters), twice as high as airplanes and the weather, Google says. Their altitude will be controlled from ""Loon Mission Control"" using special software to allow them to pick up layers of wind traveling in the right direction and form a balloon network. If all goes to plan, about 60 people who've had a special antenna fixed on their homes for the trial should be able to connect to the balloon network. The signal will bounce from balloon to balloon, then to the Internet back on Earth. Hundreds of people will be able to connect to one balloon at a time. Read more: Google unveils touchscreen laptop . The superpressure balloon envelopes, made from sheets of polyethylene plastic, stand nearly 40 feet tall when fully inflated. They are designed to maintain a constant volume and be longer-lasting than weather balloons. The balloons are equipped with antennas with specialized radio frequency technology, Google says, and each one can provide connectivity to a ground area about 25 miles (40 kilometers) in diameter at speeds comparable to 3G service. They also carry instruments to monitor weather conditions and allow them to be tracked by GPS, powered by solar panels that will store excess energy for nighttime operation. Each has a parachute in case they need to be brought down. It will be very difficult to see the balloons with the naked eye, except during launch, Google says. In any case, it may be a while before would-be Internet users elsewhere start connecting via balloon. According to the Project Loon website, the technology is still being tested to see if it's viable and what problems would have to be overcome to make it more widely available.","The balloons are designed to bring the Internet to remote places, Google says .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and visiting Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on Monday stressed the importance of strong ties between their countries, despite Brazil's concerns about U.S. economic policies that it says can work against emerging economies. In comments to reporters after a White House meeting, Obama and Rousseff highlighted the areas of cooperation on energy development, education and trade as the two leaders prepare to attend the upcoming Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, beginning Friday. However, they made no mention of less collaborative topics, such as whether each country will purchase new military aircraft from the other, or whether the United States will support Brazil's efforts to gain a seat at the U.N. Security Council. Two-way trade between Brazil and the United States last year totaled around $74 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the balance has gone from a U.S. deficit to a surplus in recent years. Brazil has recently announced a series of measures to boost economic growth and rein in its overvalued currency, including slashing interest rates and levying taxes on short-term currency inflows. At the same time, Brazil complains that low U.S. interest rates amid a sluggish recovery are hurting foreign trade partners. On Monday, Rousseff and her foreign affairs minister both noted the U.S. trade surplus with Brazil, and Rousseff called for better balance in U.S. monetary and fiscal policies to prevent a depreciation of the dollar that harms emerging market trade partners. Expansionist monetary policies, such as holding down interest rates, in isolation of fiscal expansion through increased investments, ""ultimately lead to a depreciation in the value of the currencies of developed countries, thus impairing growth outlooks in emerging countries,"" Rousseff said. Earlier, in comments to U.S. business leaders, Foreign Minister Antonio de Agular Patriota cited increased trade between the countries despite the global economic downturn of recent years, but he also called the Brazilian trade deficit with the United States ""not ideal"" and ""a challenge."" In particular, he said the United States now buys more Brazilian commodities and fewer of his country's manufactured goods, adding, ""this is something we have to look at very seriously, and we will."" In her comments, Rousseff noted that the global economy's ""resumption of growth in the medium-term future certainly involves a substantial resumption of growth in the U.S. economy."" ""We very much welcome the major improvements that have been found in the U.S. economy in the recent past, and I am quite certain that that will very much be the emphasis in the next few months and years ahead under the capable leadership of President Obama,"" she added in what amounted to either an endorsement or prediction of Obama's re-election in November. It is Rousseff's first official visit to Washington as Brazilian president and comes more than a year after Obama went to Brazil, shortly after Rousseff came to power in the South American country. In his own remarks to reporters, Obama emphasized Brazil's rising influence in global affairs as a South American power that has become the world's sixth-largest economy. He cited ""the extraordinary progress that Brazil has made"" to become ""not only a leading voice in the region, but also a leading voice in the world."" In particular, Obama noted Brazil's growing energy development and its growth into a leader in the biofuel industry as well as a major player in oil and gas development. ""The United States is not only a potential large customer to Brazil, but we think that we can cooperate closely on a whole range of energy projects together,"" Obama said at a time when he is under attack from Republicans over rising domestic gas prices. Speaking through a translator, Rousseff agreed that oil and gas development offered ""a tremendous opportunity for further cooperation, both as regards the supply of equipment and provision of services, and also as regards a wider role in our trade relations."" In addition, she welcomed a recent U.S. decision to cut tariffs on Brazilian ethanol, which strengthened the partnership between the nations in biofuel development. Rousseff also touted her country's Science Without Borders program, which seeks to send 100,000 students overseas for science education and training, including 20,000 to the United States. She will travel Tuesday to Boston to speak at two desired destinations of Brazilian science students: Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As part of its desire to raise its international status as a major emerging economy, Brazil is seeking membership on the U.N. Security Council. So far, the U.S. government has expressed support for India to join the Security Council but offered no position on Brazil, and the topic was not mentioned Monday. CNN's Shasta Darlington and Becky Brittain contributed to this report.","NEW: Brazil's president calls for a balanced U.S. economic approach .

"(CNN) -- It was once the place Greeks flocked to when leaving for pastures new. Now, the site of the old Hellinikon Airport in the south of Athens could be set to bring in billions of dollars worth of international investment to the debt-stricken nation. The Greek government hopes the sale of its stake in Hellinikon SA (the operating company established in 2011 to develop the property) to a private investor will help ease its financial difficulties as well as lead to the development of thousands of new homes, leisure facilities and commercial space. Greece is in the process of shedding state-owned assets as dictated by the conditions of its IMF, European Commission and European Central Bank bailout. See also: Regal apartments transform Thai capital . A missing Olympic legacy . The sprawling 64 million square foot plot ceased to operate as city's main airport in 2001 when it was shuttered and replaced by Athens International to the east of the city. When the 2004 Olympics came to Athens, a section of Hellinikon was redeveloped so it could host five of the Games' events. New venues were constructed for baseball, softball, canoeing, kayaking and field hockey. Yet the stadiums and the vast majority of the site have lain dormant ever since, a barren wasteland testament to a lack of legacy planning. Today, weeds grow where sporting champions were once crowned and stray dogs roam where hulking jumbo jets took-off. The Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRDAF) hope a buyer for the site will be announced in the coming weeks after the number of bidders was whittled down to three from an original nine last year. The final bidders are Israeli developer Elbit Cochin Island Ltd, Athens-based Lamda Development SA and British firm London & Regional Properties, HRDAF CEO Ioannis Emiris confirmed to CNN. Each will likely have their own visions for the site but if sale and development proceeds as planned, Hellinikon could quickly become one of Europe's largest construction projects, covering an area roughly twice as big as New York's Central Park. See also: Visit London's insane luxury basements . Emiris also points to reports that estimate the project will create around 35,000 construction jobs alone over the next 10 years and add as much as 1.2% to Greece's GDP between now and 2016. An alternative plan . Some believe there are more effective ways to make Hellinikon productive for both public and private sector in the long term. Urban planner and former CEO of Hellinikon SA, Spiro Pollalis, told CNN that putting all 64 million square foot up for sale in one go is too much for one developer to digest. He suggests spreading the risk and selling to numerous separate investors instead and developing the site in phases. Others, meanwhile, fret about what the larger issue of selling off state assets will do to Greece in the medium to long term. The privatization drive has so far failed to bring in the amounts advocates of the process had previously advertised. See also: Could world's tallest building topple China? Supporters of the reform drive, however, point to deals on state-owned real estate such as those for the Astir hotel, which recently sold for more than originally expected. An Arab-Turkish consortium agreed to pay $660 million to purchase the Greek state's share in the resort. The sum invested represents 200 times the Astir's earnings of just over $3 million last year. According to Petros Christodoulou, one of the bankers who put the Astir sale together, credit for the transaction has to go to the incumbent administration of prime minister, Antonis Samaras. ""The government is making every effort to cut red tape,"" Christodoulou said. ""The prime minister said we used to have red tape for international investors now we have red carpet. I think this (deal) is the first manifestation of this."" Many in Greece feeling the harsh effects of austerity, rising political extremism on the right and left as well as a high unemployment rate (which at 28% is the highest in Europe, according to Eurostat) will disagree with the positivity of this analysis. Whether the Hellinikon sale goes to plan and brings in as much income as expected, however, will help determine whether Greece's long term privatization plans are on track or if claims the country is selling the family jewels for less than their true worth are justified.","Greek state hopes to sell its stake in the site of the old Athens airport to private developers .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five years ago, Chinese college students in Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi'an began gathering to publicly mourn the death of a purged high-level official, Hu Yaobang. A week later, thousands of students marched into Tiananmen Square for Hu's funeral. The demonstrations escalated, culminating in the tragic military crackdown on the students on June 4, 1989 when Chinese troops opened fire on civilians and students. An official death toll has never been announced, but estimates range from several hundred to thousands. In the lead-up to the 25th anniversary of the bloody incident this year, there are mixed signals from the Chinese authorities on their attitude towards the normally taboo subject. After three generations of leadership since the student protests, there are signs of the authorities loosening online censorship of related subjects, although direct mention of ""June 4th"" is still banned. Marking death . Formerly the general secretary of the Communist Party, Hu Yaobang was a close ally of Deng Xiaoping. He worked with Deng to consolidate power and move China toward a more open political system, becoming a symbol of democratic reform. Hu died of complications from a heart attack on April 15, 1989, two years after he was purged by party conservatives for advocating ""bourgeois liberation."" His death sparked a wave of student demonstrations across China that escalated into a hunger strike and the eventual military crackdown at Tiananmen Square. With such a close link to the crackdown -- which the Chinese government has yet to acknowledge or apologise for -- Hu's name was banned from media until 2005 when his protégé, Hu Jintao, came into power and rehabilitated his mentor's name. Last week, retired president Hu Jintao paid his respects at the late Hu's former residence in Jiangxi. Online reports and images of the visit were taken down by Chinese censors. By Tuesday, the official anniversary of Hu's death, his former residence in Beijing was sealed and guarded by police, according to Hong Kong media. The home is normally open to public on the anniversary. Hu's son, Hu Dehua, also visited his father's cemetery yesterday in Jiangxi Province. He told the media that had gathered at the gravesite that he was bewildered by the lack of official contrition for the Tiananmen Square incident. ""What crime did the students commit?"" he asked. He further pointed out the contrast in the way authorities have handled the possible deaths of the Malaysian Airlines passengers against those of the students in 1989, calling it a double standard. Still touchy . Despite all this, Chinese censors loosened their grip that same day. Hu Yaobang's name could be freely searched and online commemorations began to flood microblogging sites. Chinese news sites also published commemorative features on the ousted leader, including photos of Hu with his most famous protégés Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao. The Beijing News gathered sentimental quotes from past essays on the late leader, written by other high-ranking officials. One by Hu Jintao reads: ""After Comrade Hu passed away, I would visit his home every Spring Festival and gaze with deep affection at his portrait in the living room. His far-reaching vision and determined expression always gave me strength and encouragement."" But censors draw the line at any direct mention of the tragic crackdown. Searches for ""June 4,"" ""Tiananmen Square,"" and ""Zhao Ziyang"" (an official who was seen as sympathetic to the student protestors) yield nothing. And by linking Hu Yaobang's career to any discussion of China's political system, you will get swiftly banned from the Chinese online world. An interview by the South China Morning Post with Hu's outspoken son, criticizing the lack of political reform and press freedom was deleted from the paper's Chinese Weibo account. As the June 4 date draws near, this litmus test of the authorities' tolerance shows Tiananmen Square is no less an issue after 25 years.

"Washington (CNN) -- Gary Johnson and Virgil Goode have no chance of winning the November 6 presidential election, but the two ""third-party"" candidates could have an impact on who does. Together, Johnson of the Libertarian Party and Goode of the Constitution Party are in position to siphon a few thousand votes from Republican Mitt Romney and perhaps President Barack Obama in some of the handful of battleground states considered up for grabs and therefore decisive in determining the winner. Goode, a former Democrat-turned-Republican congressman from Virginia known for an anti-immigration stance and other strongly conservative policies, routinely won well over 120,000 votes in his home district in elections from 1996 to 2008. If he gets only 10% of that support this time, it could be enough to swing what is currently considered a dead-even race for Virginia's 13 electoral votes to Obama. Gary Johnson: An uphill battle to catch a wave, win the presidency . ""Virgil Goode is a wild card, particularly in Virginia,"" said Stuart Rothenberg of the Rothenberg Political Report, adding ""he could be a factor even if he wins only a handful of votes."" A similar scenario involves Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, in other states considered too close to call like Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire, said Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University. All three states, with a combined 19 electoral votes, are known for independent-minded voters, she noted, enough of whom might be inclined to back a Libertarian instead of Romney. In Nevada, a CNN/ORC International poll last month showed Goode winning 4% support and Johnson 3%, with Obama holding a 47%-44% lead over Romney in the state. Based on 2008 turnout in Nevada, the support for Goode and Johnson would amount to about 67,000 votes. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus downplayed the impact of third-party candidates earlier this month, telling CNN that Johnson's candidacy was ""almost a non-factor."" Could Obama's struggles with white voters cost him the election? Voters ""are not going to throw their vote away when we have an election here that's about the future of America,"" Priebus said. ""I don't see that happening."" CNN polling shows that support for Obama and Romney changes little when third party candidates are factored into state races, said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""In all states CNN has polled so far, the minor party candidates are getting no more than 4% of the vote, and usually closer to 1%-2%,"" Holland said, noting that including them doesn't change the margin between Obama and Romney. ""Statistically speaking, it's difficult to make the case that the minor party candidates are affecting the race."" The influence of third party challengers has dropped dramatically since Texas billionaire Ross Perot won almost 19% of the vote in 1992, drawing conservative ire for harming incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush's re-election chances against Democrat Bill Clinton. Eight years later, consumer activist and Green Party candidate Ralph Nader got 2.8 million votes, including more than 94,000 in Florida that ensured Democratic Vice President Al Gore's loss to Republican George W. Bush in the state by 537 votes. Despite plummeting votes for third party candidates in recent elections, the tight race this year between Obama and Romney makes even fractional support for others potentially decisive in a key state, and therefore the election. Who's up? Check out: CNN Polling Center . ""If the race is close enough, 100 votes can matter,"" said Scott Rasmussen, president of the polling company Rasmussen Reports. The fierce competition of this year's race means fewer undecided voters and fewer people choosing a third-party option, he noted, adding: ""It's not a Ross Perot year."" Goode rejects any insinuation that he seeks to play a spoiler role, saying his policies would be better for the country than those of Obama or Romney. If he managed to win, ""it would shake up Washington in that an average citizen would be president instead of someone that is backed by super-PACs,"" he recently told CNN. Johnson depicts himself as more liberal than Obama on social issues and more conservative than Romney on fiscal issues. He says same-sex marriage is a constitutional issue and should be legal, supports legalizing marijuana usage, and also says he would abolish the Internal Revenue Service. To Schiller, Johnson represents a possible threat that should worry the Romney campaign. ""I think you can argue that Gary Johnson will siphon off Romney votes,"" she told CNN, arguing that hardcore conservatives who consider the former Massachusetts governor to be too moderate could opt for the Libertarian. Do the math: CNN Electoral Map . ""If Colorado gets closer, I think it will matter if Johnson's in the race,"" Schiller said, noting that ""1,000 or 2,000 votes from Romney -- it makes a difference."" To counter that dynamic, Romney's campaign must make the argument that a vote for Johnson is the same as voting for Obama, according to Schiller. ""Any time you have a third party in a very tight race and that third party candidate seems a lot more like Romney than he does Obama, then if you're Romney, you have to discredit that candidate,"" she said. However, Johnson's campaign told CNN in September that some of the candidate's support came from former Obama supporters in Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada. By running as the Libertarian Party candidate, Johnson hoped to gain the support of the relatively small but fiercely loyal following of Ron Paul, the Texas congressman who has failed in three bids to win the Republican presidential nomination. So far, the polling suggests little progress by Johnson in winning over Paul's supporters. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey earlier this month in Virginia showed 1% of likely voters -- about 38,000 based on the 2008 turnout in the state -- supported an unspecified candidate other than Obama or Romney. The bulk of that support appeared to be from strongly liberal or moderate younger voters, a demographic closer to Obama's base. Obama could get hurt by two other minor party candidates -- Jill Stein of the Green Party and Rocky Anderson of the Justice Party -- but both are considered far less likely to get enough support to undermine the president. A CNN/ORC national poll at the end of September showed Stein with 3% compared to 4% for Johnson, while Goode and Anderson had negligible support. However, Stein failed to register in CNN/ORC polls in recent weeks in Florida and Nevada, and she got 1% support in Ohio compared to 3% for Johnson. According to Schiller, possible voter apathy by liberals disappointed with Obama's first term helped motivate the president's campaign to mount a huge effort to boost turnout both in early voting and on Election Day. ""I think they understood they had to get the people who would definitely vote for Obama to the polls, period, with no wavering and no indecision,"" she said. CNN's Holland warned against assuming supporters of third party candidates changed their mind from a major party contender. ""Minor party supporters usually fall into that category because they don't like the two major party candidates,"" he said. ""So in a hypothetical world in which the race were only between the two major party candidates, a lot of minor party voters would have just stayed at home."" The other candidates, the other debate . CNN's Dan Merica and Lisa Sylvester contributed to this report.","Third-party candidates could impact close races in swing states .

"(CNN) -- Critics who have compared President Barack Obama's stance on government surveillance to that of hawkish former Vice President Dick Cheney are missing his insistence on proper systematic balances, Obama said in an interview that aired Monday. Defending at length the recently revealed government programs that gather information about phone calls and Internet usage, Obama said his focus has always been on allowing information to be gathered while ensuring necessary oversight. ""Some people say, 'Well, you know, Obama was this raving liberal before. Now he's, you know, Dick Cheney.'"" Obama told PBS' Charlie Rose. ""Dick Cheney sometimes says, 'Yeah, you know? He took it all lock, stock, and barrel.' My concern has always been not that we shouldn't do intelligence gathering to prevent terrorism, but rather are we setting up a system of checks and balances?"" Cheney defends NSA, calls Obama's credibility 'nonexistent' Obama's administration has faced a litany of questions since the disclosure of government programs that allow the National Security Agency to collect millions of records from U.S. telecommunications firms and Internet companies in the name of preventing terrorism. The source of the information, former CIA employee Edward Snowden, said he was moved to leak the top-secret documents because he felt the government was far overreaching its constitutional bounds in collecting the data. But Obama argued in the interview on Monday that the system in place includes steps to prevent Americans' rights against unlawful search and seizure from being violated. ""What I can say unequivocally is that if you are a U.S. person, the NSA cannot listen to your telephone calls, and the NSA cannot target your e-mails,"" Obama said. Snowden claims online Obama expanded 'abusive' security . ""On this telephone program, you've got a federal court with independent federal judges overseeing the entire program,"" the president continued. ""And you've got Congress overseeing the program, not just the intelligence committee and not just the judiciary committee, but all of Congress had available to it before the last reauthorization exactly how this program works."" Some members of Congress, including Senate Intelligence Committee members Jay Rockefeller and Susan Collins, have questioned the notion they were given proper briefings on the NSA's program, however, and many lawmakers have said they first learned of the programs when they were revealed in news reports two weeks ago. CNN poll: Obama numbers plunge into generation gap . Asked in the interview whether the NSA's process should be more open, Obama said, ""It is transparent. That's why we set up the FISA court."" That body, however, operates in secret, and its locations are considered classified. It has approved the vast majority of the requests it has received for warrants, though those orders are also kept secret. An administration official said Monday that Obama had asked his intelligence chief James Clapper to determine whether additional information about the data collection programs can be made public, part of what the official described as a ""broader effort the president is undertaking to have a dialogue on protecting privacy in the digital age."" The swirling debate is grist for a ""national conversation"" about privacy and national security, Obama said. ""Not only about these two programs, but also the general problem of data, big data sets, because this is not going to be restricted to government entities,"" he said. Opinion: Behind the slide in Obama's poll numbers .","Obama says his stand on surveillance is not the same as Dick Cheney's .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this week, New York police arrested four people suspected of selling heroin to actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who later died from a heroin overdose. But the police haven't yet connected them to the drugs that killed Hoffman. Assuming law enforcement does -- and they might because the actor's telephone number was found on the cell phone belonging to one of the suspects -- can those suspects be held responsible for Hoffman's death? The simple answer is no. But that doesn't mean whoever sold heroin to Hoffman would be exempt from a heap of trouble. In New York, homicide is defined as ""conduct which causes the death of a person."" But not all homicides are the same. Homicide is defined in several ""grades,"" ranging from criminally negligent homicide to manslaughter to actual murder. All share one basic requirement: intent to cause death or, at least, death arising from grossly negligent or reckless conduct. In layman's terms, that means you either have to mean to kill someone, or know there's a risk of death and don't care about it. By all accounts, the people who police believe sold heroin to Hoffman were ordinary drug dealers plying their illicit trade. They may not have cared who they sold to. They may not have cared that Hoffman had a history of drug and alcohol problems. And they may not have cared that they were feeding demons that had taken hold of Hoffman. But it's also unlikely that those alleged dealers intended or believed that anyone, including Hoffman, would die using their product. Prosecutors also generally don't hold drug peddlers responsible for the consequences of their dealing, so it's unlikely that lawyers from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office believed the dealers did. The people who police accuse of selling heroin to Hoffman could not even be charged with felony murder -- that is, a death happening during the course of committing another offense -- because New York's felony murder law only applies to robbery, burglary, rape and similar violent crimes. Still, those suspects could face serious legal problems. Police found 350 glassine bags of heroin at the time of their arrest, which, if found to belong to the suspects, strongly suggests they intended to sell them. After all, that amount of smack is a lot for personal use. So, at the very least, a seller who supplied heroin to someone who overdosed could be charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree because he or she ""knowingly and unlawfully"" possessed heroin ""with intent to sell it."" That crime is punishable by up to 8â…“ to 25 years. If police link them to the heroin that killed Hoffman, they also could be charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree because they ""knowingly and unlawfully"" sold heroin. That crime also is punishable by up to 8â…“ to 25 years. These penalties are, of course, the maximum sentences that could be imposed. If convicted of those crimes, though, those alleged dealers will surely spend time behind bars. Both statutes also carry mandatory minimum sentences of one to three years. The police in New York have already made examples out of the dealers suspected of selling heroin to Hoffman. They spent enormous resources to quickly hunt them down. For better or worse, it's doubtful that that level of effort was expended for anyone else who died of a drug overdose in New York in the past several years. And there were plenty of them -- 541 in 2010, 630 in 2011 and 730 in 2012. Now it's up to the prosecutors in New York. If they, too, want to make examples of suspected dealers, ample tools exist to put them behind bars for a very long time. It's just that they won't be locked up on homicide charges. Legally speaking, it was Philip Seymour Hoffman who was responsible for his own death, even if drug dealers sold him the means to that end. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: If suspects sold heroin to Hoffman, can they be held for his death? Not likely .
Writers: ""Homicide"" means you meant to kill, or know there's a risk of death and don't care .
In Hoffman's case, police spent huge resources to hunt down the suspects, they say .

"(CNN) -- For the second time in five months, Timbuktu's treasured collection of ancient manuscripts is under threat. Earlier this year, it was thought that most of the 300,000 precious documents were destroyed by Islamic fundamentalists when the northern Mali conflict entered the fabled city. But as it turns out, only 4,000 documents were burned by the rebels. The rest were smuggled out of Timbuktu six months before the incursion by a team of local families who have long safeguarded their city's famous library, often in their own homes. The evacuation of the Timbuktu manuscripts was led by local librarian Abdel Kader Haidra and U.S. based book preservation expert Stephanie Diakité, who recruited local citizens and couriers to help them move more than 1,000 trunks of manuscripts by donkey cart, bicycle and boats to a safe house in the south of Mali. Despite the dangers of the mission, both to the treasured texts and those involved in the evacuation, the vast majority of the manuscripts were saved, only to face a new threat. NEW: New fears for Timbuktu in Mali conflict . The climate in the south of Mali is more humid than in Timbuktu and the fragile rag paper texts are now showing signs of mildew and rot. ""It would be the ultimate irony if all of these had survived the evacuation but had been destroyed because we don't have the resources to archival box them and insert humidity traps for the period they are in exile,"" said Diakité, who has now started a campaign to raise the estimated $7 million it will cost to rescue the manuscripts. The threat has been compounded, she said, by the pending rainy season in Mali which usually begins in the middle of June. Bamako, where the manuscripts are being held, has some of the country's heaviest rain. Diakité is now calling on the global community to join the fight to save what she describes as an irreplaceable collection which includes works of poetry, fiction, commerce, medical theory and religious thought. ""Our ultimate goal is to return them to their home in Timbuktu,"" said Diakité. But that won't happen, she said, unless the manuscripts can be protected now.","Most of 300,000 ancient documents smuggled away from Islamists in Timbuktu .

"(CNN) -- Police in Nigeria's capital Tuesday made a U-turn, saying a ban on protests in support of the more than 200 girls kidnapped in April does not exist. The ban was issued one day earlier by Commissioner Joseph Mbu. ""The Police High Command wishes to inform the general public that the Force has not issued any order banning peaceful assemblies/protests anywhere in Nigeria,"" his office said in a statement. ""It notes however that against the backdrop of current security challenges in the country, coupled with a recent intelligence report of a likely infiltration and hijack of otherwise innocuous and peaceful protests by some criminal elements having links with insurgents, the Police only issued advisory notice, enjoining citizens to apply caution in the said rallies, particularly in the Federal Capital Territory and its environs,"" the statement read. On Monday, the commissioner said the proliferation of such protests was ""posing a serious security threat"" in the capital city of Abuja. ""Information reaching us is that too soon dangerous elements will join the groups under the guise of protest and detonate explosive(s) aimed at embarrassing the government. Accordingly protests on the Chibok Girls is hereby banned with immediate effect,"" his office said in its original statement. More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in northern Nigeria in April by Boko Haram, an act that drew international condemnation. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. Nigerians and others have accused their government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls seized in the dead of night. Authorities' apparent change of heart came after an outcry on the part of protesters. One group, #BringBackOurGirls, threatened legal action. ""Our Movement is legitimate and lawful and cannot be arrested by the police whose responsibility is to enforce, not betray the law,"" it said in a statement. An adviser to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan sought to explain the apparent contradiction. ""This present administration has never, ever tried to violate anybody's rights. We believe in human rights, we believe in citizens' rights,"" Doyin Okupe told CNN's Isha Sesay. ""The police command has come to further clear the statement."" ""The ban that the commissioner of police in Abuja proclaimed is like asking people, look, before you go on a protest, you have to come to the police, to come and clear with the police and let us work together to ensure that nobody's life is in danger,"" he said. Boko Haram translates as ""Western education is a sin"" in the Hausa language. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The military actually knows where the girls are, ""but as you will understand, you just cannot storm a place like that,"" Okupe said. He added: ""I believe that by God's grace, we are very near the end of this whole unfortunate saga.""

"(CNN)  -- Britney Spears, Paris Hilton ... Sen. Barack Obama? The latest ad from John McCain implies Barack Obama is a megacelebrity -- like Britney Spears. A new campaign ad from Sen. John McCain -- which flashes shots of the two aforementioned megacelebrities -- calls Obama a megacelebrity, too, and questions his leadership ability. ""He's the biggest celebrity in the world. But is he ready to lead? With gas prices soaring, Barack Obama says no to offshore drilling and says he'll raise taxes on electricity. Higher taxes, more foreign oil -- that's the real Obama,"" the ad's narrator says while crowds screaming, ""Obama!"" are shown. Responding to the ad, Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor said, ""On a day when major news organizations across the country are taking Sen. McCain to task for a steady stream of false, negative attacks, his campaign has launched yet another. Or, as some might say, 'Oops! He did it again.' "" The ad is the latest in a string of hard-hitting television commercials from the McCain campaign. Earlier spots suggest Obama is playing politics with the Iraq war, is against funding American troops and bears some of the responsibility for high gas prices. The campaign says the ad will run in 11 battleground states: Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.  Watch the ad » . In a conference call with reporters announcing the ad, McCain adviser Rick Davis said of Obama's campaign coverage: ""The focus on media, on events and activities, is much more something you'd expect from someone releasing a new movie."" ""What we decided to do was find the top three international celebrities in the world,"" he said. ""And I would say that from our estimation, Britney and Paris came in second and third. So from our perspective, we have the biggest three celebrities in the world."" Davis also brushed aside suggestions the ad will be viewed by the American public as going negative. ""Will people think of this as negative advertising? Look, it's the most entertaining thing I've seen on TV in a while. I wouldn't anticipate anything about this being negative,"" he said. Steve Schmidt, another top McCain adviser, also said it was accurate to compare Obama to the two celebrities who, as one reporter said on the call, are often portrayed as ""frivolous and irresponsible."" ""I don't poll Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, but I know they're international celebrities, so apples to apples,"" he said. A McCain adviser also told CNN's Dana Bash the ad targets Obama's ""outrageous, narcissistic statements."" ""It has not gone unnoticed by this campaign that Obama makes outrageous, narcissistic statements suggesting that his candidacy is what the world has been waiting for. Excuse me?"" the adviser said. ""What's going to happen when he parts the sea? What about all the fish in the middle?"" the adviser said. While Obama was overseas last week on his tour through the Middle East and Europe, the McCain campaign sarcastically addressed the Illinois senator's media coverage. In an e-mail to supporters last week, the McCain campaign said, ""It's pretty obvious that the media has a bizarre fascination with Barack Obama. Some may even say it's a love affair."" The campaign compiled clips of reporters praising Obama and made two videos set to music -- one with ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" and the other to ""My Eyes Adored You."" The campaign also gave reporters covering McCain in Pennsylvania a fake European press pass. The pass featured a shot of the Statue of Liberty in front of an American flag, and the words: ""McCain Press Corps/JV Squad/Left Behind To Report in America."" The back had a picture of a man sporting a beret and a neck scarf, standing in front of a silhouette of the Eiffel Tower and pouring a glass of wine.","New ad from John McCain calls Barack Obama ""biggest celebrity in the world""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Chinese authorities ordered beefed-up safety measures at the nation's ports after a pipeline explosion spewed crude oil into the Yellow Sea, state media reported Friday. Ports will be required to perform checks and remove safety hazards ahead of loading, unloading or transporting oil and other hazardous chemical products, the transport ministry said in a notice on its website, according to the Xinhua news agency. China's major ports have been ordered to complete safety evaluations by the end of the year. A state investigation has found that improper desulfurizer injections caused the oil pipeline explosion in the northeastern port city of Dalian, Xinhua said. Two pipelines exploded July 16 at Dalian Xingang Port, causing China's biggest oil spill in recent history. Workers have been scrambling to prevent the 430-square-kilometer oil slick from further spreading into the ocean. The blast occurred as workers were injecting desulfurizer into the pipeline after a 300,000-ton Libyan tanker had finished unloading its oil, a state investigation found, said Xinhua. The desulfurizer, used to remove impurities from crude, was strongly oxidizing, the investigation found. The incident is still under investigation. The accident dumped 1,500 tons of crude and caused an oil slick on the Yellow Sea that has stretched to about 430 square kilometers (165 square miles), officials have said. That is still a fraction of the 2,700 square miles of the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico. About 800 boats equipped with oil absorbers and dispersants have been dispatched. And crews are dumping 30 tons of oil-eating bacteria daily. Ship traffic at Dalian, China's second-largest port for crude oil imports, was limited to avoid interference with the cleanup efforts, Xinhua has reported. And fishing, a major industry in the area, has been banned until the end of the summer. Beijing was optimistic that the cleanup would be complete by Friday but analysts argue it may take months. CNN's Emily Chang contributed to this report.","An injection of desulfurizer is blamed for the explosion .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. drone strike killed eight militants in southern Yemen on Thursday morning, the latest hit in an intensified U.S. air camaign against al Qaeda and its affiliates in the area, security officials said. The attack targeted a convoy carrying senior leaders of the Ansar al-Sharia militant network, an offshoot of al Qaeda, in the Jaar district of Abyan province. The drone strike was followed by a string of air strikes by Yemen's air force, three security officials said. Bill Roggio, an analyst on terror and military issues, said 15 U.S. airstrikes this year have targeted al Qaeda entities. Ansar al-Sharia is the political front for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He said the bulk of the 32 U.S. airstrikes in Yemen since 2002 have occurred in 2011 and this year. Suspected al-Qaeda militants seized Abyan last year during Yemen's political stalemate after government troops evacuated most military posts in the province. Clashes between government troops and militants also were reported by the security officials Thursday morning in the Abyan districts of Zinjibar, al-Kod and Dofas. The clashes resulted in the death of three troops in Zinjibar and the injury of six others, local security officials confirmed to CNN. The developments come less than a week after a senior operative of AQAP was killed by a CIA drone strike and less than three weeks after a terror plot to bring down a U.S.-bound jetliner was foiled. Fahd al Quso, 37, was killed while riding in a vehicle in the Rafdh district in Shabwa province on Sunday, according to the officials. Al Quso was indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in 2003 on 50 counts of terrorism offenses for his role in the October 12, 2000, bombing of the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen. The bombing killed 17 U.S. sailors. The FBI had offered a $5 million reward for any information leading to the capture of al Quso, who was among the most-wanted terrorists in Yemen. He had been at-large since escaping in April 2003 with eight others from a Yemeni prison, where they had been held on suspicion of involvement in the Cole bombing. The terror plot revealed this week has been described by U.S. officials as involving a device that is an evolution of the bomb smuggled aboard a U.S.-bound plane on Christmas Day 2009 by a young Nigerian, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab. Three months before his death, al Quso foreshadowed the thwarted attack. ""The war didn't end between us and our enemies,"" al Quso told a local journalist. ""Wait for what is coming."" Another high-profile hit occurred in September, when a U.S. drone strike killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American radical cleric and leading figure in AQAP. Roggio -- managing editor of Long War Journal, a blog providing reporting and analysis on the war on terror -- said 32 drone and conventional airstrikes have been used over the decade. All of the strikes this year and four of 10 last year were drone airstrikes. The airstrike program has had its limitations, Roggio said. He compared it to U.S. operations in Pakistan. ""It's effective at picking off leaders, but it's not going to stop AQAP from occupying territory,"" he said. Roggio said that militants still control territory in northwestern Pakistan despite the intensification of U.S. drone strikes there since 2008. Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Yemen. CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta.","NEW: The bulk of airstrikes in Yemen occurred in the past two years, analyst said .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A simmering dispute over islands in the East China Sea began to bite into trade between China and Japan on Tuesday as Chinese protests prompted Japanese companies to suspend work there. The latest demonstrations included a protest by hundreds of Chinese outside the Japanese Embassy in Beijing on the 81st anniversary of an incident that led to the Japanese invasion of China in 1931. Flanked by a heavy police presence, the Chinese demonstrators marching past the embassy were vocal but orderly, shouting that the disputed islands belong to China. Rowdy demonstrations also took place near Japanese consulates in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenyang, according to CNN affiliate I-Cable. The protests appeared to be much more orderly than those that took place in many cities over the weekend, some of which turned violent. But they spurred some of Japan's biggest manufacturers -- Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mazda, Panasonic and Canon -- to halt production at some of their plants in China. Panasonic reported Monday that it would stop work at three Chinese plants after two of them were damaged during Saturday's protests. Fallout widens from island dispute between China, Japan . China normally clamps down on public demonstrations, but has allowed the protests to go ahead. Protesters carried banners that read ""Don't Forget the National Humiliation,"" according to photographs distributed by the state-run news agency Xinhua. Meanwhile, on the disputed islands, two Japanese men carried out a small-scale protest of their own Tuesday when they jumped from a fishing boat and swam to shore, spending a short amount of time on land, the Japanese Coast Guard reported. China and Japan are the world's second- and third-largest economies, and trade between the two Asian powerhouses amounted to about $300 billion in 2010, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. But political ties between Tokyo and Beijing have been strained over a cluster of islands that both countries claim, known as the Senkaku to the Japanese and the Diaoyu to the Chinese. They sit between Okinawa and Taiwan and have been under Japanese control for more than a century, but China claims they have been a part of its territory ""since ancient times."" China reasserted that claim last week, sending ships to patrol the area after the Japanese government announced it would buy several of the islands from a Japanese family. That move revived an issue left unsettled by a peace treaty between China and Japan in the 1970s, Tung Chee Hwa, the administrator who led Hong Kong after China regained possession of the onetime British colony in 1997, told CNN's ""Amanpour."" When that treaty was hammered out, ""There was one item on which they could not agree, so they agreed to disagree,"" Tung said. ""They shelved that argument but agreed there would be status quo, and there would be a joint effort to search for natural resources."" But Japan's decision ""really inflamed public opinion in China,"" he said. Background: How remote rock split China, Japan . The waters around the islands are a common fishing ground for Chinese trawlers, with more than 1,000 of them working in the area every year, China says. And the ocean floor may hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as well abundant natural gas reserves that the Chinese are already seeking to tap. China needs fuel to supply its rapid industrialization -- but Japan, which is almost entirely dependent on imports of oil and gas, is concerned it'll be cut off from those resources. China termed the deal ""illegal"" and sent six surveillance vessels into Japanese territorial waters on Friday, drawing protests from the Japanese government. A total of 11 Chinese government ships were near the islands on Tuesday afternoon, the Japanese Coast Guard said, adding that it had warned the vessels not to enter Japanese territorial waters. The dispute dates back to 1895, when Japan captured the islands at the end of that year's Sino-Japanese War. In 1932, it sold the islands to descendants of the original settlers. Then the United States occupied them from the end of World War II until 1972, when it signed a treaty returning them to Japan. ""The U.S. handed over the islands to Japan for its own purpose during the Cold War,"" Guo Xiangjiang, the deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies, told CNN. ""So, personally, I think the U.S. should take the blame for the dispute of Diaoyu island."" Washington is Japan's leading military ally and China's leading trade partner, and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has called on both sides to resolve the dispute peacefully during a visit to the region this week. ""It's in no country's interest for this situation to escalate into conflict that would undermine peace and stability in this very important region,"" Panetta said after his meeting with Gen. Liang Guanglie, the Chinese defense minister. For his part, Liang reiterated that the islands are part of ""China's inherent territory."" ""We reserve the right to take further actions, but we hope the issue will be properly resolved through peaceful ways and negotiations,"" he said, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Asia's disputed islands -- who claims what? A public initiative begun in April this year by the outspoken governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, to raise money to acquire the islands for the city authorities set off a new cycle of tensions that included civilian protesters from both sides landing on the islands to stake their nations' claims. Ishihara's move put pressure on the government of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to step in with its own bid, which resulted in the controversial deal last week with the Kurihara family, the private owners up until that point. Japan's attempts to portray the purchase as a routine internal real-estate transaction, with the islands passing from one Japanese owner to another, has failed to placate the Chinese authorities. Messages and photos posted on Chinese social media sites showed angry mobs in numerous cities ransacking Japanese stores and restaurants as well as smashing and burning cars of Japanese make. The authorities rarely permit protests in China, prompting suspicion that the nationwide rallies over the weekend were government-sanctioned. In Beijing, police walking alongside the demonstrators were seen to ask spectators to join in instead of blocking the street. But by Saturday night, China's state-run media had started appealing for restraint, running commentaries that condemned violence and lectured the public on the expression of patriotism. CNN's Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- AshleyMadison.com, the dating website for people seeking affairs with married individuals which claims 20 million members worldwide, has dropped another pin on its map -- Asia. The company cast out its first line in Japan in June, reeling in under half a million members within three months, said Noel Biderman, company CEO, ""making it our most successful launch ever."" The infidelity website launched in Hong Kong last month -- it's 29th market since starting 11 years ago in Canada -- and now has 80,000 members. That makes Hong Kong the most successful launch rate per capita, showing a ""massive pent up demand,"" Biderman said. While Asian countries are typically seen as more conservative, he says different cultural values do not diminish the demand for infidelity. ""We're just trying to address a universal behavior and pattern, targeting people from all walks of life. Infidelity is in our DNA. I'm just riding a tidal wave, a social change where women lead and men follow,"" Biderman said. ""This is their unfaithful, sexual revolution. Infidelity trumps a lot of it, there's no culturally stopping it, no religious groups can,"" he said. The site is run on a credit based purchase where members have to pay to contact each other. In Hong Kong, the starter package with 100 credits costs HK$360 (US$45) and is enough to initiate chat with 20 women, Biderman said. For women, the service is free. His website doesn't make people cheat, Biderman argues, but rather provides a platform for those who have already made up their minds to step out on their spouse. ""People want to choose what they want to do. Long before I created Ashley Madison, people were unfaithful. I don't think I can convince people to have an affair, but if people are miserable, I feel like society can benefit from my service,"" he said. In Japan where it is legal for men to seek sexual entertainment in brothels and massage parlors, Biderman says the localized website will allow ""miserable women"" to find an outlet with other married men. Out of the 160,000 women on the Japanese site, 68% of the site's traffic are made up of married women, according to Avid Life Media, the parent company of the website. Infidelity is ""clearly a global phenomenon,"" but there are some variations from region to region. ""Many of the Latin American countries -- Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, have lower female adoption rates than in North America and Europe. In France we see a greater percentage of married women over the age of 40 using the service than anywhere else in the world,"" Biderman said. What stands out in Hong Kong is the rate of single men that have signed onto the site, he said. ""Normally as a worldwide average we have about 9 to 11% single men on ashleymadison.com, but in Hong Kong we have about 18%,"" Biderman said. The company plans to expand to ""10 to 11"" more markets in Asia before the end of June 2014, Biderman said. The website is expected to launch in Taiwan next month. Ashley Madison statistics show that 325,000 people in Mainland China have been trying to log onto the site to create a profile even without spending a dime on marketing in China, Biderman said. But countries like China and South Korea raise thorny legal issues for the company. ""We'd love to go to the Chinese government first and do it through the front door...but not if they required us to give out our users' information,"" he said. In South Korea, where adultery is still a crime, the company has consulted with lawyers to ensure that they do not overstep legal boundaries, although Biderman believes this is not an issue. The website operates as a ""communication platform and only that,"" and the company does not get additional economic benefits from offline meetings, he said. ""So from a vicarious liability perspective we have no true issue -- if you start holding inanimate objects responsible for what is ultimately a personal decision then you would have to find Apple or the iPhone, hotel rooms and a whole host of others 'responsible' for an affair,"" he said. The company runs advertisements online and through a number of television networks and radio shows, but not all media companies want to be associated with a business that promotes adultery. Facebook does not accept Ashley Madison ads, and Fox and NBC refused to air the company's commercials during the Super Bowl. Biderman believes infidelity can help save marriages in the long term, and is much less costly than getting a divorce. ""The vast majority of affair seekers are having an affair because they do not want to leave...they cherish their children, their economic situation, extended family,"" he said. ""All that they are hoping to change is the monotonous monogamy within their relationship. By finding that cathartic outlet through an affair it helps them stay within that marriage."" Infidelity is often seen as destructive to marriages and families, but Dr. Sandy To, lecturer at the Department of Sociology at the University of Hong Kong with an expertise in gender, marriage and family said it depends on whether couples agree on the same notion of marriage. ""The normal conception is that marriage should be monogamous, but we have to take into account that some cannot be rationalized within this framework, and some people need to seek emotional and sexual needs outside a marriage of convenience,"" she said. ""But, if couples don't have the same notion and there's an element of deception, then of course it would be rather disastrous and someone will get hurt."" According to To, the website may reflect a shifting culture of a more self-centered and individualized approach where people are less inclined to sacrifice self fulfillment for the marriage and the family. However, she said that the website is harmless to those who believe in fidelity. ""It's just a commercial endeavor, for those who believe in monogamy, if they saw the ad, they would just look at it as a joke or a gimmick,"" To said. Regardless of what the outcome of the marriages are, Biderman has no qualms about making money off infidelity, saying that he, like many others, is doing a service to society. ""The hotel industry probably couldn't survive. Think about jewelry stores where people make duplicated purchases,"" Biderman said. ""I'm monopolizing it directly, but if you define infidelity liberally, pornography, strip clubs and massage parlors are also making money off of it.""","AshleyMadison.com, the dating website for extra marital affairs makes its second launch in Asia .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The federal trial of a former Georgia Tech student accused of supporting terrorism came to a close Thursday with the defendant delivering his own closing argument. The FBI says Syed Haris Ahmed took casing video of the Pentagon and discussed attacks on the United States. Syed Haris Ahmed, charged with providing material support to terrorism in the United States and abroad, used the time to talk about his Muslim faith instead of addressing the evidence against him. ""I just want to convey the message of God,"" Ahmed said. ""Any authority not derived from the authority of God is a state of rebellion,"" he said. ""As a Muslim, it's not right for me to use those laws to my benefit."" Ahmed cited verses and prayers from the Quran and spent a great deal of time comparing his religion with Christianity. ""We worship the same God,"" Ahmed said. Ahmed, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in Pakistan, waived his right to a jury trial so he could make the statement during closing arguments. U.S. District Judge William Duffey will decide his case. ""Mr. Ahmed, this is somewhat different,"" Duffey said at the end of Ahmed's address. ""This is not a case about your faith, nor my faith. This is about your conduct."" The judge told Ahmed he would act according to the laws of the United States in deciding the case by considering the evidence. If convicted, Ahmed, 24, could face 15 years in prison. ""The case is not about throwing bombs and shooting soldiers, but providing support for those activities,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert McBurney said in his closing argument. Prosecutors contend Ahmed and alleged co-conspirator Ehsanul Islam Sadequee traveled from Atlanta to Canada in March 2005, and discussed potential attacks in the United States with three men they met online. Ahmed and Sadequee made ""casing videos"" of landmarks in the Washington area during an April 2005 trip, McBurney said. The short, shaky videos were allegedly e-mailed to other co-conspirators and found on the hard drives of at least two men who were arrested on terrorism charges in the United Kingdom. Prosecutors also said Ahmed traveled to Pakistan in July 2005 with the goal of entering a terrorist training camp. ""The whole point is to get the terrorist before he gets to flight school and figures out how to fly a commercial airliner,"" McBurney said. Before closing arguments, Defense Attorney Jack Martin argued the case should be dismissed. ""The evidence is very, very thin,"" Martin said. During Martin's motion for dismissal, Ahmed stood and made an objection to his attorney's arguments. ""He's giving a closing argument,"" Ahmed said. ""I was told I would give a closing argument."" Martin finished his argument shortly thereafter. The motion for dismissal was denied. Martin wrapped up his case earlier Thursday after calling just two witnesses, Ahmed's older sister and his father. Both testified Ahmed was searching for his Muslim identity. Throughout the trial, Martin has argued that his client is a shy, highly emotional young man. Martin said Ahmed moved to a suburban Atlanta neighborhood with his family when he was 12. He did not have a religious mentor and turned to the Internet to find his identity as a Muslim, Martin said. Martin said there was never any agreement established with co-conspirators, just random thoughts. He said Ahmed's actions were nothing more than ""childish fantasies."" Sadequee is expected to face the same charges in an August trial.","Defendant talks about his Muslim faith, not evidence, in closing argument .

"Washington (CNN) -- Narrow passage of a sweeping health care bill by the House of Representatives portends a continuing difficult fight for President Obama and fellow Democrats to get a bill through the Senate and into law. The House voted 220-215 late Saturday, with 39 Democrats opposed and one Republican in favor, to approve what would be the biggest expansion of health care coverage since Medicare was created more than 40 years ago. The Affordable Health Care for America Act, or H.R. 3962, restricts insurance companies from denying coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition or charging higher premiums based on gender or medical history. It also provides federal subsidies to those who cannot afford it. And it guarantees coverage for 96 percent of Americans, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But turning the bill into law remains uncertain. The Senate must now pass its own version of a health care bill, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada last week signaled uncertainty over whether that will happen this year. Once both chambers have passed a bill, a congressional conference committee will merge the two proposals into a consensus version that would require final approval from each chamber and Obama's signature. On Sunday, Obama praised the ""historic"" House vote to pass the bill and called on the Senate to ""take the baton"" and complete its work. ""For years, we've been told that this couldn't be done,"" Obama said, citing the decades of failed health care reform efforts. ""Last night, the House proved differently."" The president called the support by many House members ""courageous"" in the face of ""the heated and often misleading rhetoric around this legislation."" ""Now it falls on the United States Senate to take the baton and bring this effort to the finish line on behalf of the American people,"" Obama said. ""And I'm absolutely confident that they will."" However, Republicans and an independent senator who sits with the Democratic caucus signaled Sunday that difficulties remain for Obama on his top domestic priority. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut, reiterated that he would join a Republican filibuster against a health care bill if it contains a government-run public health insurance option after the chamber's amendment process. Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Lieberman called the controversial public option, which is in the House bill and the Senate version being prepared by Reid, an unnecessary provision intended to bring government-run health insurance in the future. ""If the public option is in there, as a matter of conscience, I will not allow the bill to come to a final vote,"" Lieberman said. He previously has said he won't oppose opening Senate debate on the bill despite the public option provision, and he maintained that stance Sunday. Lieberman's stance is crucial because the Democratic caucus has the minimum 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster. Senate Republicans unanimously oppose the public option, though Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine has floated the possible compromise idea of a trigger mechanism that would mandate a public option in the future if thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs go unmet. The lone House Republican who supported the bill, Rep. Anh ""Joseph"" Cao, told CNN on Sunday he put the needs of his district over the desire of his party. Cao's ""yes"" vote ended up being unnecessary for House Democrats, but it gave House Speaker Nancy Pelosi license to tout bipartisan support for the controversial measure. ""I felt last night's decision was the proper decision for my district, even though it was not the popular decision for my party,"" said Cao, a first-term representative from Louisiana's traditionally Democratic 2nd District. ""A lot of my constituents are uninsured, a lot of them are poor. It was the right decision for the people of my district."" Cao acknowledged he extracted some White House pledges to help his district deal with the continuing effects of Hurricane Katrina in exchange for his vote. Asked about the reaction of fellow Republicans, Cao said the party's leaders ""respect my decision, and I respect theirs."" Also Sunday, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, the chamber's third-ranking Republican, said on the Fox program that Democrats were ignoring the wishes of the American public by pushing through the huge health care bill. Pence said the health care bill would raise costs, increase the deficit and lead to a government takeover of the health care system. ""I think the American people are deeply frustrated with the liberal establishment in Washington,"" Pence said. ""If Democrats keep ignoring the American people, their party's going to be history."" Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland responded on the same show that the Congressional Budget Office reported that the House bill would reduce the deficit. Van Hollen chided Republicans for failing to confront rising health care costs harming the U.S. economy during the years they controlled the White House and Congress. ""We've had a great system for insurance companies,"" Van Hollen said, citing large industry profits as Americans face what he called unfair practices such as having coverage denied for pre-existing conditions. ""This is a message to the American people; we're trying to bring down your costs to help more Americans afford health insurance."" The House vote less than an hour before midnight Saturday was full of drama. With eight seconds left in the voting period, Democrats began counting down and erupted in roars when Pelosi declared, ""The bill is passed"" and banged the gavel. Republican lawmakers stood silently across the floor, some with their arms folded across their chests. ""Well, it was about what I thought it would be,"" said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio as he quickly exited. Later, he issued a statement saying the $1.2 trillion legislation would add to the country's ""skyrocketing"" debt. ""I came here to renew the American Dream, so my kids and their kids have the same opportunities I had,"" Boehner said. ""I came here to fight big-government monstrosities like this bill that dim the light of freedom and diminish opportunity for future generations."" Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, released an equally tersely worded statement. ""Nancy Pelosi and her liberal lieutenants made a lot of promises today to get the votes they desperately needed,"" he said. ""Make no mistake -- the Democrat leadership's assurances were based on political expediency, not principle. Anyone receiving a promise from Pelosi is guaranteed to be disappointed in the end when their votes are no longer needed."" Earlier in the day, Obama met behind closed doors with Democrats to shore up support for the bill, calling it a chance of a generation. In the run-up to the vote, Republicans and conservative Democrats joined forces to pass an amendment to the bill to prohibit federal funds for abortion services. It was considered a big win for them and for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which used its power -- especially with conservative Democrats in swing congressional districts -- to help force Democratic leaders to permit a vote on the amendment. The prohibition, introduced by Democratic members -- including Rep. Brad Ellsworth of Indiana and Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan -- would exclude cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. The GOP accounted for 174 of the votes in favor of the amendment, with one Republican voting ""present."" On the Democrats' side, 64 voted for the measure, and 194 voted against. CNN's Shirley Hung, Brianna Keilar, Deirdre Walsh, Lisa Desjardins and Elaine Quijano contributed to this report.","House voted 220-215 late Saturday to approve Affordable Health Care for America Act .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The rundown of recommended stories on some popular Chinese social media sites showed nothing extraordinary this week until users looked a little more closely. On the Sohu Weibo platform for example, the characters on the homepage had been arranged to read ""Hang in there, Southern Weekly,"" but only if read vertically, from top down. Another site, 163.com, structured its homepage in a way that the first character of the top six rows of news combined to read ""Go Southern Weekly Go!"" They were referring to the wave of anger this week against alleged government censorship at the Southern Weekly, a newspaper based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. For two days, journalists at the paper and hundreds of their supporters have gathered in front of the Southern Weekly offices holding posters calling for free speech and condemning press censorship. ""This is an attack and suppression of press freedom and the people's right to know the truth. It is not right,"" said one unnamed protester. ""I came over here to say the Southern Weekly is not alone,"" explained another. Some of the mostly young protesters carried flowers as a symbol of grief, while one woman came with a face mask plastered with Chinese characters explaining it was a ""biyantao,"" or a condom to prevent speech. They demanded the resignation of Tuo Zhen, the Communist Party propaganda chief in the southern province of Guangdong, amid claims that an editorial calling for political reform was re-written as a tribute to Communist Party rule. This rare protest poses a test for Xi Jinping, the newly installed Communist Party chief, who is just beginning to define his agenda as the paramount leader governing a massive country in a state of flux. It also represents a serious dilemma for the Communist Party in an era of social media and micro-blogging. It started with a posting on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media site, complaining that the Propaganda Department in southern Guangdong province had rewritten the paper's annual New Year's editorial without the knowledge of the editors. It was originally titled ""China's Dream of Constitutionalism,"" but when it was printed it was revised to read ""Chasing the Dream,"" which echoed the official Communist Party line. The censors also added text that contained factual errors. Soon enough China's social media witnessed a torrent of postings condemning Party censorship and supporting the Southern Weekly. The controversy brings to light the role of propaganda czars who supervise the flow of information in China. To be sure, Chinese media has become more diverse in the past three decades, thanks to China's gradual reforms and opening up. Over the years, the local press has been given a bit more room to report about different topics and to do so differently, especially on non-political issues. But government censorship has never stopped and most media groups are still owned and run by the state. The Propaganda Department regularly issues written or oral directives about what news should or should not be reported and how this should be done. So one can only imagine the frustrations editors and journalists endure when faced with censorship. The Southern Weekly is not new to censorship-related controversy. Over the years, it has shown a liberal leaning. Within the allowed space, it produces stories that are relatively fresh, probing and even daring. ""Some of our essays, exposes and muck-raking stories have tried to push the margin,"" said a former reporter, who requested anonymity. ""We call them 'edge-ball' stories, just like playing table tennis, when you make points not with hard smashes but with slight, subtle hits."" For that, some of its editors and reporters have gotten into trouble with the propaganda czars. For that, too, it has earned respect and attracted a loyal following, especially among the youth, urbanites, and intellectuals. On Friday, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying insisted there was no press censorship in China and the government protects press freedom according to the law. But there are apparent attempts to rein in the media, especially popular micro-blogging services, which are used to expose problems and abuses that may embarrass the government. Meanwhile, search terms related to Southern Weekly are being blocked. Just how big a threat the demonstrations pose to Xi's new regime remains unclear. It is also unclear where Xi stands on the issue of press censorship and free speech. Some analysts wonder whether Xi or the central government supported the actions of Guangdong officials. Some blame the row squarely on Tuo Zhen, the newly appointed provincial propaganda chief. One observer in Guangdong blamed his ""behavior and work style"" for causing the row. But others see the controversy as bigger than just the Guangdong Propaganda Department versus the Southern Weekly. ""It is a publicity crisis for Xi Jinping's new administration,"" said Xiao Qiang, a founder and editor-in-chief of China Digital Times, a U.S.-based site monitoring China's Internet and media issues. ""Its political credibility and ability to lead is now being tested. ""When the top leadership seems not resolute and clear, a smaller event moves into the national public sphere, and the state even just slightly loses control of the message in the media and Internet space."" For the Global Times, however, the message is clear. ""No matter how the Chinese media is regulated, they will never become the same as their Western counterparts,"" the government-backed media group said in an editorial. ""This should be the basic judgment of Chinese media professionals. ""China's political system differs from the West's, and the media cannot separate itself from a country's political reality. The only way that fits the development of Chinese media is one that can suit the country's development path."" According to the China Digital Times, the Central Propaganda Department has issued an urgent directive telling media groups at all levels that: . -- State-run media is an unswerving basic principle . -- The ""mishap"" at Southern Weekly has nothing to do with Guangdong propaganda chief Tuo Zhen . -- The incident's development is due to the ""meddling by hostile forces"" The directive told all editors, reporters and staff to discontinue voicing their support for the Southern Weekly and ordered all media sites to prominently republish the Global Times editorial.","Protesters are angry at alleged government censorship at the Southern Weekly in China .

"(CNN) -- America has its first panda twins in 26 years. The tiny pair were born to mother Lun Lun, a 15-year-old giant panda, at Zoo Atlanta on Monday, the first arriving at 6:21 p.m. and the second at 6:23 p.m. The zoo did not immediately know the gender of the cubs. The twins are the first for Lun Lun, who has two other offspring at Zoo Atlanta, and are the product of artificial insemination. Their father is 15-year-old Yang Yang, also a resident at Zoo Atlanta. ""We're thrilled to welcome Lun Lun's and Yang Yang's twins. This is a success we share with all of our fellow zoological organizations working to understand and protect this iconic species, and we share our joy with our local community and with our colleagues in China,"" Raymond B. King, president and CEO of Zoo Atlanta, said in a statement. The pink-colored twins -- black patches of hair will begin to appear in a week or two -- were separated shortly after birth, with one staying with Lun Lun and the other being cared for in the zoo's nursery. ""Twins are an entirely new scenario for Lun Lun, Zoo Atlanta and our animal care teams, who will no doubt be extremely busy over the next few months,"" King said. The zoo said twins typically weigh less than single-born panda cubs with a high risk of mortality. A single panda cub typically weighs just 3 to 5 ounces at birth, according to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Twins are not unusual for pandas, Zoo Atlanta said in a statement, but in the wild the mother will usually only care for one of them. That is why they were separated, but the zoo said they may rotate them in Lun Lun's care over the next few months. The public can expect to see the panda twins in the late fall, the zoo said. Their father and two brothers, Xi Lan, 4, and Po, 2, will remain on display. Fewer than 2,000 giant pandas remain on the planet, according to the Smithsonian. Of these, 300 are in zoos and breeding centers, mostly in China, and about 1,600 remain in the wild in mountain forests of central China.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is seriously considering withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2014, a senior administration official told CNN. The official's comments came after The New York Times reported the administration was looking at speeding up the troop withdrawal to the ""zero option,"" leaving no U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Until now, U.S. and Afghan officials had been discussing plans to keep a small force behind to fight insurgents and to train Afghan security personnel. But Obama has, in recent months, grown increasingly frustrated in dealing with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Their relationship soured further last month after the United States and the Taliban planned peace talks. In response, Karzai cut off negotiations with the United States on the residual troop presence post-2014. A ""zero option"" has always been among the scenarios the United States envisioned. But the new revelation means that it could be a very possible one now. Pentagon spokesman George Little said Tuesday that Obama has not made a decision on U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan beyond 2014. ""We are continuing discussions"" with Afghanistan about carrying out post-combat missions, Little said. ""We continue to work through issues,"" he said, adding, ""We believe we can work through them."" If the United States pulls out all its troops, it will be a situation similar to that in Iraq. The refusal by the Iraqi government to extend legal protections for U.S. troops after the end of the war in Iraq was a major reason the United States left the country with no residual military training force. Karzai has said he would like for U.S. troops to remain after the end of the NATO mission. But he also has been highly critical of the troops over the years, following incidents in which U.S. forces have killed civilians. CNN's Adam Levine contributed to this report.","NEW: Pentagon spokesman: U.S. believes it can work through issues with Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Dramatic bloodshed Saturday in Iraq left 64 people killed and 190 wounded, two Interior Ministry officials told CNN. A wave of bombings came amid Eid festivities marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It followed a July that was the bloodiest in five years, when violence between Sunnis and Shiites -- both Muslim sects -- spun out of control. In a press release Saturday, the State Department said the attacks ""bear the hallmarks of suicide and vehicle attacks in Iraq over the past ninety days"" and said most of those attacks were committed by al Qaeda in Iraq, which is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ""The United States has offered a $10 million reward for information that helps authorities kill or capture Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,"" the State Department said, referring to a reward that the U.S. embassy in Baghdad says has existed since 2011. ""This reward is second only to information leading to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the chief of Al Qaeda's network, and symbolizes our ongoing commitment to helping our partners in the region eliminate this threat from their territory."" The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks on Sunday. The statement, published on an al Qaeda website, said the attacks were in response to recent security force operations. ""The Islamic State mobilized part of its security effort in Baghdad, the southern states and others to deliver a quick message of deterrence on the third day of Eid al-Fitr to the animals of Rawafdh 'Shiite' and their government,"" the statement said. Saturday's death toll included reports by Baghdad police that at least 22 people were killed and more than 40 others wounded after eight car bombs exploded in Shiite neighborhoods. In Tuz Khurmatou, about 180 kilometers, or 112 miles, north of Baghdad, at least eight people were killed and more than 40 others were wounded when a suicide car bomber exploded on a commercial corridor. Tuz Khurmatou is an ethnically mixed city of Arab, Kurd and Turkmen residents. In Mosul, at least eight people were killed and 12 others were wounded in two separate explosions in the city. Mosul is a largely Sunni city about 400 kilometers, or 248 miles, north of Baghdad. In Nasiriya, a car bomb exploded on a busy road, killing four people and wounding 12. Nasiriya is located in the heavily Shiite region of southern Iraq and is about 400 kilometers outside of Baghdad. In Karbala, about 100 kilometers, or 62 miles, south of Baghdad, a car bomb exploded near a bus station, killing two people and wounding 15 others. Karbala is a Shiite city. The bloodshed appears to mark a new round of violence to hit Iraq in recent months, much of it stemming from decades-old discord between the nation's Sunnis and Shiites, the two largest branches of Islam. Sunnis have felt politically marginalized under a Shiite-led government since the ouster of longtime leader Saddam Hussein in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion. The enmity is further deepened by the fact Saddam's Baathist regime was composed mostly of Sunnis during more than two decades of dictatorship and was violently repressive against Shiites. July was the deadliest month in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. According to figures released by the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, 1,057 Iraqis were killed and another 2,326 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence last month.","NEW: The $10 million reward has been in place since 2011, U.S. Embassy says .

"(CNN) -- As fellow American officials met with allied and Iranian counterparts in Geneva, Switzerland, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday that all sides are closer than they've been in a long time on a nuclear deal. But they stressed it hasn't been reached yet. ""It's important to exhaust the remedies and possibilities of diplomacy,"" Kerry said from Washington. ""We have the best chance we've had in a decade, we believe, to halt progress and roll back Iran's program."" The prospect of an agreement that could roll back some punitive measures against Iran in exchange for measures assuring that the Middle Eastern country isn't developing a nuclear weapon has met significant resistance. Some in Congress have voiced opposition, saying leaders in Tehran cannot be trusted. It's a sentiment echoed by Israel leaders. Kerry insisted the continuing talks represent ""the initial stage of determining whether or not there's a first step that can be taken."" Whether the ultimate result is Iran having access to peaceful nuclear energy is a long ways off; for now, Kerry claimed that a prospective deal wouldn't give that country leeway to move toward developing a nuclear weapon. Iran nuclear talks: 11 things you need to know . ""We will not allow this agreement should it be reached -- and I say, should it be reached -- to buy time or to allow for the acceptance of an agreement that does not properly address our core, fundamental concerns,"" he said. Kerry spoke as negotiators met in Geneva, where the major players engaged in three days of intense talks earlier this month. Those discussions concluded without the agreement some had anticipated, albeit with optimism that it could come soon. ""I think we are all on the same wavelength, and that's important,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said then. ""And that gives us the impetus to go forward."" Like those discussions, the current talks involve delegations from Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France -- plus Germany in what is known as the P5+1. ""The atmosphere is positive,"" one senior U.S. official said, adding that the Western powers expressed condolences for a bombing that happened near the Iranian Embassy in Beirut. ""We are not in a rush,"" the official said. ""We want to get a good deal, the right deal."" Israeli leader: 'This must be a genuine solution' One sticking point has been Iran's insistence on enriching its own uranium for peaceful purposes. The U.S. official said the issue ""can be navigated in an agreement."" U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said the plan would benefit the global community. ""The international community would have unprecedented access to Iran's nuclear facilities and full transparency into what they're doing, so they wouldn't have the ability to sneak out or break out,"" Rice said. But Israel, the United States' closest ally in the region, staunchly opposes the tentative plan. ""It's a bad deal -- an exceedingly bad deal,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN this week. Netanyahu opposes lifting some sanctions now without getting further concessions to ensure Iran would be unable to continue with uranium enrichment and other steps. ""I think you should not only keep up the pressure; I think you should increase the pressure, because it's finally working,"" Netanyahu said, labeling Iran's economy as close to paralysis. ""If you give it up now, when you have that pressure, and Iran doesn't even take apart, dismantle one centrifuge, what leverage will you have when you've eased the pressure?"" At the same time, Netanyahu repeated his insistence that Israel ""always reserves the right to defend itself against any threat,"" which is diplomat-speak for a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities to stop the development of a weapon. Netanyahu elaborated Wednesday during remarks in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He characterized Iran's development of nuclear weapons ""the biggest threat against us and against global security."" Carrying through on U.N. Security Council resolutions like those ""to halt all enrichment, to remove all enriched material (and) to dismantle the centrifuges"" are central to that goal. ""I would like remove any doubts: We want a peaceful, diplomatic solution; everyone prefers this over any other solution,"" Netanyahu added. ""But this must be a genuine solution."" Iran: Some Israeli officials 'are like animals' The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, didn't mince words when he fired back at Israel, his nation's staunch adversary. ""Israeli officials cannot be even called humans. They are like animals, some of them,"" he said Wednesday. The ayatollah also said Iran's ""heroic flexibility"" is not a violation of Iran's values. He coined that term a few months ago to explain that Iran's leadership can be flexible while remaining ""heroic"" in the face of Western powers it still doesn't trust. In remarks Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said his country is looking for an agreement that will benefit both sides. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran is looking for stability and tranquility in the entire region, and success in our negotiations with the Group 5+1 will benefit all the regional countries and the world,"" he said, according to the semiofficial FARS news agency. Tuesday's twin suicide bombing near the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon's capital will not sway the talks, Rouhani said. ""Those who think they can achieve their goals through terror, intimidation and violence have always been in mistake, and they are erring again this time,"" he said. Rifts within the U.S. Some U.S. lawmakers aren't sold on the new plan. On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of six senators urged the administration to reject the proposed deal with Iran and accept only an agreement that better dismantles Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. ""I think all of us are concerned,"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee. ""We know who we are dealing with, and we've watched this same type of activity occur in North Korea, where you began to alleviate sanctions, and I think what the concern is that whatever you do in the interim basis becomes the new norm."" But U.S. President Barack Obama said the current sanctions put in place during his administration had forced Iran to the negotiating table because of economic contraction and frozen oil revenue. He said the proposed deal would ""open up the spigot a little bit"" on some of the frozen revenue while leaving in place the bulk of the most effective sanctions involving Iranian oil exports and banking. But Obama also stressed that all options, including military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, remained on the table as far as the United States was concerned. Vice President Joe Biden, joined by members of his national security team, explained the administration's position Wednesday to 12 Democratic senators. He laid out potential parameters of a six-month deal such as addressing 'Iran's enrichment capabilities, existing stockpiles of uranium, centrifuges and ability to produce plutonium using the Arak reactor"" and allowing for ""intrusive monitoring"" by international inspectors. ""The Vice President reiterated that the President has a responsibility to seek a peaceful resolution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon before pursuing alternatives,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The current P5+1 proposal has the potential to do just that."" Why Israel, Gulf states are wary of Iran nuclear talks . U.S.-Israel rift over Iran nukes now in the open .

"(CNN) -- A widow says she forgives the attackers in Libya who gunned down her husband earlier this month as he went for a morning jog outside his home in Benghazi. Ronnie Smith, 33, was a chemistry teacher from Austin, Texas, who was working for more than a year in the International School Benghazi when four unidentified assailants in a black Jeep fatally shot him December 5. ""I just envision the black Jeep driving up to him and I don't know their faces. I just want them to know that God loves them and can forgive them for this,"" Anita Smith tells CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview. Emotion broke her voice as she spoke. ""I don't know them. That's how I honestly feel. It may sound crazy. It's God's spirit that's putting this inside me,"" she added. Smith said she didn't feel any anger or want any revenge against the killers of her husband. ""I just really want them to know that I do love them and I forgive them, and Ronnie would want this, and I hope and pray that our son, Hosea, would believe this,"" she said. ""Yeah, they took away my husband. I loved my husband. But it's got to be God's spirit that's pushing me to show them that this is what God wants them to see,"" she said. Smith also wrote an open letter to the Libyan people. She and her husband traveled to Libya ""because we saw the suffering of the Libyan people, but we also saw your hope, and we wanted to partner with you to build a better future,"" she wrote. To the attackers, she wrote: ""I love you and I forgive you."" To the Libyan people, she said, ""We came to bless you, but you have blessed us much more. Thank you."" Benghazi was the cradle of Libya's 2011 revolution that ousted leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime but since then, the new government is struggling to control armed groups in the country. Libya's second-largest city, Benghazi also is where militants attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission in September 2012, killing four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. The United States blames the Islamist militant group Ansar al-Sharia for the attack. ""I hear people speaking with hate, anger and blame over Ronnie's death, but that's not what Ronnie would want,"" Smith wrote of her husband. ""I want all of you -- all of the people of Libya -- to know I am praying for the peace and prosperity of Libya.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Reports conflicted Wednesday over whether the 84-year-old former president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, was clinically dead. The state-run Middle East News Agency, citing medical sources, said he was declared clinically dead shortly after arriving late Tuesday at a military hospital in Cairo, where he had been taken after suffering a stroke and cardiac arrest earlier in the day. But Gen. Mamdouh Shaheen, a member of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, told CNN, ""He is not clinically dead as reported, but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition."" Fast facts on the life of Hosni Mubarak . Mubarak was taken by helicopter to the military hospital in the Maadi suburb of Cairo, Shaheen said. ""He had a heart attack and his heart stopped and he was saved by electric shocks, then placed on respirator,"" he said. ""His pulse is 40. He then got a brain clot. He is NOT clinically dead as reported but his health is deteriorating and he is in critical condition."" And Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed El Deeb, told CNN, ""He has been in a coma for hours now. He has had water on the lungs for 10 days now and his blood pressure is down today, which obstructed his breathing and forced doctors to put him on a respirator. He was given medicine intravenously to relieve the brain clot, and electric shocks were used to revive him but there was no substantial response. He is not dead as reported."" El Deeb added that Mubarak's wife, Suzanne, was at his side. He blamed SCAF for not having moved Mubarak last week from the prison to the hospital. Adel Saeed, the official spokesman of the Egyptian prosecutor, had said earlier, ""We were informed by prison authority that Mubarak's heart has stopped and they used electric shocks and CPR to resurrect him. He is now on an artificial respirator and doctors from the armed forces and International Medical Center will inspect him."" Nile TV reported that Mubarak had suffered a stroke. He was taken from Tora prison hospital to Maadi military hospital, El Deeb told CNN. ""He has suffered a stroke, but he is not dead."" The prosecutor and the military council denied Mubarak had been moved. His health had been reported in decline since he was ousted as president of Egypt in February 2011 and found guilty of charges related to the killings of hundreds of anti-government demonstrators during the revolution. Last week, an Interior Ministry spokesman said he was comatose; the spokesman said he suffered from high blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and difficulty breathing. ""We should be skeptical,"" said Fouad Ajami, a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. ""There's a great Arab expression I like and it asks the following question: When you're told that someone is dead, you say, 'Is he dead and buried, or just dead?' I think we are in the middle of this kind of situation."" ""Clinically dead is not a phrase that is commonly used, but when it is used, what it usually means is that someone is brain dead,"" said CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. ""In the United States, we would call this person dead because they have no brain activity."" Meanwhile, crowds jammed Tahrir Square once again on Wednesday. But their focus this time was not on Mubarak. Instead, it was on the power grab by the Egyptian military, which last week issued a constitutional decree that stripped the position of president of much of its power after a top court dissolved the parliament. Those moves were followed by the nation's first presidential election, which pitted Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohammed Morsi against Mubarak's former prime minister, Ahmed Safik. Final results have not been announced. ""It's a media stunt to divert attention from the constitutional decree,"" said Taha Shaker, a demonstrator in the square. ""If he's really dead, it won't make a difference. We've started a sit-in and won't leave unless the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces leaves unconditionally."" ""I've come from far away. I'm not leaving until Morsi swears the oath in front of the legitimately elected parliament,"" said demonstrator Sayed Ahmed. ""I don't care about Mubarak. These are games played by the intelligence services."" ""If he's really dead, its God's will,"" said Nasser Shaaban, another demonstrator. ""I would hope he lives to see the new president."" Outside Maadi Military Hospital, shortly before midnight Tuesday, there was no additional security. Instead, there were a few policemen outside the main gate and two military police inside the gate. Across the street perhaps a half-dozen journalists sat on the curb smoking cigarettes. Have you witnessed demonstrations in the Arab world? Tell us what you see. Follow coverage on CNN Arabic .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The Japanese government lodged a protest with the Chinese government Monday about the alleged presence of Chinese patrol boats near disputed territory, according to Japanese media. Japanese naval authorities spotted two Chinese patrol boats late Sunday near islands that have been at the center of recent diplomatic tensions, Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported Monday. Both countries claim sovereign rights to the islands called the Senkaku Islands in Japanese and the Diaoyu Islands in Chinese. The boats were in Japan's ""contiguous zone"" but did not cross into Japanese territorial waters, Kyodo reported, sourcing Japan's coast guard. But Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku said in the protest message to China that seeing Chinese patrol boats made his government feel ""uncomfortable,"" according to Kyodo. China's foreign ministry has claimed that its boats' patrols are both legal and based on need. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku said Monday that Japan will step up its monitoring activities around the Islands, according to Kyodo. Japan will add six submarines to its current fleet of 16 during the next four years as it sees increased naval activity from Asian neighbor China, according to news reports from Tokyo last week. Diplomatic tensions peaked in September after Japanese authorities arrested a Chinese fishing captain near the islands and detained him for more than two weeks. The battle escalated into diplomatic threats by Beijing, the suspension of diplomatic talks and canceled trips between the nations. High level military talks between the two powers that had been suspended over the row restarted October 11 but with little talk about islands, because it was ""not very productive,"" as one Japanese defense official said. Japanese opposition politicians have called for Internet search engine Google to drop the Chinese name from its maps and were quickly joined by Japan's foreign ministry. Anti-Japan protesters in China turned violent over a week ago, vandalizing Japanese businesses and cars. On Monday, the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo received an envelop containing a bullet and a protest document, Kyodo reported -- the second such protest this month. China and Taiwan have began aggressively challenging Japan's claims to the islands in 2003, according to the CIA World Factbook, as well as to surrounding seas, ""where all parties engage in hydrocarbon prospecting.""","Chinese patrols make Japan's government ""uncomfortable""

"(CNN) -- About 200 Utah educators spent part of their holiday vacation in class themselves -- learning how to handle a gun. Those who attended the free, specially tailored concealed carry permit session near Salt Lake City included school secretaries, substitutes and full-time teachers. Whether they were committed to bringing a gun into school or simply giving themselves the option, they were united in their desire to learn more. ""I'm not really sure where I want to go with this, but I certainly think its good to be educated,"" said Marguerita Davilla-Telck, the financial secretary at Matheson Junior High School in Magna. ""I know we have had concealed weapons in the building, and I know it made me feel safer."" The idea of a Utah teacher having a loaded weapon in class isn't new, nor is it illegal. Still, Thursday's class received attention in the wake of this month's massacre at a Connecticut elementary school, as well as National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre pitch that his advocacy organization can help facilitate the arming of more educators. Mostly Democratic politicians, teacher's groups and mayors -- including New York's Michael Bloomberg, Boston's Thomas Menino and Philadelphia's Michael Nutter -- have blasted this proposal. For them, the focus policywise should be ensuring there aren't firearms in schools, not bringing more of them in. NRA president clarifies group's stance on weapons in schools . ""Guns have no place in our schools. Period,"" Dennis Van Roekel and Randi Weingarten, the presidents of the two biggest U.S. teachers' unions, said in a joint statement. ""We must do everything we can to reduce the possibility of any gunfire in schools, and concentrate on ways to keep all guns off school property and ensure the safety of children and school employees. But to Clark Aposhian -- president of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, which ran Thursday's event in West Valley City -- it's a matter of giving teachers, school administrators, janitors and others the same rights, when licensed, to carry a concealed weapon in their place of work as others have. ""What we're talking about is not arming teachers,"" he said, contending that the approach of locking doors and hiding behind a desk ""just isn't doing it anymore."" ""We're simply not taking away that ability of lawful self-defense within a school."" For 12 years, Utah educators have been able to do just that, even if only a small fraction do bring guns into their workplace. The state's concealed weapon law allows for a person to have, on his person or in a secure lockbox, a weapon inside a school, Aposhian said. If they do have a loaded gun, their principals, school districts, and local police departments wouldn't even know, given the restrictions in place limiting who is told about who has a concealed weapons permit. Opinion: Teachers with guns a crazy idea . Aposhian told CNN that, since this law took effect, there have been no accidents or incidents involving educators' firearms in Utah schools, nor have there been school shootings in the state. The aim of Thursday's six-hour training sessions isn't to make educators into commandos roaming the halls to engage in shootouts with school shooters, he said. Rather, it's to give them one more option -- should the lockdown policies fail, law enforcement officers don't arrive on time, and a gunman makes his way into their room. ""When that shooter gets into the classroom, the teacher doesn't need to do a lot of tactical training to access and engage a firearm,"" said Aposhian, who is an instructor at Thursday's session. ""Point it at the shooter, (who) is probably going to be 5 to 10 feet away, and press the trigger -- thereby alleviating that option of jumping in front of the kids to soak up the bullets."" Teri Binkerd, a Spanish and stagecraft teacher at Viewmont High School, said she will do everything she can to protect her students. And she doesn't want to regret not having done everything she can, should a gunman enter her school. ""I'm here because I don't want to be a statistic, and I don't want to lose any of my kids,"" she said in between sessions Thursday, adding that several parents have asked her if she'd consider carrying a gun during school. ""If somebody is coming after my kids, they're going down and going down hard."" Binkerd was among the roughly 200 who went to the class Thursday, which had only been announced a few days earlier, a response that Aposhian described as ""overwhelming."" They were taught things like how to handle and secure their firearm, plus applicable laws -- a class that, except for one hour devoted to what to do in school shooting scenarios, any other qualified Utahan could take. ""This is nothing new for Utah,"" Aposhian said. ""You just haven't heard of it before."" Some in attendance Thursday were on the fence about whether they'd personally bring a weapon to school. Still, there was a widely shared sentiment that school would be safer if more trusted educators, beyond an armed guard standing watch at the front door, had guns. ""The sooner these gunmen ... face opposition, the sooner the carnage will stop,"" said Dustin ""Spanky"" Ward, an independent filmmaker who substitutes in Salt Lake City's Granite School District. ""If I was a parent, I'd be OK with it as long as the people carrying the weapons were prepared, responsible and knew what they were doing."" Opinion: Look to MADD in changing our gun culture .

"Beijing (CNN) -- A Chinese musician famous for playing a two-stringed fiddle, a 1994 Hollywood drama about two prison inmates, a United Airlines flight bound for Washington and CNN -- what do they have in common? If you try to search ""Abing,"" ""the Shawshank Redemption,"" ""UA898"" and ""CNN"" on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, you receive this terse message: ""According to relevant laws and policies, results are not displayed."" These terms have joined a fast-growing list of keywords blocked by Chinese censors as they try to prevent the public from obtaining news on a prominent human rights activist who recently escaped his more than 18 months of house arrest in eastern China. Chen Guangcheng is now in the U.S. embassy in Beijing, and American and Chinese officials are scrambling to resolve his situation, his friends and supporters have said. In a video posted online Friday, the blind activist recounted the brutal treatment he and his family received during confinement. While Chen's plight and dramatic escape have made top headlines around the world, news outlets in China, all of which are state-controlled, have mostly ignored the story. Clinton traveling to China amid tensions over Chen . Major web portals and social networking sites, though not state-owned, have to comply with strict government censorship rules -- or risk being shut down. After launching a campaign to clean up ""rampant online rumors,"" Chinese authorities in late March ordered the country's leading micro-blogging sites -- including Sina Weibo -- to disable their comment function for three days. Outside a busy Beijing subway station Monday, CNN randomly asked more than three dozen people about Chen -- only two had heard of him and his escape. One of the two, a young man who declined to give his name, said: ""It was all over Weibo for a while before the topic was censored."" ""It's a typical response by officials and quite a successful strategy in making it extremely difficult to spread information beyond some small circles of activists,"" explained Jeremy Goldkorn, a leading commentator on China's social media. ""But people interested in such things will still manage to find out."" They also get creative in Chinese cyberspace to evade censors, especially on the popular Sina Weibo site, where a third of China's more than 500 million internet users share news and information. With Chen Guangcheng's name long-since banned, netizens have come up with various code words. The obvious ones, like his initials ""CGC"" or ""blind man,"" were caught by censors quickly and added to the search blacklist. Then people tried Abing, the famous early 20th Century Chinese musician who was also blind. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was used to tell Chen's saga as some see the parallel in the storyline of inmates -- Chen was a prisoner in his own home -- enduring great suffering before eventually breaking free. The United flight number went viral online Friday as Chen was rumored to be on that plane en route the United States. It turned out to be a false alarm. CNN, like most other international news media, has followed Chen's story for years and provided extensive coverage on his situation since his escape. Other newly banned keywords include Chen's home village ""Dongshigu,"" ""U.S. embassy"" and ""pearl"" -- nickname of Chen's friend He Peirong, who drove him to Beijing and was taken into custody after the news broke. Despite the official blackout, some Chinese journalists have tried to spread the word in covert ways. On Netease, one the country's biggest web portals, editors Monday morning posted a clip of a TV news story on the ""sudden early arrival"" of a senior U.S. official ahead of a scheduled visit by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later this week. One of the tags for the video was ""Chen Guangcheng."" Within a few hours, the 25-second clip has attracted some 25,000 comments. One of the top comments reads: ""I know why he came but I can't say it -- or I'd be revealing state secrets."" I took a screenshot of the webpage showing Chen's name and posted it on my Sina Weibo account. It was reposted several hundred times before censors removed it. Chen's name disappeared from the video tags on the Netease page shortly after that. Since Friday, eight of my last ten Weibo posts have fallen victim to the site's censors. Most of them are related to Chen, including reaction from supporter and Hollywood actor Christian Bale as well as links to my CNN stories. By Monday afternoon, ""StevenCNN"" -- my Weibo name -- has become a banned search term.","Chinese censors block a growing number of keywords related to blind activist Chen .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Wearing a dark, Japanese style business suit, New Zealand environmental activist Peter Bethune sat in-between two uniformed court officers as his trial began on Thursday in downtown Tokyo. The officers stared ahead, unflinching, as 44-year-old Bethune scanned the courtroom. The head judge ran through each of the charges in Japanese. When the court interpreter began translating into English, Bethune turned to listen. The charges are serious, announced the court: trespassing, damage to property, assault, forcible obstruction of official business and possession of an illegal knife. If convicted on all counts, Bethune faces a maximum of 15 years behind bars. Bethune was captain of Sea Shepherd's futuristic boat, the Ady Gil. The batmobile-esque, $3 million boat collided with a Japanese whaling ship, the Shonan Maru 2, and sank in January. Weeks later, Bethune jumped aboard the Shonan Maru 2 and attempted to make a citizen's arrest of the captain. He was arrested and brought back to Japan to face criminal charges. In court Thursday, Bethune admitted to all the charges, except for assault. ""I admit that I boarded the Shonan Maru, but I believe that I have good reason to do so,"" he said. ""I admit that I fired the butyric acid, but there were additional circumstances that we will discuss in court."" Prosecutors say the butyric acid burned two crew members of the Japanese whaling fleet, but Sea Shepherd calls it a harmless, albeit rancid, liquid. Butyric acid is found in rancid butter and vomit. Bethune's Japanese attorneys have mounted a defense on the assault charge, which will be fought out until the trial ends on Monday. Bethune's case is the first time a Sea Shepherd activist has been tried in a Japanese criminal court in the group's long-running battle with Japan's whalers in the icy waters of the Antarctic. Japan annually hunts whales in the Antarctic, despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling, under the loophole that a country may legally do so if its purpose is scientific research. Sea Shepherd, who notes the whale meat then gets sold in Japanese markets and served in restaurants, calls the science argument a sham. Sea Shepherd's Seattle-based attorney, Dan Harris, is in Tokyo for Bethune's trial, though he is not Bethune's official Japanese counsel. ""This whole trial has been brought about for political reasons, far more than criminal reasons. If you look at what Peter Bethune did, he didn't do anything,"" Harris said. ""He climbed aboard a Japanese ship. Nobody was in any danger. No one was under any threat. No one was afraid. For Japan to act like it's enforcing a criminal law is a little disingenuous, when you look at what Pete Bethune did."" Japan maintains that when its laws are broken, it will prosecute. ""We all recognize the right of protest, right of demonstration, right to express their views. That does not mean you can attack people with force, attack our vessels and crews with their vessels,"" said Joji Morishita, from Japan's Fisheries Agency. Bethune testifies on Monday. A verdict is expected on June 10.","Charges against Peter Bethune include trespassing .
He was taken into custody in February aboard the Shonan Maru 2 .

"(CNN) -- A Planned Parenthood clinic in Wisconsin remained closed Monday after a homemade bomb was placed outside the building, the state organization said.

""Additional regulatory steps will be undertaken but we can now state, definitively, that the Macondo well poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico,"" former Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen announced. President Barack Obama hailed the ""final termination"" of the ruptured well, but said the federal government will continue to do ""everything possible to make sure the Gulf Coast recovers fully from this disaster."" The well erupted on April 20 and spewed an estimated 4.9 million barrels (206 million gallons) of crude into the Gulf of Mexico before it was temporarily capped in July. Its owner, oil giant BP, began its final cementing operations to cap the well on Friday. The death of the well is a milestone that likely will draw only momentary celebration. As scientists debate how much oil remains below the surface, years of economic and environmental recovery in the region lie ahead. The federal government will press for answers on what went wrong April 20 and lawsuits -- including those brought by the families of the 11 workers who died in the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion -- will eventually make their way through the courts. BP stopped the oil July 15, but pumping the bottom of the well with concrete -- the ""bottom kill"" -- was the final step in a five-month operation to ensure it will not leak. ""This spill began with a bang, ends with a whimper, and leaves a number of issues still screaming for attention,"" Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Massachusetts, said Saturday. ""This may be the final nail in the coffin for BP's well, but the investigations into this crime against the environment are continuing. Inquiries by Congress, the Obama administration's independent panel, and others will progress until every inch of this environmental crime scene has been examined and a full autopsy has been performed on the spill's effects,"" Markey's statement said. The well operation is wrapping up as the company works to repair its image since the disaster. So far, BP has said it has paid $1.6 billion in claims and government payments. ""BP is doing everything we can to make this right. We continue to ... clean up the environment, and make sure that people are compensated for legitimate claims,"" its website says. Chief Executive Tony Hayward was moved to other duties partially because of a perceived lack of empathy for the victims of the spill. Hayward recently testified before a British parliamentary committee about the failure of the well's blowout preventer, which is now in custody of the U.S. Justice Department and a focus of a criminal investigation into the disaster. BP shouldered some responsibility for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster after an internal investigation of the spill, but assigned much of the blame to contractors Halliburton and Transocean. Faulty cementing, a misread pressure test and the improperly maintained blowout preventer all contributed to the April 20 explosion, BP's nearly 200-page report on the disaster concluded. ""The team did not identify any single action or inaction that caused this accident,"" BP's report states. ""Rather, a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces came together to allow the initiation and escalation of the accident. Multiple companies, work teams and circumstances were involved over time."" Both Halliburton and Transocean sharply disputed the findings, with Transocean calling them ""self-serving"" and Halliburton insisting that the problem lay with BP's well design. Government scientists have estimated that at least 200 million gallons of oil leaked from BP's damaged well, but 74 percent of it subsequently evaporated, broke up, or was skimmed or burned off. A team of researchers in the Gulf of Mexico say they found an oily layer as thick as two inches coating the sea floor in some places, and they believe it may be from the BP spill. ""I think what we're seeing is oil that was on the surface, that has sedimented down to the bottom,"" said Samantha Joye of the University of Georgia. An analyst from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cautioned against jumping to conclusions before the samples are chemically analyzed.","NEW: Obama hails capping of well, says recovery efforts continue .

"(CNN) -- Washington and Beijing may be facing the most tense and delicate moment in their bilateral relationship since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. The reported escape from house arrest of dissident lawyer Chen Guangcheng and his apparent flight to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, while not yet officially confirmed, would greatly complicate the Obama administration's efforts to keep relations on an even keel in a year already fraught with bilateral irritants. Both leaderships want stability in the relationship, given the confluence of a U.S. presidential election and the once-in-a-decade leadership transition in Beijing scheduled for this fall. But this desire has been put to the test. There have been tiffs over China's early support for the Assad regime in Syria and North Korea's failed satellite launch and presumed follow-on nuclear test. And there was the bungled attempt by the erstwhile security chief of a senior Chinese Politburo member to seek refuge in a U.S. diplomatic facility on the eve of a visit to Washington by China's putative next leader. And now this. On many levels, the parallels to 1989 are striking. After the June 4 bloody crackdown on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, another famous Chinese dissident, Fang Lizhi, became a living symbol of the bilateral conflict over human rights by spending a year in the U.S. Embassy before finally being allowed to leave the country. Today's top Chinese leadership, though not yet as deeply divided as its 1989 antecedent, is struggling to maintain unity following the purge of one of its rising Politburo stars for his connections to the security chief's botched flight and lurid allegations of the murder of a British national. Recent apparent leaks and counter-leaks to the Western media detailing leadership infighting underscore the charged political atmosphere in Beijing as party heavyweights jockey for advantage in the wake of the scandal. Another wrinkle now is the absence of a revolutionary-credentialed paramount leader — manifest in the personage of Deng Xiaoping in 1989 — to arbitrate among the competing leadership constituencies. Add to this cauldron the scheduled arrival in Beijing next week of a Cabinet-level U.S. delegation — led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner — for the fourth round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED). If Chen is holed up in the U.S. Embassy, it is hard to fathom how the two sides will stay focused on the many pressing geostrategic and economic challenges in the relationship -- especially as they will undoubtedly face a frenzy among accompanying media over Chen's status. Moreover, the Chinese leadership certainly will view the visit through the prism of another pivotal moment in the Tiananmen drama, the state visit to China of then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which emboldened the demonstrators and deepened divisions among the leadership. Of course a game changer from 1989, and one that seems to constantly surprise the Chinese leadership, is the power of social media and the Internet. Despite a large contingent of foreign media in Beijing to cover Gorbachev's visit in 1989, the regime still was largely able to pull the plug on the world's ability to witness the ensuing massacre in real time. It is learning in recent weeks that such control is virtually impossible now. But this challenge can be a two-way street. If media accounts are accurate that Chen Guangcheng entered the U.S. Embassy on Thursday evening, then U.S. diplomats had less than 24 hours between his arrival and the story's explosion on the Internet. This hardly left sufficient time to seek instructions from Washington and to approach Chinese officials about the possibility of orchestrating a face-saving way to end the potential standoff. The problem is made worse by the likelihood that many in the Chinese elite will assume the United States deliberately leaked the information to embarrass the Chinese government on the eve of the S&ED. The Chinese Communist Party's liberal wing also is trying to exploit the downfall of its Politburo archenemy to revive its long-diminished fortunes and push for a new wave of economic and political change. Their hard-line opponents, however, will see an opportunity in the Chen Guangcheng affair to blunt any reformist tide. Coming on the same day the White House will have tweaked Beijing's neuralgia about Taiwan by advising Congress that it will take a second look at potential sales of new fighter aircraft to the island. The news about Chen completes the circle for those eager to paint the United States as bent on stifling China's rise. In the past, such cries of ""hostile foreign forces"" meddling in China's internal affairs frequently have taken the wind out of the reformists' sail. Against this backdrop, the stage is set for a sudden increase in bilateral tension. Initially presumed to be largely inconsequential, next week's S&ED meetings may prove the most critical test of U.S.-China relations the Obama administration has faced to date. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Johnson.","Christopher Johnson: D.C., China face tense moment over dissident's apparent flight to U.S. protection .

"(CNN) -- With E3, the world's biggest video game expo, approaching, Sony and Microsoft are getting ready to wow the entertainment world with their next generation consoles. But some features of the new iterations of the Xbox and PlayStation -- be they announced or just rumored -- are driving a wedge between the gaming giants and some of their fans. At the heart of the issue in both cases is whether gamers will be allowed to play games they buy on more than one console. That impacts everything from reselling games to taking them over to a friend's house to play, but that could be at odds with game creators' desire to make sure everyone playing their games have paid for them. Microsoft's pre-owned game policy for their new Xbox One console has been a source of confusion and contention. The company has issued conflicting statements about whether installing a game on a second console would require a fee, or whether doing so would lock the game on the original console. The company's latest statement still leaves questions. ""We know there is some confusion around used games on Xbox One, but we have confirmed that we designed it to enable our customers to trade in and resell games at retail,"" the company said, with no elaboration, in a statement to CNN. ""Beyond that we haven't confirmed any specific scenarios."" The phrase ""we'll have more details to share later"" seems to be a common refrain from representatives, with the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo opening in a few weeks. At Sony's event announcing the PlayStation 4, they showed off many new features for games and home entertainment. However, fans are now similarly clamoring for details into the company's plans for digital rights management and the impact it will have on playing used games. The company hasn't said, but that hasn't stopped a preventative movement of gamers who have taken to forum threads and Twitter, where they're using the hashtags #PS4NoDRM and #PS4UsedGames to reach out to Sony executives. In game console terms, DRM is a code that allows users to access a game's content. It's designed to assure developers and publishers that only the person who paid for the game can play it. Sony has responded, saying they hear the concerns and are overwhelmed by the passion. They have previously made statements about not wanting to damage their relationship with their fans. But does that mean a DRM-free PS4? Only time will tell. Microsoft has also tried to reach out to fans. Larry Hryb, a director of programming for Xbox Live perhaps best known by his gamer tag ""Major Nelson,"" responded to a post on his blog with comments that gave some hope. ""We're fully aware of what is going on,"" he wrote. ""I am also working on a few things to address it. I can't say much more right now. But we ARE listening."" He attached Twitter-style hashtags: #XboxOneUSEDGAMES and #XboxOneNoDRM. The reality is that Sony and Microsoft aren't the ones who would benefit most from DRM or used-game restrictions. Game publishers want to make sure they are getting paid for their work, and that includes the secondhand market. Given a recent spate of studio closures and financial difficulties at others, it's not hard to see where that desire comes from. As shown by a slow start for Nintendo's Wii U, gamers base a lot of their decisions about which console to buy on the games that are available for it. Nintendo was dinged by some gamers for launching with a slim lineup and is currently launching a new spate of new and already popular titles in hopes of making up ground. In the end, it's unlikely that large publishers will agree to one set of rules for one of the new consoles and another for the other. And that leaves worried gamers with a conundrum: which new device do you buy if they both are released with DRM and used-game bans? And that, some say, could open the door for Nintendo, which does not have digital rights management on its games. Penny Arcade Report senior editor Ben Kuchera recently wrote suggesting gamers buy a Wii U as a message to Sony and Microsoft about how important the issue is to them. ""Rewarding that behavior with a boost in sales would be ridiculously effective, and send a much louder message than you ever could on Twitter,"" he wrote. ""But that requires a change of behavior. ""In other words, no one should expect this to happen. We won't see the true will of the players, for good or ill, until preorders begin."" All the gaps in information are likely (we hope) to be cleared up when each company holds its annual showcase at E3, which begins June 11. Then we'll see whether used games are truly important, or ultimately irrelevant, to gamers being asked to open up their wallets.","New versions of Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation are on the way .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The world's population is forecast to hit 7 billion in 2011, the vast majority of its growth coming in developing and, in many cases, the poorest nations, a report released Wednesday said. Riders cram into a train last month in New Delhi, India. India's population is expected to be 1.7 billion by 2050. A staggering 97 percent of global growth over the next 40 years will happen in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the Population Reference Bureau's 2009 World Population Data Sheet. ""The great bulk of today's 1.2 billion youth -- nearly 90 percent -- are in developing countries,"" said Carl Haub, a co-author of the report. Eight in 10 of those youth live in Africa and Asia. ""During the next few decades, these young people will most likely continue the current trend of moving from rural areas to cities in search of education and training opportunities, gainful employment, and adequate health care,"" Haub continued, calling it one of the major social questions of the next few decades. In the developed world, the United States and Canada will account for most of the growth -- half from immigration and half from a natural increase in the population -- births minus deaths, according to the report. High fertility rates and a young population base in the developing world will fuel most of the growth, especially in Africa, where women often give birth to six or seven children over a lifetime, the report says. The number is about two in the United States and 1.5 in Canada. A stark contrast can be drawn between Uganda and Canada, which currently have about 34 million and 31 million residents, respectively. By 2050, Canada's population is projected to be 42 million, while Uganda's is expected to soar to 96 million, more than tripling. ""Even with declining fertility rates in many countries, world population is still growing at a rapid rate,"" said Bill Butz, president of the bureau. ""The increase from 6 billion to 7 billion is likely to take 12 years, as did the increase from 5 billion to 6 billion. Both events are unprecedented in world history."" By 2050, India is projected to be the world's most populous nation at 1.7 billion, overtaking current leader China, which is forecast to hit 1.4 billion. The United States is expected to reach 439 million for No. 3 on the list.","Global population to reach 7 billion in two years, research institute projects .

"(CNN) -- When Regis Philbin asked David Letterman about the difficult decision to return to the air less than a week after 9/11, the ""Late Show"" host said, ""I remember not wanting to go back, not feeling ready to go back, but knowing we had to go back. And you know -- my concerns were minimal compared to people who really suffered."" Philbin, sitting in for Piers Morgan, in his return to hosting after leaving ""Regis and Kelly"" gets Letterman to open up about fatherhood, politics, his career, his friendship with the late Johnny Carson and more. Letterman's ""Late Show"" guests on September 17, 2001, were Philbin and Dan Rather, and his completely joke-free monologue was solemnly delivered from behind his desk rather than the usual center stage. Letterman praised New York firefighters, police officers and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Of those who carried out the attacks, he said: ""We were told that they were zealots fueled by religious fervor, and if you live to be a thousand years old, will that make any sense to you?"" When Philbin asked Letterman to take him back to the beginning of his career, Letterman recalled falling behind in college until the semester he took a public speaking course at Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. He referred to the class as a ""lifeline"" that made him realize he ""might be able to turn this into doing something."" Letterman graduated from Ball State in 1969 and six years later went to California to try to make it as a writer. He found success quickly, he told Philbin, ""not because of me. It was just in those days ... if you wanted to go to California and become a comic or get involved in comedy, writing, performing, whatever, the blueprint for that was laid out in front of you every night on 'The Tonight Show.' "" The show's host, Carson, often plugged comedians' appearances at the Comedy Store, and Letterman saw the famed Hollywood comedy club as ""an instant connection."" Three years later, in 1978, Letterman appeared on ""The Tonight Show."" On that appearance, Carson predicted great success for the young comedian, and Letterman, watching the old ""Tonight Show"" clip, told Philbin, ""That breaks my heart -- to see Johnny again."" Letterman recalled Carson's early influence on him. ""He was, I think, the biggest star in television. And I was just a kid who has followed ... the beacon of his light coming out of Burbank."" Letterman called Carson's friendship ""a tremendous blessing"" and said he made a point of telling him the way he felt. Letterman recalled the last time he saw Carson. ""The way life is,"" Letterman said, ""you don't know that that will be the last time, but it turned out to be the last time, and it couldn't have been a lovelier evening. And I cherish that because it was unusual. It was not going to happen under any other circumstances. And it was my wife, myself, Johnny and his wife on Johnny's yacht that he had anchored in the Hudson. ""And it was a Friday evening and we sailed off just before sunset and went up the Hudson, up under the George Washington Bridge, which is lovely, turned around, now the sun is setting. We go out to the Statue of Liberty and see that at night, as the sky is darkening. And then you turn around and we headed up the East River, and you see the lower tip of Manhattan , and it was a sight and an experience. ... You never get to see New York like that."" Carson passed away in 2005. Letterman has hosted ""Late Show With David Letterman"" on CBS for nearly 19 years. Before then, he hosted ""Late Night With David Letterman"" on NBC for 11 years. One staple of both shows -- the ""Top Ten"" list -- is still going strong. ""It was a cheap, easy way to refill a category and get some laughs most nights,"" Letterman said. When Philbin asked if coming up with the lists was ""a chore,"" the ""Late Show"" host joked, ""Not for me. ... I'm not even in the building. I'm an old man with a facial."" Letterman also said that his favorite guests -- besides Philbin, of course -- were ""people who really come and do a great job for us."" He counted Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Brian Williams, Tom Brokaw and Don Rickles among the ""handful of people who are really, really strong."" When Philbin brought up the fact that, in the past, talk-show hosts have avoided politics so as not to alienate their audiences, Letterman said, ""I have been guilty of appearing to be playing partisan politics. However, I'd just like to say that for the record, I am a registered independent."" Letterman insisted the material drives his jokes, and noted that ""no president that I am aware of got hammered harder than Bill -- President Bill Clinton -- over the Monica Lewinsky situation. We beat up on him. We still use him as a reference, and then we were desperate. We thought, 'Well, this was so easy' -- and then we got George Bush."" Letterman said that while he may appear to have a political agenda, it's simply a matter of who's easier to poke fun at. ""If a guy drops his dog or a guy straps his dog to the roof of a car or if a guy gets a shoe thrown at him, well, this is where the material is going to be,"" Letterman said. Philbin also asked Letterman about fatherhood. The comedian's son, Harry, is 8. ""Life is no longer solely about you,"" Letterman said. ""It's about him."" Philbin asked if Harry knew what his dad did for a living. ""No,"" the comedian joked, ""he thinks I have a job in a metal shop."" Letterman said he and his son took up skiing four years ago and very much enjoy the sport. Harry also loves animals, Letterman told Philbin, and likes to visit his father at work when ""Late Show"" does its ""Stupid Pet Tricks"" segment or has zookeeper Jack Hanna as a guest. When Philbin asked whether Harry was a ""mama's boy"" or a ""daddy's boy,"" Letterman answered, ""He's a mama's boy, for sure."" What's great about being the 65-year-old father of an 8-year-old? ""I'm old enough now where if I see trouble down the road, I'll probably be dead by then, and it will be his stepfather's problem."" Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"London (CNN) -- Seated side by side, News Corp. magnate Rupert Murdoch and his son, James, told British lawmakers Tuesday they were not to blame in a burgeoning scandal that has raised questions of how much top executives knew about illegal phone hacking and when. Testy exchanges peppered the nearly three hours of questioning by members of a parliamentary committee who pressed the father and son for answers on who may have authorized or known of reporters' hacking of voice mails. Asked by one lawmaker, ""Do you accept that ultimately you are responsible for this whole fiasco?"" Rupert Murdoch simply responded: ""No."" After declaring it was ""the most humble day of my life,"" the elder Murdoch let James Murdoch do most of the talking. When called upon, Rupert Murdoch indicated he knew little of the day-to-day details of his holdings and that he might hear more from a News of the World editor about extra soccer coverage than a payout to a phone hacking victim. Asked whether he had considered resigning, Rupert Murdoch replied: ""No, because I feel that the people I trusted, I don't know at what level, let me down and I think they behaved disgracefully, betrayed the company and me, and it's for them to pay."" ""I think that frankly I'm the best person to clear this up,"" he added. The Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee also heard from former top executive Rebekah Brooks, who testified she never paid a policeman or sanctioned a payment to police. Journalists at the now-defunct News of the World are accused of bribing police to get private details about people, including members of the royal family. Lawmakers seated at a horseshoe-shaped table quizzed the Murdochs about out-of-court settlements and employee actions. But it was an unexpected moment, well into the testimony, that was destined for video highlights. A protester tossed a plate of light-blue shaving cream at Rupert Murdoch, 80, prompting a brief recess. ""You greedy billionaire,"" the man said, as he hit Murdoch with the foam. Murdoch's wife, Wendi Deng, who was seated behind him, leapt to her feet and smashed the attacker's hand with her own. Britain is in an uproar over the scandal, which could have global implications. It began with the phone-hacking claims involving reporters from News of the World -- which led its parent company, News Corp., to shut down the paper -- and quickly broadened into allegations that journalists had paid police for confidential information. Tuesday's hearing was widely anticipated and the Murdochs, wearing conservative suits and ties, expressed contrition early on. Rupert Murdoch hesitated often when answering questions, and James often tried to intercede, saying he could delve into details of internal News Corp. investigations. The pair said the company has willingly forwarded information to criminal investigators once it became aware of it. While Rupert Murdoch said he could not know in any detail the actions of his 53,000 employees, committee member Tom Watson reminded the elder Murdoch several times he is in charge of corporate governance -- the culture and policies of a business entity. When James Murdoch tried to intervene on a point, Watson stopped him, saying, ""Your father is responsible, and serious wrongdoing has been brought about in the company and it's revealing in itself what he doesn't know and what executives chose not to tell him."" Rupert Murdoch said no one brought to his attention the fact that Neville Thurlbeck, a senior News of the World reporter, had been found guilty of trying to blackmail women. Rupert Murdoch said he and his son were not guilty of willful blindness to the company's problems. Therese Coffey, a member of the parliamentary committee, told CNN after the hearing that she and others were surprised by how little Rupert Murdoch knew of some details. Rupert Murdoch told the Parliament committee he has seen ""no evidence"" that victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States were victims of phone hacking by his employees, and he does not believe it happened. The FBI is investigating News Corp. over the claim, made by a British newspaper. In his testimony, James Murdoch said he had ""no knowledge"" that Brooks and Les Hinton, another former News Corp. senior official -- both of whom have resigned in the past week -- knew of the extent of phone hacking at the News of the World. He told lawmakers he had ""no evidence"" they did anything wrong. Explaining why he had previously given inaccurate statements to the committee, James Murdoch said senior News Corp. officials had learned about the extent of phone hacking by their employees as a result of civil lawsuits against News of the World in late 2010. He said those in charge were determined ""both to put things right, make sure these things don't happen again, and to be the company that I know that we have always aspired to be."" Reading a statement at the conclusion of the hearing, Rupert Murdoch said: ""James and I would like to say how sorry we are for what has happened -- especially with regard to listening to the voice mail of victims of crime."" He said that in his 57 years at the head of his company, ""at no time do I remember being as sickened as when I heard what the Dowler family had to endure -- nor do I recall being as angry as when I was told that the News of the World could have compounded their distress. Milly Dowler was a missing girl whose phone was allegedly hacked. She was later found dead. Revelations that journalists working for News of the World had eavesdropped on her phone and deleted some of her messages to make room for more brought the scandal, which had been simmering for years, to a boil. Asked how much he knew about day-to-day operations, Rupert Murdoch said the disgraced Sunday tabloid News of the World accounted for less than 1% of his News Corp. He had ""perhaps lost sight"" of what was happening at the newspaper, he acknowledged. Brooks, the former editor of News of the World who went on to become chief executive of its parent company, News International, also appeared before the committee Tuesday to answer questions. She said News International acted ""quickly and decisively"" to investigate internally when the extent of the phone hacking became clear and the company had passed the new information to the police. Brooks said she was aware that News of the World used private detectives, and believed every national newspaper in the U.K. did the same. But she said she has never met Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator accused of carrying out mass phone hacking for her paper, and did not hear his name until 2006. Brooks was editor of the best-selling Sunday tabloid at the time of some of the most serious allegations against it. She resigned July 15 over the scandal and was arrested and questioned by police two days later. Her lawyer, Steven Parkinson, said Monday his client is not guilty of any crime. Conservative politician Louise Mensch, who was among the lawmakers to quiz both the Murdochs and Brooks, told CNN she believed the trio had given ""full and frank answers"" while presenting their version of events. The thrust of the committee's questioning was that they should have known what was happening at the News of the World, rather than relying on other people, Mensch said. The ripples of the affair have reached as far as British Prime Minister David Cameron, who is cutting short a trip to Africa to return to London and deal with the crisis. Cameron has faced strong criticism in recent days over his decision to hire Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor who resigned as Cameron's spokesman after his newspaper staff were jailed for hacking voice mails. Coulson, who resigned his government post in January, has since been arrested. Cameron on Tuesday vowed to ""stop the obscenity of hacking and get to the bottom of what happened,"" then put in place measures to prevent such problems from recurring. ""The police have serious questions to answer about potential corruption and a failed investigation. Politicians have been too close to media owners,"" Cameron told reporterse in Nigeria, part of a two-day Africa trip. The prime minister is expected to answer questions Wednesday during a debate on the scandal in the House of Commons. Both Brooks and Coulson, who are free on bail, deny knowledge of wrongdoing. Earlier, the head of London's Metropolitan Police and his deputy -- both of whom have resigned -- appeared before a different committee of Parliament. Commissioner Paul Stephenson and Assistant Commissioner John Yates defended their actions in failing to authorize a more thorough investigation into the use of phone hacking, following a July 2009 article in the Guardian newspaper revealing that tactic had been far more broadly used than previously reported. Stephenson said he did not pressure the Guardian to drop its investigation, while Yates said he had no reason at the time to believe the situation was serious enough to warrant a full-scale investigation. They also defended their hiring of a former News of the World editor, Neil Wallis, for a public relations job at the department. Wallis was arrested last week in connection with the investigation. Yates also said he had nothing to do with helping secure a job for Wallis' daughter. Murdoch's News Corp. encompasses Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and Harper Collins publishers in the United States. News International -- a British subsidiary of News Corp. -- owns the Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain.

Clemens told reporters afterward that he was ""very thankful and very grateful"" for the chance to answer the allegations. In a nearly direct exchange with McNamee, Clemens told the House panel that McNamee injected him with vitamin B-12 on three occasions, but never with steroids or other illegal substances. McNamee -- who served as Clemens' trainer until 2007 -- countered that he injected Clemens with only testosterone, the steroid Winstrol or human growth hormone. ""I've never given Roger B-12,"" McNamee told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Clemens' testimony to the panel examining performance-enhancing drug use in America's pastime also failed to jibe with an affidavit provided by fellow New York Yankees ace Andy Pettitte, who has told the committee that in 1999 or 2000 Clemens ""told me he had taken HGH."" Saying Pettitte was and will remain a close friend, Clemens said he believes Pettitte made a mistake. ""I believe Andy has misheard, Mr. Congressman, on his comment about myself using HGH, which never happened,"" Clemens said. Insisting he's never taken ""shortcuts,"" a clearly miffed Clemens opened Wednesday's testimony saying he resented accusations that have forever tainted his legacy, which includes a record seven Cy Young Awards. ""No matter what we discuss here today, I am never going to have my name restored, but I've got to try and set the record straight,"" Clemens said. McNamee flatly challenged Clemens' remarks, saying, ""I injected those drugs into the body of Roger Clemens at his direction. Unfortunately, Roger has denied this and has led a full-court attack on my credibility."" Watch McNamee apologize for ""tainting our national pastime"" » . McNamee defended his credibility and told lawmakers he was promised no special treatment ""for fingering star players."" ""I have no reason to lie, and every reason not to. If I do lie I will be prosecuted,"" he said. ""All that I was ever told was to tell the truth to the best of my ability, and that is what I have done. I told the investigators that I injected three people, two of whom, I believe, confirm my account. The third is sitting at this table."" McNamee said he believes he stopped giving baseball players performance-enhancing substances in 2002. He called steroid usage ""pretty prevalent"" among players at the time.  Watch Clemens explain how he treated McNamee » . Grilled on why he provided players with such substances, McNamee replied, ""I just accepted it as the norm, and it was part of the culture in baseball."" Missing from Wednesday's hearing was Pettitte. He had been named along with Clemens and other players in ex-Sen. George Mitchell's scathing report alleging widespread steroid use in baseball. Pettitte previously acknowledged using human growth hormone in 2002. The House panel revealed Wednesday that Pettitte admitted using it again in 2004 shortly before having season-ending elbow surgery.  Watch Clemens say Pettitte ""misheard"" a remark several years ago » . Pettitte initially withheld details of the second incident because he got the HGH from his father, who had obtained it to help overcome health problems, Pettitte's attorneys said. Pettitte ""sought to shield him from publicity,"" read a statement. Pettitte, who has played with Clemens for the Yankees or Houston Astros since 1999, was excused by the committee Tuesday, along with former Yankee Chuck Knoblauch. McNamee told the panel he injected both men with performance-enhancing substances.  See the key players in the case » . ""Mr. Knoblauch and Mr. Pettitte have answered all the committee's questions and their testimony at the hearing is not needed,"" read a statement from the panel. Waxman said Pettitte's and Knoblauch's testimony backed up McNamee's account. Read Sports Illustrated analysis of the latest developments . Clemens' attorneys have steadfastly denied their client used performance-enhancing substances. Clemens was careful in his remarks to attack McNamee's credibility, rather than the Mitchell report's integrity. ""If I am guilty of anything, it is of being too trusting of everyone, wanting to see the best in everyone and being too nice to everyone,"" Clemens said. Clemens' legal team has filed a lawsuit against McNamee, saying his allegations ""fueled rampant speculation and irreparably tainted the reputation of one of baseball's hardest working and most talented pitchers."" McNamee's attorneys last week, however, showed reporters photos of needles and gauze that McNamee said were used to inject Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone. They said they turned the items over to federal investigators in January. McNamee, a former New York City police officer, kept the items because he was nervous that Clemens' drug use would become public and Clemens would turn against him, said Richard Emery, who is representing the former trainer. Rusty Hardin, Clemens' lawyer, dismissed the purported evidence as ""the desperate Hail Mary of a man who wants to ruin Roger."" Hardin would not indicate whether Clemens would voluntarily provide a DNA sample but said, ""Any time any legitimate law enforcement agency asks a reasonable inquiry of us, we'll be glad to respond."" Waxman said Wednesday that McNamee has acknowledged he was not forthcoming with investigators in past statements. Rep. Dan Burton questioned why the panel should believe McNamee when he has lied repeatedly to investigators and the media. McNamee acknowledged lying when he previously said he'd never had dealings with steroids and that Clemens and Pettitte had never asked for any. ""You're here under oath, and yet we have lie after lie after lie,"" Burton alleged. McNamee did not get a chance to respond. McNamee previously told the panel he withheld information about Clemens because he was ""trying not to hurt the guy,"" Waxman said.  Watch McNamee tell the panel, ""I did tell the truth"" » . The chairman also said that Clemens' past remarks included ""conflicts and inconsistencies"" on whether he had discussions about human growth hormone with McNamee.

"Bartilla, Iraq (CNN) -- On a dusty street corner in the Christian enclave of Bartilla, Iraq, Yousuf and his friends try to pretend that things are normal. They smoke, play dominoes and act like ISIS fighters aren't potentially just moments away from killing them. Bartilla is near Mosul, the first city to fall to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, an al Qaeda splinter group also known by its acronym ISIS. ""We have all our bags ready. If anything happens, we will leave,"" said Yousuf. Others are determined to stay. ""I might be the only girl left here. Everyone will go, but I will stay,"" said Mariana, 22, who spoke to CNN as she sat outside a church. ""I won't leave my country."" 'There won't be an Iraqi left' Religious minorities, such as Christians and Yazidis, make up less than 5% of Iraq's population. Since 2003, attacks against these minorities by insurgents and religious extremists have driven more than half of the minorities out of the country, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Those that remained sometimes took security into their own hands. After a series of attacks against churches in Baghdad in 2005, young men in Bartilla formed civilian defense units. Their efforts have intensified in recent weeks as militants have drawn near. The men won't let CNN film their checkpoints, or other defenses -- not with ISIS just a 10-minute drive away. Umm Shakir's brother and sister were killed in an explosion in Baghdad in 2008. She points at her son. ""Everyday he pulls a 12-hour guard duty,"" she says. ""It's very hard. If it stays like this, there won't be an Iraqi left in the country."" 'This evil can't continue' Comprising mostly Sunni Muslims, ISIS wants to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria. Since launching their offensive in Iraq, the group claims to have killed at least 1,700 Shiites. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have fled, prompting fears of a brewing humanitarian crisis. Most shops in Bartilla are closed. Their owners have either left or don't bother opening. Business is down; power is out. But Father Binham Lallou proudly points to the new renovations at his church -- the granite archways, the floor he always wanted to build. He remembers coming to the church as a boy.

"(CNN) -- The Russian coast guard seized two Chinese vessels and detained 36 fishermen Tuesday after they were allegedly found fishing in Russian-controlled waters in the Sea of Japan, according to state media . Warning shots were fired at one vessel during a three-hour pursuit by Russian Coast Guard, which eventually rammed the vessel and soldiers fired directly on the ship when sailors resisted being boarded, according to Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency. No one was killed or injured in the incident, according to RIA. The ship had 22.5 metric tons of squid and a crew of 17 RIA reported, and didn't have documents allowing them to fish in Russia's Exclusive Economic Zone. A second Chinese fishing vessel, with 19 crew members, was also detained in nearby waters. An Exclusive Economic Zone is an area within 200 nautical miles of a nation's shores which gives the country sole rights to fish and develop resources in the area. China's Xinhua reports that the ships were from the city of Weihai in China's eastern Shandong province. An editorial in China's People's Daily condemned the firing on the vessel, calling the move ""reckless."" ""In 1983, the Soviet Union shot down a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 civilian airliner. Now Russia, for at least the second time, has fired on a Chinese civilian ship. Such conduct will stay in the memory of people in Northeast Asia,"" the editorial said.

"(CNN) -- This month, a federal judge allowed North Carolina to put into effect new laws that would make it more difficult to vote. Most of the American public didn't notice. The Republicans pushing to restrict voting rights nationwide are betting on such inattention. Emboldened by a recent Supreme Court case limiting the reach of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, GOP legislators have moved swiftly in numerous states to cut early voting and same-day registration, and to require ID cards at the ballot box. Democrats claim these measures will discourage young and nonwhite voters from voting, who tend to vote more often for Democrats. GOP legislators insist they're only worried about voter fraud and the integrity of the electoral system. But there is little evidence of significant fraud. And these legislators don't actually dispute the Democrats' basic claim. Indeed, rigging the rules to dampen turnout among youth and minorities appears to be a key strategy for some Republicans. When people complain about the impact of voting restrictions, they're often dismissed as Democratic mouthpieces. Voting rights, to the average citizen, becomes just another partisan football. This is bad for the country. But it's particularly bad for the GOP. While it may seem that the Republicans who want to restrict voting are winning right now, their strategy in fact threatens to isolate the party in the long term. Republican leaders insist, correctly, that plenty of young, Asian-American, Hispanic, and African-American voters respond positively to a message of smaller government and more economic freedom. But prior to stances on issues, what voters of color and young voters pick up on is a vibe -- an overall sense of whether we are welcome. And the vibe that many in the GOP have been sending lately has been less than welcoming. Consider not just the efforts to invalidate the Voting Rights Act and to restrict access to the ballot, which many Millennials and African-Americans have taken personally, but also the hostility of many Republicans toward undocumented immigrants. Consider too the remarks of people like Alabama congressman Mo Brooks, who declared recently that President Obama and the Democrats are prosecuting a ""war on whites."" Whipping up the anxieties of older whites may be rational politics -- after all, they are still the likeliest voters -- but it alienates what demographer Paul Taylor calls ""the next America."" As Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention recently put it, the GOP, having painted itself in a corner, ""applied a second coat."" I am a Democrat, so I know my comments will be presumed partisan. But I am foremost an American who is quite conscious of what it took for me, the son of Chinese immigrants, to get to vote. A few weeks ago I met John Lewis, icon of the civil rights movement and longtime Georgia congressman. It happened to be the 50th anniversary of the signing of Civil Rights Act into law. I asked him how today's youth should engage, given that the obstacles and challenges are so different from what he experienced as a teenager. His answer was simple: Participate. Vote. This is the moment for a rising Republican to deliver precisely that message to people of color and young voters: Participate. Vote. It's the moment for a leading Republican to argue that his or her party should be on the side of more democracy, not less; more inclusion, not less. If there is actual voter fraud, root it out, this leader should say, but not in a way that seems like a whites-only backroom plot. Sen. Rand Paul has shown signs that he could be such a voice. He's met with constituencies that national Republicans often ignore, like African-American voters and college students. His outreach has seemed in earnest, and he has been a refreshing voice on issues like reform of criminal sentencing. But telling, also, was the quick getaway he made when an undocumented ""Dreamer"" recently came up to him and another GOP congressman to ask them about immigration reform. Outreach can't be only scripted and packaged, it has to come from readiness to engage. More importantly, it has to emerge from a sincere belief that more participation is better. A party confident about its ideas doesn't work in a cynical way to shrink the electorate. It sees in ""the next America"" a majority waiting to be made. Rock the Vote has just launched a new nonpartisan campaign to push back against voting restrictions. Celebrities, musicians and students and many progressives have joined. All that's missing are some Republicans to argue -- in a visible, unexpected, Nixon-goes-to-China way -- that rocking the vote is better than rigging it. Are there any? Their party needs them, and so does their country.","Rock the Vote recently launched a campaign to push back against voting restrictions .

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court of the United States has long been a unique political and legal institution. Our justices are the only judges in the world who sit on a nation's highest court for life. Their power to strike down the political decisions of the president, the Congress and the states (the power of judicial review) is nowhere spelled out in our Constitution. Yet, since the beginning, both the court and the American people have assumed that power to exist. The justices don't act like normal judges bound by law (because they're not), but they are not quite lawmakers, either. Having neither the ""purse nor the sword,"" the justices rely solely on the elected branches of government for the enforcement of their decisions. Their power rests mostly on the prestige they hold with the governed, and lately, more and more of the governed are having grave doubts about the nine most powerful judges in the world. Last week, a new poll by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a Democratic Party-allied pollster, for Democracy Corps set the social media world atwitter. More than 50% of those polled were reported to believe that the justices let ""their own personal or political views influence their decisions,"" and more than 70% said that the justices should have fixed terms, not life tenure. Not surprisingly, the poll revealed great support for television cameras in the Supreme Court, a move the justices have rejected for way too long. Over 85% of those polled also said that the justices should be bound by the same judicial code of ethics as other federal judges (they are not) and that their financial records should be more transparent. There can be quibbles with how some of the poll questions were asked, but there is little doubt that the results demonstrated that the American people are becoming more disenchanted with the nation's highest Court. On Sunday, Adam Liptak, the excellent Supreme Court reporter for the New York Times, wrote a lengthy story suggesting that the court is more partisan than ever before, reflecting the deep divisions in our political and media world. The tag line for an article on the new poll in Salon was ""in an increasingly divided country, it seems that everyone can agree that they hate the Supreme Court."" And the Huffington Post concluded that ""wide majorities are losing faith in the Roberts Supreme Court."" This new poll confirms what I have been arguing, including on this website, for a long time. There are (at least) two fundamental changes that we need to make to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first is easy and should be non-controversial. The American people have a right to see on their televisions, tablets and smartphones the oral arguments and decision announcements of the Supreme Court. More than half of state supreme courts, and the Supreme Courts of Canada and the United Kingdom, televise their proceedings with great success, and there are simply no persuasive arguments that the most powerful court in the world shouldn't do the same. The American people feel that the justices are hiding from them, and that cannot do anything but damage the confidence we have in the justices. The second change is much harder but even more important. Here's a simple rule that I think applies to all democracies: No governmental official who wields great power should hold their office for life. Period. The original idea was that the justices would be appointed at a relatively old age and serve for a few years. That idea is not just quaint but antiquated. Justices John Paul Stevens and William Brennan both served for more than 30 years, and Justice Elena Kagan, who was 50 when appointed, may well serve for 40 more years. No human being can be expected to perform their job well when they know they have such great power and can never be fired. Additionally, numerous justices such as William O. Douglas and Thurgood Marshall served past the time of competence. Moreover, it is just crazy that presidents who serve the same number of years appoint fewer or greater justices based on either the randomness of illness and death or even politically timed judicial retirements. For example, President George W. Bush drastically changed the balance on the court by appointing Justice Samuel Alito, a staunch conservative, to replace the more moderate Sandra Day O'Connor, while President Carter didn't have the opportunity to nominate even a single justice during his four years as president. We need a constitutional amendment giving the justices fixed terms and a salary for life. This type of system provides much-needed judicial independence without the downsides of life tenure. As far as hoping the justices will decide cases under the law without regard to their personal value preferences, no poll can provide a solution to that problem which will be with us for as long as the justices exercise judicial review. But at least we can make them use that power more transparently for all the world to see and limit the time that each individual justice wields such extraordinary authority.","Poll finds public believes Supreme Court decides cases on political grounds .

"(Parenting.com) -- Revising its policy on circumcision for the first time in 13 years, the American Academy of Pediatrics now says that the preventative health benefits of infant circumcision clearly outweigh the risks. The AAP is also emphasizing that the procedure should be covered by third party payers, including Medicaid, so more families have access to it. However, the organization stopped short of recommending circumcision routinely for all infant boys, saying it's still up to parents to weigh the health, cultural, and religious implications to make the best decision for their child. Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, a small flap of skin that covers the tip of the penis, generally performed in the days after birth. Many Jews and Muslims circumcise their sons because of their religious beliefs. Other parents choose to snip for hygiene reasons, believing it's easier to keep a circumcised penis clean, or cosmetic ones, wanting junior to ""look like dad."" The AAP's previous policy statement, published in 1999 and affirmed in 2005, took a more neutral stance on circumcision, noting ""potential medical benefits,"" but saying it's ""not essential to the child's current well-being."" However, an AAP task force formed in 2007 examined scientific studies conducted between 1995 through 2010 to evaluate if a revision was needed. The new, stronger language is a result of emerging evidence that found links between circumcision and decreased risk of urinary tract infections, some kinds of cancer, HPV, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases. Parenting.com: Why one mom decided to circumcise . ""The evidence was becoming clearer, and it's now obvious there's a preventative effect,"" says Dr. Michael Brady, chairman of the department of pediatrics at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, and a member of the AAP task force. The circumcision controversy . Once routine, circumcision rates have been declining since the 1980s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that a little more than half of all infant males are circumcised now, although that figure is likely low since it only counts in-hospital circumcisions. Globally, about 30% of men are circumcised, although rates range drastically from country to country. Passionate opponents of circumcision, who sometimes describe themselves as ""intactivists,"" call the procedure barbaric and liken it to female genital cutting. The internet, and its increasing use as a resource for medical decisions, has helped anti-circumcision groups get their message out. ""We believe that circumcision of children violates numerous legal rights of the child and is highly unethical, if not unlawful,"" said a public notice posted by Doctors Opposing Circumcision in anticipation of the AAP's announcement. Some groups have even tried to make the practice illegal. Activists in San Francisco proposed a measure to ban circumcision, but it was struck down by California Governor Jerry Brown. Courts in Germany recently called circumcision ""grievous bodily harm,"" and ruled that the ""fundamental right of the child to bodily integrity outweighed the fundamental rights of the parents."" Because circumcision is such a sensitive issue, moral or religious concerns might be more important than medical studies to many parents. ""It's a reduction of risk, not an elimination,"" says Brady. ""We recognize some people have very strong personal feelings about this issue, and those should be used in any decision-making."" What the research revealed . Many studies on the benefits of circumcision have been performed in Africa, where, because of the prevalence of HIV and other STDs, the effect can be seen more quickly. The task force found evidence that circumcision has a preventative effect on: . HIV: Studies in Africa and a CDC math model study found that circumcision reduces HIV infection among heterosexual men. Parenting.com: Dad decides not to circumcise his sons . HPV: Another African study found that circumcision reduces the spread of human papillomavirus, some strains of which can cause cervical cancer in women. Other sexually transmitted diseases: A variety of studies suggest that circumcision is linked with decreased risk of contracting syphilis and genital herpes. Urinary Tract Infections: Although still uncommon for boys, UTIs are more common among uncircumcised males in the first year of life. Treatment at this age can be painful and require hospitalization. Penile cancer: An association was found between circumcision and decreased risk of this rare type of cancer. Prostate cancer: A new study suggests that circumcision could be tied to a slightly lower rate of prostate cancer.While critics say circumcision decreases sexual pleasure, there are currently no scientific studies to support this claim. In fact, study participants in Africa who had been circumcised as adults reported either no effect or increased pleasure. Insurance implications . One major impetus for new policy, according to Brady, was to send a message to state lawmakers that circumcision should be an option for all families. Currently, Medicaid programs in 18 states in the U.S. do not provide coverage for routine circumcision of infant boys, and so ""families who could not afford it were having the decision made for them,"" says Brady. In fact, over time, a higher circumcision rate might actually save money. A new study from researchers at Johns Hopkins found that not circumcising would result in an average of $313 per person in related health costs over a lifetime -- an extra $2 billion at current circumcision rates. However, opponents of circumcision may take issue with taxpayer dollars being used to pay for a procedure they find immoral. Despite the AAP's recommendation, universal coverage is unlikely to be a reality any time soon, as states look for ways to cut back. ""I'm concerned 2012 is not the best environment for getting state lawmakers add additional health care costs to Medicaid,"" says Brady. Parenting.com: Our complete guide to circumcision . What to ask your doctor . For many new parents, this is the first medical decision they are making for their child, and it's a tough one. The new policy states that parents should get clear, unbiased information from their OB/GYN or pediatrician during pregnancy, which is when the decision on whether to circumcise is usually made. Brady suggests discussing with your doctor the health benefits and risks, and doing your homework to make sure that if you're considering circumcision, whoever is performing it has been properly trained. It should be performed in a sterile environment with analgesia for pain relief. Parents should be clear on how to care for their newborn's penis, cut or uncut. Then, after talking to your doctor, it's up to you. ""Parents need to make the decision they feel is the best for their child,"" says Brady. ""We don't want to put anyone in a position where they are being told what they have to do."" The new policy statement will be published in the September issue of Pediatrics. It is also endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This article was originally published on Parenting.com: . AAP: Health benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks .

"(CNN) -- Sergio Garcia knows the law well. He has a law degree and passed the California bar exam -- on his first try. Now he wants to practice that law, giving advice and taking on cases. ""I'm fighting for my American dream,"" he said. Wednesday was a landmark day -- his first case before the California Supreme Court. But he's not able to act as a lawyer in front of the justices, because the law he loves is not on his side. Garcia, 36, has been an undocumented immigrant since he was brought to the United States as a child from his native Mexico, and that means he cannot get a law license. It doesn't matter what qualifications he has. It also doesn't matter that he has been approved for a green card since 1995 and has been on the waiting list since. The line for Mexican citizens is so long it could be another six or seven years before his permanent residency is confirmed, he estimated. He has the support of California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who wrote in a brief to the state supreme court last year: ""Admitting Garcia to the bar would be consistent with state and federal policy that encourages immigrants, both documented and undocumented, to contribute to society."" And the state bar wants to admit him. In many ways it seems straightforward: How can someone without legal status become licensed as a lawyer, whose job entails upholding the law? That's the argument made by the Department of Justice in an amicus brief to the court. ""Aliens, including those that lack immigration status, are presumptively ineligible to receive public benefits,"" such as a law license, officials wrote, referring to a 1996 law signed by President Clinton. The argument is that the court is partially funded by the state, and the state cannot fund an undocumented immigrant, so the court may not issue a law license. But Garcia and his supporters believe the issue is not that simple as they make their arguments before the California Supreme Court on Wednesday. In addition to Garcia's lawyer, Jerome Fishkin, James Wagstaffe for the California State Bar, Ross Moody for the Attorney General's office and Tenny Daniel for U.S. Department of Justice appeared in court. The case is being closely watched for the precedent it could set, not just for California, but the nation. The court's decision could affect hundreds of other young professionals in this country seeking a license, according to VÃ­ctor Nieblas, an immigration attorney based in Southern California. Garcia's case has received nationwide attention because of two similar cases in Florida and New York. In Florida, bar admissions candidate and undocumented immigrant Jose Manuel Godinez-Samperio, 26, passed the bar and also couldn't receive his law license. He, along with the Florida Board of Bar Examiners, petitioned the state supreme court in December 2011 for an advisory opinion: ""Are undocumented immigrants eligible for admission to the Florida Bar?"" In New York, City University of New York law graduate Cesar Vargas, 29, who was also brought to the United States illegally as a child, filed an application to practice law in 2012. Vargas has also advocated for a federal DREAM Act and helped launch the DREAM Action Coalition, a political and lobbying voice to help pass federal and state legislation for undocumented youth. All three men have been open about their immigration status. ""Basically all I'm seeking is my law license in California, which I already had but was taken away from me because I'm undocumented,"" Garcia said to CNN en EspaÃ±ol. For about two weeks, Garcia was sworn in as an attorney. Then he received a notice from the state bar that his admission was in error. ""It was very, very hard for me to have to tell my family that the celebration we had meant nothing,"" Garcia said. ""It killed me inside to tell them that I really wasn't a lawyer."" Many undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children qualify for two-year work visas under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but Garcia is too old to be eligible. He qualifies for a green card through his father, who became a lawful permanent resident under the 1986 amnesty law, but is still waiting. ""Immigrants must wait longer if they are from Mexico, India, China or the Philippines, because lots of people from those countries want to immigrate to the U.S., and so demand is greater than supply,"" said Hiroshi Motomura, professor of immigration and citizenship law at the UCLA School of Law, ""This seems superficially fair but I believe it's quite unfair and unequal, because the waiting period can vary so much."" Larry DeSha, former prosecutor for the State Bar of California, said Garcia shouldn't be given his law license because his immigration status would be in violation of a civil immigration statute and could affect his ability to represent his clients. ""If Mr. Garcia works or not is a separate question that deserves independent analysis,"" Nieblas said. Motomura's view is that although undocumented immigrants generally may not be employees, they can be independent contractors. They could take clients as solo practitioners, to work on specific cases or projects, or to have an ongoing relationship as long as they had multiple clients. This ability to work as an independent contractor also means they could do volunteer legal work of certain kinds. The U.S. Constitution guarantees public educational access through high school. Beyond high school there is no constitutional guarantee of access, but traditionally each state can decide to admit undocumented students to its public colleges and universities. Some bar them, some admit them as nonresidents at higher tuition, and some, like California, admit them at resident tuition rates. Motomura said whatever California decides, ""it is a decision that the federal government should and must respect."" The California Supreme Court has up to 90 days to decide on the future of Garcia. If it denies him his law license, he said he is prepared to take his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Should it be legal for an undocumented immigrant to practice law?

"(CNN) -- Radovan Karadzic, whose Interpol charges listed ""flamboyant behavior"" as a distinguishing characteristic, was a practicing psychiatrist who came to be nicknamed the ""Butcher of Bosnia."" Twice indicted in 1995 by the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Karadzic faces charges of genocide over the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, and nine other charges related to ethnic violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. He had filed a motion seeking acquittal on all 11 counts in June, but was successful on only one. While president of the so-called Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Karadzic's troops were reported to have massacred over hundreds of thousands of Muslims and Croats during a campaign of ""ethnic cleansing."" Early estimates of the death toll from the 3-year war ranged up to 300,000, but recent research reduced that to about 100,000. The U.S. State Department had a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. His arrest brings an end to more than 10 years as a fugitive. Karadzic was born on June 19, 1945, in Petnjica, Montenegro. He studied psychiatry and medicine at the University of Sarajevo during the 1960s and took courses in psychiatry and poetry at Columbia University from 1974 to 1975. Karadzic, a Serb-Croat, in 1990 helped found the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS), a party aimed at unifying Serbs into a common state, and became its president. Two years later, he became president of the newly declared Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, later called ""Republika Srpska."" During the next three years, he ordered Bosnian Serb forces to seize the majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He also announced, according to his U.N. indictment, six ""strategic objectives"" for the Serbian people. They included the establishment of state borders between the Serbs and the other two ethnic communities, Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats. Answering to him, according to the indictment, was Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. From May 1992, the indictment alleged, Bosnian Serb forces under Mladic's command targeted civilian areas of Sarajevo with shelling and sniping during a three-year conflict within the city. In July 1995, according to the U.N. indictment, troops under Mladic's command executed an estimated 7,000 Bosnian Muslim male prisoners in Srebrenica, a U.N. safe area, and then participated in a comprehensive effort to conceal the killings. The massacre is considered the worst in Europe since World War II. The indictment states that Bosnian Serb forces acted under Karadzic's direction and worked to ""significantly reduce the Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat and other non-Serb populations"" in municipalities that were seized. Karadzic was last seen in public in September 1996, a year after the Dayton Peace Accords brought a formal end to the conflict and banned anyone accused of war crimes, including him, from office. He reportedly shaved his trademark bushy hair, grew a beard and donned priest's robes, moving from monastery to monastery in the mountains to avoid capture. CNN correspondent Alessio Vinci said in 2008: ""He enjoyed protection from the local population, wherever he was hiding. Legend has it he disguised himself as a priest to take part in his mother's funeral. ""In 2002, after NATO launched one of its many failed raids to try to arrest Karadzic in Bosnia, I interviewed his mother. At that time she said: 'Serbs are righteous people and I can see that they support him, and that they adore him the way he is. They would lose their lives to protect him.'"" Despite years on the run, Karadzic wrote ""Miraculous Chronicles of the Night"" -- 1,200 copies of which sold out at the 2004 Belgrade International Book Fair. After his arrest was announced, Serb officials revealed the final chapter of his life on the run had seen Karadic reprise his medical role, working in a clinic in Belgrade under a false identity and heavily disguised by a white beard, long hair and spectacles.","Radovan Karadzic faces 10 charges, including genocide over the Srebrenica massacre .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- When pictures of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama's multi-colored button down shirt started spreading on the Internet, people around the world cringed. But not Peter Crawfurd and Michael Yang. They saw brilliance. ""Extraordinary,"" said Yang, of Hatoyama's purple, red, yellow, blue and green shirt. ""That's exactly what we see in the Japanese prime minister. Mr. Hatoyama is a great symbol for that. We believe in individuality and people should be able to dress as they want."" And for $500, you can own your own Hatoyama shirt. Crawfurd and Yang, two 26-year-old buddies who met in high school in Denmark, run a build-your-own-shirt business based in China. By build, they mean pick your own fabrics, cuts and colors on their Web site, www.ShirtsMyWay.com. The company claims users can design over 7 trillion different men's dress shirts, by breaking the shirt into components and custom- tailored fits. You pick, they make, and ship it to your door. They said they like very individual fashion choices. Which is why even though they're not the original designers of Hatoyama's shirt, they're launching a replica, a special ""Prime Minister Hatoyama shirt,"" so you, too, can have Hatoyama's every color of the rainbow shirt. They are convinced someone out there really does want it. ""Regardless of what people out there think is fashionable or not, it's one of the bravest moves we've ever seen,"" said Yang. ""We honor his bravery because it takes a brave man to face the world with so many colors, especially a man in his position. We stand behind him 100 percent."" ""There's a lot of integrity in what he's doing,"" added Crawfurd. ""Just because he's prime minister, doesn't mean he loses this part of him."" The entrepreneurs are by no means just looking to honor Japan's leader. They see a business opportunity by coat tailing off the Internet buzz on Hatoyama's bold shirt. But they also think critics are ""too harsh,"" said Yang. ""I don't know what else to say. Yes, too harsh."" The Prime Minister under fire this week, from both outside the political halls of Tokyo and within, after he backed out of a campaign promise to move a disputed U.S. air base off the island of Okinawa. But as tensions in the Korean peninsula and pressure from Washington mounted, the prime minister caved on that campaign promise on Sunday. This week, the political fallout has begun. Members of the opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party, are now calling on him to resign. In Okinawa, it is full-on name calling, with residents saying he is a liar. National polls show his approval ratings are below 30 percent. But outside of Japan, at least two entrepreneurs are cheering him on. They just launched their Hatoyama shirt special Wednesday morning in Asia and say they have already gotten an order. They hope customers will at least want to look like the prime minister, regardless of the political turmoil Hatoyama currently faces.","PM Yukio Hatoyama came under fire for wearing multi-colored shirt .

"(CNN) -- The prospect of competing in the 2012 London Olympics left British rower Mohamed Sbihi with a big dilemma. As a practicing Muslim, Sbihi, who has Moroccan family, should be starting his month-long Ramadan fast on July 21, abstaining from food and water during daylight hours. But it clashes with what should be the pinnacle of his career so far when he competes in the British men's eight at the Olympics on home water. A compromise was needed. ""My faith is really important to me,"" Sbihi said in an interview with CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I make sure I say the first verse of the Koran before every single race, whether it be out loud or in my head. ""I spoke to my family here, spoke to my family back home in Morocco, and at the end of the day I'm making the right decision for me, and that's to postpone my fast."" It isn't only his faith that will inspire him. The devoted Arsenal football fan will also turn to music to fire him up before he races. ""I like to listen to quite violent hip-hop rap kinda of stuff before I get on the water,"" he said. ""I do listen to one song: Eminem feat. Lil Wayne -- No Love."" Football fan . Born in Britain to an English mother and Moroccan father, Sbihi had one sport on his mind when he was 15 -- and it wasn't rowing. Sbihi -- nicknamed ""Moe"" by his friends -- spent as much time as possible on the football pitch, but the visit of British rowing's talent identification scouts to his school in Surbiton persuaded him to try a different pursuit. ""I wasn't really for the idea... I just wanted to play football,"" he said. ""The coach that was testing at the time saw me and said, 'Make sure that boy is there.' I had the raw parameters to be a really successful rower."" That same year, he won Under-15 gold at the British indoor championships and he went on to win bronze in the men's four at the Under-23 World Championships. Hitting the heights . Now the 24-year-old is preparing to compete in his first Olympics -- and he shouldn't be too hard to spot. At six foot eight inches (2.03 meters), Sbihi is the tallest member of the British eight -- although his physique is not unusual in rowing. ""If I wasn't a rower, I'd love to be a basketball player. I love basketball, I love watching it,"" he said. ""And basketball you kind of fit in. It's the same thing with rowing, you just sit here and everyone is tall. And you're like, 'Is this the land of the giants?' "" Size matters . Being the biggest member of a crew is not necessarily an advantage, Sbihi says, so keeping his weight down is crucial. ""When it comes to summer racing I'm the biggest guy -- I can also easily be the heaviest guy. By me being lighter, and keeping the same power, it would be beneficial to the crew."" Gold target . Sbihi moved up to the eight crew in 2010, having raced in the pair and the four at youth level, and Britain looks set to renew its rivalry with Germany at the Games. The British eight finished second behind the dominant Germans at the 2010 and 2011 World Championships. However, Sbihi isn't interested in collecting another silver medal. ""I'm in this to win,"" he said. ""I only want one thing and that is an Olympic medal. I went four years not winning anything and if I just win that gold medal ... I'll be happy. My legacy would be that gold medal."" Britain's rowing legends . If he does win gold, Sbihi will follow in the footsteps of some of the biggest names in British rowing. Steve Redgrave won titles at five successive Olympics, while Matthew Pinsent won four in a row and James Cracknell won gold in the coxless four in 2000 and 2004. ""Pincent, Cracknell and Redgrave they were able to do that for 20 years, 16 years and 12 years,"" Sbihi says. ""That's pretty impressive. It's unimaginable for me to be able to try to better Redgrave.""","British rower Mohamed Sbihi was born in Britain and has a Moroccan father .

"(CNN) -- Police dropped assault and harassment charges against a man who Lindsay Lohan said choked her during a scuffle over cell phone photos early Sunday, a New York Police Department official said. Instead, Christian LaBella, 25, and Lohan, 26, filed harassment claims against each other. ""Cross complaints for harassment were filed and LaBella's assault arrest was voided after detectives investigated further,"" NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. The incident happened in a guest room at New York's Union Square W Hotel at 5 a.m., according to a police official who did not want to be named. Lohan said she and three other friends -- another woman and two men, including LaBella -- went to the room after a night of partying at a nightclub, another police source said. From there, the accounts differ. Lohan told police she asked LaBella to borrow his cell phone because her battery died, and then discovered photos he took of her at the nightclub, the source said. LaBella told police Lohan took his phone without permission and refused to give it back. When she refused to return the phone, Lohan told police that LaBella pushed her onto the bed and she suffered scratches, the source added. Lohan said she then ran out of the room and into the stairwell with LaBella in pursuit, according to the source. She accused LaBella of choking her during the struggle for the phone, the source said. Police, who responded to a fire alarm that officers said had been pulled by Lohan, arrested LaBella on two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment based on Lohan's description of what happened. Those charges were dropped when investigators decided there was not enough evidence to support them. Both Lohan and LaBella could have difficulty pursuing competing civil claims, a police source said. LaBella could argue she took his phone without permission, and Lohan can argue he attacked her, the source explained. Lohan did not seek medical treatment, the source added. ""While she did sustain some injuries, she was not hospitalized,"" Lohan publicist Steve Honig said. Police will have no further involvement in the case. Lohan, who is on unsupervised probation for a shoplifting conviction, moved to New York this summer following a series of late-night controversies in Los Angeles. LaBella told police he is a clerical worker from Valley Village, a suburb of Los Angeles. A spokesman for U.S. Rep. John Shimkus confirmed to CNN that LaBella is an employee in the Illinois congressman's Washington office. ""Obviously, the congressman does not condone his actions,"" said Shimkus spokesman Steve Tomaszewski, declining to comment further. NYPD releases video of Lohan traffic incident .

"(CNN) -- Even as anti-American violence eased Saturday around the Muslim world, tensions remained high -- stoked, in some nations, by the prospect of U.S. troops arriving to protect U.S. diplomatic missions. The widespread protests connected to an online trailer for an inflammatory anti-Islam film privately produced in the United States were relatively thin and calm, and in some places nonexistent, on Saturday compared to earlier in the week. Yet even with this relative break, the furor has not gone away completely, nor has concern over safety and security at U.S. embassies. To that end, U.S. officials said earlier this week that Marine teams would be dispatched to protect U.S. diplomatic missions in Libya, Yemen and Sudan in the wake of anti-Western unrest in those countries. But U.S. troops haven't necessarily been welcomed. Clinton demands Arab Spring nations protect embassies . Yemen's parliament issued a statement early Sunday demanding U.S. Marines leave the Arab country immediately, calling the presence of any foreign forces -- and U.S. troops in particular -- ""unacceptable."" Some leading politicians, like Ahmed al-Bahri of the opposition Haq party, warned that even a few dozen American troops could ""open the doors of hell for Yemen and give terrorists an excuse."" Others like Abdul Majid al-Zindani, president of Yemen's Cleric Committee, equated the U.S. troops arrival to a foreign occupation. Zaid al-Thari, a political adviser to Yemen's ruling General People's Congress, speculated that the U.S. Marines recent arrival raises doubts about who was behind this week's attacks on the U.S. embassy in Sanaa that left four protesters dead. ""In the end of the day, the United States is benefiting more than all and was able to bring its forces inside Yemen,"" said al-Thari. Even with the arrival of its troops, the U.S. government isn't taking chances in Yemen -- closing its embassy in Sanaa through Saturday, September 29, because of the threat of ""potential demonstrations,"" according to the State Department. Meanwhile, U.S. Marines that were to travel to Sudan have returned pending further talks with the government there, a U.S. official said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Saturday that Washington has requested ""additional security precautions"" in Sudan, whose government ""has recommitted itself both publicly and privately to continue to protect our (diplomatic) mission."" Sudan's foreign ministry turned down a U.S. request to send ""special forces"" to protect its embassy in Khartoum, saying Sudanese security forces would protect ""the diplomatic missions (and) its guests,"" according to a report from the state-run Sudan News Agency. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has warned the United States will act to protect its diplomatic facilities if countries in question did not prevent violence and seek justice for attacks. What the Mideast protests reveal . ""Reasonable people and responsible leaders ... need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts,"" she said Friday. ""And we will ... keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world."" In Egypt, where violent protests began in earnest last Tuesday and continued to rage for days, government officials have recently criticized violence targeting the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and promised to protect it. Notably, too, the thousands who participated in these demonstrations represent a fraction of the roughly 11 million people in the Egyptian capital. Still, statements from the Muslim Brotherhood -- the Islamist group that controls parliament and whose former leader of its political party, Mohammed Morsy, is now Egypt's president -- that are in English differ from those in Arabic, which tend to be less sympathetic to diplomatic missions and focus more on the inflammatory ""Innocence of Muslims"" video. And anti-American sentiments remain high in certain places, as was evident at a protest outside a mosque Friday. Those participating accused the United States of supporting ""international terror"" and being an ""enemy of God,"" with some chanting, ""Obama, there are a million Osamas."" ""Relations between countries of the so-called Arab Spring and the West have not yet taken complete shape,"" saying this is especially true with Egypt, Prime Minister Hesham Kandil said Saturday, according to the state-run MENA news agency. On the ground Saturday night, there was a marked change in Cairo -- as relatively calm returned to the area around the U.S. embassy for the first time in nearly a week. Earlier in the day, Egyptian security forces pushed protesters away from the embassy toward Tahrir Square, where they were eventually dispersed. Calm returns to Cairo . That gave workers the chance to finally clean the debris-ridden streets, business owners to assess the damage, and drivers to start moving against -- all under the watchful eye of hundreds of Egyptian riot police, who remained in the area. The most heated demonstrations Saturday occurred not in the Middle East, ironically, but in a staunch United States' ally, Australia. Carrying signs that read ""Obama, Obama, we like Osama"" and ""Behead all those who insult the prophet,"" hundreds gathered on the steps of the U.S. consulate in Sydney. The demonstration turned violent when authorities -- using tear gas and police dogs -- tried to push protesters away from the building. They were met with thrown bottles and shoes, the latter act considered a grave insult among Muslims. Six police officers were injured and eight people were arrested, Sydney police said. Seventeen people were treated for effects of pepper spray used by police. Here's a breakdown of other developments Saturday from around the globe tied to furor over the anti-Islam film and related violence: . -- Kandil, Egypt's prime minister, said Saturday that his government has reliable information ""a number"" of people admitted to getting money to protest outside the U.S. embassy in Cairo, while noting other demonstrators were genuine and not paid. -- Four protesters died and 49 were wounded during an attack Friday on the U.S. Embassy in the Tunisian capital of Tunis, the state-run Tunisian News Agency reported Saturday, citing Charles Nicolle Hospital interim general director Souad Sadraoui. Interim Tunisian President Al-Munsif Al-Marzouki said late Friday on state-run TV that two were dead and more than 20 were injured, but authorities later hinted the death toll could rise. -- All nonemergency personnel and relatives of State Department personnel at U.S. missions in Khartoum, Sudan, and Tunis, Tunisia, have been ordered to leave and travel warnings have been issued for American citizens for both those nations, Nuland from the U.S. State Department said Saturday. -- In his weekly address, U.S. President Barack Obama urged Americans not to stereotype all those in the Muslim world. ""Let us never forger that for every angry mob, there are millions who yearn for the freedom and dignity and hope that our flag represents,"" he said. -- FBI investigators probing Tuesday's killings of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi put off a visit to Libya until conditions are safer. Agents had hoped to arrive in the North African nation Saturday, federal law enforcement officials said. -- Libyan authorities said they are cooperating with U.S. investigators. ""Things are moving very, very well,"" said Muhammad Alkari, a spokesman in the prime minister's office. Disagreement over how Benghazi attack began . -- In Egypt's northern Sinai Peninsula, a large number of security forces backed by tanks on Saturday regained control of a base housing an international peacekeeping force that was breached a day earlier by Islamist militants, state-run EGYnews reported. Egyptian security forces, including the military, have been fighting militants in Sinai since August after 16 border guards died in an attack by Islamist militants. U.S. intelligence warned Embassy in Egypt about anti-Muslim film . -- In Afghanistan, the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack on a joint U.S.-British base in Helmand province that left two troops dead, saying the attack was in response to the film. The attack follows a call by the Taliban on its fighters to take revenge for the film by increasing assaults on NATO troops. -- In Sudan's capital, Khartoum, the German and British embassies shored up their security after protesters managed to get inside a compound that is shared by both diplomatic missions, according to the foreign ministers of both nations. -- The man behind the ""Innocence of Muslims"" video, identified as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, was willingly interviewed early Saturday by a federal probation officer, said Steve Whitmore of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The questioning came hours after federal officials said they were reviewing Nakoula's probation in connection with a 2010 bank fraud conviction. -- The Council on American-Islamic Relations said Saturday it had released a video appeal to those protesting the movie. A message in Arabic tells viewers in the Middle East that ""ordinary Americans and the U.S. government should not be blamed for the religious hatred expressed in the film,"" the group said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- To date, Britain has avoided the politicized and polarized abortion debate that is so prevalent in the U.S. Traditionally, our political parties have seen abortion as a 'private' matter of personal and public 'health' and not a matter of rights. The law gives women no 'right' to abortion as in most Western democracies -- but, if two doctors certify that it's best for her health and well-being and the pregnancy is less than 24 weeks gestation, abortion is a legal option. Most people support this. We want people to be able to plan their families and to support and be responsible for their children, yet we know contraception sometimes fails and people fail to use it. Abortion, as a back up to birth control, is generally seen as regrettable, but a fact of life. Even in Northern Ireland, where abortion remains illegal, it's accepted that women travel to the mainland. I am stunned when I talk with American colleagues about the violence and intimidation that their abortion doctors face. For them, a typical protest is several hundred strong -- for us a large protest is sometimes several dozen protesters, but more typically it is just several individuals. But, small as our protests are, they upset and disrupt women seeking safe and legal care from legitimate pregnancy advisory services. In recent weeks the Bedford Square clinic of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (bpas), close to London's Oxford Street, has been the focus of a Lent-long 40 days for Life vigil. It is a 'mini-me' version of U.S. campaigns. Women attending the clinic face a gathering of people praying for them to reject abortion. They are handed leaflets with fanciful claims about how abortion will raise their risk of cancer and mental illness. They are shown 'life-size' models of their unborn baby and subjected to 'pavement counselling' to encourage them to 'choose life.' For the present at least, women are no longer tormented with 'gifts' of little knitted baby bootees, a feature of some previous vigils. The problem with the protests is this: the protesters oppose abortion in principle -- but their actions are against women who want to consider abortion -- not in principle -- but as a private medical solution to a personal, individual problem. Women attend our clinics for care or counseling because they need help. They do not come to demonstrate support for abortion. The protesters should leave them alone, to deal with their problems privately with those they have chosen to seek help from. As the main abortion provider in Britain, bpas is not shy of debate. Public education is part of our job and seeing more than 60,000 women with problem pregnancies each year puts us in a good position to explain what these women want and need. Of course, society should debate the rights and wrongs of abortion. There are places for that and persons who are ready and willing to engage with the issues. Outside a clinic is the wrong place, and women in immediate need of care are the wrong audience. The protesters have allies in the UK Parliament to voice their concerns. They have no need spend 40 days in the cold plaguing women. It is my job to answer for what bpas does, and I could not be more proud of the charity, its staff and its work. Bpas really is 'genuinely' pro-choice. Part of our charitable mission is to alleviate distress in relation to fertility by providing advice, treatment and assistance. In the past we have provided infertility care as well as abortion -- and we hope to do so in the future. One marvelous response to the protests was that some complete stranger to bpas set up a website encouraging support for us. The comments posted speak volumes. Those who accuse us of running 'abortion mills' should ponder this comment by 'S' on March 17, 2012: ""Your advice and support helped me decide the right thing to do was keep my baby. Being able to talk through my choices without judgment was undoubtedly the most important part of that process. Long may you be able to support other women like me."" When a woman comes to us with a 'problem pregnancy,' if she is undecided, our first aim is to help her to make the decision that she feels is right for her. We may not be able to make her feel 'happy' about her decision; she may choose what seems the 'least worst' option -- but the decision will have been hers. This is what the protesters, who stand with their banners or lurk around our clinic entrances soliciting the attention of women approaching our doors, refuse to understand. They boast of the occasional woman they 'turn away' -- but refuse to accept that thousands of 'bpas clients' decide against abortion in any case. And we are glad when they are satisfied with that decision just as we are glad when a woman is satisfied with her abortion decision. That is what it means to be pro-choice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ann Furedi .","Abortion is a legal option in the UK if doctors agree .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the sport of wrestling, longtime adversaries Iran and the United States are friendly enemies. Andy Hrovat, right, seen wrestling Reineris Salas of Cuba, is among the U.S. wrestlers touring this winter. A U.S. freestyle men's wrestling team will go to the Islamic republic -- where the sport is widely popular -- for a prestigious tournament in March. Nine American wrestlers will take part in the Takhti Cup competition, scheduled for March 12-13, according to state Iranian media and USA Wrestling -- the national governing body for Olympics wrestling in the United States. ""In Iran, wrestling and soccer are the two major sports,"" said Gary Abbott, director of communications for USA Wrestling in Colorado Springs, Colorado. ""They know their wrestling as well as anyone in the world. They treat our athletes like kings."" Relations between the United States and Iran ended after Iranian militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held Americans hostage there for 444 days. More recently, the two countries have been at odds over Iran's nuclear ambitions and have been sharply critical of each other's policies and actions in the Middle East. But Abbott said there has been a history of U.S. and Iranian wrestling exchanges despite the politics. Both sides are always looking for opportunities to compete. Abbott said Iran is one of the top wrestling powers in the world, along with countries such as the United States, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. Competing in a wrestling-crazy society like Iran is special to Americans, who look forward to getting on the mats before large crowds in sold-out arenas. ""For the common citizen, an American wrestler in Iran is like Michael Jordan going over there,"" Abbott said, referring to the world-famous American basketball legend. USA Wrestling said the trip is one of several overseas events this winter for American wrestlers. U.S. teams also will also be competing in Russia, Ukraine, Sweden, Cuba, Bulgaria, Belarus, Turkey, Serbia, Hungary and Slovenia. The team going to Iran includes four men who have represented the United States in the Olympics.","Longtime adversaries Iran and the United States are friendly enemies on the mat .

"(CNN) -- In baseball-crazy Japan, where players are treated as celebrities, Yu Darvish is a superstar. A new giant of the game? The 6ft 5 in Yu Darvish could soon be thrown a deal into the big time of MLB. He's been called the greatest pitcher in the country, but the relaxed 23-year-old takes any pressure that comes his way, on and off the field, in his substantial stride. Standing 6 feet 5 inches (196 centimeters) he immediately stands out from most other players in the game and has added some extra color to the sport, as well as some peerless pitching. ""I don't really feel that much pressure,"" he told CNN. ""Instead, I'm just happy to play the game here. I have a pride in being a baseball player. With poor results, I would feel responsible for it and feel embarrassed. I don't want to become like that. So setting high standards for myself doesn't cause frustrations."" He joined the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters straight after High School where he had been identified as the most promising player for many years. He was almost immediately thrust into the media spotlight as an 18-year-old when he was photographed smoking a cigarette in a pachinko parlor. The media outcry that followed would have been comparable to a U.S. Major League player caught in a doping scandal. With an Iranian father and Japanese mother, Darvish had a different upbringing from most of his schoolmates. ""I grew up in a different environment from the typical Japanese family,"" Darvish said. ""Compared to them, we had quite different life. But my parents gave me the great influences and I am very grateful for that."" He remains in contact with his family heritage in Iran, organizing games in the country and sending over kits to youth teams. He has also helped to set up the Yu Darvish Water Fund to help provide clean water to communities in developing countries. But mostly for Darvish, ""it's baseball all the time."" He practices every day, even on days off, and has no problem living and breathing baseball. ""Baseball is a game where you can never predict what will happen next,"" he said. ""With great players, the sport creates drama. If you come to the stadium, you will soon understand how exciting baseball is. I wish everyone could see a game in Japan."" Japanese baseball players are expected to lead an exemplary life off the field, and while Darvish was never the enfant-terrible of the game, he believes that marriage to actress Saeko in 2007 has had a particularly positive effect on his life and his game. ""My lifestyle became more stable after the marriage. Marriage gave me many positive influences. If I'm in a tight spot on the mound, I think of my wife and I think how sad she will be if I am batted down. This helps me to throw better,"" he said. He maintains he's happy playing in Japan, but he could be the next big thing from Japan to hit the U.S. Major League. Rumors have circulated that the likes of the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox are willing to pay the Fighters millions of dollars just to talk about the prospect of signing him. The unflappable Darvish refuses to play up the attention coming his way from the other side of the Pacific. ""Ichiro Suzuki, Hideki Matsui, Daisuke Matsuzaka and all the other Japanese players are doing a great job in the States. They really encourage me to become a better player. But I don't particularly dream of playing in the major league or in the states now."" But if he produces more stellar performances he may well be living that dream, sooner rather than later.","23-year-old has been feted as the best pitcher in Japan and has celebrity status .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A rarely seen portrait of Michael Jackson is on display inside a Harlem luxury car dealership. Macky Dancy, a partner at Dancy-Power Automotive, said the oil painting titled ""The Book"" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat. The oil painting titled ""The Book"" is on display at Dancy-Power Automotive in Harlem, New York. A different portrait of the entertainer was among items auctioned from his Neverland Ranch in April. It is not clear whether Jackson sat for that painting. The painting on display in Harlem belongs to Marty Abrams, a friend and customer of the owners of the high-profile dealership. The 40-inch by 50-inch portrait, by Australian painter Brett Livingstone-Strong, sold for $2.1 million in 1990. Abrams acquired it as part of an unrelated business deal in 1992 and had it stored. The painting shows Jackson sitting in Renaissance-era clothes and holding a book. Jackson sat for the portrait because he was a friend of Livingstone-Strong's. The painting was unveiled at the Dancy-Power Automotive Group showroom on Thursday but was removed Friday because of crowd concerns. It returned to the showroom floor Monday morning. Dancy said the painting's owner chose the showroom because it's near the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where the Jackson 5 won their first taste of fame by winning Amateur Night in 1967. He said Abrams hopes the painting in some way can raise money for charities in the Harlem neighborhood. Dancy said Abrams is not necessarily interested in selling the portrait. When news broke about the resurfacing of the painting, Dancy said, he received a phone call from representatives of Livingstone-Strong, the artist. Now, Dancy said, ""We are in the middle of possibly putting together the artist with the painting again. Maybe for some auctions or charitable shows or something of the sort."" The showroom features Rolls-Royces, Ferraris and other pricey cars and is famous for its celebrity clientele.","Oil painting said to be the only portrait for which Michael Jackson sat .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- When you see people at the office using such Internet sites as Facebook and MySpace, you might suspect those workers are slacking off. A social-networking site for the world of spying officially launches for the U.S. intelligence community this month. But that's not the case at the CIA, the FBI and the National Security Agency, where bosses are encouraging their staff members to use a new social-networking site designed for the super-secret world of spying. ""It's every bit Facebook and YouTube for spies, but it's much, much more,"" said Michael Wertheimer, assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analysis. The program is called A-Space, and it's a social-networking site for analysts within the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies. Instead of posting thoughts about the new Avenged Sevenfold album or Jessica Alba movie, CIA analysts could use A-Space to share information and opinion about al Qaeda movements in the Middle East or Russian naval maneuvers in the Black Sea. The new A-Space site has been undergoing testing for months and launches officially for the nation's entire intelligence community September 22. ""It's a place where not only spies can meet but share data they've never been able to share before,"" Wertheimer said. ""This is going to give them for the first time a chance to think out loud, think in public amongst their peers, under the protection of an A-Space umbrella."" Wertheimer demonstrated the program to CNN to show how analysts will use it to collaborate. ""One perfect example is if Osama bin Laden comes out with a new video. How is that video obtained? Where are the very sensitive secret sources we may have to put into a context that's not apparent to the rest of the world?"" Wertheimer asked. ""In the past, whoever captured that video or captured information about the video kept it in-house. It's highly classified, because it has so very short a shelf life. That information is considered critical to our understanding."" The goal of A-Space, like intelligence analysis in general, is to protect the United States by assessing all the information available to the spy agencies. Missing crucial data can have enormous implications, such as an FBI agent who sent an e-mail before September 11, 2001, warning of people learning to fly airplanes but not learning to land them. ""There was the question, 'Was that a dot that failed to connect?' Well, that person did this via e-mail,"" Wertheimer said. ""A-Space is the kind of place where you can log that observation and know that your fellow analysts can see that."" Even though Facebook, MySpace and other social-networking sites that inspired A-Space are predominantly the domain of young people, there apparently is no such generational divide on A-Space. ""We have found that participation in A-Space crosses every conceivable age line and experience line. People are excited, no matter what age group,"" Wertheimer said. Of course, the material on A-Space is highly classified, so it won't be available for the public. Only intelligence personnel with the proper security clearance, and a reason to be examining particular information, can access the site. The creators of A-Space do not want it to be used by some future double agent such as Jonathan Pollard or Robert Hanssen to steal America's 21st-century secrets. ""We're building [a] mechanism to alert that behavior. We call that, for lack of a better term, the MasterCard, where someone is using their credit card in a way they've never used it before, and it alerts so that maybe that credit card has been stolen,"" Wertheimer said. ""Same thing here. We're going to actually do patterns on the way people use A-Space."" Yes, analysts can collect friends on A-Space the way people can on Facebook. But nobody outside the intelligence community will ever know -- because they're secret. CNN's Barbara Starr and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","U.S. intelligence agencies are urging staffers to use a new social-networking site .

"(CNN) -- Air-raid sirens haunted the night sky. It was March 11 1941 and the Luftwaffe was on the attack. There was fear, panic, death and ruin. The northern English town of Manchester was under siege; Old Trafford was under siege. With each bomb that fell upon the old stadium -- home to one of the world's most iconic clubs Manchester Untied -- a piece of James Gibson's heart was shattered. The man who had built United up from financial ruin was left facing the destruction of a decade of hard work. The grandstand was obliterated, the stadium left for ruin like an ancient battleground. This was not the Theatre of Dreams, but the Theatre of Shattered Dreams. Dying embers . Mention United and talk inevitably turns to the club's Â£1.4 billion value, the longevity of its remarkable manager Alex Ferguson, players like Ryan Giggs and Robin van Persie, or their American owners -- the Glazers. Sculptor shows softer side of formidable Ferguson . But if it had not been for Gibson, it is unlikely there would be the United we know today. There would be no 19 league titles or three European Cups. The likes of George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton would never have pulled on the red and white. The ""Busby Babes"" would have never existed. The youth set-up, which produced such gems as Duncan Edwards, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, would never have come to fruition. The rivalry between United and Sunday's opponent Liverpool would never have been fashioned. 'The Gibson Guarantee' Even by the times the Lutfwaffe flew over Manchester, Gibson had already resuscitated an ailing giant. It was on December 19th 1931 that Gibson took on a club crippled by debt and financial neglect after the the Wall Street Crash and the death of a benefactor had left United on the brink of collapse. On that fateful day, Walter Crickmer, the club secretary, went cap in hand to Gibson, a man who had made his money supplying uniforms for tram workers. Ferguson's 25th anniversary . An avid football fan, Gibson handed over $165,000 in today's money, allowing the club to appease its debtors, pay staff and players and provide a large Christmas Turkey for families of employees. It was to go down in history as ""the Gibson Guarantee"". ""My great-uncle was such a kind, generous and lovely man,"" said Alan Embling, who has organized an exhibition in Gibson's honor in Manchester. ""He was the kind of man who would have given somebody the shirt off his own back if they had really needed it. ""He would do anything to help anybody and it's a real honor for me to have been related to such a man. ""Unfortunately, a lot of the history books about United have glossed over what he did, which is a real shame."" What Gibson did -- as chairman and president of the club -- was invest heavily in the club, wiping away huge debts and appoint the club's first Scottish manager -- Scott Duncan. Together, they ensured United survived relegation to English football's third tier in 1934, allowing them to tackle debts which would be valued at an estimated $1.4 million today. ""My great uncle knew that the only way to solve the money crisis was to get more people into games,"" added Embling. ""In those days there was no sponsorship, there was no merchandising. It was all about the pitter-patter of feet on the terraces. ""That's why he did so much to make it easier for fans to get to games. He understood what they wanted."" Youth Academy . Gibson realized the importance of community and the impact the club could have on it. He negotiated with the local railways for steps to be built from the platform at the nearby train station to lead to the stadium, while he also arranged for trains to make unscheduled stops on their way to London. It helped attendances rise and encouraged those without the luxury of a car to make the trip to Old Trafford. Today, a red plaque still shines upon the railway bridge on Sir Matt Busby Way with Gibson's name enshrined. Even more crucial was the establishment of the club's youth academy, which was set up during the 1936/37 season. With little money to invest in players, Gibson was determined to find talent within the local area which would help improve United's fortunes on the pitch. It was to prove a masterstroke. The youth team won the Chorlton Amateur League in 1939, scoring a remarkable 223 goals in the process. It laid the foundations for generations of young talent which would go and bring success for many a year to come. But on that fateful March night, as German bombers blitzed Old Trafford, all Gibson's hard work was undone. Football's most poisonous rivalry? With the stadium all but destroyed, United were effectively homeless and the club's future was once again hanging by a thread. Gibson moved quickly, arranging a deal for United to play its home matches at Maine Road, home of local neigbor, Manchester City. But with rules in place which required a license to be granted by the government for rebuilding work, it took seven years for Gibson to get started on restoring Old Trafford. Tragedy . It was not until 1948 that Gibson truly began to see the fruits of his labor. With the renovations and repairs starting at Old Trafford and the arrival of Matt Busby as manager, the club began to excel. In the two years following the end of the war, United had finished second in the league on both occasions and in 1948 the club reached the FA Cup final . Great Scot! Why Scottish coaches rule . Under Busby, who had been appointed by Gibson despite having no previous managerial experience, the team went on to achieve greatness. With its last FA Cup victory having come in 1909, Busby's team faced a Blackpool side boasting the great talents of Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen. It was a day that Gibson had dreamed of. The likes of Johnny Morris, Jack Rowley, Stan Person and Charlie Mitten, all of whom had grown up around the streets of Manchester, were ushering in a new era of success. Tragically just hours before Gibson was set to make the trip down to Wembley he suffered a stroke. Perhaps that helped motivate the players as they claimed a 4-2 win and the team took a detour on the way home to visit their stricken owner. It was there that they left the FA Cup, for Old Trafford had not been finished yet. ""It was a wonderful gesture for the players to come and see him,"" recalls Embling. ""I remember that they kept the FA Cup in the spare bedroom. There were a lot of spare bedrooms, but I'll never forget it. ""There was nowhere to keep it as Old Trafford was still being renovated and I'll never forget my aunt taking me into the bedroom and opening the wardrobe. ""I was only a young boy and I had my paws on the FA Cup. I know it wasn't the original but even still, it was amazing."" Pride . While United returned to playing at Old Trafford in August 1949, Gibson lived just another two years until he suffered another stroke, passing away in September 1951. Just months later, United won the league title for the first time in 40 years. During his lifetime, it is estimated that Gibson invested around $3.3 million in today's value, while both his wife, Lillian and son, Alan, also went on to serve the club's board for years to come. Gibson's family will attend Sunday's game against Liverpool, sitting in the same stadium which would have faded into the abyss had it not been for the dreams and determination of one man. From the seeds sown by Gibson, United would go on to flourish with European Cups, FA Cups and league titles galore thanks to the work of Busby and later, Ferguson. Busby, who survived the tragedy of the Munich air disaster where seven United players were among the 21 people killed, cheated death to help restore the club once again. Under Busby, United would go on to great triumphs, triumphs of which Gibson would have been so proud. The story of James W Gibson will be told in an exhibition at Hale Library, Leigh Road, Hale, January 14-21.","James Gibson is the man credited with saving Manchester United from financial ruin .

"Washington (CNN) -- Troubling questions over Georgia's controversial death penalty system will remain unresolved for now, after the Supreme Court declined Monday to review an appeal from a death-row inmate who received unwanted help from state prosecutors on his legal representation. The justices without comment rejected Jamie Ryan Weis' request for relief. He says he sat in jail for years after the state ran out of money to pay for his lawyers. Weis said prosecutors then suggested that a judge appoint two public defenders, even offering the names of two overworked and inexperienced attorneys who did not want the job. Weis' current legal team calls that a blatant conflict of interest. At issue is whether Weis' constitutional right to a speedy trial and competent defense were short-circuited by an ongoing budget shortfall. Dozens of other inmates who lack financial resources to afford their own attorneys have made similar accusations. The Georgia Supreme Court concluded the indigent defense system was functioning adequately, if not perfectly. The state justices also said Weis was partly to blame for the delays because of his unwillingness to work with his legal team, and should have accepted the public defenders. The state has said he was never without legal representation. Weis was convicted in the 2006 murder of Catherine King during a robbery. Two private attorneys were originally named to represent him, but a lack of funding forced a judge to instead appoint the two public defenders. The new legal defense team later tried three times to withdraw, citing a bursting caseload, a lack of experience handing a capital case, and a lack of money to hire investigators to prove Weis' claimed innocence. His current lawyers, from the Southern Center for Human Rights, say Weis has suffered greatly behind bars because of the long appeal process. He has reportedly tried to commit suicide three times. Georgia revised its system by creating a taxpayer-funded public defender system in 2003, and an office to deal just with death penalty cases, which generally undergo greater judicial scrutiny and take longer to work their way through the courts. But problems in the program popped up almost instantly, exacerbated by the high-profile prosecution of Brian Nichols, who was convicted of escaping from a prison cell and killing a judge and three others in an Atlanta courthouse in 2005. That case ate up $3 million in state funds, nearly draining the new office's budget. Another $30 million raised from court fees and fines was diverted by the state legislature to a general fund, creating more budget uncertainty for the defender office. The U.S. Supreme Court in recent years has taken a close look at Georgia's capital punishment procedures. Now-retired Justice John Paul Stevens in 2008 slammed the state's high court for an ""utterly perfunctory"" review of a death penalty case. The justices last year also ordered a federal court to review whether Troy Davis received a fair hearing. He was convicted of murdering a Savannah police officer in 1989, but has earned high-profile support from those who claim the state has repeatedly refused to examine new evidence showing he may be innocent of the crime. State and federal courts have repeatedly rejected his claims. That case could again be back on the Supreme Court's radar in coming months. The case rejected Monday is Weis v. Georgia (09-10715).","The case involves an inmate's complaint of trial delay due to a budget shortfall .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo underlined just why Real Madrid agreed to pay him the big bucks on a scintillating evening of European football. The 28-year-old, who inked a new five-year deal with the Spanish club on Sunday, completed a brilliant hat trick as Real raced to a 6-1 rout against Galatasaray. Ronaldo had the final say in Istanbul as he danced past three defenders before blasting the ball into the net for his hat-trick. Summer signing Isco had got Los Blancos off the mark when he picked up a long ball hit from beyond the halfway line by Angel di Maria and hit home after 33 minutes. From then on it was one way traffic as Karim Benzema and Ronaldo added two goals apiece before Umut Bulut pulled one back for the Turkish champions. The away victory saw the nine time European champions kick off a new era of European football under manager Carlo Ancelotti in some style. A pulsating opening round of Champions League group matches featured a flurry of firsts. Former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola safely negotiated his first match in charge of Bayern Munich's title defence with an emphatic 3-0 win over CSKA Moscow. David Alaba hit home a dipping free kick to set the Germans on their way before Mario Mandzukic powered in a header in a dominant first half. Arjen Robben volleyed in a scooped pass from Alaba to tick off a first European win for Guardiola and his defending champions. David Moyes also came through his first game as Manchester United manager unscathed as the club made its first European outing without Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm since 1985. Wayne Rooney -- wearing a thick headband to protect an injury - set United on their way as he bundled home Patrice Evra's cross after 22 minutes. Bayer Leverkusen leveled the match at Old Trafford in the second half thanks to Simon Rolfes. But the German side's relief was short lived as, just five minutes later, Robin van Persie scissor kicked the ball into the net to put United back in front. Moyes watched Rooney -- the star striker he sold to United from Everton in 2004 -- pounce again with his 200th goal for Manchester United. The 27 year old coolly slotted in a low drive to become only the fourth player in the club's history to reach the landmark. United poured forward on the break with some brilliant flowing play that was finished off with a fourth goal from Antonio Valencia. With two minutes on the clock, Omer Toprak pulled back another away goal for Leverkusen but United came off the pitch 4-2 winners in the Group A clash. In the Czech Republic, Manchester City recovered from a tentative start to cruise to a 3-0 away win against FC Viktoria Plzen. New City boss Manuel Pellegrini led Malaga to the Champions League quarter finals last season and was looking for a positive display from his new charges. Edin Dzeko broke the deadlock after half time when he slotted home a pass from Sergio Aguero, who used his muscle to hold off the Czech defence. Yolo Toure conjured a curling goal from nowhere to double City's advantage before Aguero finally got on the score sheet to complete a pleasing away win. Paris St Germain also earned a 4-1 win away at Olympiakos while Italians Juventus were held to a 1-1 draw by FC Copenhagen.","Cristiano Ronaldo sinks a hat trick as Real Madrid beat Galatasaray 6-1 .

"(CNN) -- Nigerian police have arrested a man claiming to be Boko Haram's ""chief butcher"" in an area identified as the Balmo Forest of northeastern Nigeria. Detectives arrested Mohammed Zakari, 30, as he fled from what police and the military describe as an intensive counterinsurgency sweep in the area. Zakari is accused in connection with the deaths of seven people, including women and children, according to Nigerian police. He is also accused of taking part in an April attack against Nigerian customs officers in Kari, police say. Boko Haram is a fundamentalist Islamic militant group based in northern Nigeria whose name translates as ""Western education is forbidden."" Its members are accused in dozens of brutal attacks against Nigerian government offices, churches and schools since 2009. Human Rights Watch said Tuesday the group is responsible for at least 2,053 civilian deaths in 2014. The group based its account on media reports and field investigations. ""Boko Haram is effectively waging war on the people of northeastern Nigeria at a staggering human cost,"" said Human Rights Watch West Africa Director Corinne Dufka. Malala to Boko Haram: Stop misusing Islam . In May, the group abducted more than 200 girls from a boarding school in the town of Chibok, setting off worldwide condemnation of the group and prompting Western nations to send troops and aid to the region to help with the search for the missing girls. Last month, Boko Haram militants held residents in the village of Kummabza hostage for four days, abducting more than 60 females and killing 30 men. The women later escaped when militants left them alone in a camp while they battled Nigerian soldiers. Nigerian troops have been conducting intensive efforts against the group in northeastern Nigeria for days, according to government statements and Nigerian media reports. The military said it has routed terrorists from the Balmo Forest region and uncovered weapons caches as well as uniforms worn by Nigerian security services, according to Nigeria's Ministry of Defence. Some of the suspected terrorists captured during the raid are ""volunteering information linking the activities in the forest with other terrorist activities in the country,"" the Defence Ministry said in a statement.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- The stands around the boxing ring were mostly empty and the bout was a mere three-round exhibition fight, but Dlandy Regalado Ajete battled as if a title was on the line. ""If you want to be a great boxer in Cuba,"" he said, moments after being declared the winner, ""you have to be willing to work hard and sacrifice."" Regalado's drive isn't unique for Cuba. Boxing, along with baseball, is a passion that runs deep for many of the island's 11 million inhabitants. And despite Cuba's small population, the country has been a consistent force to be reckoned with at the Olympic Games, winning 32 gold medals in the sport. Three of those golds went to Cuban boxing legend Teofilo Stevenson. Now 60 years old, Stevenson has lost the quickness in his step and he carries the scars of years of battle in the ring. But his eyes still light up when he discusses the sport that made him a household name around the world. ""Cubans like to box because of our temperament,"" Stevenson said, with a smile creeping across his lips. ""Because of our idiosyncrasies and because we have needed to know how to defend ourselves."" After the 1950s Cuban revolution, boxing was briefly banned by the country's new leaders. But then -- like all sports-- it fell under the control of the government. Today that remains the case as there are no professional sports in Cuba. In the 1960s, boxing trainers -- many of them Soviet -- were brought into work with fledgling talent such as Stevenson. Cuban boxers' amateur status let them compete in the Olympics, but not on the high profile --and high paying -- professional fight circuit. Stevenson famously turned a million-dollar offer to fight Muhammad Ali. Other Cuban fighters have chosen a different path, defecting and earning the huge purses not available to them in their home country. Despite those losses, Cuba's boxing commissioner Alberto Puig says there is a deep talent pool to draw from. ""Our strength comes from the heart, from patriotism,"" he said. ""Our boxers may not have a million dollars but they have 11 million Cubans who support them."" Puig said despite the country's legacy of great boxers, he expected countries like Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to provide strong competition at the 2012 Olympics in London. He believes Cuba's advantage comes from the government's ability to identify and cultivate emerging talent at a young age. ""We can say with total certainty that in the farthest corner of Cuba if there's a talented boxer we know about him and are following his progress,"" he said. ""So that maybe one day he might join our national team."" The Rafael Trejo boxing gym in Havana is one of the places where young boxers receive that encouragement from a young age. The students receive lessons as early as eight years old in the gym's open-air ring. While the facilities are threadbare, the instruction they receive is world class. Two-time Olympic gold medal winner Hector Vinent Charon runs the gym, teaching the children how to throw and take a punch. ""What makes Cubans different is the intelligence that we fight with,"" he said, ""Our aggression, our tactics and the way we move."" Vinent said most of the children at the Trejo are boxing as an after-school activity. They will pick up the basics of boxing and confidence while never achieving greatness in the ring. Boxing teaches them skills, he said, they can use in their everyday life. ""We teach them the elements of boxing but also patriotism,"" he said. ""How you act in the classroom or on the street. It's not just boxing."" Vinent is looking for young fighters with drive and something to prove. Because there among the gangly youths bobbing and weaving in his classes, Vinent said, could very well be Cuba's next champion of the ring.","Boxing is a passion in Cuba, rivaling baseball as the country's national sport .

"(CNN) -- On the second anniversary of the death of former North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, the nation held a memorial in his honor, lauding his life and achievements. During the ceremony, his son, Kim Jong Un sat front and center below the image of his father, which was festooned in gold-colored flowers. He assumed power after his father's death in 2011. The memorial marking the death of the elder Kim brought out what looked like thousands of party members and military personnel, who dressed in black or in green uniforms, into Pyongyang Gymnasium. They clapped in in synchrony, raising their hands above their shoulders. The anniversary came a week after an uncharacteristically public announcement of the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek that raised speculation about turmoil within the North Korean leadership. Showing allegiance . During Tuesday's ceremony, the remaining top brass, appearing solemn, flanked Kim. All the levels of power and control of North Korea appeared to be there, to show allegiance to Kim and the state, said Daniel Pinkston, senior analyst of the North East Asia region for the International Crisis Group. Anniversary ceremonies pertaining to the North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung and his son, Kim Jong Il are common. ""Kim Jong Un is using those dates for ceremonies as opportunities to have people in the leadership extend pledges of allegiance and loyalty to the regime, to the party and Kim Jong Un as a leader,"" said Pinkston. ""There was a lot more eyes on it because of the recent purging and execution of Jang Song Thaek."" 'Human bullets and bombs' In a separate event on Monday, members of the North Korean military -- the Korean People's Army -- swore to uphold Kim as leader and to defend him unto death at a meeting at Kumsusan Palace, reported the North Korean state news agency, KCNA. The participants ""solemnly pledged to become human bullets and bombs"" and to know only Kim, according to KCNA. The execution of Jang last week came as a shock. Jang, who was Kim's uncle by marriage, had been regarded as the second-most powerful figure in the secretive nation. Denounced as a ""traitor for all ages"" and ""worse than a dog,"" he was executed for trying to overthrow the state ""by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods."" His crimes on KCNA included: Behaving arrogantly, unwilling to stand up from his seat and ""half-heartedly clapping."" His widow and the current North Korean leader's aunt, Kim Kyong-hui did not appear to attend the Tuesday anniversary commemorating the death of her brother. However, she was mentioned in a KCNA report this weekend, suggesting she had survived her husband's purge. After the ceremony held at the Pyongyang gymnasium, Kim Jong Un later appeared with his wife, Ri Sol Ju as they visited the mausoleum where his father's body lies. Ri was seen walking by his side. For the rest of the North Korean population, the situation may be tense. Sokeel Park, director of Research and Strategy at Liberty in North Korea, an NGO, said he had heard from defectors secretly communicating with family members inside North Korea that there have been greater restrictions. This is common during anniversaries marking the Kims. ""I've heard of increased restrictions on movement, and increased restriction on the market,"" Park said. ""The general atmosphere is one of lockdown. Combine that with the quite shocking news to North Korea that Jang Song Thaek was looking to overthrow the leadership -- that's shocking in any society. That contributes to this tense atmosphere among North Korean people."" Signs of instability? The execution of Jang has unsettled some North Korea observers as well as its neighbors, as they look for signs of instability in the government and possibility of provocation. The South Korean defense ministry said Jang's death could be a major turning point in North Korea since the founding of its power 68 years ago and there could be a provocation early next year. But the ministry's spokesman Kim Min-seok said that there is no ""imminent sign of North Korea carrying out nuclear and missile tests."" Park Geun-hye, the South Korean president said on Monday before a meeting with diplomatic and security ministers, that she could not rule out ""reckless provocations"" from the north. U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry called Kim ""reckless"" and"" insecure"" following the execution of his uncle, stating that it makes having a nuclear weapon in the hands of somebody like him ""even more unacceptable."" CNN's KJ Kwon in Seoul contributed to this report.","Two-year anniversary marked for death of Kim Jong Il .

"Washington (CNN) -- An Ohio man was charged Tuesday with destruction of property stemming from a bizarre incident outside the White House that involved a driverless SUV. Joseph Clifford Reel, 32, of Kettering, Ohio, appeared in federal court and will remain jailed pending a detention hearing on Thursday. According to a court affidavit, a driverless sports utility vehicle rammed a steel security bollard and a light post shortly after 3 a.m. on Sunday. Officers found a wood block had been attached to the accelerator. Secret Service officers spotted a man nearby on a bike who said he was watching the action. Officers told him to move along and he did. But the same man, later identified as Reel, allegedly jumped a fence at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is next to the White House. President Barack Obama was in California while all this was going on. Reel was captured along with a can of paint. According to the court document, he told officers that he wanted to spray paint the ""Don't Tread on Me"" rattlesnake from an American Revolutionary era flag somewhere at the White House complex. A search of the Jeep turned up 100 rounds of .45 caliber ammunition, 100 rounds of .22 caliber ammunition. eight knives, and two machetes. No explosives or guns were found, authorities said.","Driverless SUV rammed steel security pipe and light pole outside White House .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- John McCain has learned his lesson: Don't ever cancel on David Letterman. Appearing on CBS' ""Late Show with David Letterman"" Thursday, the Republican presidential candidate apologized for skipping out on a scheduled visit in September that Letterman later made the subject of an ongoing joke. ""I screwed up,"" McCain told Letterman more than once in the interview that aired Thursday night. McCain's appearance on the show comes three weeks after he raised the ire of the generally mild-mannered host by canceling at the last minute, citing his decision to suspend his presidential campaign because of the financial crisis. ""This doesn't smell right,"" Letterman said. ""This is not the way a tested hero behaves. Somebody's putting something in his Metamucil."" Letterman also didn't appear to buy the Arizona senator's explanation for the cancellation. At the time, he showed the audience a live feed of McCain preparing for an interview with CBS anchor Katie Couric. After praising McCain's record as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, he said, ""This is not the John McCain I know, by God."" Letterman has repeatedly harped on McCain for the missed appearance, noting the Arizona senator's poll numbers appeared to begin to slide right after he skipped out on the show. ""Look at all the conversation I gave you. Including having Mr. Olbermann on,"" McCain told Letterman Thursday night, referencing the MSNBC liberal talk show host who filled in for him that night. However, Thursday's interview was not all fun and games, as Letterman pressed McCain on Republican VP Sarah Palin's preparedness to lead the country through ""the next 9/11 attack.."" ""Absolutely,"" she is, McCain said. ""She has inspired Americans. That's the thing we need."" McCain said her experience as a mayor, governor and PTA member have prepared her to be president. ""In all due respect, one of the people I admired most was an obscure governor of a southern state called Arkansas and he turned out to be a fairly successful president,"" McCain said. ""I mean, Ronald Reagan was a cowboy, no experience in international affairs. So, look, I think she has shown leadership."" When Letterman asked McCain about Palin's charge that Barack Obama ""palled around with terrorists,"" the senator said ""he did."" McCain said that while Obama might have been just a child when William Ayers founded the Weathermen, a Vietnam War era group blamed for several domestic bombings. Ayers recently said he regretted not doing more attacks. ""Mr. Ayers, on 2001, September 11, 2001 said, 'I wish I had bombed more,'"" said McCain. McCain's reference was to a New York Times story published on September 11, 2001, when Ayers wrote ""I don't regret setting bombs ... I feel we didn't do enough."" Later, after the issue was raised in an April primary debate by Sen. Hillary Clinton, Ayers posted his 2001 reply to the Times story on his blog, saying, ""I said I had a thousand regrets, but no regrets for opposing the war with every ounce of my strength.""","""I screwed up,"" John McCain tells David Letterman for canceling scheduled visit .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Attackers killed at least 11 people Wednesday in a region of Nigeria that has been convulsed by violence between Muslims and Christians, an official said. Muslim herdsmen, some dressed in military uniforms, attacked a predominantly Christian village at about 1 a.m. Wednesday near the city of Jos, close to where a machete-wielding Muslim group killed hundreds in a mostly Christian town this month, said Choji Gyang, special adviser on religious affairs to the governor of the Nigerian state of Plateau. Opinion: We will fight for the soul of Nigeria . The dead included women and children, he said. The attackers, from the Fulani ethnic group, also injured at least four people and stole 120 cattle from the village of Kyi, he said. Two people are missing. The violence has put much of oil-rich Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, on edge, with rumors swirling of more attacks. Authorities in Lagos took the unusual step of sending a text message to residents to try to put them at ease. ""Please be informed that the story of Fulanis trooping into Lagos for the past three days to cause chaos is baseless,"" the message said. ""All security agencies have investigated this rumor individually and collectively and found that there's no iota of truth in it. Be advised to go about your lawful business without fear. ""All agencies remain committed to keep our state and country safe. We are fully alert. Thank-you and pass this message onto others."" The attacks Wednesday followed the massacre earlier this month of roughly 200 people near Jos, a city in central Nigeria that lies on a faith-based fault-line between Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria and the mainly Christian south. A few weeks ago, Muslim attackers with guns, machetes, and knives killed people in several Christian villages near Jos in apparent retaliation for previous attacks against Islamic communities and the theft of cattle from herdsmen, Human Rights Watch said. What's behind slaughter in Nigeria? Thousands of people in Plateau state have been killed in similar outbreaks of violence in the last decade, said Corinne Dufka, a senior West Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. Though the violence often pits Christians and Muslims against each other, it has more to do with disputes over access to natural resources than religion, according to John Onaiyekan, the archbishop of Abuja, Nigeria. Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo also has said that the violence is fueled more by ethnic, social, and economic problems than religion. ""If you have one group or a community that has land that's been encroached upon by another community or even by itinerant cattle farmers, then the people who lay claim to the land will fight back,"" he recently told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""If there are job opportunities in an area, and persons believe they are indigenous to that area, and (are) not getting enough out of the jobs that are available, they will fight those who are getting the jobs.""","Muslim herdsmen attacked predominantly Christian village near the city of Jos .

"(CNN) -- James Bond piloted a Douglas DC-3 airliner. Indiana Jones hopped a ride on one for his last crusade. This aviation icon even stars in a reality TV show. Almost 80 years after its introduction, a few hundred DC-3s are estimated to still be flying worldwide. That's kind of unbelievable in an age when dozens of younger types of airliners have already retired to aviation boneyards. ""When we take them to air shows I watch people gravitate toward (them),"" says Joe McBryan, co-star of History Channel's ""Ice Pilots."" McBryan owns Canada's Buffalo Airways and its six operating DC-3s. ""People always have a story. They say their dad or grand-dad flew one ... or they flew on one when they were young."" The DC-3 debuted in the mid-1930s as an aviation rock star. With its two powerful propeller engines it revolutionized the travel industry by cutting typical coast-to-coast flight time across the United States from 25 hours to just 18. Although it typically seated only about 21 passengers, the plane allowed airlines to make a giant leap toward profitability. Later a military version of the plane helped win World War II by dropping thousands of paratroopers during the D-Day invasion of France, 70 years ago this month. Result: The DC-3 has touched millions of lives. But what about this plane keeps it flying all these years later? Pilots will tell you the DC-3 won't quit because it was so well-built. Some say its design and rugged landing gear helped it touch down safely on short runways. A day in the life of the world's busiest airport . But for McBryan -- age 70 and still flying almost daily -- it's about love. ""You can choose your friends and coworkers but you can't choose the one you love. An airplane is the same. And in 1969, the DC-3 came and it stayed with me,"" McBryan says. During some of the coldest weather on the planet, McBryan's planes ferry tourists, hunters, adventurers and regional workers across Canada's remote Northwest Territories. The 45-minute DC-3 flights from Yellowknife across icy Great Slave Lake to Hay River are pretty basic. Passengers get no meals, no WiFi, no video. ""There's coffee and cookies and juice,"" McBryan says. There is an alternative to in-flight entertainment: ""A lot of passengers like the sound of the engine. It will lull you to sleep. It's a perfect sleeping noise."" McBryan's son once said the engines sound like a ""funeral procession for the Hell's Angels."" On the flight deck, for McBryan, it's all about the plane's feel. These classic aircraft are controlled with a yoke connected directly by cables to the tail and wings. No fancy fly-by-wire electronics like newer airliners. No flashy heads-up displays for speed or altitude, either. An old fashioned instrument panel works just fine, thank you very much. ""It's very comfortable,"" he says. ""You're in your own nest. You have the ability to feel what the airplane's doing."" 007 flies the Gooney Bird . In 2008, a Gooney Bird helped James Bond get out of a jam. Fans of the Bond film ""Quantum of Solace,"" may recall actor Daniel Craig in the cockpit of a beat-up DC-3. ""Let's see if this thing will fly,"" Bond says in the film. Does it? Oh yeah. And then some. After takeoff, a super-fast jet fires on the Gooney Bird, forcing Bond to use the DC-3's slow speed to outwit the jet pilot. The jet winds up as a stain on a rocky mountainside. Chalk up a win for low and slow. Back in the 1980s, a DC-3 served another movie franchise hero. In ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" Indy flies from New York to Newfoundland to the Azores and Europe on his quest for the Holy Grail. 50 spots, 50 states for 2014 . Taildraggers . Getting on board a DC-3 is an uphill climb. Literally. The plane's tail sits on the ground when it's not flying, forcing passengers to walk up a steeply inclined aisle to take their seats. ""One of the most common comments I hear when some passengers come on board is, 'Wow, there's really an angle here,' "" says Ric Hallquist, a longtime pilot for Missionary Flights International. Three times per week, Hallquist flies DC-3s loaded with cargo or passengers from South Florida to the Caribbean. In addition to passengers, Hallquist and his co-pilots have hauled horses, ATVs and pretty much any legal cargo they can fit through the aircraft door. The Gooney Bird's rugged landing gear with its big struts can handle rough runways in places like Haiti or the Dominican Republic, Hallquist says. ""And the air frame is just so strong, it really is."" But the plane can also be temperamental, especially for pilots without much DC-3 experience, says Catalina Air Boats pilot Robby Bolling, who flies a daily DC-3 cargo route from Long Beach, California, to Catalina Island, about 30 miles offshore. ""You just have to respect it, not abuse it,"" says Bolling. ""I kind of feel like I'm going back in time to the 1940s or '50s. flying these airplanes around."" When the DC-3 flies, folks around the airport start shooting photos, Bolling says. ""I always notice that. It's kind of like a rock star."" Bolling fears the plane won't be around much longer. He says he'll miss it. Back in Yellowknife, ice pilot McBryan sees it differently. He believes the planes could easily fly for another 30 years . ""They keep making parts, so there won't be a shortage,"" says this son of a prospector. If anything stands in its way, McBryan says it will be a shortage of leaded fuel that his DC-3's engines burn. The environmentally hazardous leaded fuel is being phased out. But losing the DC-3 would be a shame, McBryan says. There's simply nothing else like it. The plane is about as near humans will get to growing wings. ""Strap a DC-3 to your a** and let the wings extend out,"" he jokes. ""That's the closest thing you will come to a human flying.""

"(CNN) -- We just can't leave well-enough alone. In 1960, the movie ""Scent of Mystery"" opened in theaters, marking the first and only official attempt at Smell-O-Vision, in which strategic odors were emitted during the film from little pipes near the seats. At the time, it was big thinking and an interesting draw for moviegoers, sort of like the collective asthma attack everyone developed a few years ago for modern 3-D. Which I think most of us will now agree is more trouble than it's worth. Like wearing pants. Before Smell-O-Vision, other motion pictures had unsuccessfully tried to use aromas in disjointed and haphazard ways. But in ""Scent of Mystery,"" new, specific patented technology was developed to actually drive the plot. And that hadn't been done before. Fortunately, the storyline had nothing to do with Peter Lorre getting sick from bad oysters. Though the reviews might've been interesting. ""I liked it up until the 30-minute bathroom scene. Two stars."" ""Scent of Mystery"" was eventually de-odorized and retitled ""Holiday in Spain,"" at which point Smell-O-Vision was neatly tucked away in the vault of American bad ideas. It now shares that space with game footage from the XFL. But more than 60 years later, a startup company in Japan is bringing back the Smell-O-Vision concept for a smaller screen. Specifically, the one on your phone. Sexting just got way more interesting. They call this thing ChatPerf, and it's a thumb-drive-sized atomizer that plugs into your mobile device so it can be triggered to release specific odors on command. However, the major design limitation is that it can release only one specific fragrance from whatever scent tank you happen to have inserted into the atomizer. So God help you if you suddenly want to smell ""Summer Flowers"" but accidentally left the house with ""Larry the Cable Guy Doing Situps."" Git-R-Done! Holding but one fragrance tank at a time definitely steals some of the potential fun, for it also seems unlikely that you could remotely sneak attack a friend who's on a first date, digitally wafting his table with the putrid stink of rotten eggs. Not that it would necessarily change things. ""Um, Jarrett, did you just pass gas?"" ""Yes. Yes, I did."" Naturally, this new little gizmo is still in development, but they hope to have it out in markets by the fall for both iPhone and Android. Which, sadly, will be months too late for strategically teaming up with Bonnaroo so tech-savvy music fans can olfactorily brag to everyone back home with the familiar summer festival smell of a hot Port-O-John. ""Sounds like Heather is having fun."" ""Don't you mean smells like Heather is having fun?"" ""Ha ha ha! Yes. We have indoor plumbing."" But the sky seems to be the limit for ChatPerf, so long as we agree that the sky is rather low and remarkably pointless. That said, the company is being smart and releasing a software development kit to encourage outsiders to hack away at new, creative uses for different smells. So, you never know. Perhaps there's hope for something interesting. I just can't think of what that might be. Nevertheless, Team ChatPerf thinks there are possibilities ranging from the pleasant to the completely absurd. For instance, they excitedly ponder the possibility of concert venues handing out tanks of sweat for fans to truly experience the closeness of their favorite performer on stage. Clearly, they've never been to a Meatloaf concert. One somewhat practical application, they say, might also be for game play, where, say, a shooting game could be programmed to release the smell of gunpowder. Or a driving game might enhance the experience with burning rubber. Come to think of it, maybe even World of Warcraft could be designed to smell like your mom's basement. You know, just in case you happen to emerge from the darkness to play the game somewhere else. Not that you'd want to. At least it has indoor plumbing.","ChatPerf attaches to mobile devices and can be triggered to emit odors .

"Outside of Beijing, China (CNN) -- Something isn't quite right with this picture. There seem to be too many children here. Isn't this the country famed for its one-child policy? Aren't there big fines and penalties for having that second child? A man is watching two children play. He says both of them are his. ""Many people here have more than one child. Some have four children,"" he adds. This migrant workers' village on the outskirts of Beijing is typical of itinerant communities, where families are finding ways to beat the system. The one-child policy has been in place since 1979 to try to curb China's population growth. It has worked -- some estimates say hundreds of millions of births have been averted. And it hasn't been bad for the economy, either. As China has opened up, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty as the nation's economy grows faster than the population. But there have always been loopholes. The wealthier families have paid fines, and some have traveled overseas to have a second child with a foreign passport. China's ethnic populations have been largely exempt as rural families have multiple children to help work the fields. Offspring of one-child families who then marry also may have more than one child. Zakaria: Could China's one-child policy change? In this migrant village, however, one father says he thinks this has always been an unfair policy. ""What has fairness got to do with it?"" he says. ""If you have more money, then you can have more children; and if you're poor, you only have one child."" He won't reveal his name and doesn't want his face photographed. But he is willing to talk. He says people here sometimes pay brokers to bribe officials for documentation for additional children. It can cost up to $1,000 but is still much less than the official fine, which can be as high as 200,000 Renminbi, or more than $31,000. In his case, he waited until his second child was born and registered both together as twins. It is illegal, and he says people worry about being caught but are willing to take the risk. Forced abortion sparks outrage, debate in China . The Zhang family decided to have a second child more than 20 years ago. It certainly wasn't fashionable or patriotic. They paid a big price -- not just a hefty fine, but the father, Zhang Jian, even lost his job. ""Yes, once I had two kids, I lost my job. But I'm not scared of that, I don't care. The most important thing is to raise my kids. This is for happiness,"" he says. His daughter Zhang Dongjuan is forever grateful for her parents' sacrifice. ""I am very happy. I'm the luckiest girl in the world,"" she says. She shows me photos of her sister, now away from home working as a banker. They are very close, she says. Dongjuan says her friends were always envious of her, and she's already planning to have two children when she marries. ""Yes, I think the policy should be finished, because we all have a lot of pressure if we have just one child,"" she says. ""If we have two children, then four people can afford to look after two set of parents, we'll have less pressure."" There are growing calls for an end to the policy. Critics say China's population is aging and is heavily weighted toward male children. Eventually, they say this will have a serious impact on the country's economy and social cohesion. On advertising billboards now there is a new image. One in Beijing promoting Chinese values -- patriotism and inclusiveness -- shows grandparents, parents and, yes, two children. It is in stark contrast with another more horrifying image. Last month a photo appeared on the Internet and quickly went around the world showing the brutal side of the one-child policy: a mother forced into an abortion lying exhausted and disheveled on her hospital bed, beside her a fully formed fetus. Between these two images -- the new Chinese poster family and the exhausted mother -- lies the reality of a policy that has defined China for three decades, but is now being questioned.","China's one-child policy has been in place since 1979 to try to curb population growth .
But many Chinese are now questioning the policy and skirting the law .

"NEWARK, New Jersey (CNN) -- Two people, including a 15-year-old boy, are in custody in connection with the execution-style slayings of three college students in a Newark, New Jersey, schoolyard, authorities said. Jose Carranza, 28, of Newark, New Jersey, surrendered in the slayings of three college students. Jose Carranza, 28, of Newark, surrendered with his lawyer at midday Thursday, Mayor Cory A. Booker said. The suspect insisted on surrendering to the mayor after learning he was wanted for murder. ""He simply came forward. He said nothing,"" recalled Booker, who rushed from a news conference to meet the lawyer, Felix Lopez Montalvo, for the surrender.  Watch Booker describe the surrender » . ""We put him in handcuffs and we walked the individual into the office. I personally helped the detective to sit him down and I left,"" the mayor added. The teenager was taken into custody at about 11 p.m. on Wednesday. Booker said others are being sought. ""We have very, very strong leads,"" he told reporters. ""I want the killers off the streets of Newark."" Ballistics evidence, information from the shooting's lone survivor and a fingerprint lifted from a beer bottle at the scene led to the major break in a criminal case that has outraged a city numbed by street violence. At a news conference earlier Thursday, Booker praised the ""incredible courage"" of survivor Natasha Aeriel, 19. She is in stable condition and under heavy police guard at The University Hospital in Newark, recovering from gunshot and knife wounds. ""From her hospital bed, she has been cooperating with authorities and making identifications,"" Booker said. Newark Police Director Garry McCarthy and Essex County Prosecutor Paula Dow asked for the public's help in the rapidly developing case. A $150,000 reward is being offered for information. An arrest warrant had sought Carranza's arrest for three counts of murder, a single count of attempted murder, four counts of robbery, conspiracy and weapons offenses. ""We believe that others were involved in this heinous crime. We are looking for them,"" Dow said. The 15-year-old was not identified because of his age, but Dow said she would seek to try him as an adult. Newark has become accustomed to violence but the slayings on Saturday night touched a nerve. The four friends, ages 18 to 20, were shot while listening to music at the schoolyard. Three of them -- Terrance Aeriel, 18, Dashon Harvey, 20; and Iofemi Hightower, 20 -- were forced to kneel against a wall and were shot in the head, execution style. Authorities have said robbery appeared to be the motive, but Dow said Tuesday that police also were looking into possible gang involvement. While Newark has seen 60 homicides this year, the schoolyard killings stood out because the victims, by all accounts, were good kids.

"London (CNN) -- It was just like a scene from the Alfred Hitchcock crime caper ""To Catch a Thief."" The same hotel. The sparkly jewels. The robbery. Only this was real life. A robber, his face covered by a hat and a scarf threatened to shoot attendees at a exhibition in Canne's Carlton Hotel, setting of the 1955 movie, on Sunday. Within minutes he had escaped with $136 million worth of jewels: security guards at the show were unarmed, while the man had a semi-automatic pistol. The robbery is the third high-profile jewelery heist in Cannes in Southern France in only three months. During the Cannes film festival in May, a necklace worth $2.6 million (2 million euros) was stolen from a hotel party shortly after more than $1 million worth of jewels were stolen from a safe in a hotel room. The high-profile thefts follow a brazen heist in neighboring Belgium in February. A gang of eight men managed to snatch $50 million worth of diamonds from a plane on Brussels Airport -- within only eight minutes. ""It comes as a big surprise that something like this is possible,"" said Jan Van der Cruysse, a spokesman for Brussels Airport. ""But of course, this is rather connected to banditism and organized crime rather than aviation security."" Yet such incidents have a history. From 1960s gangster film-style armed robberies to elaborate stunts involving drag queens and fake beards, thieves from around the world have tried almost anything to get hold of diamonds. Here are some of the biggest heists they pulled off: . On Valentine's Day weekend in February 2003, $100 million worth of precious stones were snatched from the Antwerp Diamond Center. The thieves, headed by Leonardo Notarbartolo, reportedly managed to penetrate some of the most advanced security measures, including hi-tech combination locks, motion and heat sensors -- and 18-inch steel doors. The gangsters even changed the tapes of the security cameras in the building to avoid being identified. They did, however, make one mistake: they left behind a half-eaten sandwich with DNA samples on it. They were arrested after months-long police operation involving detectives in several countries. The jewels were never recovered. The sensational robbery inspired a book ""Flawless -- Inside the Largest Diamond heist in the History."" In March 2007, a man using the name Carlos Hector Flomenbaum adopted an unorthodox approach to robbery. Swapping weapons for chocolates and charm, Flomenbaum became a frequent customer at ABN Amro bank in Antwerp. Befriending the bank staff, who believed he was a successful diamond trader, he gained their trust and acquired a key to the bank's vault. Once he had the key, he simply let himself in and walked out of the front door with 120,000 carats of diamonds, worth $28 million. In mid-May 2008, four armed robbers -- two disguised as women -- walked into a jewelry store in Paris. Once inside, they pulled out their weapons, forced the customers and employees into a corner, and grabbed jewels out of display cases and safes. Swiping an estimated 80 million euros ($102 million) worth of jewels, the ""drag queen robbery"" became one of the biggest heists in history. On New Year's Eve 2008, two armed men casually walked into a shop called Dialite Imports, one of New York's diamond district shops. Dressed in traditional Orthodox-jewish clothing accessorized with fake beards, they quickly gained access to the store's safe, spray-painting two security cameras in the process. They disappeared with $4 million in diamonds and other jewels. The heist later turned out to be an elaborate inside job set up by the store's co-owners, who were $1 million in debt, six months behind on their rent and acquired a new insurance policy shortly before the robbery. In 2009, two sharp-suited men walked into Graff Jewellers on central London's New Bond Street. In the middle of the afternoon, with people walking on the streets outside, they threatened employees with handguns and managed to steal 43 items, with a value of about £40 million ($65 million). In 1994 three men armed with a machine gun stormed into the Carlton Hotel in Cannes, France. They stole jewels valued at £30 million ($43 million) from a jewelry shop in the hotel. Reportedly, the rounds they had been firing were blanks -- which did not prevent them from gaining the world's biggest gems robbery record in Guinness Book of Records.","$50 million worth of diamonds were stolen from a plane on Brussels Airport .

"(CNN) -- There's a killer on the loose and Los Angeles is on edge -- again. This jaded city has witnessed every variety of killing, from Charles Manson and his helter-skelter spree to the Night Stalker's deadly nocturnal prowling and the random strikes of the Hillside Strangler, the Freeway Killer and the Grim Sleeper. This one is different: The suspect is an ex-cop with an ax to grind, and he's allegedly targeting other cops. This one crosses the blue line, the one cops think separates the good guys from the bad. This one picks at one of L.A.'s barely healed scabs, the scandals of the Los Angeles Police Department. They began in March 1991, when George Holliday videotaped a gaggle of police officers kicking Rodney King and beating him with batons after a high-speed freeway chase. It ended, or so most people thought, in 2009 when a federal judge lifted a consent decree that threatened severe sanctions if the LAPD did not reform itself. Related: Mood tense among officers . The subject of television and movie dramas since the 1960s and Jack Webb's ""Dragnet"" -- ""Just the facts, ma'am"" -- the LAPD has long been a flash point for controversy. It is the nation's third-largest police force, but has far fewer officers per capita and square mile than the two largest forces, in New York and Chicago. Until about 15 years ago, the department's officers where overwhelmingly white. A couple of decades of reform seemed to make things better. Officers of color were recruited, and the department worked on community relations. About a year ago, the force nailed one of its own: a female detective who killed her romantic rival in a cold case dating back 26 years. Related: Manhunt recalls D.C. sniper case . At the time, officials spoke of an enlightened era in which the new LAPD could investigate the old LAPD. Even the loudest critics had mostly fallen silent in recent years. Enter Christopher Jordan Dorner, a 33-year-old, 270-pound LAPD washout who is now the most hunted man in America. He is the suspect in three killings and has dredged up the LAPD scandals in a 6,000-word rant addressed to ""America"" and posted on his Facebook page. ""The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days,"" he wrote. ""It has gotten worse. The consent decree should never have been lifted."" Dorner is angry about being fired by the LAPD. He is articulate and lucid enough to trigger flashbacks to a time not so long ago when patrol officers broke their world into two categories: ""blue and everybody else."" King, who died last year, was beaten by LAPD patrol officers on March 3, 1991 while a supervisor stood by. Three officers and a sergeant were tried a year later, and acquitted of the most serious charges. The LAPD watched as parts of the city erupted in rioting that left 53 dead and damaged $1 billion worth of property. An investigation revealed that racism, brutality and adversarial attitudes were so ingrained that it didn't even occur to officers to hide them. The inquiry documented a culture in which cops openly talked with each other about beating suspects -- ""attitude adjustments,"" they called it -- and labeled a group of African-Americans as ""gorillas in the mist,"" a popular movie title during the Rodney King era. Six years after the riots, another scandal exposed more corruption and even deeper cover-ups, implicating members of an elite anti-gang unit at the LAPD's Rampart division, home to some of the city's most vicious gangs. Related: Dorner's grudge dates back to 2007 . Rogue cop Rafael Perez was accused in 1998 of stealing eight pounds of cocaine from an evidence locker. He admitted shooting and paralyzing an unarmed teenager and planting a gun so he could claim self defense. The boy was sent to prison but later exonerated. Perez's plea bargain confession led to nearly 100 tainted convictions being overturned. Three officers were arrested and tried. A higher court tossed out the convictions. Attorney Harland Braun defends police officers, including the ones accused of criminal misconduct in the King and Rampart scandals. He said he believes there might be a grain of truth to Dorner's allegations of a cover-up. He said he thinks that may have been what set Dorner off. Civil rights leaders, highly vocal in past scandals, have held back on criticizing the LAPD this time. Instead, they are urging Dorner to surrender peacefully. Related: Timeline of events . Dorner wrote in his manifesto that he was forced to turn to violence because the culture of racism, brutality, corruption and cover-up continues at the LAPD. He claims he was kicked off the force after he complained about a training officer kicking a mentally ill suspect. Braun said he had never heard of a case in which the LAPD fired an officer who reported excessive force. ""You don't go after the guy,"" he said. Usually, though, other officers are quick to close ranks and shun a perceived ""rat."" He told the story of an officer who testified at the King trial as an expert on the use of force. The man said he believed the officers had, indeed, employed excessive force. His photo was tacked up at the police academy, and it became tradition for any officer who passed by to spit on it, Braun said. ""They've changed enormously, but you're still going to have pockets of this,"" he added. ""You're still going to have individuals who are throwbacks. You're still going to have the culture of cover-up. A group that's fighting together and under siege, they're going to stick together."" Dorner demanded justice and an apology, and vowed that police blood will flow until he gets them. The manifesto names some 40 people he claims have wronged him. He wrote that he does not expect to survive his vengeful rampage. Last weekend, a couple was found shot to death in Irvine, a suburban Orange County community south of Los Angeles that is home to a college campus. Investigators tied the slayings to Dorner; his manifesto seems to confirm the connection: It says the slain woman's father represented Dorner, unsuccessfully, at a hearing before an LAPD disciplinary committee in 2008. So far, the bloodshed seems to be taking place outside the city limits. It covers a wide area around Los Angeles, with incidents reported from San Diego in the south to the mountain resort of Big Bear in the east. Three Riverside police officers were shot, one fatally, by a man police say was Dorner. His beef might be with the LAPD, but no one in law enforcement can feel safe while he is on the run. Alleged cop-killer's manifesto details threats . Others have threatened to target LAPD cops in the past -- gang members, for the most part. But Dorner is no gang-banger. He's a veteran trained to kill by the military and by his one-time employer, the police. He threatens payback by violent, unconventional means: ""This is my last resort. The LAPD has suppressed the truth and it has now led to deadly consequences,"" he wrote. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck dismissed the allegations in Dorner's manifesto. ""You're talking about a homicide suspect who has committed atrocious crimes,"" he said, adding that he was not inclined to give credence to his ""ramblings on the Internet."" As for any apology, well, Dorner shouldn't hold his breath, Beck said. People who have invested years watching the LAPD -- including attorneys, legal analysts and the Los Angeles Times reporters who have covered the department -- say it has indeed changed since the early 1990s. But they also agree that its past is fertile territory for anyone with a grudge against the department. Times editor-at-large Jim Newton covered the LAPD as it struggled with the fallout from the King beating and the years of study, oversight and reform that followed. He was the paper's lead reporter during the O.J. Simpson murder trial, when the defense put the LAPD on trial and Simpson was acquitted. Dorner's manifesto ""doesn't reflect any larger cultural truth about LAPD,"" Newton wrote in an e-mail. Andrew Blankstein, the paper's current LAPD reporter, agreed. ""Every organization is going to have rogues,"" he said. ""But what can you believe from somebody who is homicidal? Obviously, anybody with grievances has a long, well-publicized history of the LAPD to pick at."" Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, has watched the LAPD and its high-profile controversies during the era that includes King, Simpson and Rampart. She also believes the LAPD has changed, even if it is not perfect. ""The LAPD has come a long way, but it still has its detractors,"" she wrote in an e-mail. ""Ironically, the person who is most set on destroying it is one of their own. The Rodney King and Rampart scandals brought to light racism and corruption that had existed in the department. It is easy for someone with their own vendetta against the department to tap into these past episodes and make the LAPD a target."" Opinion: In rampages, it's about revenge . But, she added, the tactic is likely to backfire. ""In the end,"" Levenson said, ""he is probably just creating more sympathy and support for the people he loathes."" CNN's Ann O'Neill covered the Rampart police corruption trial in 2000 as a reporter for The Los Angeles Times.","Suspect Christopher Dorner's manifesto says he is waging war against ""corrupt"" LAPD .

"(CNN) -- If the latest audio recording attributed to Donald Sterling is the real deal, the L.A. Clippers owner is denying he's a racist -- and doesn't appear ready to submit to demands to sell the team. ""You think I'm a racist?"" a man purported to be Sterling says in a recording posted Thursday morning by RadarOnline.com. ""You think I have anything in the world but love for everybody? You don't think that. You know I'm not a racist."" CNN cannot independently confirm that the speaker is Sterling. Sterling has been banned for life from the team's day-to-day operations and facilities and was fined $2.5 million last week for racist comments that were recorded and posted online late last month. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has asked the other 29 NBA owners to force Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, to sell the Clippers. In the tape posted Thursday, a second man says ""they're trying to force you to sell."" ""You can't force someone to sell property in America,"" responds the man who RadarOnline.com says is Sterling. ""Well, I'm a lawyer, that's my opinion."" RadarOnline.com's post doesn't say when the recording was made or identify the second man heard in it. Sterling, a lawyer and billionaire real-estate investor, has not issued a public statement since the celebrity gossip website TMZ posted a 10-minute audio recording in which he chastises V. Stiviano for posting pictures on Instagram in which she poses with African-Americans, including basketball Hall of Famer Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. Sterling made the comments during an argument he had with Stiviano on April 9, according to TMZ. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" he says. ""If it's white people, it's OK?"" she responds. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?"" The matter of the team's sale is with the NBA's Advisory/Finance Committee, which met Wednesday on a conference call. Members discussed the ""termination of Mr. Sterling's ownership of the team,"" the NBA said in a news release. The committee will meet again next week, the statement said. If the case proceeds to a full vote, 75% of the owners would have to approve the forced sale. Wife wants to retain her ownership share . However, Pierce O'Donnell, attorney for Donald Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, told CNN that she wants to keep her 50% stake in the team and they have been talking by phone with NBA officials. She wants to bring in an investment group to buy her husband's half of the franchise. ""She would not be in a managing position, but she would be a co-owner,"" O'Donnell said, adding they plan to meet in person with league officials soon. Technically the team is now owned by the Sterling family's trust, with Donald and Shelly Sterling serving as co-trustees. Their two children are named as beneficiaries. During his news conference announcing Donald Sterling's lifetime ban, Silver was asked if there would be sanctions against Shelly Sterling. ""No, there have been no decisions about other members of the Sterling family, and I should say that this ruling applies specifically to Donald Sterling and Donald Sterling's conduct only,"" Silver said. Shelly Sterling hasn't done anything wrong, O'Donnell said. ""The truth of the matter is that Mrs. Sterling has denounced in the strongest terms possible her husband's racist comments,"" he told CNN. ""Totally disassociated."" The Sterlings have not lived together for more than a year. Shelly Sterling is ""weighing her options"" as to whether she wants a divorce, O'Donnell said. He also said she categorically denied making any racist statements as alleged in court documents filed when the couple was sued for discrimination at their apartment buildings. Those cases were settled out of court. ""Mrs. Sterling is a wonderful woman and doesn't have any racial animus,"" he said. While her husband is banned from NBA arenas, Shelly Sterling has attended some of the Clippers playoff games since the scandal unfolded. CNN's Stephanie Elam, Ray Sanchez and Chris Isidore contributed to this report.","NEW: Shelly Sterling's attorney says she wants investment group to buy half of the team .

"Kabul. Afghanistan (CNN) -- Gunmen attacked a spy agency in eastern Afghanistan early Saturday, killing six people and leaving dozens injured, authorities said. The Taliban militant group claimed responsibility for the attack in Jalalabad city. It targeted the provincial headquarters of the national directorate of security in Nangarhar province, according to Hazrat Hussain Mashriqiwal, a local police spokesman. The attack started with a suicide bombing involving an explosives-laden truck and two assailants at the gate of the compound, he said. Six more attackers armed with guns and hand grenades then stormed into the building and battled with security forces for hours. All six assailants were killed, according to the spokesman. Most of the 45 people wounded are nearby residents injured by smashed windows or collapsed ceilings as a result of the suicide bombing, said Dr. Najibullah Kamawal, the province's top health official.

"Richmond (CNN) -- Closing arguments concluded Friday in the trial of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen. The two are accused of conspiring to commit corruption after accepting money loans from a person hoping to gain the governor's influential support for a business product. Prosecutors argued during their closing that McDonnell, while seemingly taking responsibility for his actions, blamed others at every turn. McDonnell's defense rides on the claim that he did not know his wife Maureen had accepted loans from Jonnie Williams, who was seeking support from the governor for a product from his nutritional supplement company. Nor did he know that she had accepted designer dresses or a Rolex watch as a gift from Williams, defense lawyers said. During the trial, salacious details about the couple's marriage came out, detailing that purportedly they barely spoke after 38 years of marriage and thus, said the defense, could not have conspired to corrupt. Prosecutors said the two didn't need to like each other to conspire. ""He was a strong governor. He was a weak husband,"" prosecutor Michael Dry said of the one-time rising star in the Republican Party who had potential presidential ambitions. McDonnell, wife plead not guilty to gift charges . Prosecutors alleged that once Maureen McDonnell became aware of the investigation about the corruption, she returned the designer dresses that she received from Williams. She wrote a note to Williams saying that she hoped his daughters could wear the dresses after she received them on loan, or that even they could be auctioned for a worthy charity. The prosecution pointed out that Williams' daughters are smaller in size than Maureen McConnell . If the dresses were in fact on loan, that would not be a crime. The governor's wife waited two years to return them, however. The defense also argued that there is no direct effect of those loans or other gifts given to the McDonnells that caused the governor use official actions to help Williams and his business, . Prosecutors said they don't need to prove there was a direct action based on the alleged bribes but did note Williams was able to have his business featured during an event at the executive mansion, and the governor pitched his product during a meeting with state workers. Defense lawyers also contended Williams was only out for himself, selling out the governor to gain immunity from alleged crimes. They also argued that Williams made up a lot of his story to give the government a bigger prize in the former governor. Jurors will return after the Labor Day weekend to receive instructions from the judge and then head to deliberations. The former governor was once rumored to be a potential vice presidential candidate with Mitt Romney. ""It's sad for the McDonald family and sad for the state of Virginia. Regardless of the verdict, there will be no winners,"" prosecutor Dry said.","Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was a rising star in the Republican Party .

"AMMAN, Jordan (CNN) -- A 12-year-old Yemeni girl, who was forced into marriage, died during a painful childbirth that also killed her baby, a children's rights group said Monday. Fawziya Ammodi struggled for three days in labor, before dying of severe bleeding at a hospital on Friday, said the Seyaj Organization for the Protection of Children. ""Although the cause of her death was lack of medical care, the real case was the lack of education in Yemen and the fact that child marriages keep happening,"" said Seyaj President Ahmed al-Qureshi. Born into an impoverished family in Hodeidah, Fawziya was forced to drop out of school and married off to a 24-year-old man last year, al-Qureshi said. Child brides are commonplace in Yemen, especially in the Red Sea Coast where tribal customs hold sway. Hodeidah is the fourth largest city in Yemen and an important port. More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18 -- many times to older men, some with more than one wife, a study by Sanaa University found. While it was not immediately known why Fawziya's parents married her off, the reasons vary. Sometimes, financially-strapped parents offer up their daughters for hefty dowries. Marriage means the girls are no longer a financial or moral burden to their parents. And often, parents will extract a promise from the husband to wait until the girl is older to consummate the marriage. Children's organization UNICEF issued a statement Monday saying: ""Child marriages violate the rights of children in the most deplorable way. The younger the girl is when she becomes pregnant, the greater the health risks for her and her baby. ""Girls who give birth before the age of 15 are five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s. Child marriage denies girls of their childhood, deprives them of an education and robs them of their innocence."" ""More must be done to address the underlying causes in order to prevent tragic deaths like those of 12-year-old Fawziya and her baby,"" the statement added. The issue of Yemeni child brides came to the forefront in 2008 with 10-year-old Nujood Ali. She was pulled out of school and married to a man who beat and raped her within weeks of the ceremony. To escape, Nujood hailed a taxi -- the first time in her life -- to get across town to the central courthouse where she sat on a bench and demanded to see a judge. After a well-publicized trial, she was granted a divorce. The Yemeni parliament tried in February to pass a law, setting the minimum marriage age at 17. But the measure has not reached the president because many parliamentarians argued it violates sharia, or Islamic law, which does not stipulate a minimum age.","Children's rights group draws attention to plight of child brides in Yemen .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The 43-year-old woman sentenced to death by stoning in Iran denounced her lawyer and said in an interview broadcast Wednesday that she knew about the plot to kill her husband but thought it was a joke. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's lawyer said his client made those comments to state-run television ""to save her life"" and noted that the death sentence for murder charges related to her husband's death was commuted. The mother of two faces a death sentence for adultery. Ashtiani's attorney, Mohammad Mostafaei, told CNN last month that his client confessed to the crime after being subjected to 99 lashes. He said she later recanted the confession and denied any wrongdoing. In Wednesday's interview, aired on the program ""20:30,"" Ashtiani blamed Mostafaei for publicizing her case and said she had never met him. ""I tell Mostafaei: How dare you use my name, lie in my name, say things about me that are not true,"" she said in a statement that was voiced over by another woman. Ashtiani's voice carries a thick Azeri accent that some Iranians may have difficulty understanding. She added she had not wanted her family to know she was in jail. Ashtiani acknowledged having known about the plot to kill her husband but said she had not taken it seriously at the time. ""The man entered my life and fooled me with his words and said let's kill my husband,"" she said. ""He fooled me and said I'll do this for you, what a bad husband, I'll take care of you. He was my husband's cousin, and he said things about my husband. ""Then I realized, when I went to prison, he had a criminal record and that this was his third criminal record. And when he said we should kill my husband, I couldn't even believe him or that my husband would die. I thought he was joking, that he had lost his mind. ""When my husband's mother was at our house one day and I went to get her medicine, I saw him there with all the tools he had bought, including electrical tools, wires and gloves. Then he killed my husband by connecting him to electricity with the electrical wires. He had told me beforehand to send my kids to their grandmother's house."" The prosecutor of East Azerbaijan Province, Malek Ajdar Sharifi, then says, ""The deceased was given an injection to fall asleep by his wife. Then the man arrived and put him into the bath and put two electrical lines on his body and killed the deceased."" The anchor then speculated that the Western news media, including CNN, have focused on the case to help secure the release of three American hikers seized by Iranian forces along the Iraqi border who have been in custody for more than a year. The three Americans -- Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer, and Josh Fattal -- were detained after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Ashtiani's lawyer dismissed the program as a tool of the government. "" '20:30' is a program that is controlled by the intelligence services in Iran,"" Mostafaei told CNN in an interview in Oslo, Norway, where he has been granted asylum after fleeing Iran. He had gone into hiding July 24, after enduring a lengthy interrogation at Iran's notorious Evin prison, the same day rallies were being held worldwide to draw attention to the Ashtiani case. He then slipped out of the country when his wife and brother-in-law were arrested. They have both since been released. ""Even IRIB [Iranian state television], they don't have any control of this program,"" Mostafaei said. ""And the point of having this program is the character assassination of people. In this program, many reports are not real."" Mostafaei noted that his client is in prison, where she is facing a death sentence. ""It's natural that she will do whatever the authorities tell her to save her own life. They are putting a lot of pressure on her to be on television. Otherwise it wouldn't be so crucial to carry out such an act. The lawyer of a person who is facing the death penalty is the person who knows the most information about the case. He is the defending attorney. The lawyer can comment on the case, not the defendant."" He noted that Ashtiani's death sentence for killing her husband had been commuted because the victim's family forgave her. ""What is important is the sentence to stone this innocent woman to death"" for adultery, he said. ""She should not be stoned to death. And this is what the international community is demanding as well. This is the main subject that the Iranian state TV broadcast and the judiciary system did not address."" He disputed the assertion that they had never met. ""I met her last year in Tabriz Prison,"" he said. ""I am her legal counsel. And my goal as her attorney is to help her survive."" Another of Ashtiani's lawyers, Hootan Kian, concurred. ""She was forced to say these things on television, 100 percent forced,"" he told CNN from Tabriz. CNN's Ivan Watson in Oslo and Mitra Mobasherat in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this story.","Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani: ""How dare you use my name, lie in my name""

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- From the boisterous crowds of stadia to a noisy assembly of mostly politicians, India's cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar faces a new test. On the website of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament, the 39-year-old is now listed as one of its nominated members. ""When you get nominated because of your contribution in your field, it's an honor,"" Tendulkar said at an event in Pune, western India on Tuesday. The sporting icon's surprise selection to the house of elders has drawn a mixed reaction in India, where cricket and politics are often seen as the opium of the masses. ""Nominating Sachin Tendulkar to the Rajya Sabha may be a populist move, but it makes little sense,"" wrote the Times of India newspaper in a comment last week. The editorial was posted under a page-one headline ""God has a new House"" that announced the naming of the revered cricketer to the national assembly. ""A nomination to the Rajya Sabha, however, should not be treated as a means of honoring eminent people but as a way to enrich parliamentary debate by having people with expertise in different fields. Nominating an active sportsperson defeats that purpose,"" the paper wrote Friday. Some of India's sports personalities were also skeptical whether an active player would be able to do justice to legislative proceedings. ""I don't know whether he (Tendulkar) has time to do that because I think he is playing international cricket; he is playing in all formats of the game,"" former cricketer Dilip Vengsarkar told reporters. ""Whether he will have time to do that? Whether he will have time to attend parliament? I really cannot say anything on this."" At the same time, many lawmakers welcomed the celebrated batsman -- who has scored more runs in international cricket than any other player in the history of the game -- to their ranks. ""I am happy for Sachin. Last time, when I spoke to the media on his birthday, I had said that I hope that government nominates him for the Rajya Sabha. There is no-one better than Sachin. I am happy,"" said Najma Heptullah, a leader from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. In March, Tendulkar became the first cricketer to score 100 international centuries. And last week, he and his wife visited the residence of Sonia Gandhi, the Italy-born head of India's ruling Congress party whose popularity has plummeted because of a raft of corruption scandals in the government. Critics of Congress, which denies any wrongdoing, issued words of caution to the cricket star. ""Sachin will perhaps have to guard against being used by political interests. He belongs to all. He is a silent lone worker, not an activist,"" tweeted Kiran Bedi, a former police officer who is now part of an anti-corruption campaign against the federal government. Tendulkar's selection to parliament comes under a constitutional provision that empowers the Indian president to name 12 people to the 250-member Rajya Sabha. The nomination, according to the constitution, is extended to people with ""special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as literature, science, art and social service."" ""Unless Sachin becomes a national voice for clean, organized sports, he would be a disappointment,"" Bedi wrote on her Twitter website page. Confronted with subtle hints of political loyalty, Tendulkar has attempted to steer clear of controversies over his new role. Cricket, he insists, will remain his priority. ""I have been nominated because I am a sportsman and not a politician. I am a sportsman and will always remain one. I am not going to enter politics giving up cricket, which is my life. I will continue to play cricket,"" he said Tuesday.","Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has been nominated to join India's parliament .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea's threatening rhetoric has reached a fever pitch, but the Pentagon and the South Korean government have said it's nothing new. ""We have no indications at this point that it's anything more than warmongering rhetoric,"" a senior Washington Defense official said late Friday. The official was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named. State media: North Korea in 'state of war' with South . The National Security Council, which advises the U.S. president on matters of war, struck a similar cord. Washington finds North Korea's statements ""unconstructive,"" and it does take the threats seriously. ""But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats, and today's announcement follows that familiar pattern,"" said Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the security council. The United States will continue to update its capabilities against any military threat from the North, which includes plans to deploy missile defense systems. No, North Korea can't hit Hawaii . North Korea's hot rhetoric . Pyongyang's propaganda machine flung new insults at the United States on Saturday. It compared the U.S. mainland with a ""boiled pumpkin,"" unable to endure an attack from a foreign foe, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. North Korea, on the other hand, could sustain an offensive from the outside, the report said. It claimed the government had built shelters around the country ""against any enemy nuclear and chemical weapons attack."" The rhetoric and military show of force by the North have heated up in the face of annual joint military exercise between South Korean and U.S. forces called Foal Eagle. The routine maneuvers are carried out in accordance with the armistice that put an end to armed hostilities in 1953. There was no peace treaty to officially end the war. North Korea's threat: Five things to know . The North Korean government declared the armistice invalid on March 11, 10 days after Foal Eagle began. It is something Pyongyang has done before during heightened tensions. In an added slap, North Korea has declared that it had entered a ""state of war"" with neighboring South Korea, according to a report Saturday from the state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""The condition, which was neither war nor peace, has ended,"" North Korea's government said in a special statement carried by KCNA. Saturday's reports also asserted any conflict ""will not be limited to a local war, but develop into an all-out war, a nuclear war."" The statements made the prospect of war contingent upon ""a military provocation ... against the DPRK"" in sensitive areas on the border between North and South. Analysis: Just what is Kim Jong Un up to? The South: It's not new . South Korea has not treated its neighbor's latest threat as imminent danger. Seoul noted scores of its personnel had entered the Kaesong Industrial Complex -- a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas situated on the North's side of the border -- on Saturday morning. Hundreds more were set to join them later in the day, seeming to suggest both sides were going about business as usual. South officials said that North threats to shut down the complex are part of the North's ""measures of putting military alert to highest level,"" but the South was taking the North's words ""seriously,"" the South Korean Unification Ministry Press Office said. The threats aren't ""beneficial"" to the development of the economic zone, the South ministry said. Currently, 310 people work in the industrial complex, the ministry said. ""Our government takes the situation seriously and is prioritizing the safety of our people in Kaesong industrial complex. Our position to maintain stability of Kaesong Industrial Complex remains unchanged,"" the press office said. The South hasn't detected, however, any ""irregular trend"" in the zone, the ministry said. On Saturday, North Korea attacked that sense of normalcy, questioning the future of the cooperation. ""The entry into the Kaesong Industrial Zone by the south side's personnel has been put in jeopardy,"" KCNA reported. The communist government accused Seoul of insulting its dignity with assertions that North Korea would not end the cooperation, because it would be too afraid of losing the revenue it brings. Pyongyang's declaration it was readying its missiles also did not seem to worry officials in the South. ""The announcement made by North Korea is not a new threat, but part of follow-up measures after North Korea's supreme command's statement that it will enter the highest military alert"" on Tuesday, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement. Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . Map appears to show U.S. targets . A day earlier, the same official North Korean news agency reported its leader Kim Jong Un had approved a plan to prepare standby rockets to hit U.S. targets in the Pacific, including in Hawaii, Guam, and South Korea. Behind North Korea's heated words about missile strikes, one analyst said, there might not be much mettle. ""Unless there has been a miraculous turnaround among North Korea's strategic forces, there is little to no chance that it could successfully land a missile on Guam, Hawaii or anywhere else outside the Korean Peninsula that U.S. forces may be stationed,"" James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defense Weekly, wrote in an opinion column published Thursday on CNN.com. Behind the veil: A rare look at life in North Korea . U.S. official: We're 'committed ... to peace' U.S. defense officials said Friday that the North's bantering is destructive. ""This is troubling rhetoric that disrupts the prospects for peace on the Peninsula,"" the senior official said. Some observers have suggested that Washington is adding to tensions in the region by drawing attention to its displays of military strength on North Korea's doorstep, such as the flights by the B-2 stealth bombers. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel argued against that assertion Thursday. ""We, the United States and South Korea, have not been involved in provocating anything,"" he said. ""We, over the years, have been engaged with South Korea on joint exercises. The B-2 flight was part of that."" Washington and its allies ""are committed to a pathway to peace,"" Hagel said. ""And the North Koreans seem to be headed in a different direction here."" Opinion: Why North Korea regime is scary . Pyongyang's allies irked . The tense situation has irritated North Korea's traditional allies China and Russia, drawing regular calls for restraint on all sides in recent weeks. Saturday, the Kremlin repeated this admonition. ""Moscow expects all parties to exercise as much responsibility and restraint as possible in light of North Korea's latest statements,"" the Russian foreign ministry said according to Russian state broadcaster Russia Today. China, which has expressed frustration over Pyongyang's latest nuclear test, also called for calm. ""We hope relevant parties can work together to turn around the tense situation in the region,"" Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei said Friday, describing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula as ""a joint responsibility."" Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt noted Saturday that ""Beijing likely to try to calm things down,"" he said on his Twitter account. ""But the Pyongyang regime is the most militarised, the most authoritarian and the most closed in the world,"" Bildt tweeted. U.S. officials concerned about North Korea's 'ratcheting up of rhetoric' Tensions have been rising for months . Tensions escalated on the Korean Peninsula after the North carried out a long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions on the secretive government. Pyongyang has expressed fury about the sanctions and the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises, due to continue until the end of April. The deteriorating relations have killed hopes of reviving multilateral talks over North Korea's nuclear program for the foreseeable future. Indeed, Pyongyang has declared that the subject is no longer up for discussion. Korean nightmare: Experts ponder potential conflict .

"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional Democrats and Republicans escalated their rhetorical war Thursday over a pending federal rule requiring religiously affiliated employers to provide full contraception coverage to women -- one day after hints emerged of a possible compromise between the White House and conservative religious critics. Numerous rank-and-file Democrats urged the White House not to back away from its support for the rule, while Republicans demanded a full retreat. ""It is time for the extreme right wing to stop playing football with women's health,"" said Rep. Nita Lowey, D-New York. ""My colleagues and I stand in solidarity with American women who have waited decades for equity in contraceptive coverage. We have fought for too long."" ""I woke up this morning in the 21st century, not in the Middle Ages,"" said. Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colorado. ""Family planning and birth control (are) an essential part of women's health."" But Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum said the issue is about the rights of churches, not women. ""This has to do with the right of a church not to spend their moral resources in a way that's inconsistent with their faith,"" the former Pennsylvania senator, a staunch conservative Catholic, told CNN's ""John King USA."" ""We're not talking about denying women the access to contraception,"" he added. ""They can go and get it. But we're talking about having a church of which they happen to choose to work for, and they know their position in working for them. You're now forcing them as a condition of employing people to pay for something that again is a grievous moral wrong."" And Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, called the proposed rule ""an attack by the federal government on religious freedom for everyone in our country and our rights of conscience."" ""It must not stand, and it will not stand, if we are going to keep the freedoms that we love and cherish in this country,"" Foxx said. Stephen Prothero says the nation's ""culture wars"" are back . The question of whether institutions with religious ties should be required to offer insurance plans covering birth control and the so-called morning after pill, among other things, hits a number of political hot buttons. Liberal groups defend the requirement on grounds of gender equality in health care; conservatives consider it a violation of the First Amendment and an infringement on religious liberty. Republican leaders have repeatedly blasted the administration's decision, raising the issue's profile on both Capitol Hill and the presidential campaign trail. Speaking on a Cincinnati radio show Thursday, Vice President Joe Biden said the Obama administration hopes to find a middle ground that would allow women to get insurance coverage for contraception while allowing an institution like the Roman Catholic Church, which opposes birth control, ""to be consistent with its teachings."" ""What I'm making a commitment is there's going to be a significant attempt to work this out, and there's time to do that,"" Biden said. ""And as a practicing Catholic, you know, I am of the view that this can be worked out and should be worked out."" Biden told radio station WLW that there has been ""a lot of misunderstanding"" about the rule. ""There's not enough focus on the fact that we've decided that there's a year to work this out so we can accommodate it,"" he said. While churches themselves are exempt from the rule, hospitals and schools with religious affiliations would have to comply. The new policy is set to go into effect on August 1, though religious groups would have a yearlong extension to implement the rule. Published polls show a slight majority of U.S. Catholics actually favor the requirement. But the Catholic media network EWTN sued the federal government Thursday, seeking to stop the mandate's implementation and get it ruled unconstitutional. ""We had no other option but to take this to the courts,"" EWTN President Michael Warsaw said. ""We are taking this action to defend not only ourselves but also to protect other institutions -- Catholic and non-Catholic, religious and secular -- from having this mandate imposed upon them."" Two other lawsuits have also been filed seeking to block the mandate. All three lawsuits are backed by the Becket Fund, a conservative religious legal organization. Some political analysts think the controversy will cost President Barack Obama votes in politically critical states like Pennsylvania and Ohio in November, while others insist it will ultimately hurt Republicans with suburban women. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that there was a deep internal administration split on the matter, with Biden and former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley warning Obama about the possibility of negative political repercussions in swing states, But several female aides -- including Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius -- urged the president to move forward with the rule, Bloomberg said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney denied the report, though he declined to offer any details. Several high-profile Democrats -- including Pennsylvania Sen. Robert Casey, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, Connecticut Rep. John Larson and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine -- pushed the White House on Wednesday to reconsider its position and expand the exemption for religious employers. Manchin joined Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, in introducing legislation Thursday that would immediately repeal the mandate. The reproductive health group Planned Parenthood condemned the bill, arguing it would let any business lift birth-control coverage for its employees ""on the basis of personal religious belief or moral conviction."" ""It should not be left up to a boss's personal beliefs whether his employees should be allowed birth control coverage,"" Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards said in a written statement. ""Birth control is basic health care and women should have access to birth control, no matter where they work. That's why a majority of Americans, including Catholics, support the Obama administration's birth control benefit."" But Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, suggested the White House change its stance. ""What I am urging is a compromise that respects the substantive goal of making sure that women have access and that no person is without the care, but at the same time that finds a way to respect issues of conscience and matters of religious belief. I think there is a balance,"" Kerry told reporters. ""I do know the president is sensitive to this,"" Kerry said. Policymakers are examining laws in 28 states that have similar coverage requirements, senior administration sources said. Two sources have told CNN that the administration is particularly interested in the Hawaii model, in which female employees of religious institutions can purchase contraceptive coverage directly from the insurer at the same price offered to employees of all other employers. Another possible solution, one source said, would be legislation allowing women employed by religiously affiliated employers to get contraceptive insurance from the exchanges created under Obama's sweeping health care reform rather than from their employer's insurer. Sources familiar with White House thinking said the administration is is convinced approval from conservative Catholics is out of reach and is trying to win over progressive Catholics. New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said Thursday that the decision to require full contraception coverage was a ""terribly misguided judgment."" ""We can't compromise on principle. That's almost rewarding bad behavior,"" Dolan told ""CBS This Morning."" On Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called the policy an ""unambiguous attack on religious freedom"" and announced his chamber would pursue legislative action to prevent the rule from going into effect. And on the presidential campaign trail, GOP front-runner Mitt Romney has pledged to eliminate the rule on his first day in office. Both the White House and Romney's Republican opponents, however, have noted a Massachusetts law in effect, while Romney was governor that required hospitals -- including Catholic ones -- to provide emergency contraception to rape victims. It's ironic for Romney to criticize ""the president for pursuing a policy that is virtually identical to the one that was in place when he was governor of Massachusetts,"" Carney said Wednesday. Romney, in turn, said Carney needs to ""check his history."" In 2005 then-Gov. Romney vetoed a bill that would have required all hospitals -- including Catholic hospitals -- to provide emergency contraception. The heavily Democratic state legislature overrode his veto. According to news reports at the time, Romney initially said his administration would not enforce the law at Catholic hospitals. But he later reversed course, saying all hospitals would have to supply the morning-after pill. Romney was quoted at the time as saying, ""My personal view in my heart of hearts is that people who are subject to rape should have the option of having emergency contraception or emergency contraception information."" ""I worked very hard to get the legislature to remove all of the mandated coverages, including contraception,"" Romney told reporters Wednesday. This ""was a provision that got there before I did, and it was one that I fought to remove."" Romney's campaign released a statement from former U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Mary Ann Glendon on Thursday defending Romney's past stance on the issue. ""The charge that Mitt Romney has not stood tall to defend freedom of religion is preposterous,"" Glendon said. ""He has shown backbone on every critical issue at every juncture when it counted.""

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson apologized Wednesday for ""crude and hurtful"" remarks he made about Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama after an interview with a Fox News correspondent. The Rev. Jesse Jackson apologized to Sen. Obama's campaign Wednesday over ""hurtful"" remarks. The remarks came Sunday as Jackson was talking to a fellow interviewee, UnitedHealth Group executive Dr. Reed V. Tuckson. An open microphone picked up Jackson whispering, ""See, Barack's been talking down to black people ... I want to cut his nuts off."" Jackson told CNN's ""Situation Room"" that he didn't realize the microphone was on. ""It was very private,"" Jackson said, adding that if ""any hurt or harm has been caused to his campaign, I apologize."" An Obama campaign spokesman, Bill Burton, said that the senator from Illinois ""of course accepts Rev. Jackson's apology.""  Watch Jackson whisper comments about Obama » . Jackson's son, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois -- co-chair of Obama's presidential campaign -- publicly blasted his father's comments Wednesday. ""I'm deeply outraged and disappointed in Rev. Jackson's reckless statements about Sen. Barack Obama,"" the younger Jackson said. ""His divisive and demeaning comments about the presumptive Democratic nominee -- and I believe the next president of the United States -- contradict his inspiring and courageous career."" Jackson Jr. added that he'll ""always love"" his father. But, he said, ""I thoroughly reject and repudiate his ugly rhetoric."" The elder Jackson repeated his apology in a news conference in Chicago a couple of hours before Fox News aired Sunday's remarks. He said he wanted to address the issue publicly before the cable network aired the comment, because ""I know that they will further violate the context of it."" Earlier, Jackson told CNN he felt ""very distressed because I'm supportive of this campaign and with the senator.""  Watch more of Jackson's apology on CNN » . ""I was in a conversation with a fellow guest on Sunday. He asked about Barack's speeches lately at the black churches. I said he comes down as speaking down to black people,"" Jackson said. In a recent Father's Day speech at a black church, Obama took absent black fathers to task, saying, ""We need them to realize that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child -- it's the courage to raise one."" While Jackson didn't cite any particular comment, he told CNN that Obama's message to black voters must be broader and serve as more than a ""moral challenge."" The black community is faced with high levels of unemployment, home foreclosures and violence, ""so we have some real serious issues -- not just moral issues,"" he said. However, Jackson said after finding out about the open microphone, he immediately contacted the Obama campaign to apologize. Burton, Obama's spokesman, said the senator is quite familiar with the issues facing African-Americans and that ""he will continue to speak out about our responsibilities to ourselves."" ""As someone who grew up without a father in the home, Sen. Obama has spoken and written for many years about the issue of parental responsibility, including the importance of fathers participating in their children's lives,"" Burton said. ""He also discusses our responsibility as a society to provide jobs, justice, and opportunity for all."" The Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the civil rights group National Action Network, said Jackson's remarks were ""most unfortunate,"" adding he was happy that Jackson apologized. ""I hope people will remember the great work he's done in this country as one assesses this last incident,"" Sharpton said in a statement. Sharpton said people ""must be careful not to segregate Sen. Obama and impose some litmus test that is unfair and unproductive."" ""We must be very clear that Sen. Obama ... is running for president for all Americans, not just African-Americans -- which is why most Americans have embraced his campaign,"" Sharpton said. At Wednesday evening's news conference in Chicago, Jackson said: ""I have supported Barack's campaign with passion from the very beginning.""  Watch Jackson's comments in Chicago » . Jackson, whose Rainbow/PUSH Coalition is based in Chicago, has publicly endorsed Obama, most recently in a piece published Tuesday in the Chicago Sun-Times, and said he enjoys a close relationship with the Obama family. The incident is the latest of several in which the issue of Obama's relationship with the African-American community has become a part of the campaign, raised either by opponents or by Obama's allies. Nearly two weeks ago, Ralph Nader -- who is running his own presidential campaign as an independent -- accused Obama of attempting to ""talk white"" and appealing to ""white guilt"" in his quest for the White House. ""There's only one thing different about Barack Obama when it comes to being a Democratic presidential candidate. He's half African-American,"" Nader told Colorado's Rocky Mountain News in a June 26 story. Obama is still bouncing back from the weeks-long controversy over his former minister, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whose fiery sermons at Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ drew unwanted attention for the campaign. In the sermons, Wright suggested the U.S. government may be responsible for the spread of AIDS in the black community and equated some American wartime activities to terrorism. Wright's sermons and his eccentric behavior at later public appearances became a major political headache for the Obama campaign, especially since Wright officiated the senator's wedding, baptized both of his children and was a spiritual adviser to his presidential campaign until he was asked to step down in March. This week's remarks by Jackson were not the first time he criticized Obama. Last fall, he was critical of Obama's reaction to the severe charges filed against six black students in the beating of a white student in Jena, Louisiana, a racially charged case that sparked a national outcry. Jackson accused Obama of ""acting like he's white,"" according to a South Carolina newspaper that cited a speech by Jackson at the historically black Benedict College in Columbia. ""If I were a candidate, I'd be all over Jena,"" Jackson said, according to the The State newspaper. ""Jena is a defining moment, just like Selma [Alabama] was a defining moment."" The newspaper reported Jackson later said he did not recall saying Obama is ""acting like he's white,"" but he continued to criticize Obama and other presidential candidates for not bringing more attention to the issue. During the Democratic primary race, Jackson also said Sen. John Edwards was the only candidate speaking to the issues of the black community. He later apologized.

"(CNN) -- Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday called new U.S. penalties against firms violating sanctions against Iran illegal and a crime against humanity, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported. ""We should resist such an aggression with all might and power,"" Rouhani said at a news conference in Tehran, according to the news agency. ""We consider some of the sanctions crimes against humanity. Definitely, we will resist any sanction."" His remarks come one day after the United States imposed new penalties against more than 30 individuals and companies, including banks, accused of providing U.S. dollar banknotes to Iran, supporters of Iran's missile and nuclear programs and sellers of Iranian oil, according to a U.S. officials. Several overseas airlines also were targeted for allegedly ferrying weapons and personnel to Syria in support of the Assad regime there. A senior U.S. administration official said the actions were meant to demonstrate that the U.S. and partner countries were active in ongoing negotiations over Iran's nuclear program and will aggressively enforce existing sanctions. ""The message that we have conveyed has been very clear, which is that Iran can only obtain the sanctions relief, the comprehensive sanctions relief that it so desperately needs, by addressing the concerns with its nuclear program at the negotiating table,"" the senior administration official said. In a statement, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the additional sanctions were aimed at ""several companies and individuals engaged in activities such as assistance to Iran's nuclear program, support for terrorism, or aiding Iran's evasion of international sanctions."" ""Just as we announced these measures and continue to enforce pre-existing sanctions on Iran, the United States remains committed to working with our P5+1 partners toward a long-term, comprehensive solution that provides confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful,"" Hayden said.

"(CNN) -- London has spent billions preparing to host the 2012 Olympics, constructing state of the art stadiums, overhauling transport links and installing anti-aircraft missiles to beef up security. But there is one thing organizers can't control: The Great British Weather. Recently two titanic events of the sporting summer -- tennis at Wimbledon and Formula One's British Grand Prix -- have been hit by violent storms and the persistent rain that has been stalking the UK for months. Only this week a major concert in London was canceled after a series of severe deluges rendered Hyde Park unsafe for the thousands of fans who bought tickets. With just 15 days to go until the opening ceremony and forecasters predicting more turbulence ahead, Olympic officials and their government partners are making contingency plans for those events that could be decimated by adverse weather. As well as umbrellas, a mass of red, white and blue ponchos will be on sale to keep patrons dry, yet those who have spent the most on tickets -- up to £2,012 ($3,100) in some cases -- could well be stationed in the parts of the Olympic Stadium that aren't fully sheltered. Many events, such as the beach volleyball on Horse Guard's Parade and the show jumping in Greenwich Park, are open and vulnerable to whatever the elements decide to throw at them. Photos: Olympic sports add variety to photographer 'diet' The W-Factor . But despite fears the July 27-August 12 sporting extravaganza could be a washout, the London Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) has stressed that combating the challenges the UK's unique climate offers has featured heavily in its seven years of meticulous planning. ""I don't think the issue of the weather has kept anyone awake at night,"" a spokesperson said. ""We've had several years of detailed planning and I think this comes with any major outdoor sporting event. You have to factor the weather into your plans, and we have done. ""The weather in the UK is what it is -- changeable. People organize sporting events all year round and deal with the weather, so the Olympics is no different in that regard -- but there is planning in place if there is extreme weather so we can deal with it and the Games can continue."" LOCOG said there was enough flexibility in the Games program to reschedule events if necessary. The grass in Greenwich Park has been treated for three years to ensure it is better able to cope with any downpours that may occur during the equestrian events, LOCOG said, while the dressage arena is built on a platform to shield it from any surface water. In addition, there are five alternative venues for sailing, should they be required, and a team of meteorologists from the Met Office -- the UK's national weather service -- will be stationed at various locations to provide up-to-the-minute forecasts. LOCOG's confidence is shared by the UK government, which is footing the extensive bill that comes with hosting the four-yearly showpiece. Photos: The art of shooting the Olympics . Government's guarantee . Sports minister Hugh Robertson said most venues are ""reasonably weatherproof."" ""It won't surprise you to learn we've been spending quite a bit of time on this, given the way June and July have gone,"" he was quoted as saying by The Guardian newspaper. ""The Thames would have to rise a huge amount before the rowing is under the threat; the mountain biking is up a mountain and if it's a bit muddy it doesn't matter; the canoeing is an artificial venue; the football pitches shouldn't be a problem. ""There is sufficient slippage in the individual programs in various sports to cater for a certain amount of this. With hockey, which you can't play if there is a tropical monsoon going on, there is enough slippage in the program to enable you to reschedule the matches."" All facets within organizers' control have been covered, Robertson said, and he confidently predicted those attending the first Olympics in London since 1948 wouldn't let the weather dampen their spirits. ""It would be nice if the weather was perfect. It's completely out of our control,"" he said. ""The British themselves are pretty stoic; there is a long tradition of watching sport in rain macs or listening to Cliff Richard or whatever. It has rather dogged this project since we went to Greece (to receive the Olympic flame) and it rained. ""People who come to watch the Olympics tend not to be born yesterday, they tend to do a bit of research. Anyone coming to this country this year probably know they are going to get a drop of rain. Regardless of the weather, we will have a great party. The fun of the party will overcome the inconvenience of the rain."" Olympic-level security underway . Queen's rain . Should the heavens open, it won't be the first time inclement weather has put a soggy spin on huge celebrations in the English capital, or that the famous British ""stiff upper lip"" has been deployed to combat depressing conditions. Many regions of the UK were officially in drought conditions in early spring, but there has been a deluge since late April. The Queen's Jubilee celebrations were hit by torrential rain, as the Royal Family had to brave the wet and chilly conditions during a flotilla procession down the Thames, albeit undercover. The tennis at Wimbledon wouldn't be the same unless it was punctuated by breaks for rain, and sure enough, the weather forced organizers into a well-worn routine of rescheduling. The installation of a roof on Centre Court in 2009 has allowed some of the game's biggest names to complete their matches, and came to the rescue again this year when a heavy shower adjourned the men's singles final between Andy Murray and Roger Federer. While the weather didn't interrupt the British Grand Prix it did turn camping areas for the 120,000 fans who attended into a mud bath, with organizers asking those with cars to stay away from Saturday's qualifying. Why so wet? The reason for this particularly soggy summer, meteorologists say, is to do with the position of the all-important jet stream to the south of England, when it should usually be stationed far further north. It has already produced the wettest June the UK has seen since records began in 1910, with July continuing in a similar vein. One of the Met Office's observation towers, next to Weymouth, the venue for the sailing events during the Olympics, has already seen three times the average rainfall in the opening 11 days of the month. ""The jet stream is a narrow band of fast flowing winds that run from west to east across the Atlantic and it effectively steers low pressure systems, so with it running to the south it's steering those low pressure systems over the UK,"" the Met Office's Dan Williams told CNN. ""We're in the UK, we have Great British weather and that as we know can entail lots of different weather, sometimes in the same day or even less time than that. ""Our advice to those going to the Olympics is to keep up to date with the forecast to know whether to pack your sunscreen, a poncho or both. Always go prepared for whatever the weather has in store."" Though the Met Office is reluctant to nail its colors to the mast in terms of a detailed Olympic forecast, its website does say a lengthy spell of hot, sunny weather looks ""unlikely."" The British obsession with the weather is well documented even when there isn't an Olympic summer to contend with, but with the biggest event in world sport approaching, the nation's eyes are sure to be glued to the forecast right up until the opening ceremony kicks off.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran has put the stoning sentence of a woman convicted of adultery and murder ""on hold,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast told state-run Press TV on Wednesday. While the statement did not differ greatly from previous, sometimes contradictory reports from the Iranian government about the fate of the woman, Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, it did indicate continued attention to the murder aspect of her case. ""The sentencing of Ms. Ashtiani for adultery has been stopped and (her case) is being reviewed again, and her sentencing for complicity in murder is in process,"" Mehmanparast said. Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning, but her son and human rights activists urged help for her this summer, prompting an international outcry. There have been conflicting reports about the murder charge, which relates to the death of Ashtiani's husband. Ashtiani's previous lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, said last month his client had been sentenced to death for the crime but that the sentence was commuted because the victim's family forgave her. Ashtiani, however, told the British newspaper The Guardian last month that she was acquitted of the murder in 2006. Ashtiani, who spoke to the newspaper through an intermediary, said the man who actually killed her husband was identified and imprisoned for the crime. Mehmanparast said those concerned about Ashtiani's condition should have some consideration for the family of the victim, according to Press TV. ""Defending a person on trial for murder should not be turned into a human rights matter,"" Mehmanparast said. Ashtiani gave an interview to state-run TV last month in which she said she knew about a plot to kill her husband but that she had not taken it seriously at the time. ""The man entered my life and fooled me with his words and said let's kill my husband,"" she said in the interview, which was criticized by human rights groups. ""He fooled me and said I'll do this for you, what a bad husband, I'll take care of you. He was my husband's cousin, and he said things about my husband. ""Then I realized, when I went to prison, he had a criminal record and that this was his third criminal record, and when he said we should kill my husband, I couldn't even believe him or that my husband would die, I thought he was joking, that he had lost his mind. ""When my husband's mother was at our house one day and I went to get her medicine, I saw him there with all the tools he had bought, including electrical tools, wires and gloves. Then he killed my husband by connecting him to electricity with the electrical wires. He had told me beforehand to send my kids to their grandmother's house."" The prosecutor of East Azerbaijan Province, Malek Ajdar Sharifi, said on the same program that ""the deceased was given an injection to fall asleep by his wife, then the man arrived and put him into the bath and put two electrical lines on his body and killed the deceased."" The human rights group Amnesty International criticized the interview, saying Ashtiani may have been coerced. CNN's Gena Somra contributed to this report.","Iran has made previous, similar statements amid international outcry .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Azerbaijan have arrested 22 people they say were spying for Iran and plotting attacks on Israeli and Western targets, the government announced Wednesday. A statement from the central Asian nation's national security ministry said the group stands accused of spying, treason and ""other grave crimes."" It did not indicate when the arrests were made. The spy ring dates back to 1999 and had been supplied with money, military training and weapons, the statement said. Under the instruction of Iranian handlers, its members ""were spying, collecting and delivering information to use against the national security of the Republic of Azerbaijan,"" the statement said. In addition, it said, they were seeking new recruits. The Iranians started by recruiting Karimov Niyazi Alovsat while he was on a visit to Tehran in 1999, the statement said. He was promised large sums of money to find others who would carry out sabotage and terror attacks ""against the embassies, representations and organizations of the U.S., Israel and the Western countries in Baku,"" Azerbaijan's capital, the ministry said. He and other suspects attended military training camps in Iran, where they mastered weapons and explosives skills, the statement said. They also gathered information in Azerbaijan about potential targets. Firearms, ammunition and explosives were found when properties connected to the suspects were searched, the ministry said. No group or individuals linked to Iran have ever carried out an attack against U.S., Western or Israeli targets in Azerbaijan, an oil-rich nation that lies on the Caspian Sea. Relations between Azerbaijan and Iran, which share a border, have grown increasingly rocky since the government in Baku started building relations with the United States and Israel, supporting sanctions against Iran, and supporting the many Iranian Azeris' calls for an independent state. Many in Iran are of the view that the Azerbaijan government is in the pocket of the U.S. government because of the economic aid and military support it receives from Washington. And Wednesday's arrests of suspects with reported ties to Iran are not the first in Azerbaijan. Baku announced last month that a number of people had been arrested in connection with an alleged Iranian-organized plot against foreign citizens. The National Security Ministry said the plotters had acquired weapons and explosives. And in January, Azeri authorities arrested two local people allegedly plotting an attack on the Israeli ambassador and a rabbi in the country's small Jewish community. It said they, too, had worked with a criminal figure who had links to Iranian intelligence. In turn, Iran has furiously accused Azerbaijan of allowing the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, to launch terrorist operations across the border. Israeli and Western counterterrorism officials believe that elements within the Iranian regime most likely sponsored the plots in Azerbaijan, looking for revenge after the killing of several Iranian nuclear scientists. Iran has strenuously denied involvement, accusing Israel and the United States of trying to provoke conflict. Azeri Defense Minister Safar Abiyev pledged Tuesday in Tehran not to allow other nations to use Azerbaijan's territory to launch attacks on other countries, particularly Iran, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. His comments followed a warning from Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi last month against aiding Israel in such attacks, the news agency reported. CNN's Igor Krotov, Mitra Mobasherat and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","NEW: Iran has rejected previous claims by Azerbaijan of involvement in plots on its soil .

"(CNN) -- Beatles star Paul McCartney became the latest high-profile figure to sign a letter calling on Scottish voters to choose to remain part of the United Kingdom in a vote on independence next month. Other famous signatories to the so-called ""Letter to Scotland,"" organized by the Let's Stay Together campaign, include Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger, physicist Stephen Hawking, actress Dame Judi Dench and celebrity TV producer Simon Cowell. The campaign describes itself as a UK-wide effort giving a voice to ""everyone who doesn't have a vote in the decision to break up Britain."" Anyone living in Scotland who is aged 16 and over on September 18 will be able to vote in the referendum. However, Scots living outside Scotland don't have a vote, nor do the residents of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland has been part of the United Kingdom for more than 300 years. McCartney added his name to the open letter while the campaign was canvassing for support in Liverpool. National treasure . Addressed to the voters of Scotland, the letter reads: ""The decision on whether to leave our shared country is, of course, absolutely yours alone. ""Nevertheless, that decision will have a huge effect on all of us in the rest of the United Kingdom. ""We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you, and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them. ""What unites us is much greater than what divides us. Let's stay together."" ""We are absolutely delighted to be able to have Sir Paul's support for Let's Stay Together, as he is not only a national treasure but somebody who loves Scotland for what it is: a beautiful and inspiring country, and one that we are proud to count as part of the United Kingdom,"" a post on the Let's Stay Together blog said. McCartney, who owns a farm in Scotland, co-wrote the hit song ""Mull of Kintyre"" there in 1977 with his band Wings, formed after the Beatles split. 'Bad for business' On Wednesday, more than 120 business leaders, employing 50,000 people in Scotland, published an open letter in The Scotsman newspaper in which they said the ""business case"" for separation had not been made. ""Uncertainty surrounds a number of vital issues including currency, regulation, tax, pensions, EU membership and support for our exports around the world; and uncertainty is bad for business,"" it said. Prime Minister David Cameron backed their appeal in a speech Thursday to business leaders in Glasgow. ""Scottish businesses deserve the security and opportunities a United Kingdom brings,"" he said on Twitter. The ""Yes"" campaign, led by the Scottish National Party, has its own celebrity backers who are calling for independence, such as Sean Connery and fellow Scottish actors Brian Cox and Alan Cumming, and comedian Frankie Boyle. Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader Alec Salmond has been a vocal proponent of independence. The Scottish government, led by the Scottish National Party, says this is a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity"" for Scotland's people to take control of the decisions that affect them most.

"(CNN)  -- Pirates have struck again, this time capturing a Greek cargo ship in waters off Somalia on Thursday evening, a Greek government spokesman said. The ship was seized in the Gulf of Aden on its way to South Korea with a load of iron, an official with Greece's Merchant Marine Ministry said. The ship, the ""Titan,"" has a crew of 24 and is owned by Albamar Shipping, the official said. Seventeen crew members are Filipino, three are Greek, three are Romanian and one is Ukrainian, the official said. Pirating off the coast of Somalia has increased over the past four or five years as fishermen from Somalia realize that pirating is more lucrative. The crime, which is hard to prevent, has raised concerns internationally. In 2008, pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 off Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau. In response, two Japanese destroyers set sail last week on an anti-piracy mission off Somalia, the Japanese defense ministry said.","Pirates seize Greek cargo ship the ""Titan"" off Somlia, crew of 24 on board .

"(CNN) -- It was a promise that seemed to owe as much to optimism and sentimentality as reason. When the notoriously passionate fans of Vegalta Sendai, a small, understated soccer club playing in Japan's J-League, stood before their team as they took on Kawasaki Frontale, they unfurled a large banner for the world to see. ""Thank you for all [our] friends,"" it read. ""We do not lose until we regain a hometown."" Yet it is a promise that Vegalta Sendai has managed to keep. Sendai, and its football club, were devastated in Japan's earthquake and tsunami. But since the restart of the Japanese football league, the unfashionable club has gone on a remarkable run, remaining unbeaten this season with a chance to secure their very first league title in the face of disaster. Since it began life 23 years ago, Vegalta Sendai has led something of a quiet life, spending almost all of its time in Japan's second division, before finally wining promotion to Japan's top tier in 2009. But on March 11, that all changed. When the 9.0 magnitude earthquake unleashed its full power off the northeast coast of Japan, Sendai was one of the places hardest by the subsequent tsunami. Thousands of people were left dead or missing across the country; every aspect of life was touched by tragedy, and the city's football club was no exception. Its training ground was destroyed and the team's stadium declared unplayable, deemed to be ""in ruins,"" according to J-League chairman Kazumi Ohigashi. The J-League was suspended, with many calling for it to be cancelled outright for that season. ""Immediately after the earthquake and tsunami we, as a team, wondered if we should, and could, continue to play soccer,"" the team's coach, Makoto Teguramori, told CNN. But when the controversial decision was made to restart the league, the players and management decided that they could play an important role in getting the region back up on its feet. ""We have been determined to be the symbol of hope for the entire Tohoku Region [the northeast region of Japan's Honshu island] and to lead and encourage the reconstruction efforts with our strong performance,"" added Teguramori. The team duly delivered. After the fans had displayed their banner, Vegalta Sendai beat Kawasaki Frontale 2-1. And they've kept winning. They remain unbeaten and sit just one point off the league leaders Kashiwa Reysol. ""The biggest job for us was to overcome the shock of devastation and to prepare all the players ready for the matches mentally,"" said Makoto Teguramori. One player, the Brazilian striker Marquinho, was so shaken up that he couldn't continue and returned to South America. ""The departure of Marquinho was a big blow to the team. However, the other players all felt that it could not have been helped as it was due to his family matter and that the gap created by his departure would need to be filled by the rest of the team which led the entire team to a stronger and closer sense of unity,"" said Teguramori. ""This united spirit, we believe, is also the key to overcoming the trial of the earthquake and tsunami damages."" That Vegalta Sendai is even fulfilling fixtures is remarkable enough, but given the club's underachievement over the years, its unbeaten run is even more impressive. ""Sendai has a long history of getting so close to promotion to the J1 league [Japanese football's top tier] and could not make it,"" explained Koji Takao, a writer for Japan's Weekly Soccer magazine. ""They waited, waited, and waited and after seven long years, finally they got promoted... It's the people's club as well. There's one big shareholder but the Sendai city and Miyagi prefecture own the majority of the shares. ""People in Sendai are passionate about sports. Some follow both baseball and football and it's quite unusual in Japan."" Few would deny that Vegalta Sendai would be fitting winners of what has already been an extraordinary J-League season. There are still 22 league games to play, starting with this week's match against Shimizu S-Pulse. ""The disaster in Sendai region has inspired the players, staff, and the entire Vegalta Sendai club with great performances and results,"" explained Afshin Ghotbi, the American-Iranian coach of Shimizu S-Pulse, who had only been in charge for one game before the March 11 disaster struck. ""The restart of the league has been important and symbolic of the courage, resilience and fighting spirit of Japanese people. The attendance has been slowly recovering...If their [Vegalta Sendai's] results can help the people in the recovery and healing process, this may a great gift of football."" Ghotbi will be hoping to end that run on Sunday, and the club themselves, whose players have been involved in the clean up operation whilst also running football training camp for homeless children, maintain that the championship is a long way away. ""If we play football, it is a first step towards normality,"" said Teguramori. ""As football is a team game, it is a sport where we can demonstrate strength of unity. We can inspire spectators with our spirited play and for those dedicated fans our victory would be something special to give them courage in life."" But Vegalta Sendai's fans who held their hopeful banner against Kawasaki Frontale back in April will be dreaming of the ultimate fairytale ending. After all, a promise is a promise.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Bush administration told the CIA in 2002 that its interrogators working abroad would not violate U.S. prohibitions against torture unless they ""have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering,"" according to a previously secret Justice Department memo released Thursday. Former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft testifies before Congress July 17 about waterboarding. The interrogator's ""good faith"" and ""honest belief"" that the interrogation will not cause such suffering protects the interrogator, the memo adds. ""Because specific intent is an element of the offense, the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture,"" Jay Bybee, then the assistant attorney general, wrote in the memo. The 18-page memo is heavily redacted, with 10 of its 18 pages completely blacked out and only a few paragraphs legible on the others. Another memo released Thursday advises that ""the waterboard,"" or simulated drowning, does ""not violate the Torture Statute."" It also cites a number of warnings against torture, including statements by President Bush and a then-new Supreme Court ruling ""which raises possible concerns about future U.S. judicial review of the [interrogation] Program."" A third memo instructs interrogators to keep records of sessions in which ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" are used. The memo is signed by then-CIA director George Tenet and dated January 28, 2003. The memos were made public by the American Civil Liberties Union, which obtained the three CIA-related documents under Freedom of Information Act requests. ""These documents supply further evidence, if any were needed, that the Justice Department authorized the CIA to torture prisoners in its custody,"" said Jameel Jaffer, director of the ACLU National Security Project. The Bush administration has consistently denied that the United States tortures detainees. Reports say the CIA waterboarded three ""high-value detainees,"" including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, although former Justice Department official Daniel Levin suggested in congressional testimony in June that there had been more than three instances of the practice, which critics call torture. The third document released Thursday was blacked out except for a line saying ""Unless otherwise approved by Headquarters, CIA officers (redacted) may use only Permissible Interrogation Techniques. Permissible Interrogation Techniques consist of both (a) Standard Techniques and (b) Enhanced Techniques,"" plus the instruction for interrogators to keep records of sessions in which enhanced interrogation techniques are used.","Previously secret Justice Department memo released Thursday .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese Internet users have come out in strong support of American data leaker Edward Snowden, with many calling on Hong Kong to refuse handing him over to the United States should an extradition request be made. The former intelligence contractor's presence in Hong Kong, having fled his life in Hawaii in order to leak details of the National Security Agency's Prism surveillance program, has been a hot topic on Chinese micro-blogging site Sina Weibo. Snowden's name was one of the top-ranked current affairs topics on the site, as Internet users discussed the revelations. Users were typically supportive of the 29-year old, who is believed to still be in Hong Kong after having checked out of his hotel Monday, with many commending his courage in exposing the secret surveillance program. ""He is brave. He is a real fighter for human rights. Now he is in China, we should protect him,"" wrote Beijing-based user Xiaodong Wang, a view echoed by a user named Sunflower, from Suzhou. ""Beijing should support Hong Kong to provide asylum for him."" Another user, Blue Sky, extended the greeting: ""Welcome to China!"" while Beijing-based Chow Kat described Snowden as a ""true hero."" ""I wish him the best. The situation is very tricky,"" Chow Kat added. What's next for Snowden? Snowden's actions in leaking classified national security information have placed him in a precarious situation in which all his ""options are bad,"" he told The Guardian, the British newspaper which broke the story. ""Yes, I could be rendered by the CIA. I could have people come after me. Or any of the third party partners."" U.S. authorities have started a criminal investigation, but have not yet issued a request for Snowden's extradition. Snowden said he had chosen Hong Kong as a refuge due to the former British colony's record on the issue of free speech and commitment to the right of political dissent. But many observers believe Snowden has scant chance of avoiding U.S. authorities, citing an extradition treaty signed between the U.S. and Hong Kong in 1996, shortly before the colony was handed back to Beijing. Who is Edward Snowden? Many Sina Weibo users shared this pessimistic view of Snowden's prospects. ""Snowden picked the wrong place to hide. He will surely be killed,"" wrote user Juren, from Zhongshan, a view echoed by Beijing-based Guoxiang Wang. ""The CIA will try to kill him no matter where he hides."" A user with the handle Ponka wrote that ""China will definitely deport him,"" while Taipei-based Weimang Sun thundered against the notion: ""Whoever hands him over to the U.S. imperialists will be a traitor to the nation."" Sunny Gemini, a user from Beijing, saw the scandal as highlighting the similarities between the U.S. and China, despite their different political systems. ""Any government ... is unreliable. They prefer to control everything, no matter whether a democratic or non-democratic regime."" On the other hand, the user wrote, at least in a democracy ""the media has the right to write about it and help to improve the system,"" adding that similar revelations could never be made in China. Leak journalist says more surveillance revelations on the way . Beijing-based user Flying to the Stars said the disclosures about the secret surveillance program were unsurprising.

"(CNN) -- Today, as we mourn the loss of one of history's most transformational leaders, let us also pay tribute to his life and legacy. Let us dedicate ourselves to remembering his lessons and continue his efforts to spread democracy, freedom and equality across the globe. Nelson Mandela was a civil rights activist, teacher, freedom fighter, ""Father of the Nation,"" political prisoner, father, husband and an inspiration to the entire global community. He fought for democracy, not only in his own home of South Africa, but across the world. He explained: ""To be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others."" Years after organizing against apartheid in front of the South African Embassy in Washington, I first had the honor of meeting Mr. Mandela in 1993 when I escorted him to President Clinton's Inaugural event at the D.C. Armory. A year later, I went to South Africa to help train election workers and had the privilege of meeting him again. A man of great dignity and curiosity, he was anxious to know how we went about organizing political campaigns and getting people involved in politics. He was eager to hear stories from many of us who had worked in the segregated Deep South. Like so many others fighting for progress, I have drawn inspiration from Nelson Mandela. He showed us that it was possible to create lasting change, peace and stability even in the most formidable circumstances. He was an advocate for the downtrodden and believed that, ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."" A great warrior has died. A man who dedicated his life to liberating his country from apartheid and transform his nation and continent. Nelson Mandela was the President of a New South Africa: An optimist who believed he could help lead the country away from its violent past and to bring people from all walks of life together. President Barack Obama and the first lady said it best, ""Nelson Mandela's personal story is one of unbreakable will, unwavering integrity and abiding humility.""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has urged India to scale back troop deployments along the countries' shared border in order to ease regional tensions following last month's massacre in the Indian city of Mumbai. An Indian border guard stands on duty at the India-Pakistan Wagah Border Post crossing. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said in a statement made to state television Tuesday that India should withdraw its security forces to peacetime positions and deactivate air bases near the border. In return, Pakistan would pull back its troops as well, Qureshi added. But India's External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee took issue, saying New Delhi hadn't done anything to escalate the situation between the nuclear-armed neighbors. ""We have not escalated any tension between India and Pakistan, so where is the question of de-escalating it?"" Mukherjee told reporters. An Indian army spokesman denied Saturday that any troop mobilization was taking place but told CNN that the army was watching the situation closely. But Pakistani authorities insist they have information to show Indian troop movements along the border. Reports on Friday that Pakistan had redeployed military resources on its eastern border with India raised concerns last week. An official in Pakistan's Foreign Office said Pakistani troop movements were in response to Indian troop movements and any scale back would follow the right signals from India. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said a Pakistani official told him 20,000 soldiers had been moved from the Afghanistan border toward the Indian border. That amount, he said, was not significant, as Pakistan has a very large army. Singh said no communication had been received from Pakistan about troop movements, but added that the Indian army was always on alert. India accuses Pakistan of harboring militant organizations and claims 10 attackers involved in last month's Mumbai attacks trained at a terrorist camp in the Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir. Militants launched a coordinated strike against luxury hotels, a Jewish center and other targets in Mumbai beginning November 26, killing 160 people. India has criticized Islamabad for not doing enough to counter terrorism, and it has accused elements within the Pakistan government and military of complicity in fueling terrorism in the region. Since the division of the subcontinent in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three wars, including two over the disputed territory of Kashmir -- now wracked by an 18-year, bloody separatist campaign that authorities say has left at least 43,000 dead. There also was a limited border conflict in 1999 between the countries in Kashmir.

Kardashian has already warned her fans not to believe anything until they hear it from her, so take these bits of gossip with an engagement-ring sized rock of salt. For those having a hard time keeping up with this Kardashian and her wedding details, here's a roundup of everything we've heard so far: . Where's it going to be? The short answer: Europe. The long answer depends on whom you ask. Kardashian has said that she and West, who popped the question last October, had their sights set on marrying in Paris. But lately there's been a lot of chatter that Kardashian and West will have their rehearsal dinner in France before tying the knot in Florence, Italy. The gossip is that the location has special meaning to them, with West being quoted as telling Florence's La Nazione newspaper that he thinks their daughter, North, was conceived there, ""among the masterpieces of the Renaissance."" For what it's worth, Us Weekly says it has spotted wedding preparations at Florence's Forte di Belvedere, although E! reports the couple held their rehearsal dinner in France at the Palace of Versailles on Friday night. The lavish affair's guest list reportedly ranged from fashion designer Valentino to movie producer Joel Silver to ""Real Housewife"" NeNe Leakes and featured a performance by Lana Del Rey, a surprise arranged by West for his bride-to-be. ""Everyone was crying! So beautiful,"" sources told E! Aren't they already married? According to Kardashian, no. In early May there was a Life and Style Weekly report that Kardashian and West had already obtained their marriage license, but she personally denied that claim. So who's invited? Here's where the speculation gets interesting. There has been a lot of attention paid to whether West's friend and musical collaborator, Jay Z, would be in attendance with his wife, Beyonce. Obviously, those two have had some personal issues sprout up in recent weeks, which is fueling the fire on which celebrity is attending and why. In early may, People magazine reported that neither Jay Z nor Beyonce would be attending the nuptials, because the couple is preparing for their summer ""On the Run"" tour and ""the wedding hoopla is reportedly just too much for the power couple to make the trip."" Now, however, Us Weekly reports that Jay Z is attending the wedding but that Queen Bey is ""still a 'maybe.'"" One person who will definitely be missing at the ceremony is ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" executive producer Ryan Seacrest, who has already said he's not going. Guests expected to attend include members of the Kardashian-Jenner family but minus Brody Jenner, John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, fashion designer Rachel Roy, Vogue contributing editor Andre Leon Talley, star trainer Gunnar Peterson, and the usual assortment of Kardashian pals (Jonathan Cheban, La La Anthony, Brittny Gastineau, etc.). More importantly, what will they bring? We're not sure, but we've heard Kardashian's ex Ray J is planning to gift the newlyweds with a portion of his yearly profits from the sex tape he made with the bride-to-be. How thoughtful. What will the ceremony be like? Kardashian has said that it will be ""VERY small & intimate,"" and will not be filmed for her E! reality show. Wedding guests are also supposed to be treated to a private tour of the Palace of Versailles before Saturday's event. ""You will see everything leading up 'til and after!"" Kardashian tweeted May 7. ""As much as we would love to share these memories on camera, we've decided to keep this close to our heart & share thru photos."" Will the groom wear leather jogging pants? Neither Kardashian nor West have elaborated on their wedding day fashion, but we wouldn't be surprised. And what about North? The couple's 11-month-old daughter is present and accounted for, although whether she'll have a role in the ceremony remains to be seen. North has been her mother's pre-wedding shopping partner; she accompanied Kardashian on a trip to Givenchy. What's that I've heard about a pre-nup? TMZ reported that there is a prenuptial agreement, while RadarOnline has gone a step further in claiming Kardashian would get $1 million for every year she stays married to West. But E! has quoted a source who calls that report ""all wrong."" ""Whether or not Kim and Kanye have a pre-nup is a private matter and any speculation is just that,"" another source told the network. Hmm. Anything else? You might be interested to know that Kardashian may rely on Jennifer Aniston's hairstylist -- the man who came up with ""The Rachel"" -- to create her wedding day 'do, and has balanced a pre-wedding diet of ice cream and cheeseburgers with trips to the gym with West. When not out shopping or snapping on-location pics for Instagram, Us Weekly reports the future Mrs. West has also sneaked in a $550 stem cell facial.","There are several rumors about Kim Kardashian's marriage to Kanye West .

"Washington (CNN) -- ""Our foreign policy is just spinning out of control"" one senator said. ""Recognize reality,"" chided another. Fourteen months after giving up his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to become America's top diplomat, Secretary of State John Kerry faced harsh criticism Tuesday from the panel he used to lead. Some of it was the usual partisan sniping that permeates Washington, especially with congressional elections looming in November. However, Democrats also expressed concern about the U.S. response to Russia's tactics in Ukraine, negotiations on Iran's nuclear ambitions and the ongoing Syrian crisis. Kerry pushed back, at times accusing senators of uninformed or short-sighted assessments, and the sometimes sharp exchanges showed a rising skepticism in Congress for the policies and pronouncements of the Obama administration as it approaches the midpoint of a second term. ""It's worth doing"" ""I may fail. I don't care,"" Kerry said when Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a committee veteran, complained of what he predicted would be failed diplomatic efforts on Syria, Iran and Middle East peace. ""It's worth doing. It's worth the effort, and the United States has a responsibility to lead, not always to find the pessimism and negativity that's so easily prevalent in the world today."" Russia warns of civil war . The debate on the Syria issue demonstrated how things have changed between Kerry and his former committee colleagues. Last September, the panel voted 10-7 in favor of a resolution authorizing President Barack Obama to launch a limited military strike on Syria intended to deter the regime of President Bashar al-Assad from using chemical weapons. The measure never made it through the full Senate and House, in part because U.S. ally Britain rejected taking part in such an operation, but the committee's support for it showed the continuing influence of Kerry seven months after he became secretary of state. On Tuesday, Republicans who joined Democrats in backing the resolution last year castigated Kerry and the administration for what they characterized as an ineffective Syria policy. ""We have no policy from what I can tell, other than ... allowing people to kill each other off, and us making commitments to the opposition that we do not honor, and leaving them in refugee camps and basically stranded without the support that we committed to on the front end,"" said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the panel's ranking Republican. Corker and McCain called for sending weapons and other military aid to some groups in the Syrian opposition. So far, the administration has limited its support to humanitarian and non-lethal military aid, but Kerry indicated Tuesday it was considering increased military backing. Support for Syrian opposition . Obama has rejected any chance of U.S. troops joining the Syrian fight, but Kerry said the President believes arming the opposition could change the Syrian leader's ""calculation"" of how the conflict will proceed. When he explained how things had changed in recent months, with the opposition fracturing and jihadists joining the fray, Corker noted that such outcomes had been widely predicted. Forget Ukraine, Syria is now the world's biggest threat . ""But what was the plan to not have that happen, senator?"" Kerry shot back. ""I didn't notice Congress racing to the barriers saying, 'we're going to, you know, we're going to do something.' I don't think the American people were going to send American troops."" He took particular umbrage with complaints that Obama failed to attack Syria for crossing the red line he set on using chemical weapons. Obama had decided back then to attack, Kerry said, and the President's resolve led to the agreement brokered by Russia for Iran to turn over its chemical weapon stockpiles to international control. ""We came up with a better solution -- to get all of them out by working through the diplomatic channel with Russia, and we have an agreement which is now working out with 54% removed"" so far, Kerry said to Corker. ""So, what's your take? Would you rather drop a few bombs, send a message, and then have him still with the weapons and capacity to deliver them? Or would you rather get all of them out."" The Ukraine crisis also drew criticism, with McCain accusing the administration of using ""the logic of appeasement"" by failing to provide military support against Russia's expansionist moves. Citing Teddy Roosevelt's admonition to ""talk softly and carry a big stick,"" McCain said his former longtime colleague on the panel was ""talking strongly and carrying a very small stick, in fact, a twig."" ""Here we are with Ukraine being destabilized, a part of it dismembered, and we won't give them defensive weapons,"" McCain added.. Ukraine debate . Kerry reiterated the U.S. threat of tougher sanctions targeting specific sectors of Russia's economy if Moscow sent troops gathered near the border with Ukraine into the former Soviet territory. Initial sanctions imposed because of Russia's recent move to annex Crimea from Ukraine already had an impact, Kerry said, telling the panel the Russian ruble currency had been devalued by 7%. Taking umbrage at any notion that Obama lacked the backbone to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kerry declared that ""I do not doubt this president's resolve one iota"" while also noting that further steps against Russia would impact the global economy. ""If you go down that road, it's not just them that feels it, we'll feel it too,"" he said. To Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the committee's chairman, a main topic was international talks with Iran intended to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. Menendez worried that the goal of the negotiations had shifted from Iran lacking any capability to enrich uranium needed to make a nuclear weapon to now maintaining some enrichment capability. ""It is far different from where we started off and what we were told to where I believe we are heading,"" Menendez said. Kerry responded with his insistence that any final deal with Iran must include proof through verification that an Iranian nuclear energy program would only be capable of peaceful use. The sharpest attacks came from Republicans intent on scoring political points, such as Sen. James Risch of Idaho, who launched a broad-based attack on the Obama administration. ""You can't help but get the impression that our foreign policy is just spinning out of control,"" Risch said, complaining that Russia continually ""misbehaves"" and yet the government continues trying to reach agreements with it. McCain-Kerry clash . McCain said failure appeared certain for three initiatives under Kerry -- the Geneva agreement for Syrian talks, the ongoing talks on Iran's nuclear ambitions, and the Israel-Palestinian talks. Prospects for Mideast peace deal fading . Kerry has been criticized for his focus on trying to revive the Middle East peace process, with more than a dozen trips to the region since he became secretary of state. The effort appeared stalled or even broken last week when Israel refused to carry out a planned prisoner release and announced 700 new settlement units in Jerusalem while the Palestinians sought recognition from international bodies as part of a unilateral bid for statehood recognition. ""It's interesting that you declare it dead, but the Israelis and the Palestinians don't declare it dead,"" Kerry said to McCain. ""They want to continue to negotiate."" McCain rejected that, telling Kerry: ""It is stopped. Recognize reality."" ""We'll see where the reality is as we go down the road here,"" Kerry responded. ""There are serious problems. It's a tough issue, but your friend, Teddy Roosevelt, also said that the credit belongs to the people who are in the arena who are trying to get things done, and we're trying to get something done."" CNN's Elise Labott, Virginia Nicolaidis and Laquahsa Bivens contributed to this report.","Secretary of State Kerry gets a rough homecoming from his old Senate committee .

"(CNN) -- From krill to king crabs, the collapse of a 160-square-mile portion of the Wilkins Ice Shelf in Antarctica could mean many changes for wildlife at the bottom of the world. Krill may not be the most exotic of creatures, but climate change could affect them like any other animal. Most inhabitants of our planet will never get a firsthand look at a polar bear at the North Pole or a penguin at the South. But polar scientists already see changes in plants and animals from rapidly warming temperatures. ""Because of their extreme environments, they tend to be highly sensitive to temperature changes,"" said marine biologist James McClintock of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""Therefore, what we see happening in the poles should be taken as warning of what may be coming elsewhere,"" said McClintock, who studies the physiology and ecology of aquatic and marine invertebrates in Antarctica.  Watch how the ice shelf is a sign of trouble » . According to the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, in the past 50 years, the western Antarctic peninsula has undergone the biggest temperature increase on Earth: up .9 degree Fahrenheit, or .5 degree Celsius, in each of the past five decades.  How the ice is disappearing » . Although krill may never be as majestic as whales or as adorable as penguins, these small shrimp-like crustaceans in the waters of the Antarctic are crucial to the region's ecology. And they might be among the first in the animal kingdom to have to adapt to warming temperatures. Scientists already are observing declines in polar krill populations that could be tied to a decrease in annual winter sea ice. ""As babies, krill live under the sea ice and graze on microalgae. With a decline in sea ice, there is less habitat for young krill,"" McClintock said. But there may be a non-global-warming explanation for the decrease. Once heavily hunted, humpback whales that feed on krill have made a comeback in Antarctic waters. So it is also possible that more whales are simply eating more of these tiny crustaceans. Another warming ocean event that scientists are studying closely is the migration of king crabs. Marine remotely operated vehicles have captured photos of these giant crabs on the Antarctic Slope, where underwater land starts to rise up to the southernmost continent. It's the first time in tens of millions of years that these predators have appeared that close to Antarctica. Crabs and other marine invertebrates die when the water is too cold, because they cannot flush magnesium out of their systems. But even slightly warmer seawater allows the animal to regulate that element. McClintock says that if these new predators keep moving, they could wipe out other Antarctic species. Snails, brittle stars, sea spiders and some marine worms have evolved without armor and other protections they would need to survive alongside the king crab. Scientists studying Adelie penguins on Antarctica's western peninsula see that species suffering major declines. Ironically, an increase in snowfall could be among the most dangerous ""warming"" effects for this animal. ""In Antarctica, as the air temperature warms up, the humidity rises and the ability of snowfall to occur increases,"" McClintock said. That snowfall can affect the mortality of penguin eggs. Another possible impact of climate change in the Antarctic is acidification. Seawater has long been known to be good at absorbing carbon dioxide. But one effect of that absorption is that it turns the ocean water more acidic. Organisms that make shells or have skeletons that are exposed to seawater, such as clams, snails and sea butterflies, could see their shells dissolve in water that is too acidic. Plants and animals that have survived and thrived in the brutal conditions of Antarctica for millions of years have had to make plenty of adjustments. ""Wildlife will be impacted, but they are pretty adept at dealing with a topsy-turvy world,"" said Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. ""The ecosystem is pretty resilient,"" he said. Scambos first spotted the disintegration of the Wilkins Ice Shelf in February. He cautions that the poles will be the leading edge of what's happening in the rest of the world as global warming continues. ""Even though they seem far away, changes in the polar regions could have an impact on both hemispheres with sea level rise and changes in climate patterns,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Once again, North Korea has violated an important international agreement by launching a long-range missile. And like many times before, there is not much Washington or anyone else can do about it. The brazen defiance of the North Korean regime is stunning. It's a performance that carries a strong message for the West and regimes that are contemplating the possibility of starting nuclear programs of their own. It may be tempting to dismiss the importance of the launch since the rocket failed to go into orbit and disintegrated after liftoff. But North Korea succeeded in defying the world and managed to carry out an important test of its missile program. Those who are paying attention to the unfolding drama in the Korean Peninsula include the leaders of Iran and those trying to stop Iran's nuclear ambition. Pyongyang's decision comes at a time when the West is preparing for new talks with Iran. At the end of February, North Korea made an agreement with Washington to stop all missile tests and uranium enrichment in exchange for the United States to deliver 240,000 tons of food. (While the regime cannot feed its people, the budget for new launching pads, rockets and a huge military has not run out.) Now Pyongyang has broken its word. It is claiming that launching a satellite into space is not a military test, so it does not violate the international agreement; rather, the event was meant to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of its founder and ""Eternal President,"" Kim Il Sung. But that explanation persuades no one. The United States and its allies warned North Korea to stop the launch, saying plainly, ""Don't do it."" President Barack Obama, in a thinly veiled message to Pyongyang and also to Tehran, warned that ""treaties are binding. Rules will be enforced. And violations will have consequences."" It's not clear what those consequences might be. The U.S. says it will not deliver the food aid agreed to in February, but that further punishes a population living in misery. The true consequences of obtaining nuclear weapons, as North Korea has done, are becoming increasingly clear. The North Korean dictatorship may just be the most brutal regime on earth, imprisoning, starving and isolating its people. Despite its self-acknowledged ""responsibility to protect"" victims of state power, the rest of the world tiptoes around the atrocities, afraid to provoke the unpredictable regime because it has a nuclear arsenal. What the latest missile launch may be is a propaganda campaign, a show of force to consolidate power by Kim Jong Un, who took power in December after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il. The Kims have ruled North Korea since its founding after World War II. Since North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, the country has become more of a threat to the region and the world. It has used extortion, manipulation and intimidation against its neighbors and against the United States. It has killed, kidnapped and terrorized those in neighboring countries. And it has become a provider of nuclear technology to dangerous regimes. In May 2010, it fired a torpedo that sank a South Korean submarine, killing 46 sailors. South Korea, a strong ally of the United States, responded with a trade embargo. Six month later, the residents of the small South Korean island of Yeonpyeong fled in terror as the North fired 130 artillery shells. The attack killed no one but caused widespread panic. North Korea's nuclear and missile tests have also put Japan on edge more than once. Today, Japan seems like it is preparing for war as it awaits the latest missile launch. And according to a leaked report from the United Nations, North Korea has become a supplier to the nuclear programs of Iran, Syria and Burma. In 2008, videos of North Korean workers inside a mysterious plant in Syria added to suspicions and helped convince Israel that Syria was building a nuclear reactor to produce weapons-grade plutonium. The reactor was later destroyed by Israel. Because North Korea obtained nuclear weapons, its erratic behavior and appalling actions have become almost impossible to stop. That reality has come with a terrible cost to the suffering people of its people and with a price tag whose final tally in world peace is still unknown. For a country such as Iran, the impunity that has followed North Korea's success on the nuclear pathway is an incentive not to give up its own nuclear program. For the rest of the world, it should serve as a reminder of how dangerous it would be to allow more nuclear weapons anywhere, but especially in the Middle East, the most unstable region on earth. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","North Korea launched a long-range rocket that broke apart after liftoff .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will meet Tuesday with the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to discuss deepening ties between Washington and Tripoli, senior State Department officials said Monday. Saif al Islam Gadhafi has been credited with convincing his father to compensate victims of a 1988 bombing. ""It's a growing, evolving relationship,"" one senior official said, calling Saif al Islam Gadhafi ""a significant political figure."" Al Islam Gadhafi, who has been mentioned as a possible successor to his father, is in the United States on a private visit. Libyan activists have urged Rice not to meet with Gadhafi's son while in the U.S. until leading Libyan dissident Fathi Eljahmi is released from prison after seven years behind bars. The Western-educated al Islam Gadhafi is widely credited with convincing his father to abandon his weapons of mass destruction program and compensate victims of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in order to forge better ties with the West. In September he announced he was retiring from political life to push for political and economic reforms through his Gadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation, of which he is the chairman. In an interview with CNN, he said it was time for Libya to embrace democracy and establish a parliament and a constitution. His visit comes amid warming ties between the United States and Libya following an agreement between the two countries on a final settlement for the Lockerbie bombing. President Bush called Moammar Gadhafi Monday to express his satisfaction that a settlement for the Flight 103 bombing has been fully implemented. The State Department described the call as the first conversation on record between a U.S. president and the flamboyant Libyan leader. A Libyan intelligence officer was convicted of masterminding the bombing, and Libya was obligated to pay $2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the 270 victims killed in the attack, or $10 million per family. At least 189 of the people on board were Americans. ""The two leaders discussed that this agreement should help to bring a painful chapter in the history between our two countries closer to closure,"" said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe. ""While we will always mourn the loss of life as a result of past terrorist activities, the settlement agreement is an important step in repairing the relationship between Libya and the United States,"" Johndroe said. ""Libya has taken important steps on the road to normalizing its relations with the international community, beginning with its renunciation in 2003 of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction."" The agreement was fully implemented October 31. The Bush administration lifted most U.S. sanctions against Libya in April 2004, opening the way for U.S. investments and commercial activities. In September, Rice made a historic visit to Libya, where she met with Gadhafi -- the first visit by a secretary of state in 54 years.","Son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is on private visit to U.S.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Veterans groups are angry after President Obama told them Monday that he is still considering a proposal to have treatment for service-connected injuries charged to veterans' private insurance plans. President Obama, with Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shineski, spoke with leaders of veterans groups Monday. Leaders of the country's most prominent veterans groups met Monday at the White House with Obama, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Steven Kosiak, the director in charge of defense spending for the Office of Management and Budget. Some of the veterans groups were caught off guard when the president said the administration is still thinking about the idea as a way of generating $540 million for the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2010. The groups and some members of Congress have been very vocal in opposing the idea. The message, according to some of the people in the room, was that if the groups do not like this idea, they need to come back with another way of saving or raising revenue for the VA. ""I got the distinct impression that the only hope of this plan not being enacted is for an alternative plan to be developed that would generate the desired $540 million in revenue,"" Cmdr. David Rehbein of the American Legion said in a written statement. But the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs vowed Tuesday that the plan would never gain the panel's approval. ""VA's sacred duty is to care for veterans injured in honorable service to our nation, and the department should not turn to wounded warriors' private insurance to pay for combat injures,"" said Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii. ""Under my chairmanship, the Veterans' Affairs Committee will not advance any such legislation."" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said no decision has been made. ""The president and the [veterans service organizations] had a good conversation, and veterans can be assured that the president understands any concerns that they would have,"" Gibbs said. ""The budget the president has proposed represents an historic increase in discretionary spending to take care of our wounded warriors: those that have been sent off to war, have protected our freedom and have come back wounded."" He added, ""this president takes very seriously the needs of our wounded warriors that have given so much to protect our freedom on the battlefields throughout the world."" Obama did most of the talking for the administration in the session with veterans representatives, participants said. Shinseki did not speak much in the meeting, which was described as ""professional"" by David Gorman, executive director of Disabled American Veterans. The president was sympathetic to the needs of veterans, Gorman said, but insisted that the insurance companies are getting away with not paying for anything. ""The vets are paying premiums to insurance companies, and that is a free ride that needs to stop,"" Gorman said in describing the president's message to the group. The groups oppose the idea because they believe that the government has a moral obligation to pay for service-connected injuries for the men and women who risked their lives serving the country. ""This flies in the face of the VA's covenant to cover all service-related health-care expenses,"" said Jay Agg, a spokesman for AMVETS. The groups also say that the cost of treating service-connected injuries could lead to veterans quickly maxing out their benefits in third-party insurance, risking coverage for not just them but their families, who are also covered under the plans. In addition, they foresee premiums rising to cover the cost of treating the service-connected injuries. ""We are going to go back in and fight this thing tooth and nail,"" Gorman said. He said the president complained that instead of commending the significant budget increase for the VA -- an 11 percent increase in 2010 and $25 billion over five years -- the groups are complaining about this proposal. But Gorman said that the issue of third-party billing is fundamental to the VA and that it is a ""distraction"" from discussing the budget increases. Another group, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that although it is encouraged by the increase in money for veterans' health care, the billing proposal is not acceptable. ""Veterans of all generations agree that this proposal is bad for the country and bad for veterans. If the president and the OMB want to cut costs, they can start at AIG, not the VA,"" said Paul Rieckhoff, the group's executive director, in a written statement. The opposition is not a surprise to the White House. The groups had sent a letter opposing the idea when it was just a rumor. Last week, Congress weighed in when members of both the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees told Shinseki at separate meetings that they objected to the plan. Shinseki was told by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, that it would be ""dead on arrival."" Rep. Mike Michaud, D- Maine, said that if it were presented, he would oppose the entire budget. It is unconscionable, and it is an insult to our veterans who have been hurt overseas,"" Michaud said. ""It is just unbelievable that anyone would ever think of doing that in this budget."" At the time, Shinseki would say only that the idea was under consideration but no decision had been made. The groups have another meeting with the White House on Thursday to suggest other options. Both AMVETS and Disabled American Veterans believe that the VA could raise more revenue by being more aggressive about pursuing billings for non-service-connected treatments. Increasing third-party billing for non-service related injuries by 10 percent, suggested Agg, would free up more money to help service-related injuries. Another idea that will be presented would be to bill Medicare. ""This, we believe, would more easily meet the president's financial goal,"" said Rehbein, of the American Legion. Gorman said his group is willing to concede some money in the VA budget to avoid the insurance proposal. ""If it comes down to this issue, which is fundamental to the VA and what it should do, we are willing to give up a couple billion to salvage this issue,"" Gorman said. A VA spokesman deferred all questions to the White House. White House officials were not immediately available for comment.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Western nations and Iran broached solutions over Tehran's controversial nuclear program Wednesday, the latest push to end the saber-rattling over the Islamic republic's atomic aspirations. Both sides, negotiating in Baghdad, delivered proposals in the latest round of talks between Iran and six nations -- the United States, France, Russia, China, Britain and Germany. The talks, a followup to negotiations last month, come amid a backdrop of tensions across the Middle East over Iran's nuclear efforts. Western powers fear that Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons, despite its insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The West has been using sanctions and diplomacy to try to stop Iran from producing nuclear arms. Tehran threatened this year to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping lane, if sanctions were imposed on its exports of crude oil. Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. The six nations are ""putting forward a detailed proposal, which will include confidence-building measures that can begin to pave the way for Iran to demonstrate that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and for it to comply with UNSC (U.N. Security Council) resolutions,"" said a Western official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions. ""This approach includes concrete step-by-step, reciprocal measures aimed at near-term action. We are looking to have detailed and serious discussions in Baghdad that strive to make progress towards these concrete steps,"" the official said. Asked whether relief from the tough Western sanctions imposed on Iran will be on the table, the official said, ""There is no expectation it will happen as a result of this meeting. Iran would need to take significant concrete action first."" The Western official said bilateral talks between European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, had concluded. A closing plenary session will be held Thursday morning. When asked if there were a chance of a deal, another Western official, who requested anonymity because of sensitive diplomatic discussions, said, ""We're not talking final deals, but solid progress."" Iran has submitted a package to the nations, with some, but not all, of the points addressing the nuclear issue, said a member of the Iranian delegation who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks. Details were not immediately available. A British Foreign Office spokesman said world powers are offering support for Iranian economic and agricultural development and the country's civilian nuclear program in exchange for cooperation. Another idea on the table is an updated version of an earlier offer to swap enriched uranium for nuclear fuel, European Union officials said. There had been a proposal to swap most of Iran's low-enriched uranium for fuel rods to power a medical research reactor in Tehran. The proposals address the world community's ""concerns about the nature of their nuclear program,"" said Michael Mann, a spokesman for Ashton. ""Obviously, you have various U.N. Security Council resolutions and reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that have found suspicions that they may be developing a military program, so our proposals on the table address those concerns,"" Mann said. ""We hope that they will come back and react positively to those proposals that we've made and that we can really talk about the substance and get things moving."" Mann said 20% uranium enrichment ""is one of the issues that's addressed"" in proposals Ashton put on the table. Uranium enriched at 20% is typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors, but is also seen as a shortcut toward the 90% enrichment required to build nuclear weapons. The Baghdad meeting takes place a day after the head of the IAEA said he would soon sign an agreement with Iran, a sign that Tehran may have agreed to broader inspections of its nuclear facilities. The talks come at a critical time for Iran. The country's economy has been crippled by sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union. Because 80% of Iran's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports, an embargo by the EU set to go into effect in July will put further pressure on its economy. Jalili was welcomed by the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, on his arrival Wednesday at Baghdad International Airport, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has repeatedly raised alarms about Iran's nuclear development, said Monday that the world powers ""must show determination, not weakness"" in the talks. ""They do not need to make concessions to Iran,"" he said in remarks distributed by his office. ""They need to set clear and unequivocal demands before it."" Israel wants Iran to halt all uranium enrichment, give up all nuclear fuel it has enriched so far and dismantle the Fordo enrichment plant it built into a mountainside. ""Only thus will it be possible to ensure that Iran will not have a nuclear bomb,"" Netanyahu said. Opinion: Reality check, please . On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak urged other countries to intensify the pressure on Iran. ""Without a tightening of the sanctions, Iran will not stop nuclear program development,"" he said. Leaders of the so-called Group of Eight -- the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Russia -- called Saturday on Iran to comply with the requirements of the IAEA and open its doors to nuclear inspectors. In a declaration, the G-8 leaders said they welcomed the resumption of talks. The IAEA has been demanding access to sites where Iran could be doing weapons-related testing. The agency's director-general, Yukiya Amano, met with Iranian negotiator Jalili in Tehran on Monday. ""During the meeting, we discussed a wide spectrum of different issues, including nuclear disarmament, peaceful use of nuclear energy and strengthening (the position of) the agency,"" Amano said Tuesday in Vienna after returning from the visit to Iran. ""During my stay in Tehran, there was an important development on the structured approach document on which we were working since January,"" he said, adding that a ""decision was made by me and Mr. Jalili to reach the agreement on the structured approach."" Amano told reporters he raised the issue of access to Parchin, the military complex believed to have been the site of high-explosive tests related to nuclear weapons research. ""This issue will be addressed as part of the implementation of the structured approach document,"" he said. Amano said differences remained, but Jalili said they would not pose obstacles to signing the agreement. The ""decision was made to conclude and sign the agreement,"" Amano said. Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency said that in meetings, both sides ""discussed present problems more candidly, providing each other with proposals to remove ambiguities and expand cooperation."" Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi ""welcomed the new IAEA approach toward Iran's nuclear issue based on mutual understanding and bilateral respect,"" IRNA reported Tuesday. The United States, France, Russia, China, Britain and Germany are called the P5+1, a reference to Germany and the other nations, permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Another name for the group is the E3+3, a reference to the European countries of Germany, France and Britain and the others.

"KFAR CHABAD, Israel (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners and emissaries from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Chabad movement poured into an Israeli village Tuesday for the funerals of two people killed in the Mumbai terrorist attacks. Israeli girls mourn Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivkah, who were killed in the Mumbai attacks. There was a feeling of pain and anger at the funeral in Kfar Chabad, a village of 900 families just outside Tel Aviv. Speeches at the funeral said the gunmen sought out the Chabad House in Mumbai and targeted the victims because of their faith. The two people laid to rest Tuesday were Chabad House directors Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife, Rivka. They lived and worked at the house in Mumbai, which served as both a home and Jewish center -- a place open to anyone who wanted a place to pray, eat kosher food, or celebrate Jewish holidays. Three former Israeli prime ministers were at the funeral: Ehud Barak, who is now the defense minister; Shimon Peres, currently the Israeli president; and Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the Likud Party.  Watch Israeli funerals for those killed in Mumbai » . After the funeral, the bodies of the Holtzbergs were buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. Another victim from Chabad House, kosher supervisor Rabbi Leibish Teitelbaum of New York, was buried there earlier. Separate funerals were held for Teitelbaum and another kosher supervisor at Chabad House, American-Israeli Rabbi Bentzion Kruman. They died in the siege along with Israeli grandmother Yocheved Orpaz and Mexican citizen Norma Shvarzblat Rabinovich. The building, also known as the Nariman House, was the local headquarters of the Chabad community, a Hasidic Jewish movement. The Holtzbergs had two children, one of whom was in the house when terrorists stormed in. A woman who worked as a nanny and cook at the house managed to escape with the 2-year-old boy, Moshe.  Watch report about nanny saving infant » . The couple's other son was not in Mumbai at the time, according to Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, chairman of the educational and social services arms of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. The child has Tay-Sachs, a terminal genetic disease, The Associated Press reports. In an emotional scene before flying from India to Israel on Monday, the boy repeatedly cried for his mother at a memorial ceremony at a Mumbai synagogue. His cries were played repeatedly on Israeli TV stations. ""You don't have a mother who will hug you and kiss you,"" Rabbi Kotlarsky said, adding that the community would take care of the boy, AP said. ""You are the child of all of Israel."" The only other surviving member of the family, Moshe's brother, has Tay-Sachs, a terminal genetic disease, and is institutionalized in Israel, AP added. The Holtzbergs' eldest son died of the disease. The Holtzbergs went to Mumbai five years ago to serve the city's small Jewish community and the thousands of Israeli visitors and business people who frequent the area, according to Chabad.org, the ultra-Orthodox group's Web site. About 5,000 Jews live in India, according to the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise. About 3,000 of them live in Mumbai, The Jewish Press reported. iReport.com: Share tributes to those who died . The Holtzbergs operated a synagogue and taught Torah classes. The rabbi also conducted weddings for local Jewish couples. Gavriel Holtzberg, 29, was born in Israel and moved to Brooklyn, New York, when he was 9. He studied in New York and Argentina and traveled to Thailand and China as a rabbinical student. His wife, Rivka, 28, was a native of Israel. In Mumbai, they ran the headquarters of the Chabad community, a Hasidic Jewish movement. The center, in a building known as the Nariman House, was open to anyone who wanted a place to pray, eat kosher food or celebrate Jewish holidays. In footage filmed two years ago by the Chabad movement, Gavriel Holtzberg said anybody who visited the center was welcome. His wife said its doors were always open and that it was not unusual to have 30 people for dinner. The Chabad-Lubavitch movement was formed more than two centuries ago in Russia. The organization says 4,000 full-time emissary families now direct more than 3,300 Chabad institutions around the world. Kruman was in India to help Teitelbaum supervise a mushroom packing plant under kosher certification, the Chabad Web site said. He grew up in Israel and in the past year had visited China once a month to supervise food packaging plants there. Kruman often visited the Chabad House in Beijing, the organization said, and survived the May earthquake in China's Sichuan Province. He leaves behind a widow and three children.

"(CNN) -- Iran said it has broken up an Israeli ""terror and sabotage network"" that was planning attacks within the country, making a number of arrests while confiscating weapons and equipment, state-run media reported. ""The complicated and months-long measures and moves made by the Iranian intelligence forces to identify the devils led to the discovery of the Zionists' regional command center ... and discovering the identity of the agents active in that command center,"" a statement from the Iranian Intelligence Ministry said, according to the Fars News Agency. Paul Hirschson, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry said that every few months Iran spreads disinformation and there is no basis to the story. The developments come ahead of the scheduled resumption of nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers in Istanbul, Turkey, on Saturday. Faced with mounting pressure from the world powers over its controversial nuclear program, Iran said last month that it was ready to re-engage with the International Atomic Energy Association, the U.N. nuclear watchdog. As a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran has the right, like other countries, to enrich uranium for commercial and research reactors. But the same facilities that are used for peaceful enrichment can be used to enrich uranium for a bomb. And that's what many Western countries suspect Iran is doing. Iran insists its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes. Tehran's claims of an Israeli terror network come in the midst of an apparent shadow war the two nations are believed to be fighting. Iranian nuclear scientists have been assassinated and there have been mysterious explosions in the country. Also Iran and the Tehran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah have in recent months made various claims about discovering Israeli espionage operations, which have been met by either silence or flat out denials from Israeli government officials. Separately, there have been attempted attacks against Israeli diplomats in India and Georgia, along with suspected terror plots against Israeli targets in Thailand and Azerbaijan.

"(CNN) -- Iran has stepped up its production of high-grade enriched uranium and has re-landscaped one of its military bases in an apparent effort to hamper a United Nations inquiry into the country's nuclear program, a U.N. report said Thursday. Iran's facilities have produced 189.4 kilograms (417.6 pounds) of the enriched uranium, an increase of 43.8 kilograms (96.6 pounds) since the last U.N. analysis in May, the report said. That enriched uranium is produced at declared facilities in Iran that don't include the military base cited in Thursday's report. Iran hasn't allowed the agency access to the military site, called Parchin, and, in fact, has been conducting ""extensive activities"" at that location ""that will significantly hamper the Agency's ability to conduct effective verification,"" the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency said in its report. Iran's expanding nuclear program . ""Significant ground scraping and landscaping have been undertaken over an extensive area at and around the location, with new dirt roads established,"" the report said. Iran must respond to the agency's concerns ""without further delay."" Otherwise, the U.N. body won't be able to resolve issues about Iran's nuclear program and ""the existence of possible military dimensions"" to the program, the report said. Many Western diplomats and nuclear experts believe the Parchin site has been secretly used to test high-explosive nuclear triggers, an essential step toward achieving a weapons capability. Iran denies that Parchin has any role in its nuclear program, which it insists is for peaceful purposes. A meeting in Vienna last week between IAEA officials and an Iranian delegation, which in part was to discuss access to the Parchin site, ended without progress. High stakes nuclear poker game in Iran? Iran acknowledges that it is increasing its number of centrifuges to enrich uranium. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said last month that 11,000 centrifuges were now operational, about 1,000 more than estimated by the IAEA in May. In a letter Wednesday to the agency, Iran said the allegations of nuclear activities at the Parchin site were ""baseless,"" the report said. But the IAEA reasserted its ongoing alarm about Iran in Thursday's report. ""Since 2002, the Agency has become increasingly concerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile,"" the report said.

"(CNN) -- Tropical Cyclone Mahasen jogged northward Thursday prior to striking the coast of Bangladesh, averting the widespread disaster that government authorities had prepared for. Still, at least 12 people were killed, thousands of thatched houses were damaged and trees uprooted, the state news agency said. ""The situation is turning normal and the people have started returning home after some 200,000 people took overnight refuge at cyclone shelters at Barisal Division,"" divisional commissioner of Barisal Mohammad Nurul Amin told Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS). ""The damage was not that much what we feared, and people who took shelters have already started moving to their houses as the weather is becoming almost normal,"" he said. Bangladeshi authorities had relocated hundreds of thousands of people in vulnerable areas to safer ground ahead of the storm's arrival. The storm's strongest gusts reached 90 kph (56 mph), weaker than a hurricane, BSS said. Authorities had suspended port activities at Chittagong, a major transport and commercial hub, and canceled all flights to and from the city's airport. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs had warned that Mahasen could put millions of people in the surrounding region at risk. On Wednesday, aid agencies and local authorities scrambled to prepare residents and to put emergency supplies in position. Bangladeshi authorities relocated at least half a million people from the coastal districts of southeastern Bangladesh, the top administrative officer of Chittagong Division said. Authorities prepared thousands of buildings as cyclone shelters. The OCHA put the number of people ordered to relocate by the Bangladeshi government at 1 million nationwide. There was reason for the caution: In 1970, Cyclone Bhola killed some 400,000 people, according to the OCHA. Cyclone Sidr killed nearly 4,000 people in 2007, and Cyclone Aila killed about 200 people in 2009. A vulnerable group in Myanmar . Relocation efforts have also proved challenging in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, which borders Bangladesh. On Rakhine's coast, Myanmar authorities and relief agencies worked to relocate tens of thousands of Muslims who had been living in makeshift camps in low-lying areas since last year, when their homes were destroyed in sectarian violence. Most of them are Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority who suffered during decades of military rule in Myanmar. Sectarian violence erupted last year in Rakhine between Buddhists and Muslims, resulting in the deaths of scores of people, most of them Rohingya. Since then, more than 100,000 Muslims have been forced to live in camps. In a report last month, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch accused Myanmar authorities of involvement in a Buddhist campaign of ""ethnic cleansing"" against the Rohingya in Rakhine. The Myanmar government dismissed the report as ""one-sided."" The efforts to relocate some of the displaced Rohingya living in the camps appear to have been hindered by distrust of the security forces involved. On Monday night, a boat ferrying people from one camp in Rakhine to safer areas hit rocks and capsized, the OCHA said, citing the government. Fifty-eight people were missing and an unspecified number died, the agency said.

"(CNN) -- Can a handful of ancient copper coins from a once-opulent but now abandoned corner of East Africa change what we know about Australian history? A team of researchers is on a mission to find out. With its glittering wealth, busy harbor and coral stone buildings, the island of Kilwa rose to become the premier commercial post of coastal East Africa around the 1300s, controlling much of the Indian Ocean trade with the continent's hinterland. Situated in present-day southern Tanzania, during its heyday Kilwa hosted traders from as far away as China, who would exchange gold, ivory and iron from southern Africa's interior for Arabian pottery and Indian textiles as well as perfumes, porcelains and spices from the Far East. But the Kilwa sultanate's heyday came to a crashing end in the early 1500s with the arrival of the Portuguese who sacked the city in their bid to dominate the trade routes between eastern Africa and India. From then on, Kilwa never managed to recover its greatness. With its trading network gradually eclipsing, the once flourishing city started to decline in importance. It was eventually deserted in the 19th century, its crumbling, UNESCO-protected ruins offering today a glimpse of its glorious past. But interest in this nearly forgotten East African city has resurfaced lately thanks to the mystery surrounding a remarkable discovery thousands of miles away, in a long-abandoned, remote chain of small islands near Australia's Northern Territory. Astonishing discovery . Back in 1944, an Australian soldier named Maurie Isenberg was assigned to one of the uninhabited but strategically positioned Wessel Islands to man a radar station. One day, whilst fishing on the beach during his spare time, he discovered nine coins buried in the sand. Isenberg stored them in a tin until 1979, when he wondered if they might be worth something and sent them to be identified. Four of the coins were found to belong to the Dutch East India Company, with one of them being from the late 17th century. But the rest of them were identified as originating from Kilwa, believed to date back to the 1100s. The sultanate started minting its own currency in the 11th century. Read this: The dark history of Bunce Island . ""It's a very fascinating discovery,"" says Ian McIntosh, an Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis anthropologist. ""Kilwa coins have only ever been found outside of the Kilwa region on two occasions,"" he explains. ""A single coin was found in the ruins of great Zimbabwe and one coin was found in the Arabian Peninsula, in what is now Oman, but nowhere else. And yet, here is this handful of them in northern Australia, this is the astonishing thing."" Re-write history? According to history textbooks, Aboriginal explorers arrived in Australia from Asia at least 60,000 years ago. The first European widely known to have set foot on the continent was Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon in 1606, more than 160 years before captain James Cook arrived at Australia's south-eastern coast to claim the territory for the British empire. So how did the five coins from distant Kilwa wind up in the isolated Wessel Islands? Was a shipwreck involved? Could it be that the Portuguese, who had looted Kilwa in 1505, reached the Australian shores with coins from East Africa in their possession? Or was it that Kilwan sailors, renowned as expert navigators all across the sea route between China and Africa, were hired by traders from the Far East to navigate their dhows? These are the kind of questions that McIntosh now hopes to answer as he bids to unravel the mystery of how the coins, which are currently stored in Sydney's Powerhouse Museum, were found in this part of the world. ""We have five separate hypotheses we're looking to test about how these coins got there, each one quite different from the other,"" says McIntosh. On July 15, he will lead an eight-member team of archaeologists, historians and scientists to the area where Isenberg discovered the coins. Read this: African roots of the human family tree . ""This is an initial survey; if we find something then we'll prepare for a more detailed and focused exploration in specific areas,"" says the Australian professor. ""We are interested in a more accurate portrayal of Australian history that is currently allowed in textbooks."" The team will embark on its quest for answers equipped with a nearly 70-year-old map on which Isenberg had marked with an X the spot where he found the coins. McIntosh, who was sent the map before Isenberg's death in 1991, says he first tried to mount an expedition to the Wessel Islands in the early 1990s but at the time he'd failed to gather funding. ""In 1992 there was a very limited interest for such a venture,"" he says. ""But we maintained an interest in the Kilwa connection because it was such a famous place in its day -- from the 1100s to the 1300s it was the most prominent port in the entire east African coast, bigger than Mombasa, Zanzibar and Mogadishu."" ""If you bought these coins in a shop in Kilwa, you could probably get them for a few dollars,"" says McIntosh. ""But in northern Australia, these are priceless in terms of their historical value.""","African coins dating back to 1100s found in remote part of Australia .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-six years ago this week, a botched reactor safety test in a corner of what was then the Soviet Union set off the worst nuclear accident in history. The radiation effects of the April 26, 1986, reactor explosion were about 400 times more potent than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II, and nearly 14 times greater than the disaster last year at the Fukushima plant in Japan. Fast forward to today, and even in the exclusion zone, plants have re-grown, animals are flourishing and Chernobyl has been opened to tourists. But Chernobyl refuses to be relegated to the past. Indeed it may still be devastating the lives of millions who continue to live in the fallout zone. Aside from the potential health hazards of living in an area contaminated with radiation, domino socioeconomic effects have caused multiple problems in these regions. Chernobyl Children International, or CCI, works to help kids in the region whose lives have been impacted by a disaster that happened years before they were born. Many suffer from physical problems such as congenital heart defects. Many kids have chronic illnesses or disabilities, and many live full time in institutions. To help them, CCI sends surgical teams who in turn help train local doctors. CCI nurses teach institution staff techniques, and volunteers renovate facilities. One of CCI's main goals going forward is a program they call ""Home of Hope,"" which uses money from donations to place institutionalized kids with nearby families. For many severely disabled children there, the future is uncertain. CCI works to build community centers in affected areas, in the hopes that there will be some support system for them after they are too old to remain in institutions. Decades after the meltdown, the mission of CCI is complicated by the fact that there is no real consensus on how many of the region's current problems can be directly attributed to Chernobyl. Only 30 people died in the immediate aftermath, either from the explosion or acute radiation syndrome. But the disaster sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over hundreds of thousands of square miles of what is now Russia, Belarus and Ukraine that would have an impact on the health of many more. More than 200,000 people were evacuated, never to return. However, a 2005 report by ""The Chernobyl Forum"" (the most comprehensive to date) estimated more than 5 million remain in what have been termed ""contaminated territories,"" and a quarter-million live in ""highly contaminated territories."" Ten years after the explosion, a CNN team visited Chernobyl to ascertain the long-term effects of radiation exposure for those living near Chernobyl during the accident, for cleanup workers or ""liquidators,"" or for those who continued to live in areas that were classified as polluted. They found more questions than answers. Research funds were scarce. Economies of affected countries were decimated by the disaster and by the subsequent breakup of the USSR. Years later, there aren't many more definitive answers than there were then, to the question of how exactly Chernobyl has affected the lives, not just of those who lived through it, but of subsequent generations still living in these ""contaminated' areas"" Many of us have certain mental images that spring to mind when thinking of the effects of radioactive contamination: mutated animals, children with deformities and birth defects, for example. But the 2005 Chernobyl Forum report found scant evidence that this was the case. In fact, other than a marked increase in thyroid cancers in those living near the exclusion zone, the report found few definitive links to increased instances of disease or birth defects. Their conclusion; in the 600,000 people they studied, they might expect around 4,000 extra deaths that could be directly linked to Chernobyl. The report created fierce debate among some who felt it grossly underestimated the impact of the disaster. A subsequent study titled ""The Torch Report,"" commissioned by the European Green Party, put the number of extra cancer deaths alone at a much higher rate -- somewhere between 30,000 and 60,000. Figures released by UNICEF in 2010 showed that more than 20% of adolescent children in Belarus suffered from disabilities and chronic illness. Belarus absorbed 70% of Chernobyl's fallout. But the truth is, no one really knows where to lay the blame for these figures. One of the main challenges for anyone attempting to ascertain the health effects of Chernobyl radiation is that there is so much background radiation in the atmosphere to begin with. But more specifically, Chernobyl was so much more than an explosion. ""When we think about Chernobyl, most people think about the medical consequences of living with radiation,"" said Kathy Ryan, a spokesperson for Chernobyl Children's International (CCI). ""But it's important to understand that people are still being affected by the social and economic fallout."" After the Chernobyl disaster, millions living on previously prime farmland found that no one would import their ""contaminated"" produce. The high cost of cleanup from the accident, which cost Belarus alone well over $200 billion, is thought to have contributed to the breakup of the Soviet Union and further crippled affected region's economy. With diminished ways to make a living, many were -- and still are -- forced to eat food and drink water from the polluted areas where they live. Whether radiation in produce is or is not harmful, what's certain is malnutrition is common, which often can result in illnesses and birth defects. Another factor is a sense of defeatism in Chernobyl-affected people, many of whom had to leave homes their families had lived in for generations. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says displacement, poverty and fear of radiation sickness have contributed to ""suicides, drinking problems and apathy."" It's issues like these -- prenatal alcohol exposure for example -- that have led to birth defects and illnesses in many children. As a result, many children live in institutions; UNICEF estimates the number in Belarus alone to be nearly 10,000. ""The children in many cases were removed from their home ... because the parents might have had issues with alcoholism or with poverty,"" Ryan said. According to CCI, many kids suffer almost as much from being in an institution as they do from their disability or illness. Rebecca Fordham, communications officer from UNICEF, said that finding an alternative to institutions is a worldwide priority for them. ""It can be impersonal,"" she said. ""They're not getting the dedicated services they need, not having enough access to proper food or physical activity."" The question now, is how populations can begin to move on from the specter of Chernobyl? Reports by the U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and the World Health Organization claim that much of the land designated as ""contaminated"" by the former Soviet Union actually contains radiation levels not much higher than vast areas considered ""safe."" In fact, by the USSR's standards, it's not just the former Soviet republics that should be concerned.. ""Some 45,000 square kilometers in Western Europe have measurable levels of radioactivity in the soil from Chernobyl above the criterion applied in the former Soviet Union to designate 'contaminated' areas,"" said UNSCEAR Secretary Malcolm Crick. And yet, those areas have experienced nowhere near the alienation and economic impact of much of Belarus and Ukraine. How many areas are still ""contaminated,"" and what does that mean? Does lingering radiation adversely affect the health of residents, and is there still a danger from eating food grown there? These are questions that many not have answers to for some time to come. In the meantime, a priority for CCI volunteers is simply to spend time with the kids, hug them, show them some love, and help them look forward to some kind of future -- whatever their link to the explosion that so altered their past. ""We're not scientists; we're humanitarians,"" Ryan said. ""We just don't want these people to be forgotten.""","A botched reactor safety test set off the worst nuclear disaster in history in 1986 .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Iranian nuclear negotiators arrived Friday and began consultations with Chinese and Russian counterparts on the eve of international talks on the country's nuclear program, state media reported. Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, has said he intends to bring ""new initiatives"" to talks Saturday with delegates from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the United States, France, Russia, China, and Britain -- and Germany. That group has spearheaded diplomatic efforts to persuade Iran to rein in its nuclear program, which Iran has said is purely peaceful but which U.N. and Western leaders suspect of having military aims, including a possible nuclear weapon. On Friday, Iran's official Press TV cited a source close to the Iranian delegation in reporting that Iran sees little encouraging coming from the remarks of European and U.S. officials ahead of the talks. Iran has been under increasing pressure to accept international demands to restrict its nuclear program, including a series of increasingly harsh economic sanctions imposed by European nations and the United States. Last month, Iranian officials signaled they were ready to engage with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, over the issue. The European Union said Monday that Iran had agreed to Saturday's talks in Istanbul. Iran suggested last week that one proposal may be a reduction in the amount of uranium it enriches to 20%, but it was unclear Friday if such a proposal was still on the table. While the enrichment isn't enough to create nuclear weapons, which require a uranium content of 90% or more, analysts and inspectors say it is step toward being able to create a nuclear weapon. Last month, the IAEA noted what it called a sharp and troubling increase in Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. Iran says the enrichment is for research and medical needs. As a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran has the right, like other countries, to enrich uranium for commercial and research reactors. But the same facilities that are used for peaceful enrichment can be used to enrich uranium for a bomb, and inspectors say they have not been able to fully gauge Iran's intentions. IAEA inspectors traveled to Iran in January and again in February to discuss the issue but said Iran refused to grant inspectors access to a military base the agency believes may have been used to test explosives that could be used to detonate a nuclear bomb. Last month, IAEA director Yukiya Amano said the agency has credible information that Iran has engaged in ""activities relevant to the development of nuclear explosive devices."" On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admonished Iranian officials to come to Istanbul willing to make progress on international demands. ""This is a chance for Iran to credibly address the concerns of the international community,"" Clinton said. ""Iran, coming to the table, needs to demonstrate that they are serious."" A top Iranian religious leader, Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, countered Friday that Western leaders should back off, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. They should, instead, ""react to Iran's proposals logically and stop the current unconstructive accusations against the Islamic Republic,"" IRNA quoted him as saying.","Iranian nuclear negotiators arrive in Istanbul, Turkey, for talks .

"(CNN) -- An education department in one Malaysian state is sending effeminate boys to a boot camp to change their behavior, a move that's drawn fire from educators and activists. The Terengganu state Education Department picked 66 boys for the camp this month, part of a program to help boys deal with identity crises, media in the Asian nation reported. The camp offers physical training and other activities and is designed to prevent the boys from developing feminine traits, The Star newspaper reported, quoting Razali Daud, the education department's director. ""The boys involved were selected from most schools in the state,"" Daud is quoted as saying. ""They were carefully vetted before a final selection was made."" Daud said there could be big problems for such boys if their behavior was not addressed. He cited a couple of factors contributing to the issue -- parents dressing boys in girl's clothing ""as they had really wanted a girl"" or boys ""surrounded by female siblings."" The move smacks of homophobia to many. Donna Guest, deputy director of the Asia-Pacific program at Amnesty International, deplored the action, which ""feeds into gender stereotyping and homophobia."" Malaysia is a state party to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, and an article in that convention calls on countries to ensure that gender stereotyping does not occur, she said. ""Starting a re-education camp or boot camp is directly counter to that. It goes to encouraging discrimination against all people because of their sexual orientation."" Guest also noted that homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia. ""Amnesty would oppose that and urges the government to repeal those provisions in the law,"" she said, adding that ""anyone who is arrested merely for being gay we would consider as prisoners of conscience, they should be released immediately non-conditionally."" Malaysia's Women, Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Sharizat Abdul Jalil said the ministry views the move with ""alarm and great concern"" and said such boot camps should be abolished. ""The experience of being singled out on the basis of perceived characteristics is an extremely traumatizing experience, in particular for adolescent teens. Such profiling has potentially serious psychological repercussions and could harm the development and mental health of the children, as it exposes them to prejudices among their peers and members of their family and community,"" she said. She said the camps violate the Child Act 2001, which says ""every child is entitled to protection and assistance in all circumstances without regard to distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, social origin or physical, mental or emotional disabilities or any other status."" The Joint Action Group for Gender Equality, a coalition of Malaysian organizations, said it was appalled at the move, noting that ""identifying and singling out boys who behave effeminately is highly discriminatory bordering on predatory."" It said the department is undermining the role of education -- nurturing ""the personality and talents of the child"" and inculcating ""respect for human rights in preparation for responsible adulthood."" And it said fashioning a criterion for so-called normal behavior ""is highly questionable."" ""The boys in this case have been denied and persecuted for the expression of their personalities and identities. Ideally, school is supposed to provide a safe and neutral space for children to develop without fear of recrimination for being themselves,"" the group said. It added that the children in question weren't -- but should have been -- consulted. ""Corrective boot camps to 'fix' children and individuals must not be condoned because it violates the rights of people who are perceived as 'different.' It should be strongly opposed and challenged as it promotes homophobia and prejudice. We should send a clear message to institutions that they have no business meddling with an individual's identity and personal preference,"" the group said. Ellen Kahn, director of the Human Rights Campaign's Foundation Family Project and a professional social worker, said it is ""heartbreaking that young men are being forced into 'masculinity camps' simply because some adults don't think they are masculine enough."" The group is an advocate for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. ""It is irresponsible for adults -- particularly parents -- to shame and punish their children for who they are.  These attempts to change children only cause emotional harm and distress.   We should heed the advice of The American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, among other experts, and provide love, support and affirmation to our children regardless of their gender expression or sexual orientation.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States sanctioned two engineering firms Wednesday for their ties to an elite Iranian military unit that has been branded a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. Iran Maritime Industrial Company SADRA and it subsidiary, Deep Offshore Technology PJS, are connected with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, the U.S. Department of the Treasury said. ""By designating the individuals and entities today, Treasury is sending a clear signal to the international community that Iran's attempts to evade international sanctions will not go unnoticed,"" Adam Szubin, director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in a statement. SADRA has offices in Iran and Venezuela and is owned by Khatam al-Anbiya, which the office has designated as an engineering arm of the Quds Force, the statement said. The Treasury Department also announced sanctions against two shipping companies based in Malta and two shipping officials connected to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. The shipping lines have ""played a key role in Iran's efforts to advance its missile programs and transport other military cargoes,"" the Treasury Department said. The companies and individuals were sanctioned under an executive order freezing the assets of proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their supporters, the department said . The sanctions come a day after the United States sanctioned an Iranian airline, three Iranian officials, a trading company and a shipping agent for providing support to the Quds Force. Iran's secretive Quds Force is the elite special operations unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard. The most militant wing of the Guard, Quds has reportedly carried out covert operations in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Iraq. The United States has accused it of aiding insurgent groups behind attacks on U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, Jane's global security site reports.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- ""Significant differences"" remain between world powers and Iran in negotiations over its nuclear program, European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Thursday. But, Ashton said, ""it's clear that we both want to make progress."" The parties ""agree on further discussions to expand common ground,"" she said, and have a clear direction going forward. Negotiations between Iran and the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, France, Britain, Russia, China and Germany -- will continue next month in Moscow. Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, asserted Iran's right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy in his remarks to reporters. Later, in an interview with CNN, Jalili said there was progress. ""In two days, we exchanged viewpoints regarding those issues,"" he said. ""It showed both sides are serious in order to move forward in the talks."" Western powers fear that Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons, despite its insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. The West has been using sanctions and diplomacy to try to stop Iran from producing nuclear arms. Jalili told CNN that the removal of ""hostile measures"" would increase cooperation. ""We have always said the thing that could break this deadlock is the attitude and cooperation,"" he said. ""The current strategy of pressure could make the talks come to an end. The time for and the strategy of pressure is over, but we still have time for talks and new strategies that can bring a new horizon if (there is) cooperation."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the sanctions will remain in place. ""Iran now has the choice to make,"" she said. ""Will it meet its international obligations and give the world confidence about its intentions, or not."" The announcement of further talks followed two days of intense negotiations in Baghdad. The discussions, scheduled to take a day, were extended into Thursday after reaching an apparent stalemate a day earlier. Speaking after the talks wrapped up, Ashton said the world powers remain ""firm, clear and united"" in seeking a swift diplomatic swift resolution to their concerns over the ""exclusively peaceful nature"" of Iran's nuclear program. ""We expect Iran to take concrete and practical steps to urgently meet the concerns of the international community, to build confidence and to meet its international obligations,"" she said. The world powers laid out ""clear proposals"" to address the issues at hand and in particular the question of 20% enrichment. Meanwhile, Iran came with its own five-point plan, which included an assertion that the world recognizes its ""right to enrichment,"" she said. ""It's clear that we both want to make progress and that there is some common ground,"" she said. However, ""significant differences remain."" Diplomats will arrive in Moscow on June 17, for talks on June 18 and 19 which will be based on ""a step-by-step approach and reciprocity,"" Ashton said. The resolve to continue talks may signal a change in tone, coming after past negotiations that have been marred by threats and allegations of foot-dragging and unreasonable demands. Wednesday's meeting appeared to yield little result, with each side submitting dueling proposals. Iran rejected calls during talks to stop the high enrichment of uranium that can be used for weapons, while the international powers refused Tehran's demand for an immediate end to sanctions crippling its economy. Iran threatened this year to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping lane, if sanctions were imposed on its exports of crude oil. Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. The talks come at a critical time for Iran. The country's economy has been crippled by sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union. Because 80% of Iran's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports, an embargo by the EU set to go into effect in July will put further pressure on its economy. On Wednesday, the six world powers made Iran an offer for stopping its processing of medium-enriched uranium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons, EU officials said. The proposal also called for Tehran to prove its nuclear program is being used for peaceful purposes as it claims, and comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a Western official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions. Asked whether relief from the tough Western sanctions imposed on Iran will be on the table, the same Western official said: ""There is no expectation it will happen as a result of this meeting. Iran would need to take significant concrete action first,"" the official said. Iran's counter-proposal included five areas of nuclear and non-nuclear cooperation, state-run IRNA reported late Wednesday. A British Foreign Office spokesman said world powers are offering support for Iranian economic and agricultural development and the country's civilian nuclear program in exchange for cooperation. Another idea on the table is an updated version of an earlier offer to swap enriched uranium for nuclear fuel, European Union officials said. There had been a proposal to swap most of Iran's low-enriched uranium for fuel rods to power a medical research reactor in Tehran. The proposals address the world community's ""concerns about the nature of their nuclear program,"" said Mann, the spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Ashton. ""Obviously, you have various U.N. Security Council resolutions and reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency that have found suspicions that they may be developing a military program, so our proposals on the table address those concerns,"" Mann said. ""We hope that they will come back and react positively to those proposals that we've made and that we can really talk about the substance and get things moving."" Mann said 20% uranium enrichment ""is one of the issues that's addressed"" in proposals Ashton put on the table. Uranium enriched at 20% is typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors, but is also seen as a shortcut toward the 90% enrichment required to build nuclear weapons. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, said all parties should be commended for returning to the negotiating table. ""A feasible solution is to match tangible, verifiable Iranian concessions with a delay of the impending European Union oil embargo,"" Parsi said in a statement. ""This would add time to the negotiation clock and buy both sides some breathing space.""

"San Salvador, El Salvador (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday expressed hope that Libya's opposition movement, given new protection by a U.S.-led military mission, can organize itself to revive broad enthusiasm for political change and oust Moammar Gadhafi from power. In a 13-minute interview with CNN's Spanish-language network, Obama said the immediate goal of the U.N.-sanctioned military mission that began Saturday was to prevent an onslaught of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi by Gadhafi's military. ""Because the international community rallied, his troops have now pulled back from Benghazi,"" Obama said. Now the United States and its coalition partners, including NATO allies and Arab states, are establishing a no-fly zone over Libya, with U.S. forces taking out Gadhafi's air defense systems, Obama said. He conceded that Gadhafi could ""hunker down and wait it out even in the face of a no-fly zone, even though his forces have been degraded."" ""Our hope is that the first thing that happens once we clear this space is that the rebels start discussing how they're able to organize themselves, how they articulate their aspirations for the Libyan people,"" Obama said. ""Potentially what we may see is all the enthusiasm that the Libyan people had for a change in government that was occurring a few weeks ago,"" but was brutally repressed by Gadhafi, can now resurface, the president said. In particular, Obama said he hoped that the Libyan people decide it was time for a change that ends up sweeping Gadhafi from power. The president acknowledged the irony of being a Nobel Peace Prize winner who ordered the U.S. military into action on the eight anniversary of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, but said the goal in this case was humanitarian. ""I'm accustomed to this contradiction of being both a commander-in-chief but also somebody who aspires to peace,"" Obama said, adding the Libya mission was to protect the Libyan people from Gadhafi's military. ""We're not invading a country; we are not acting alone,"" he said. ""We are acting under a mandate issued by the U.N. Security Council."" The American people will see no contradiction between someone who believes in peace and ""who wants to make sure people aren't butchered because of a dictator who wants to cling to power,""Obama added. Speaking in El Salvador on the final leg of a three-nation Latin American trip that included stops in Brazil and Chile, Obama also cited what he called a new relationship between the United States and the region to the south. He noted that an area once known for dictatorships and coups now featured democratic governments that were less focused on political ideology and more focused on results in helping their people. ""That's the kind of partner we want,"" Obama said, describing the relationship as a ""two-way street"" based on mutual respect, interests and trust, rather than the old model of underdeveloped nations approaching the United States with ""hat in hand."" Asked about immigration reform back home, Obama said he would again make the push for a comprehensive bill. ""I'm going to need some help,"" he said. ""I can get the majority of Democrats to support it. I need some help from Republicans."" With last year's census results showing a growing Hispanic population in the United States, Obama said Republicans will have a hard time winning future elections if they focus on anti-immigration sentiment.","President gives an exclusive interview to CNN's Spanish-language network .

"(CNN) -- An official with the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency emerged from a meeting with an Iranian delegation in Vienna on Friday and reported no progress on a document intended to resolve issues related to Tehran's nuclear program. ""The agency team came to the meeting in a constructive spirit with the desire and intention of finalizing the paper,"" International Atomic Energy Agency Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts said in a statement. ""We presented a revised draft which addressed Iran's earlier stated concerns. However, there has been no progress and, indeed, Iran raised issues that we have already discussed and added new ones. This is disappointing."" Iran, world powers agree to meet on nuclear issue . No date has been set for another meeting, he said. Before the talks, China's President Hu Jintao urged Tehran to take a ""flexible and pragmatic"" approach, China's foreign ministry said. Hu told Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Friday, when the two leaders met in Beijing, that China believed in serious dialogue and cooperation as the way to ease tensions, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Ahmadinejad said Iran would continue to pursue negotiations and maintain contact with all sides, Xinhua said. Hu's remarks come a day after he and Russian President Vladimir Putin jointly stated that ""any attempts to resolve the Iranian issue by force are unacceptable."" Putin, Ahmadinejad meet before nuclear talks . Friday's private meeting with Iranian negotiators at the IAEA occurred 10 days ahead of international negotiations over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Officials in Vienna had been expected to continue working toward an inspection agreement over Iran's nuclear capabilities. They have been keen to gain access to restricted sites amid rising concern about satellite images taken last month that showed the Iranians had demolished buildings at one site that inspectors have been pressing to visit. The agency's director-general, Yukiya Amano, said last month after meeting with Iranian negotiator Saeed Jalili in Tehran that a deal that would allow broader inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities could come ""quite soon."" However, Russia and China's support for Tehran this week may have given Iran more leverage in the talks with IAEA officials. Hu and Putin, along with four Central Asian partner nations, signed a joint declaration in Beijing on Thursday at the end of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit expressing concern over recent developments in Iran. ""We believe any attempts to resolve the Iranian issue by force are unacceptable,"" it said. ""Such attempts could lead to unpredictably serious consequences, which would threaten stability and security in the region and the entire world. We call on all parties to maintain maximum restraint, and refrain from words and actions that may lead to further confrontations."" Hu and Putin also released a joint statement Wednesday expressing opposition to any use of force on Iran. ""We do not approve exerting excessive pressure and implementing unilateral sanctions against Iran,"" they said. ""We advocate actively working for peace and facilitating talks in resolving the Iran nuclear issue."" The United States, France, Russia, China, Britain and Germany -- the ""P5+1,"" a reference to Germany plus the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- are to meet June 18-19 with Iran in Moscow for another round of talks on Iran's nuclear program. Some world powers, particularly Western nations, suspect that Iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons, although Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Last month, during a round of talks with the P5+1 in Baghdad, Iran rejected calls to stop its high enrichment of uranium, while the international powers refused Tehran's demand for an immediate end to sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union that are crippling its economy.

Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.

"(CNN) -- The president of a Connecticut beverage distributor said Thursday a man who went on a shooting rampage this week never filed a claim alleging racial discrimination. The girlfriend of Omar Thornton, who killed eight people and then himself, told CNN that he was being racially harassed at work. But Ross Hollander, whose family owns Hartford Distributors, said there were no grievances filed with the company or Thornton's union. ""I can state to you unequivocally no racism claim was ever alleged,"" Hollander said at a news conference. ""Nevertheless, these ugly allegations have been raised and the company will cooperate with any investigation."" Kristi Hannah, Omar Thornton's girlfriend, said he first told her about racial harassment at work last summer. Hannah said her mother told Thornton to take pictures of the alleged harassment with his cell phone. He took two pictures in the men's bathroom at work, she said. She described one as his name written on a cartoon, and the other as a drawing of a hangman with a noose around its neck. Connecticut state police have the phone. Hannah's mother, Joanne Hannah, said she had heard of the cell phone photos. She said Thornton heard a co-worker say he ""wanted that n****r out of there."" She said Thornton told his girlfriend he had reported harassment to a company supervisor and a union representative, but nothing was done about it. ""There is nothing on record of any complaints from Omar, and there had been no disciplinary actions with him prior to this,"" said Chris Roos, secretary and treasurer of Teamsters Local 1035. Manchester, Connecticut, police have said they have found no evidence of racial discrimination. Thornton's mother told CNN affiliate WFSB that he called her shortly after 7 a.m. Tuesday. He said he had just shot several people and planned to kill himself. She said she pleaded with him for 10 minutes not to do it. ""He said, 'I killed the five racists that was there bothering me,'"" Thornton's uncle, Will Holliday, told WFSB. ""He said, 'That's it. The cops are going to come in, so I'm going to take care of it myself.'"" Hollander said Thornton ""was embraced as a member of our team."" Authorities said Thornton, 34, resigned under pressure Tuesday after he was accused of stealing alcoholic beverages while on his driving route. An investigation found Thornton was stealing and selling goods to others, Hollander said. As he left that meeting, escorted by two people, Thornton said he wanted a drink of water and went into the kitchen area, Manchester Police Lt. Chris Davis said. Police believe he had brought two 9mm handguns to the building in a lunch box. In the kitchen, he pulled out the guns and shot his two escorts. Thornton then ""went through the whole building in a very short amount of time"" as workers cowered under desks and in ""nooks and crannies"" and 911 calls poured in, Davis said. ""It's probably likely that he was targeting some individuals,"" he said. Thornton passed people without shooting them, he said. He would not say whether anyone was shot in the parking lot, but said Thornton shot through a glass door to re-enter the building. The first 911 call came in at 7:26 a.m., Davis said, and the first officers arrived within three minutes. A five-man team was sent into the building to search for the suspect within 10 minutes, he said. Thornton's body was found in a corner office area of the building by 8:15 a.m. Manchester police identified the eight slain people as Francis Fazio, 57, of Bristol, Connecticut; Douglas Scuton, 56, of Middletown, New Hampshire; Edwin Kennison, 49, of East Hartford, Connecticut; William Ackerman, 51, of Broadbrook, Connecticut; Bryan Cirigliano, 51, of Newington, Connecticut; Craig Pepin, 60, of South Windsor, Connecticut; Louis Felder Jr., 50, of Stamford, Connecticut; and Victor James of Windsor, Connecticut, who was killed on his 61st birthday. Steven Hollander, 50, of South Windsor was treated and released from Hartford Hospital. Jerome Rosenstein, 77, of West Hartford, Connecticut, was in serious condition Wednesday. Cirigliano was the shop steward for the Teamsters union and its president, Roos said. One of those killed was attempting to escape from the gunfire and drove a forklift into an electrical conduit, starting an electrical fire, Davis said Wednesday. He would not say whether that person was shot. Police also found a shotgun in Thornton's vehicle, but believe it was not used in the shootings, Davis said. Thornton was ""fairly nomadic,"" he said, and authorities have searched his previous addresses, but found nothing of value. Thornton left no notes behind and made no comments to relatives about his plans, Davis said. But the fact that he brought the guns to the building indicates the shootings were ""obviously something he was thinking about doing."" Thornton had six guns registered to him, and police were attempting to account for them all, Davis said. Authorities believe the guns used in the shootings were bought at a gun dealership in East Windsor, Connecticut.

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal grand jury in the District of Columbia has indicted two people for their alleged attempts to supply Iran with U.S. materials for gas centrifuges to enrich uranium, the Justice Department said Friday. The indictment charges Parviz Khaki, an Iranian citizen, and Zongcheng Yi, a resident of China, each with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by conspiring to export the goods without the required license. Both also face one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, two counts of smuggling, two counts of illegally exporting U.S. goods to Iran in violation of IEEPA and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, the Justice Department said. The indictment also accuses Khaki of seeking to obtain for customers in Iran radioactive source materials from the United States. Khaki, 43, was arrested in the Philippines in May. Yi remains at large. ""This new indictment shows that we have no tolerance for those who try to traffic in commodities that can be used to support Iran's nuclear program,"" U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. said in a statement. ""It also underscores our commitment to aggressively enforcing export laws."" As a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, Iran has the right, like other countries, to enrich uranium for commercial and research reactors. But the same facilities that are used for peaceful enrichment can be used to enrich uranium for a bomb. That's what many Western countries suspect Iran is doing. Iran insists its nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes. Among the materials Khaki and Yi are accused of trying to obtain are measuring instruments, pressure transducers, vacuum pumps and maraging steel, a class of high-strength steel. All can be used in gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment. The indictment alleges they both also caused the illegal export of lathes and nickel alloy wire to Iran, and it accuses Khaki of trying to obtain radioactive source materials. In 2009 and again in 2011, he allegedly contacted an undercover U.S. federal agent, posing as an exporter, asking the agent to purchase radioactive sources. A law enforcement official, not authorized to talk to the media, declined to say whether the radioactive and centrifuge materials made it through to Iran. The lathes and nickel alloy wire were shipped from the United States through China to Iran. If convicted, Khaki and Yi could face up to 20 years in prison for conspiring to violate IEEPA, five years for conspiring to defraud the United States, 10 years for each smuggling count, 20 years for each exporting count and 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering.

"(CNN) -- Members of Madagascar's military battled supporters of President Marc Ravalomanana outside the presidential palace Monday as the turmoil over whether he stays in office intensified. Madagascan soldiers loyal to opposition leader Andry Rajoelina outside the presidential palace Monday. An eyewitness who blogs from Madagascar, Stefan Armananarivo, told CNN he saw two tanks outside the presidential palace in Antananarivo, the country's capital, and saw the military shoot at people in the crowd protecting the building. News reports from the scene gave similar descriptions and said the self-declared leader of the armed forces had announced his support for the opposition. Some supporters of the president lined up to try to block the military from taking over the palace. It was not immediately clear whether the military had taken over the palace. Reports said the embattled Ravalomanana was in a different palace at the time. At the U.S. embassy in Antananarivo, the head of security announced that explosions and gunshots had been heard at the palace, according to an embassy employee who asked not to be named for security reasons. The violence came as the African Union held an emergency meeting to discuss the power struggle gripping Madagascar. The AU said all members of its Peace and Security group would attend the meeting. Ravalomanana pledged Sunday that he would remain in office despite fierce opposition, and urged the country's military not to intervene. ""I am aware of the feelings of anxiety that you feel in the face of intentions to seize power by force,"" Ravalomanana told a crowd gathered at the president's palace Sunday in Lavoloha, according to a statement issued by his office. He pledged to ""remain faithful to the people and never leave her alone."" An official with his office told CNN that the president said he would organize a referendum if that would help solve the crisis. The statement from Ravalomanana's office quoted him as saying, ""If we have to go through a referendum, I have nothing to fear even if this occurs."" The president's government has been at odds with opposition leader Andry Rajoelina, who recently was ousted from his position as mayor of Antananarivo. Rajoelina has called on Ravalomanana to quit. Poverty has been a major issue in Madagascar, boosting Rajoelina's appeal to a segment of the population angered by the behavior of Ravalomanana, including his recent purchase of a private jet.

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors building a case against a teenager accused of raping and killing a high school teacher say he apparently planned an attack on a female youth counselor earlier this month, according to court documents. Philip Chism, 15, took deliberate steps to ""elude"" staff as he followed a counselor into a locker and bathroom area at a Department of Youth Services facility and, wielding a pencil as a weapon, attacked her, according to an affidavit filed June 10 and released Thursday. Chism allegedly choked and beat the employee before staff intervened and restrained him. Chism ""took several steps to elude other staff who were believed to be observing him including but not limited to creeping along a common hallway crouched down out of view of observers,"" Essex Assistant District Attorney Kate B. MacDougall said in the affidavit. Chism is awaiting trial on charges he raped and murdered his high school algebra teacher, Colleen Ritzer, on October 22, 2013. Police and prosecutors say the teacher was killed with a box cutter in a girls' bathroom at Danvers High School. He is now being held at Worcester State Hospital, court documents say. Prosecutors have requested that Chism not be allowed in any part of that hospital that is not securely locked; not be allowed to leave without prosecutors' consent; and not be left alone with female staff or patients, according to court documents. An official at the youth services facility had been warned by MacDougall in November not to allow Chism to be alone with female staff members, court documents say. A call to one of Chism's attorneys, Susan Oker, was not immediately returned. Denise Regan, another defense attorney, declined to comment Friday. In January, Chism pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder charges in the Ritzer case. He is being tried as an adult. After Chism was reported missing by his mother on the evening of October 22, police had his cell phone company ""ping"" the location of his phone. It was found near the Hollywood Hits Theater, where investigators learned the teen had bought a movie ticket and then left. An affidavit said that when Chism was spotted by a police officer the next day, he was carrying a knife. A search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter. Asked where the blood came from, Chism allegedly responded: ""The girl."" He also allegedly carried credit cards and driver's licenses belonging to Ritzer, as well as a pair of women's underwear. Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris, court papers said. Her throat was slit.

"(CNN) -- Former Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci -- who later served as U.S. ambassador to Canada -- died Saturday after battling ALS, the University of Massachusetts Medical School said. He was 65. Cellucci died at his home in Hudson -- the small town from which he rose from selectman to eventually governor and diplomat -- surrounded by family, the school said, adding it was announcing the news on behalf of Cellucci's family. A graduate of Boston College and Boston College Law School, Cellucci served in the U.S. Army Reserves and worked as a lawyer and for his family's car dealership before he was elected in 1976 to the Massachusetts Legislature. The Republican served for 14 years there, as a state representative and later a state senator, before being elected lieutenant governor in 1990, according to his biography on the state website. When Gov. William Weld stepped down in 1997 after being tapped by President Bill Clinton to become U.S. ambassador to Mexico -- a job he never got due to GOP objections -- Cellucci took his place. Bay State voters elected him to the governorship the following year. In 2001, Cellucci followed Weld's lead in leaving the Massachusetts State House for an ambassador's job following his nomination by President George W. Bush. He assumed the position as America's top diplomat in Canada, a post he held for five years. Presidents George H.W. and George W. Bush released a joint statement Saturday about a man they called ""a close and loyal friend, a superb public servant and a devoted family man."" They noted that Cellucci was the first Massachusetts official to back the elder Bush's losing 1980 presidential campaign, grouping him with other Bay Staters such as Andrew Card and Andrew Natsios who also served under the two Bushes. ""We were deeply saddened to learn of Paul Cellucci's passing,"" the former presidents said.

"(CNN) -- With no time left on the clock, members of Congress finally reached a deal that would reopen the federal government and raise the debt ceiling. As the world watched Congress stumble and tumble toward the brink of default, Senate Democrats and Republicans finally agreed on a deal that gained enough support in the House to bring this episode to a close. Some Democrats and pundits have concluded that Democrats are walking away the victors. They correctly argue that the Republican Party has become so damaged in the polls as a result of their hardball tactics that they are extremely vulnerable in the 2014 midterms and could very well suffer in the presidential election of 2016 as a result of these debates. President Barack Obama also walks away from this deal with the Affordable Care Act generally intact, as conservative proposals to repeal the program recede further and further away from political reality. In 2011, when threatened with the debt ceiling, Obama conceded to Republican demands by agreeing to the 2011 Budget Control Act. This time he refused to negotiate. But can Democrats really claim victory? Not really. As the dust settles, Republicans might find themselves pretty content with the outcome of this battle. In terms of public policy, they have kept the President on the defensive and kept their main issue front and center. Throughout much of the past month and a half, when the President hoped to return from the congressional recess to push the immigration bill through the House, all attention has centered on sequestration, repealing the Affordable Care Act, cutting spending and avoiding fiscal catastrophe. All of the other energy has been sucked out of Washington. Even with the current deal, the sequestration remains in effect, severely harming government agencies that have undergone cuts as well as those in desperate need of funding increases. Congress and the administration will now embark on more extensive discussions about budget reform that will consume the attention of both parties until the middle of January. For now, sequestration remains in place, leaving many agencies with insufficient funds. The battle has also been beneficial to Republicans in that they have continued the process of normalizing the use of radical tactics in pushing for cuts to the federal government. Just as many Americans seemed to accept sequestration, conservative Republicans have not yet felt any serious political threat as a result of their having forced a government shutdown. Nor is it clear that there will be any negative consequences to them for having gone to the brink of a federal default in their fight for concessions on the budget deal. If they are left standing, there is little reason to think that they won't use these tactics once again. The last month offers them a template. Furthermore, the current deal simply postpones any decision and actually sets up another round of fights when Congress returns from its winter break in December. The new year will look very much like the one that came before. Given the pattern we have seen, conservative Republicans will be just as likely, even more likely, to employ the same kind of aggressive tactics and try to force the administration into accepting deep cuts in domestic spending if Obama wants to keep the economy in stable condition. 9 things we missed during the shutdown . Conservatives will be even more emboldened as they seek to please their constituents going into the 2014 midterm elections. The deal that emerged from the Senate is simply a continuation of the kind of political chaos that we have witnessed since the 2010 midterms. Obama will have to start fighting on this issue as soon as the ink is dry. Obama has spent much of his second term on defense, responding to pressure from House Republicans to cut spending and trying to combat their use of radical procedural weapons. This crisis was clearly the most dangerous moment for the country. And it is true that Obama and congressional Democrats walk away having achieved important objectives. After all, the government is up and running again, at least for the time being, and Congress has raised the debt ceiling, thereby averting a global meltdown. But Republicans have defined the national agenda and forced a deal that doesn't resolve debate. Just the opposite: It ensures that the fights will continue and the threat of default continues into the foreseeable future. Until Democrats find a way to reach some kind of long-term budget accord by building sufficient pressure -- and electoral support -- to push back against the Republican Right, they'll find themselves on the losing side of this issue over and over again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer .","A deal will reopen government and avert a default on U.S. debt .

"(CNN) -- Iran has hanged a man who was convicted of killing one of its nuclear scientists, state-run Press TV reported Tuesday. Majid Jamali Fashi was convicted of the January 2010 killing of Massoud Ali Mohammadi, an Iranian university professor and a nuclear scientist. He was also convicted of spying. Prosecutors accused him of working for Israel's spy agency, Mossad, and said he was paid $120,000 by Israel to carry out the hit. Israel does not comment on such claims. The killing was among a series of attacks against Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years. In January, Iran sent a letter to the United Nations secretary-general alleging that the killings of the scientists were terrorist attacks that followed a clear pattern. ""There is firm evidence that certain foreign quarters are behind such assassinations,"" the letter said. ""It is highly expected from the secretary-general of the United Nations, and President of the Security Council of the United Nations, as well as all other relevant organs and bodies, to condemn, in the strongest terms, these inhumane terrorist acts."" Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, another nuclear scientist, was killed in a blast in Tehran in January after a motorcyclist placed a magnetic bomb under Roshan's Peugeot 405 automobile. Mohammadi and one other scientist were killed in a similar fashion in the last two years. With no one claiming responsibility, the killings remain shrouded in mystery. In January, Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's U.N. ambassador, blamed Israel for the attacks. ""They are trying to assassinate the Iranian scientists to deprive Iranians from the right of using peaceful nuclear energy,"" Khazaee said. ""We believe that these terrorist attacks are supported by some elements -- especially within the Israeli regime, as well as some quarters around the world."" Israel generally refuses to comment on accusations and speculation. After Roshan's death, Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said on his Facebook page Wednesday, ""I have no idea who targeted the Iranian scientist but I certainly don't shed a tear."" Some in Iran have pointed to the United States, but U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton rejected the claims. ""I want to categorically deny any United States involvement in any kind of act of violence inside Iran,"" she said in January.","Majid Jamali Fashi was convicted of the January 2010 killing of a university professor .

"(CNN) -- A day after a filibuster and a raucous crowd in the state Capitol foiled passage of a bill that would have imposed strict new regulations on abortion in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry vowed Wednesday to try again. Perry said the Legislature would convene July 1 in special session to take up the abortion bill, which was declared dead before dawn Wednesday. The bill failed after a night of drama in Austin during which a lone lawmaker talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on a special session. Chants of ""shame! shame! shame!"" from spectators who had filled the building drowned out the efforts of Republican lawmakers as they tried to pass it minutes before midnight. ""We will not allow the breakdown of decorum and decency to prevent us from doing what the people of this state hired us to do,"" Perry said in a statement calling lawmakers back into another special session. Texans ""value life and want to protect women and the unborn,"" he said. Perry's announcement came a day before he was to address the National Right to Life convention in Dallas on Thursday. Opinion: The truth about the Texas filibuster and abortion . And it came on a day when abortion rights advocates found a new hero in state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth. Though Republicans control the state Senate, Davis tried to block the abortion bill by attempting a 13-hour filibuster Tuesday. ""I underestimated how difficult it would be -- both physically and mentally,"" Davis told CNN's ""AC360"" on Wednesday. ""About two hours in, I realized I was in for a long day. My back started hurting pretty early on and began to really hurt as the hours ticked by."" But, she said, the energy from the packed gallery ""kept me going throughout the day."" Davis fell short of her goal by less than three hours when the chair ruled she had gone off topic. The gallery erupted in boos. Her fellow Democrats stalled for time with procedural tactics. And as the clock wound down, opponents of the bill drowned out proceedings on the floor, preventing lawmakers from completing a vote in time to get it passed. At 3 a.m., Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst stepped to the Senate floor to declare the bill dead and the special session over. Texas parents agree not to pressure teen to have abortion . ""We empowered the voice of people in Texas and people who wanted to stand against this intrusion, this big government intrusion, into their personal lives,"" Davis said Wednesday night. Even if the bill winds up passing in the next special session, the reaction will not be split along partisan lines, she predicted. ""It's a reaction coming from Republicans, independents and Democrats alike, which is saying: Governor Perry, Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst, stay out of my private decision-making."" The bill would have banned most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightened standards on abortion clinics and the doctors who work at them. Critics said the measure would have shut most of the abortion clinics in Texas. ""He (Perry) lost this fight in regular session, and even after they broke the rules he and his allies lost again in front of the entire country last night,"" said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a statement. ""They tried every trick in the book, blocking testimony from the very women whose lives would be affected, voting in the middle of the night, shutting down the debate â€” they couldn't get this done because Texans would not let them."" Wearing pink sneakers, Davis, 50, took to the floor of the chamber late Tuesday morning to criticize the bill. Rules called for her to stand, unaided, until midnight, for the filibuster to succeed. She was not allowed to sit down, lean or take a bathroom break, and she was allowed three warnings before the Senate was to be allowed to vote on whether to stop the filibuster. The senator spent much of the time reading testimony and messages from women decrying the bill and recounting the struggles they, their friends or relatives faced before birth control and abortion were legalized. ""Women realize that these bills will not protect their health,"" she said. ""They will only reduce their access to abortion providers and limit their ability to make their own family-planning decisions."" Early in the diatribe, her comments were ruled off topic and she was given her first warning. During the evening, a fellow senator helped Davis put on a back brace, which was ruled to have violated filibuster rules, and she got her second warning. Finally, at about 10 p.m., Davis talked about the abortion pill, RU486, and the chairman ruled again that her comments were off topic. But a member of the Senate then moved that the ruling be appealed, and its status was in doubt. The final hours of the session were marked by confusing parliamentary maneuvers until Sen. Leticia Van de Putte stepped to the microphone, ending the debate. ""At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?"" the Democratic senator asked after she had been ignored. At 15 minutes before midnight, the gallery erupted in applause and chants of ""Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"" As the session ended, Davis waded into the crowd of supporters and praised them as ""the people who truly made this happen."" Texas Right to Life blamed ""the angry mob of protesters in the Senate gallery"" for the failure of the bill to pass. ""Ultimately, we should be encouraged that we had the votes and that so many came to support the bill,"" the anti-abortion group said on its website. ""We will continue to work to pass Pro-Life legislation that protects women and saves lives in Texas."" The last stand . Davis' stand captivated abortion rights advocates from coast to coast, prompting the hashtag #standwithwendy on Twitter. The White House took notice. ""Something special is happening in Austin tonight,"" said a post on President Barack Obama's official Twitter account. The account is run by Organizing for Action, a nonprofit group established to support the president's legislative agenda. A post by Aimee Parker of Los Angeles said: ""I'm in absolute awe of you, @WendyDavisTexas. Thank you for your passion, perseverance and unparalleled badassery."" English comedian Ricky Gervais weighed in as well. ""Whatever the outcome, @WendyDavisTexas efforts entered her into the pantheon of American heroes tonight."" Heady times for Davis, who was first elected to the Texas Senate in 2008, defeating a longtime Republican incumbent to do so. Last year, she staged a filibuster to force a special session in an attempt to stop $5 billion in cuts to Texas public schools, according to her website. Davis, who became a single mother at age 19, went on to graduate with honors from Harvard Law School, it says. Her filibuster was no record. In 1977, Sen. Bill Meier staged a 43-hour marathon. The special session ends with irony, Twitter user Cody Beckner said, echoing the governor's own words. ""'In Texas, we value all life,' Gov. Perry TX. Said on the eve of the state's 500th execution."" CNN's Josh Rubin, Ed Payne and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I underestimated how difficult it would be,"" Davis says .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea Handler's late-night television show on E!, ""Chelsea Lately,"" will come to a close in August, freeing the comedian to create a different show elsewhere. The ""Chelsea Lately"" finale date, August 26, was announced by the cable channel on Wednesday, capping months of speculation about Handler and E!'s plans to split. Her E! contract expires at the end of this year. In a national late-night field dominated by men, Handler is the only woman with a daily talk show. ""Chelsea Lately"" started in July 2007 and gradually became a signature part of the E! lineup. Handler was never shy about criticizing E! on the air or off. And Handler and her representatives have been intimating for a while now that she is ready to leave E! for another television network or for a new outlet such as Netflix. Wednesday's announcement made her exit official -- a full three months ahead of her contract expiration date. It is unclear where she will appear next. ""I myself am more surprised than anyone that I was able to hold down a job for seven years, and it was a fantastic seven years,"" she said in a statement. ""I will always look back at my time on E! as most people look back at their time in college. I'm glad I went.""

"(CNN) -- The Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai, India, had been warned about the possibility of a terrorist attack before a 60-hour rampage began Wednesday, leaving at least 183 people dead, the chairman of the company that owns the hotel said Saturday. Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata, whose company owns the Taj Hotel, discusses this week's attacks in Mumbai. The hotel heightened security as a result, the chairman of the Tata Group and Taj Hotels, Ratan Tata, said in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria. There were indications, though, that the hotel relaxed the security before the attack. ""It's ironic that we did have such a warning and we did have some measures,"" Tata said. ""People couldn't park their cars in the portico where you had to go through a metal detector,"" he said, explaining one of the measures. ""But if I look at what we had -- which all of us complained about -- it could not have stopped what took place. They didn't come through that entrance,"" he said, referring to the entrance that had a metal detector. He did not identify which entrance had the security device. ""They came from somewhere in the back. They planned everything,"" he said of the attackers. ""I believe the first thing they did, they shot a sniffer dog and his handler. They went through the kitchen, they knew what they were doing."" He did not elaborate on the hotel's warning or when the security measures were enacted.  Watch Tata discuss need for better preparedness » . A. Vaidyanathan, an economist who was a guest in the hotel when the attacks occurred, told The Hindu newspaper on Friday that he had noticed tight security at the Taj Mahal when he stayed there last month -- a measure he indicated was unusual. ""The last time I went, last month, there was very tight security. You could not get into the [hotel]. There is an entrance there, which is closed. At the entrance to the tower, they had two-level security,"" he told the newspaper. ""First, when you enter the open parking, where the cars are parked, you had a very heavy metal frame, your baggage was searched. ... At the entrance of the foyer, there was another metal detector and you were personally searched and so on."" However, for this latest trip, the hotel did not have the strict security. ""This time I noticed it had gone. We could go straight to the [hotel]."" The 105-year-old hotel was the site of the attackers' final stand. Authorities carried out a room-by-room sweep in the 565-room Victorian building late Saturday to make sure all guests had been evacuated and no gunmen remained hidden. The hotel's guests and staff had endured about 60 hours of explosions, gunfire and fires during the standoff. Another luxury hotel in Mumbai a few blocks away, the Hotel Oberoi, had also been among the nine sites attacked. Bullet holes and scars of grenade blasts marred the restaurant walls in the Taj Mahal Hotel, Tata said. An Indian commando spoke earlier this week about the hotel, saying bodies and blood had been all over.  See images from the battlegrounds » . ""I kept hearing the grenades or explosives going on inside; the sound of gunfire, the fact that there were several hundred people in the hotel, either at dinner or living there, and I just felt tremendously helpless,"" Tata said. Like several Indian officials, Tata said the attackers were well-equipped and well-versed in his hotel's layout. ""There seems to be no doubt that they knew their way around the hotel,"" he said. ""They seemed to know it in the night, or in the daytime. They seemed to have planned their moves quite well, and there seem to have been a lot of pre-planning in terms of what they did and how they managed to carry on for three days and sustain themselves during that time."" Asked whether it was possible if some of the attackers had an inside connection, he replied, ""I wouldn't know. I think this would be something that the investigation will show up."" Tata praised his staff and called them heroes. iReport.com: Share tributes to those lost . ""The general manager lost his whole family in one of the fires in the building,"" Tata said. ""I went up to him today and he said, 'Sir, we are going to beat this. We are going to build this Taj back into what it was. ... We will not let this event take us down.' "" Tata added, ""And that is the feeling that they have, and I have a feeling that that's pretty much echoed throughout the country.""","Taj had heightened security in response to warning, Tata group chairman says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A British Royal Navy nuclear submarine and its French equivalent collided while on operations in the Atlantic Ocean earlier this month, defense ministries in Paris and London confirmed Monday. The British Royal Navy submarine HMS Vanguard. Both vessels, HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant, were armed with nuclear warheads and suffered damage but were able to return to port under their own power following the collision. ""Two ""SNLE"" (nuclear submarines), one French and the other British, were, a few days ago, on standard patrols in the Atlantic. They briefly came in contact in a very slow speed while they were immersed,"" the French Ministry of Defense said in a statement. ""There is no casualty or injury among the crew. Neither the nuclear deterrent mission nor the nuclear security have been compromised."" In an earlier press release issued on February 6, the Ministry of Defense said the vessel's sonar dome had been damaged in a collision. The vessel was able to return to its base at Ile Longue in Brittany, northwest France, accompanied by a frigate. The UK's Ministry of Defence also confirmed the incident. In a statement, the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jonathan Band said the collision occurred during ""routine national patrols.""  Watch Band describe ""slow-speed impact"" » . ""Both submarines remained safe and no injuries occurred. We can confirm that the capability remained unaffected and there has been no compromise to nuclear safety,"" Band said. HMS Vanguard returned to its home base at Faslane in Scotland on February 14. The UK's Sun newspaper reported that dents and scrapes were visible on the vessel's hull as it was towed into dock by a tugboat. Both the UK and French nuclear deterrent operations depend on complete secrecy, despite both countries' membership of NATO. But naval analyst Richard Cobbold told CNN that procedures would be in place to ensure that French and British submarines were routinely kept apart. ""Either one of these submarines was doing something different or somebody made a mistake -- but we don't know that,"" Cobbold said.  Watch why the collision is an embarrassment for both the British and the French » . Both submarines were equipped with state-of-the-art sonar technology, but Cobbold said it was possible that neither was aware of the close proximity of the other vessel. ""Modern submarines are very, very quiet. In many types of water conditions they might not hear the approach of another submarine,"" he said. But with both nations keeping at least one nuclear-armed submarine constantly at sea for the past 40 years, he said it was no surprise that they had eventually ended up in the same area of ocean. ""Even in an ocean the size of the North Atlantic the submarines are eventually going to be in the same patch of water at the same time,"" he said. In a statement issued Monday, the UK-based Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament described the incident as ""a nuclear nightmare of the highest order."" ""The collision of two submarines, both with nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons onboard could have released vast amounts of radiation and scattered scores of nuclear warheads across the seabed,"" said CND chair Kate Hudson. ""The dents reportedly visible on the British sub show the boats were no more than a couple of seconds away from total catastrophe."" Hudson said the incident was the most serious involving a nuclear submarine since the sinking of the Russian Kursk in 2000 with the loss of the vessel's entire 118-man crew. HMS Vanguard, which was launched in 1992, is one of four submarines which make up the UK's nuclear deterrent. Its firepower includes 16 Trident II D5 missiles capable of delivering multiple warheads to targets up to a range of 4,000 nautical miles. The 150-meter vessel carries a crew of 141 and is powered by a uranium-fueled pressurized water reactor. Vanguard Class submarines routinely spend weeks at a time underwater on patrol in the North Atlantic. But contact with naval commanders and government officials, including the defense secretary and the prime minister, is maintained at all times by a ""comprehensive network of communications installations,"" the Royal Navy Web site said. Le Triomphant was launched in 1994 and entered service in 1997 with a crew of 111, according to the GlobalSecurity.org Web site. Its weapons include 16 M45 missiles capable of launching multiple nuclear warheads. The UK has maintained a nuclear arsenal since 1956, with at least one nuclear-armed submarine somewhere at sea continuously since 1969. In 2006 the government approved plans to develop a new generation of nuclear weapon-carrying submarines which is due to be ready to replace the Vanguard Class by 2024. But the program, which is expected to cost around £20 billion ($29 billion), has been heavily criticized by anti-nuclear campaigners.","British, French nuclear submarines collide in Atlantic, defense ministries confirm .

"(CNN) -- Inside her Oxford, Ohio, kindergarten classroom, Christine Milders has 24 cubbies, 24 tables and 24 seats. It's a perfect fit for her 24 little students, no more. But come next fall, she expects that number will grow to 30. That's when forced federal spending cuts, also known as the sequester, will kick in and start chipping away at education funding. ""Where will I put six more students?"" Milders asked. ""My young learners come to my classroom with little or no school experience. I not only need to meet their academic needs, but their social and emotional needs as well."" The government is set to cut $85 billion through the end of the fiscal year, September 30. Of that money, $2.5 billion will be coming out of the Department of Education's $70 billion budget. Uncertainties surround how these large cuts will affect schools, because the decisions will be made on the state and local levels. But with budget cuts looming, many teachers like Milders are wondering what's left to cut. Milders, who has taught kindergarten for 17 years, worries that more cuts to education will not only affect her students' ability to learn and grow, but also fears she will eventually be replaced by a younger and cheaper teacher, as she put it. ""It happens often,"" she said. The 42-year-old teacher is certified to teach kindergarten through eighth grade, but she said because her pay is tied to students' test results, it is difficult for her to move to higher grades. With the often short notice, it's tough to be adequately prepared to prep her students for state tests. ""Many times teachers are not told what grade or building they will be teaching until as little as a day or two before classes begin,"" she said. Similarly, Phil Dietrich, a newcomer to teaching from Portage, Indiana, also said he feels left in the dark. The fifth grade teacher said it is hard for him to predict how forced spending cuts overall will affect him and his students. ""In the past, my district has tried to keep budget cuts as far from the classroom as possible. In other words, they have -- and I'm sure will continue to -- make every effort to meet their federal obligations while preserving as much personnel as possible."" But despite his district's previous attempts to keep teachers and staff after budget cuts, the 33-year-old is worried that schools will still be forced to cut vital resources for teaching. While he's sure many professions have suffered from tightening budgets, he's scared for his students. ""I worry that technology which prepares students to compete globally will be seen as luxuries, not necessities, and thereby put our students behind the eight-ball,"" he said. Dietrich's worry is justified. American students are lagging behind their international peers in other countries, ranking 25th among 34 countries in math and science, according to the 2009 Program for International Student Assessment. A study published in 2012 by Harvard University's Program of Education and Governance found that students in industrialized foreign countries were outpacing American students academically. Countries like Slovenia, Colombia and Lithuania were making education gains twice as fast as U.S. students. Dietrich said he has seen how previous budget cuts affected his school when teachers' aides were let go. To help curb spending, he tries to be more judicious with his limited school supplies. ""Everyone is affected. We're not alone,"" he said. ""If I had time in the midst of all my other grading to grade Congress' handling of this sequester, they would get an 'incomplete.'"" But Congress is not the only player with something to lose in the budget cut battle; President Obama is feeling the pressure, too. Earlier this month, Obama's approval rating took a brief hit because of the budget sequester, dropping from 53% to 49% in the polls, according to Gallup. Dietrich is disappointed in Washington for letting the budget situation get this bad. ""What I would like Congress to cut is the political theater that has in many ways led to this day,"" he said. ""I see the spending cuts as being symptomatic of a much deeper problem."" Like Dietrich, Vincent Ferraiolo is more concerned with what forced spending cuts will mean for his students than his paycheck. He and his wife are both teachers in Moseley, Virginia, and for the past four years, he said, teachers in his area have endured 2% to 3% cuts to their salary. ""So many of us are right on the edge financially that just 50 to $100 is enough to really hurt,"" he said. In the past 30 years, teachers have seen their salaries shrink. On average, teachers make 14% less than other professionals who work in jobs that require a similar level of education, according to the Economy Policy Institute. Even though the 48-year-old science teacher isn't concerned about his own teaching salary, he fears budget cuts will start trickling into his classroom, where he teaches a handful of special education students. A loss in funding could mean he could lose his ""collaborative teacher;"" the two work together so they can spend adequate time with each student individually. Joshua Saunders also teaches special education students and said he is outraged after learning that forced spending cuts could potentially affect them. ""I don't think cutting special education works with any political ideology,"" said the 26-year-old teacher from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. President Obama warned Congress that forced spending cuts would affect special education students and people with disabilities. Special education programs could lose $840 million because of the cuts and 7,200 special education teachers, aides and staff members could lose their jobs. Saunders has already seen the aftermath of previous budget cuts in his area; he only works four days a week. That happened in 2011 after the district cut one special education position and a teaching position at his school in St. Helena Parish. As a result, the ratio of students to teachers at each grade level is approximately 25 to one, he said. In a two-hour reading block, Saunders used to spend six minutes with each of his 20 students. But add five children to his classroom, and that gives him less than five minutes per child. ""We all need more than that; 4.8 minutes per kid is not a recipe for success,"" he said. ""I understand fiscal responsibility is important. But these aren't blind cuts,"" he said. ""I see them every day. And I think other people need to see them, too,"" he said. Phoenix teacher Bettina Bennett loves her job, but like Saunders, she hates how education always seems to be on politicians' chopping block. ""It's a bipolar world we're living in,"" she said. ""On the one hand, lawmakers are mandating that we up our standards, while on the other they're cutting funding."" In her area, the way teachers are evaluated is changing. Arizona is not alone. More than 23 states are tying teachers' salaries to students' test scores. ""Bottom line is standards are changing, evaluations are changing -- and this is an even bigger deal when you consider we haven't seen salaries keep up with inflation -- while those who control our laws and our budgets are winning elections claiming they will get more accountability, more results out of us while shaving away dollars,"" she said. As a high school journalism and film teacher, she worries that elective courses will be the first programs let go because of forced spending cuts. ""Add the federal cuts to state and local (cuts) and our future doesn't look so bright, does it?"" But Milders, the kindergarten teacher from Ohio, said the outlook for teachers doesn't have to be so grim if the right cuts are made. She suggested Congress look into cutting school days from five to four. ""Longer days I know, but we could save on electric, water, food, fuel for buses, hourly employees. And let's share administrators,"" she said. When she was younger, Milders dreamed of being a teacher, but it's a profession she is struggling to stick with as fears of more budget cuts threaten an already shrinking department.

"(CNN) -- Less than a month after she was crowned Miss Universe Thailand, pageant winner Weluree ""Fai"" Ditsayabut has relinquished her title under a barrage of criticism for comments she made online against supporters of the country's ousted prime minister. ""I felt under pressure. I tried to improve myself but what I could not stand was to see my mother stressed,"" an emotional Weluree told reporters in Bangkok Monday. After the 22-year-old won the competition on May 17, scathing comments predating the contest were found on her Facebook page. They referred to pro-government demonstrators, who are known as ""red shirts,"" as ""dirty"" and ""evil activists"" that should ""all be executed."" ""I am not neutral. I am on the side of His Majesty the King,"" Weluree said in a now-deleted Facebook comment from November, when the country's political crisis began, according to local news site Khaosod English. Weluree reportedly said Thailand would be cleaner if the ""dirty"" red shirts left the country. Pro-government supporters questioned Weluree's pageant victory on popular online forums and social media sites. A Facebook page in protest of her winning the competition garnered thousands of ""likes"" -- although some users criticized her appearance and claimed she won because of her connections, rather than raising concerns about her anti-red shirt comments. Other netizens seemed to be preoccupied with comparing Weluree's appearance to that of Nissa Katerahong, who won the Miss Tiffany's Universe transgender beauty contest in Pattaya last month. Weluree -- an actress, talk show host, and English student -- apologized for her remarks on May 19. ""I was careless. I was young. I did it recklessly,"" she said in an interview on Thailand's Channel 3. But the unrelenting public scorn appears to have worn her down. ""At first, my family was happy for me when I was crowned,"" Weluree said Monday. ""But there's no more happiness following waves of criticism from the society."" She said the decision was hers alone, and thanked the pageant judges and her fans for their support. It is unclear whether Weluree's crown will be passed to the competition's runner-up and audience favorite Pimbongkod ""Ellie"" Chankaew. The pageant controversy emerged at the height of a political crisis that has plagued Thailand for months, and prompted the military to seize power in a coup in May. The turmoil began in November when the government attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill that would have cleared the way for the return of then-prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra's brother, Thaksin, to politics. The former prime minister and tycoon has been living in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction, after being overthrown in a military coup in 2006. Since November, the People's Democratic Reform Committee led anti-government protesters, who were mostly middle-class royalists, in calling for Yingluck's government to be replaced with an unelected ""people's council."" Competing rallies were held by pro-government supporters, many of whom came from the country's rural north and northeast and view Yingluck's ouster as a ""judicial coup."" Yingluck was found guilty of abuse of power and removed from office along with several cabinet ministers on May 7, and indicted by Thailand's anti-graft body. In a televised address on May 22, Thailand's army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha announced that the country had been placed under military control. Since then, the junta has imposed a series of measures purportedly aimed at restoring order and resolving the crisis, including curfews, bans on public assembly, and media blackouts.

"Editor's note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. Let's admit it: We all need to feel special sometimes. Well, if you're a firefighter, scientist or teacher, you should. After all, a new Harris poll indicates that plenty of Americans already think you are. Firefighters have one of the most prestigious jobs, according to a new Harris poll. U.S. adults, according to a recent survey by Harris Interactive, see firefighters, scientists and teachers as the most prestigious occupations while bankers, actors and real estate agents are the least prestigious occupations. The 2007 ""Most Prestigious Occupations"" poll measured the public perceptions of 23 professions. Participants were asked to rank these professions as having ""very great prestige,"" ""considerable prestige,"" ""some prestige,"" or ""hardly any prestige at all."" They could also opt not to rank them or say they weren't sure. Sixty-one percent of adults consider firefighters to have ""very great prestige,"" making this occupation the most prestigious on the list. Five other occupations were ranked as having ""very great prestige"" by over 50 percent of the adults surveyed: Scientists and teachers are considered very prestigious by 54 percent of adults, followed by doctors and military officers, who earn the prestige of 52 percent of Americans, and nurses, whom half of all adults consider very prestigious. Among the least prestigious occupations are real estate brokers, actors and bankers. Only 5 percent of survey participants ranked real estate brokers as very prestigious; 9 percent gave actors this label, followed by 10 percent for bankers. Accountants, entertainers, stockbrokers, union leaders, journalists, business executives and athletes all also ranked low on the list: Less than 20 percent of adults consider any of the aforementioned occupations to have ""very great prestige."" Consequently, five occupations are perceived to have ""hardly any prestige at all"" by at least a quarter of adults: stockbrokers (25 percent), union leaders (30 percent), entertainers (31 percent), real estate brokers (34 percent) and actors (38 percent). Harris Interactive started conducting its ""Most Prestigious Careers"" survey in 1977 and included only 11 professions. The most significant change since the survey's inception is that, with the exception of teachers and clergy, the perceived prestige of every one of the original 11 occupations has actually decreased over the years. The most drastic drop occurred among scientists, lawyers and athletes, whose prestige dropped by 12 points, 14 points and 10 points, respectively. Clergy members are considered prestigious by a percentage point more of the population than they were 30 years ago, while teachers' perceived prestige increased by 25 percent. Understandably, the year-to-year changes are less drastic. Scientists' perceived prestige hasn't changed in the last year, and despite a significant jump from 1977, teachers' perceived prestige has increased by only two percentage points. Bankers and athletes showed the most drastic drop in prestige: Both are down seven points from last year. The profession that saw the biggest increase in prestige from 2006 was that of farmers, who rose five points. While the survey measures the degree to which certain occupations are considered prestigious, it offers no indication as to why people consider certain occupations more prestigious than others.

"(CNN) -- Manuela Testolini and her colleagues had just sat down to dinner at the Oberoi hotel restaurant in Mumbai, India, on Wednesday when the sound of gunfire erupted outside. Manuela Testolini was in Mumbai on business when a series of brazen attacks broke out. At first, they didn't know what it was.
